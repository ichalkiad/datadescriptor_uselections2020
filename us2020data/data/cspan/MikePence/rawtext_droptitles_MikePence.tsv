CSPANMP17120190	Mike Pence	2019-01-17	President Trump Remarks on Missile Defense Review	THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHAT I HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I MET WITH FROM THE CUSTOMS BORDER PROTECTION DIVISION, WE NEED MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. CERTAINLY WE ARE HEARING FROM BORDER AGENTS WHAT THEY REALLY NEED. IT'S HARD TO TELL THE PRESIDENT WHO THEY WORK FOR WHEN HE MAKES A VISIT TO THE BORDER ANYTHING DIFFERENT HE WANTS TO HEAR. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. MR. PRESIDENT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, SENATOR SULLIVAN, CONGRESSMAN TURNER, GENERAL SILVA, AND MILITARY OFFICERS, ALL MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AS WE RELEASE THE 2019 MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW. TODAY THE NUMBER OF NEW MISSILE PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD IS GROWING DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OTHER CAPABILITIES. WRIT LARGE, THE WREST OF THE WORLD IS NOT DEVELOPING NEW FIGHTER AND BOMBER AIRCRAFT. THEY ARE DEVELOPING MISSILES. THE SHEER PROLIFERATION OF OFFENSIVE MISSILE CAPABILITIES MORE THAN 20 NATION STATES TODAY IN 2019, MAKES THIS REVIEW TIMELY AND ESSENTIAL. ALIGNED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY AND NESTED WITHIN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, AND IN LOCK STEP WITH THE NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW, THIS THREAT DRIVEN REVIEW IS THE LATEST TILE IN OUR BROADER NATIONAL SECURITY MOSAIC AND WE ARE MOVING OUT ON IT. AMERICA'S COMPETITORS, INCLUDING CHINA AND RUSSIA, ARE INCREASING THEIR EXISTING MISSILE SYSTEM CAPABILITIES, ADDING NEW AND SOPHISTICATED MISSILES TO THEIR ARSENALS, INCLUDING HYPERSONIC MISSILES AND ADVANCED CRUISE MISSILES. INTEGRATING THESE MORE EFFECTIVELY INTO THEIR POLITICAL INTIMIDATION, ANTI-ACCESS, AREA DENIAL EFFORTS, AND WAR PLANNING. WHILE WE ARE FORGING A NEW PATH TO PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, NORTH KOREA'S MISSILES REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, SO DO IRAN'S. MAKE NO MISTAKE, OUR CURRENT DEFENSE CAPABILITIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR PURPOSE AND OUR COMPETITORS KNOW IT. FRUSTRATED BY OUR MID-COURSE DEFENSES, THEY ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO CIRCUMVENT TODAY'S SYSTEMS. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCE NEW THREATS AND THESE THREATS ARE HARDER TO SEE, HARDER TO TRACK, AND HARDER TO DEFEAT. TO OUR COMPETITORS, WE SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WE'RE TAKING ACTION. THE MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW CALLS FOR NECESSARY INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN OUR GROUND AND SEA-BASED MISSILE DEFENSES. FROM MORE INTERCEPTORS TO NEW KILL VEHICLES TO IMPROVED COVERAGE OF PRIORITY REGIONS LIKE THE ENDO PACIFIC. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE FOCUSED ON NEW CAPABILITIES FOR NEW THREATS. THIS INCLUDES HYPERSONICS, SPACE-BASED SENSORS AND DIRECTED ENERGY FOR BOOST PHASE MISSILE INTERCEPT AND INCLUDES A POLICY SHIFT TOWARDS GREATER INTEGRATION OF OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES. BECAUSE MISSILE DEFENSE NECESSARILY INCLUDES MISSILE OFFENSE. FOR DECADES, THE U.S. LED THE WORLD IN HYPER SONICS RESEARCH AND DELIBERATELY CHOSE NOT TO WEAPONIZE THESE SYSTEMS. CHINA AND RUSSIA HAVE CHOSEN DIFFERENTLY. OUR NATION DOES NOT SEEK ADVERSARIES, BUT WE WILL NOT IGNORE THEM EITHER. WE REFUSE TO BE BOUND BY GEOGRAPHY. OUR NEW SPACE-BASED SENSOR LAYER WILL GIVE US PERSISTENT, TIMELY, GLOBAL AWARENESS. THESE CAPABILITIES WILL REMOVE ADVERSARY'S ABILITIES TO US OR OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. CONGRESS HAS WISELY MANDATED SUCH A CAPABILITY. REST ASSURED, YOU WILL SEE THIS PRIORITY REFLECTED IN OUR UPCOMING BUDGET REQUEST. WE ARE TO THE INTERESTED IN KEEPING PACE WITH THE EMERGING THREATS. WE WANT TO OUT PACE THEM. THIS REQUIRES NOT JUST DEFENSIVE WEAPONS, BUT A HOST OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INTEGRATE MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT. MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE READY FOR THIS TASK. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF GET STUFF DONE. FROM THE MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY TO THE SPACE FORCE AND ACROSS THE JOINT FORCE, WE ARE ALL A PART OF THE MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION NOW. WE WILL WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE, NATIONAL LABS, AND ACADEMIA, WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS FROM ASIA TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO EUROPE, TO BROADEN THE SHIELD, FROM JAPANESE CO-DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW INTERCEPTOR TO OUR WORK WITH NATO TO COUNTER SHARED MISSILE THREATS. LIKE US, OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS HAVE RECOGNIZED THE THREAT. WITH US, THEY HAVE AND WILL SHARE THE BURDEN OF ANSWERING IT. IN A TIME OF GREAT POWER COMPETITION WE WILL UPHOLD OUR SOLEMN DUTY, JUST AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST, WE'LL DEFEND THE HOMELAND, OUR DEPLOYED FORCES AND OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. WE'LL DO TER POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES AND CREATE THE DIPLOMATIC SPACE TO SOLVE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS. I'LL CLOSE WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S WORDS FROM 1962. THE GREATEST DANGER OF ALL WOULD BE TO DO NOTHING. TODAY'S CAPABILITIES ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, BUT THE LOGIC REMAINS THE SAME. THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE MISSILE DEFENSE A TOP NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITY. DIRECTING THIS REVIEW IN THE FIRST WEEK OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, ALONG WITH VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, HE HAS ELEVATED THIS ISSUE ACROSS OUR GOVERNMENT, WITH OUR ALLIES, BUT MOST OF ALL IN THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONGRESS HAVE GIVEN D.O.D. THE NECESSARY AUTHORITIES, RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. THIS DEPARTMENT WILL NOT LET HIM OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DOWN. NOW IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. ACTING SECRETARY SHANAHAN, SECRETARY MARK ELSEPER, SECRETARY WILSON, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MEMBERS OF THE JOINT CHIEFS, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES AND TO ALL OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IT IS MY HONOR TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AT THE PENTAGON. AS OUR PRESIDENT UNVEILS HIS VISION FOR OUR RENEWED COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN MISSILE DEFENSE. AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NO HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S, FRANKLY, THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT, TO A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND THEIR FAMILIES. TODAY, ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU, OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN AMERICAN HEROS WHO WERE LOST IN SYRIA YESTERDAY, AS WELL AS THOSE SERVICE MEMBERS WHO WERE WOUNDED. WE HONOR THEIR SERVICE. WE WILL HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN. THEIR FAMILIES AND ARMED FORCES SHOULD KNOW, THEIR SACRIFICE WILL ONLY STEAL OUR RESOLVE, THAT AS WE BEGIN TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, WE WILL DO SO IN A WAY THAT ENSURES THAT THE REMNANTS OF ISIS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RE-ESTABLISH THEIR EVIL AND MURDEROUS CALIPHATE. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S IN THAT SAME SPIRIT OF RESOLVE THAT WE GATHER HERE TODAY, SINCE DAY ONE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN DECISIVE ACTION TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, WE'RE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, RESTOURGRE RESTORING DEMOCRACY, AND LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN, INCLUDING THE LARGEST MILITARY PAY RAISE IN NEARLY A DECADE. [ APPLAUSE ] AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, WE RELEASED A NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST, PURSUED THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR NUCLEAR AR SEN FALLLE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN ACTION TO EXTEND DOMINANCE ON LAND, ON SEA, IN AIR AND CYBER SECURITY AND CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SIXTH BRANCH OF OUR ARMED FORCES TO ENSURE DOMINANCE IN SPACE. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OUR PRESIDENT HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND TODAY, BY UNVEILING OUR NEW STRATEGY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL TAKE ANOTHER CRITICAL STEP TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AMERICA FIRST BEGINS WITH PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. SO NOW IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND DISTINCT PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S REALLY NICE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE ONLY DOING THAT BECAUSE I GAVE YOU THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST BUDGET IN OUR HISTORY AND I'VE NOW DONE IT TWO TIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I HATE TO TELL THE REST OF THE WORLD, BUT I'M ABOUT TO DO IT THREE TIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU GAVE ME SUCH A NICE WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE AT THE PENTAGON WITH SO MANY DISTINGUISHED MILITARY LEADERS AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY PATRICK SHANAHAN. HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, PATRICK. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. WE WERE TALKING JUST AS I CAME ON, I SAID PAT, I HAVE TO GO NOW. WE'RE TALKING DEFENSE AND ALSO TALKING OFFENSE, CAN'T FORGET OFFENSE EITHER, CAN WE? WE HAVE THE FINEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE ORDERING THE FINEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN BE SURE OF. WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF MY ADMINISTRATION'S MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW. OUR GOAL IS SIMPLE, TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DETECT AND DESTROY ANY MISSILE LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ANYWHERE, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE BEST WAY TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE IS TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, STRONGER THAN EVER. JOINING US FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION ARE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF MISSILE DEFENSE IN CONGRESS, SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN, MY FRIEND, THANK YOU, DAN, VERY MUCH. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER, THANK YOU, MIKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALSO JOINING US FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OUR ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DAVID NORQUIST, DAVID, THANK YOU. SECRETARY MARK ESPER, SECRETARY HEATHER WILSON, THANK YOU. UNDERSECRETARIES OF DEFENSE, MICHAEL GRIFFIN, ELLEN LORD, AND JOHN RUDE. GENERAL PAUL SILVA, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GENERAL. GENERAL MARK MILLY, THANK YOU, MARK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. VERY IMPORTANTLY, CONGRATULATIONS. GENERAL JOSEPH LENGAL AND GENERAL JAMES McCONVILLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. BEFORE PRESENTING THE RESULTS OF OUR MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE BRAVE AMERICAN HEROS WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES YESTERDAY IN SELFLESS SERVICE TO OUR NATION. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEIR NOBLE AND IMMORTAL SACRIFICE. THIS MORNING I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS ANOTHER MATTER OF CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY, THE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WITHOUT A STRONG BORDER, AMERICA'S DEFENSELESS, VULNERABLE AND UNPROTECTED. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MILITARY FOR HELPING US OUT DURING THE BIG CARAVAN PERIOD, BUT NOW YOU HAVE MORE CARAVANS FORMING AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY UP. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FROM, WHO THEY ARE, NOTHING. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS. WE NEED STRONG BARRIERS AND WALLS. NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO WORK. EVERYONE KNOWS IT. EVERYBODY IS SAYING IT NOW. JUST A QUESTION OF TIME. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY OTHER , REALLY BY OTHER PRESIDENTS. IT WASN'T. JUST LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE DOING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO, WHETHER IT'S OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA, MOVING THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, SO PANE THINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO AND THEY WEREN'T, BUT WE'RE DOING THEM. A WALL HAS TO BE BUILT. WE NEED SECURITY AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. DRUGS FLOW IN, TREMENDOUS PERCENTAGES OF THE DRUGS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY COME FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. THAT IS WHY OUR HOMELAND SECURITY PROFESSIONALS HAVE ASKED CONGRESS FOR A STEEL BARRIER BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ENTRY TO FUND MORE AGENTS, BEDS, MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND TECHNOLOGY, AND TO CLOSE THE RIDICULOUS AND DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION LOOPHOLES THAT NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS BUT US. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO APPROVE BORDER SECURITY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BORDER SECURITY. IT'S GOING TO BE TIGHT, IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG. WE'RE GOING TO HETLET PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY GLADLY, BUT THEY WILL COME IN LEGALLY, THAT INCLUDES FOR THE FARMERS WHO NEED HELP AND FOR OTHERS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE POWERFUL, STRONG BORDER SECURITY. WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DEAL, SPEAKER PELOSI WILL NOT LET THEM NEGOTIATE. THE PARTY HAS BEEN HIGH JACKED BY THE OPEN BORDERS FRINGE WITHIN THE PARTY. THE RADICAL LEFT BECOMING THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS. HOPEFULLY DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS WILL STEP FORWARD TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY IS BORDER SECURITY AT THE STRONGEST LEVEL. STOP HUMAN HIGHJACKING. STOP DRUGS. STOP GANGS. STOP CRIMINALS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. THAT WAS MY PLEDGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER TO OUTLINE THE STEPS THAT WE MUST TAKE TO UPGRADE AND MODERNIZE AMERICA'S MISSILE DEFENSE, SO IMPORTANT. ROGUE REGIMES ARE ENHANCING THEIR MISSILE ARSENALS ALL OVER, THEY'RE GETTING BIGGER AND STRONGER, AND WE'RE GETTING BIGGER AND STRONGER IN EVERY WAY. THEY'RE INCREASING THEIR LETHAL STRIKE CAPABILITIES AND THEY'RE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING LONG-RANGE MISSILES THAT COULD REACH TARGETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. AS PRESIDENT, MY FIRST DUTY IS THE DEFENSE OF YOU ARE COUNTRY. FIRST DUTY. THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY. DEFENSE HAS MANY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND COVERS A LOT OF TERRITORY. I WILL ACCEPT NOTHING LESS FOR OUR NATION THAN THE MOST EFFECTIVE, CUTTING-EDGE, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS. WE HAVE THE BEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. OUR NEW STRATEGY CALLS FOR SIX MAJOR CHANGES IN MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY. FIRST, WE WILL PRIORITIZE THE DEFENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOVE ALL ELSE. OUR REVIEW CALLS FOR 20 NEW GROUND-BASED INTERCEPTERS AT FORT GREELEY, ALASKA, AND NEW RADARS AND SENSORS TO IMMEDIATELY DETECT FOREIGN MISSILES LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR GREAT NATION. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING A MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM THAT CAN SHIELD EVERY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE WILL NEVER NEGOTIATE AWAY OUR RIGHT TO DO THIS. SECOND, WE WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY, NOT JUST INVESTING MORE MONEY INTO EXISTING SYSTEMS. THE WORLD IS CHANGING. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE MUCH FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THIS PAST TUESDAY THE IRANIAN REGIME TESTED A SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLE, WHICH FAILED, THAT WILL PROVIDE IRAN WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION IF IT DIDN'T FAIL, THAT THEY COULD USE TO PURSUE INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABILITY AND A CAPABILITY ACTUALLY OF REACHING THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. THE UNITED STATES CANNOT SIMPLY BUILD MORE OF THE SAME OR MAKE ONLY INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. WHAT WE'VE DONE TO IRAN SINCE I'VE BECOME PRESIDENT IS RATHER MIRACULOUS. I ENDED THE HORRIBLE, WEAK IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AND I WILL TELL YOU, IRAN IS A MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY TODAY THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. IT'S NOT THE SAME AND IT WON'T BE THE SAME. I DO BELIEVE THEY WANT TO TALK. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY KEEP PACE WITH OUR ADVERSARIES. WE MUST OUT PACE THEM AT EVERY SINGLE TURN. WE MUST PURSUE THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH TO GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ALWAYS SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD OF THOSE WHO WOULD DO US HARM. THIRD, WE WILL PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM ALL TYPES OF MISSILE ATTACKS. IN THE PAST THE UNITED STATES LACKED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE THAT EXTENDED BEYOND BALLISTIC MISSILES. UNDER OUR PLAN THAT WILL CHANGE. THE U.S. WILL NOW ADJUST ITS POSTURE TO ALSO DEFEND AGAINST ANY MISSILE STRIKES, INCLUDING CRUISE AND HYPERSONIC MISSILES, AND WE ARE, BY THE WAY, VERY ADVANCED ALSO ON HYPERSONIC TECHNOLOGY AND MISSILES. WE WILL ALWAYS BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVERYTHING. FOURTH, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT SPACE IS A NEW WAR FIGHTING DOMAIN WITH THE SPACE FORCE LEADING THE WAY. MY UPCOMING BUDGET WILL INVEST IN A SPACE-BASED MISSILE DEFENSE LAYER. IT'S NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY BIG PART OF OUR DEFENSE AND OBVIOUSLY OF OUR OFFENSE. THE SYSTEM WILL BE MONITORED AND WE WILL TERM MY NATE ANY MISSILE LAUNCHES FROM HOSTILE POWERS OR VEEN EVEN FROM POWERS THAT MAKE A MISTAKE. IT WON'T HAPPEN, REGARDLESS OF THE MISSILE TYPE OR GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS OF THE ATTACK. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ENEMY MISSILES FIND NO SANCTUARY ON EARTH OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE. THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT I'M HEADING. WE HAVE SOME VERY BAD PLAYERS OUT THERE, AND WE'RE A GOOD PLAYER, BUT WE CAN BE FAR WORSE THAN ANYBODY IF NEED BE. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN AND I'VE WATCHED AND I'VE SEEN THE STRONGER YOU ARE, THE LESS YOU WILL NEED WHATEVER THAT STRENGTH MAY BE. FIFTH, WE WILL REMOVE BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES TO DRAMATICALLY SPEED UP THE ACQUISITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. SIXTH, WE WILL INSIST ON FAIR, BURDEN SHARING WITH OUR ALLIES. I MADE IT CLEAR WE ARE PROTECTING MANY, MANY WEALTHY, WEALTHY, WEALTHY COUNTRIES. ONE COUNTRY THEY SAID HAS AN UNSUSTAINABLE CASH FLOW. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY MAKE SO MUCH MONEY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I SAID, SEND IT OUR WAY. WE'RE PROTECTING YOU. SEND IT OUR WAY. WE PROTECT ALL OF THESE WEALTHY COUNTRIES, WHICH I'M VERY HONORED TO DO, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE SO WEALTHY THEY CAN EASILY PAY US THE COST OF THIS PROTECTION. SO YOU'LL SEE BIG CHANGES TAKING PLACE AND WE'VE HAD GREAT TALKS WITH COUNTRIES, FRIENDLY TALKS. ONE OF THEM SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, YES, WE WILL WORK WITH YOU. BUT FOR 30 YEARS NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED. I SAID NOW WE'RE ASKING. TOOK A LONG TIME. SAID NOW WE'RE ASKING. AND THAT ALLOWS US TO SPEND MUCH MORE MONEY THAN THESE INCREDIBLE BUDGETS WHERE IT'S JUST MONEY GOING OUT AND NOT COMING BACK. WEALTHY, WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE PROTECTING ARE ALL ON NOTICE AND ALL COOPERATING VERY NICELY. I WOULD SAY THEY PROBABLY LIKED OTHER PRESIDENTS MORE THAN ME, BUT THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T BLAME THEM. I WOULD TOO. THERE WAS A RECENT POLL IN EUROPE, THE ORIGINAL POLL WHEN I FIRST RAN I WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. AND NOW THEY SAID HE'S NOT POPULAR IN EUROPE. I SHOULDN'T BE. BECAUSE I'M ASKING THEM TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE COUNTRIES PAYING LESS THAN 1% IN NATO. LAST YEAR I RAISED $44 BILLION MORE BY SAYING, I'M SORRY, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP. THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, MY FIRST YEAR, I WAS JUST GETTING STARTED. I RAISED $24 BILLION WITH ONE MEETING. UNTIL THAT IT WAS JUST GOING DOWN, FOR 15 YEARS, JUST GOING DOWN. THE NUMBERS GOING INTO NATO. THIS YEAR WE'LL ALSO HAVE A GOOD YEAR. THEY'RE STARTING TO STEP UP. VERY UNFAIR WHEN GERMANY PAYS 1% AND WE'RE PAYING 4.3% OF A MUCH LARGER GDP. WE CANNOT BE THE FOOLS FOR OTHERS. WE CANNOT BE. WE DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED THAT. I WILL TELL YOU, FOR MANY YEARS, BEHIND YOUR BACKS, THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH NATO 100%, BUT AS I TOLD THE COUNTRIES, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE TO PAY. MINIMUM NUMBERS ACTUALLY. THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER. THEY SAID A 2% GOAL. VERY FEW PAY THAT. BUT THEY SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR , LOOK AT WHAT WE PAY, IT'S MASSIVELY HIGHER THAN THAT. SO WE HAVE VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS, BUT COUNTRIES ARE NOW STEPPING UP AND THEY CAN WELL AFFORD TO. IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS GOAL OUR PLAN DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO PRIORITIZE THE SALE OF AMERICAN MISSILE DEFENSE AND TECHNOLOGY TO OUR ALLIES AND TO OUR PARTNERS. WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND. THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE FINEST MISSILES IN THE WORLD. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. THEY'RE STEPPING UP LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SEEN BEFORE, ACTUALLY. WE WILL ALSO LEVERAGE OUR, NETWORK OF PARTNERSHIPS TO SHARE EARLY WARNING AND TRACKING INFORMATION AND DETECT MISSILE LAUNCHES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN OUR MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE BEEN HELD BACK BY SELF-IMPOSED LIMITS WHILE FOREIGN COMPETITORS GROW AND THEY ADVANCE MORE THAN WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS. PART OF THE REASON IS WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON SO MANY OTHER PLACES. NOW THAT'S CHANGING. WE'RE HELPING AND WE'RE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY ON TECHNOLOGY AN NEW DEFENSE AND FAR BEYOND DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SO THOSE DAYS ARE HISTORY. OUR STRATEGY IS GROUNDED IN ONE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE, TO DETECT AND DESTROY EVERY TYPE OF MISSILE ATTACK AGAINST ANY AMERICAN TARGET, WHETHER IT BE FOR OR AFTER LAUNCH. WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING AMERICA, WE WILL NOT TAKE ANY CHANCES. WE WILL ONLY TAKE ACTION. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AMERICAN MILITARY MIGHT. WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD, OUR MILITARY WAS VERY TIRED. IT WAS VERY DEPLETED. I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU THE THINGS THAT SOME OF OUR GREAT GENERALS WERE TELLING ME. AND NOW IT'S BEING REBUILT AT A RAPID RATE AND VERY SHORTLY WILL BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE. AS I SAID, THE MORE POWERFUL IT IS THE LESS LIKELY IT IS WE'LL EVER HAVE TO USE IT BUT IT WILL SOON BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. TODAY, WE REAFFIRM THAT A STRONG AMERICA REMAINS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT CONFLICT, PROMOTE PEACE, PRESERVE FREEDOM, AND PROTECT OUR GREAT PEOPLE. TOGETHER WE UNITE BEHIND A NOBLE MISSION TO SHIELD OUR COUNTRY WITH THE GREATEST MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS ANYWHERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, SPECIAL, SPECIAL PEOPLE AND THE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY KNOW THAT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FAR MORE SO THAN YOU WOULD EVER KNOW. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY AT ANY TIME SOON IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO JUST FINISH BY SAYING, I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE. YOU'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.

N ow on the Presiden t's behalf I want to thank you all so many he roes in t he room for your tireless eff orts. B ut let me give s pecial thanks before I begin 2, 4 relen tle ss champion s of fr eedom for the Venez uelan people . F our leaders who have be en at P resident Trum p's side since day one Cha mpion freedom an d the r esto ration of democ rac y for th e, for the Venez uelan peopl e. Wo uld you join me in thanking cong ressman Mario Diaz Bal art Senator r ick scott. Governor Ron DeSa ntis and Sena tor marco rubio. Yeah. Okay. The President a sked me to be here to sho w our unwavering commi tment to the good people of Ve nezuela for t oo long. The people o f Venezuela have su ffered under the heavy hand of oppression. But no w there is hope, there 's hope in Ven ezuela ac ross that c ountry, in t he l argest cities a nd smallest tow ns, people are risin g up in def ense of their rights And as president tru mp said just l ast week the fight for freedom has begun. Oh mhm. And t o be clear th e str uggle in V enezuela is between di ctatorship and dem ocracy and freedom has the momentum . Nicol as Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate cla im to power and Nicolas Maduro must go. Yeah. Just three w eeks ago the National Assembl y, the only le gitimate elected body in Venezuela decl ared tha t it no longer recognized t he Maduro regime. T he National Assembl y invoked t he constitu tion and recognized a new leader, a man w ho spea ks for the peop le of Venezuela a nd cheris hes thei r rights. And last week a s hundred s of tho usands of citizens marched t hrough th e streets in the name of f reedo m . That leader s tood before his country and too k an oath before almi ghty God and th e Uni ted States of Amer ica. I was pr oud to be the first nation on earth to re cognize the only leg itimate preside nt of Vene zuela. President ju an Yeah, I spoke with juan the night be fore he took that of and I'll never forget I marveled at his calm, his cou rage and his faith. Jus t two days ago. President trump sp oke to President and congratulated h im on his historic umpt ion of the presidency of V enezuela? He reinforce d our strong suppo rt for his leaders hip and for Venezuela's fi ght to regain its freedom an d the United States has made it cle ar the safety and security of President an d his f amily are of great importanc e to the a merican people. Just yesterd ay, Maduro threatene d President Guido's family sen ding paramilitary police to his home. B ut we know t hat President and t he Ve nezuelan people will ne ver be inti midated and neith er w ill we. The U nited States was proud to recognize juan as Venezue la's int eri m president And Br azil Colombia Canad a Argentina and ma ny other countries h ave foll owed Ameri ca's le ads. All told, more than 20 nations have announced their support for Pres ident Yea h, but let m e ma ke it clea r the leaders aroun d the worl d, that is not enough. T here can be no byst anders in the struggle f or Venezuela's free dom. The Unite d States today calls on every nation to recognize ju an as Venezuelan preside nt and take the side of freedom. Wow . The United States has als o taken action to suppor t the National A ssembly and the Go vernment of one G odel. Just this week , it was my p rivilege to welcome its newest representative to the White House, a man who was imprisoned t wice by th e Madur o regime, forced into exile here i n florida . But despite all he's faced? He still works tire lessly to r estore democracy in his homeland. Would yo u join me in thank ing the new am bassador to t he United States of America from a fr ee Venezuela Ambassador Ca rlos vecchio . Y eah, okay. As I to ld Ambassador vecchio, the National assembly and President h ave our f ull support because we recognize th e truth. Nicolas Madu ro's dic tat orship is destroying Vene zuela When the dictato r came to power s ix long year s ago, he promised to deliver an agenda of socia lism. And sadly for t he Venezuelan people, Maduro did just that. As w e gather her e, Venez uela's soci alism has shrunk their econom y by nearly half. More than nine out of 10 people live in poverty and the average Venezue lan has lost more t han £20 through depriv ation and mal nutrition. Tho usands of Vene zuelan Children are st arving at this very hour And risi ng desperation has fueled a mass exodus . More th an three mill ion Venezuelans have now abandoned th eir beloved country and if t hings don't get bett er, another two million are expe cted to foll ow t hem before the yea r is held and t hose who stay be hind our subject to lawle ssness and c rime as well as deprivat ion, thieves in Venezuela don't ta rget banks, they target rest aurants, vicious gangs an d government backe d cartels have tur ned the stree ts in th e l iteral war zones, Venezue la now has the secon d hig hest murder ra te in the world and more than 70 peopl e are slaughte red every sin gle day For years. The Venezuelan people have trie d to sa ve their country in the ballot box in 2015 , they elec ted a national assembly th at is still Venez uela's best hope. But in respo nse, the dictat or imprisoned, his opponen ts orchestrated sham e lections crackdown on protests with lethal force. In fact, in just the past two weeks, s ecurity forces hav e jailed More than 850 protes ters an d murdered at least 40 more. We will never forg et them. We will alwa ys honor the memory of t he martyrs who died for democracy. In Venezuela. Jus t a few moments ago, Kare n and I had t he privilege to meet with sev eral Vene zuelans who fled i n searc h of a bett er life. We heard th eir stories, they told us t hen that they weren't ther e to t ell us their st ory. They were th ere to represe nt all of th ose who could not speak. In thi s moment w e sp oke with Jose and Franci s who took th eir Ch ildren and left the ir home t wo years a go, Jose had sp oken out for freedom, plac ing his own life in dang er. We he ard from jesu s, the for mer council member fro m the city of Volter ra the govern ment gangs bega n to target him, even tel ling his mother t hat th ey would murder him. He had to le ave his h ome to save h is life. We li stened to r ule wron gly accus ed and impr isone d for seve n years where he was tor tured b y the re gime and witnesse d ot hers tortured as well saw the murder o f fellow in mates and he spoke today on be half of those wh o are still bei ng held to all of the se courageous m en and w omen to all of y ou who have fled Venezuela. We'r e with you and I promise we wil l s tay with you un til you can safely retur n hom e to a free Venezuela. Yeah Venezue la's pligh t has captured not ju st the attentio n of ou r president and our pe ople. It has s ti rred the United S tates of Ame rica act. We do this beca use it is what justice re qu ires. We also do this because it i s in our interest as well. Ve nezuela is a failed state a nd fai led states know no boundaries have no borders, V ene zuela overru n with drug smuggl ers, gangs. Human traffickers is a danger to all pe ople and a ll nations in this hemisphere. The very crisis on our southern border toda y is driven in large p art by crimina l organizations that have over whelmed c ountries across our hemis ph ere. Let me be clear. The Uni ted States of Americ a wants every nat ion in our hemisphere to be a place where peo ple can fl ou rish and build their own futures in their own homeland. Oh and so we s tand, we stand for fre edom a nd security for the Venezuelan people. We stand for t he security of both our nations. A nd I promise you, the United States will conti nue to stand with the V en ezuelan peop le and w e will continue to stand up to t heir op pres sors. Oh, At President Tr ump's direction, the United States has imposed sanctions on mo re than 50 current and former Ven ezuelan of ficials targe ting know n drug run ners and human ri ght s abusers and governmen t thieves who've enrich themselv es by impo verishing the people since oil is the lifeb lood of that corrupt regime this week. The U nit ed States of America san ctio ned V enezuela's state owned oil company, Venez uela's oil b elongs to the Ven ezuelan people and you can be assured t he United State s will always support the Venezuelan pe ople as they wo rk to restore a co nstitution al government and hold f ree and transparent elect ions. An d let's be c lear this is no ti me for dialogue . This is time for action. Oh and the time has come to en d th e Madu ro dictator ship once and for all . Yeah, righ t to that e nd, th e U nited States will co ntinue to e xert all diplo matic and econom ic pre ssure to bring abo ut a peacefu l transition to democr acy. But those look ing on sho uld know this. All o ptions are on the ta ble and Ni colas M aduro would do well not to test the reso lve of the Unit ed States of America. Oka y, Maduro's tyranny mus t e nd and it must en d now. But as the Venezuelan p eople know their oppr essors do n ot act alon e under President donald tr ump the United Sta tes has also stood up to those who have aided and abetted the dict atorship i n Venezu ela. The tr uth is, the di ctator has l ost the support o f his peopl e and even now is b eg inning to lo se the s upport of h is military. The only w ay he cl ings to p ower is wi th the help that h e receives from commu nist CUba. The pe ople of V enezue la know CUba's leaders are the real Imperialists in the western hemisphere. Right? The truth has to be told for decades CUBA has tried to create client states across the region. While normal countries export goods, CUba exports Tiffany and strong armed tactics, CUBA's influence has driven Venezuela's failure and the time has come to liberate Venezuela from CUba. Yeah. Mhm CUBA's malign influence is evident in Venezuela and also in Nicaragua where the regime of Daniel Ortega is oppressing the people and denying their basic rights. That's just one more reason. That's just one more reason why President trump kept his promise when he reversed the failed policies of the last administration toward CUBA. Because the Cuban people have the same birthright of liberty that God gave us all. Mhm. Mhm Venezuela deserves to be free. Nicaragua deserves to be free and in this white house under this president it will always be a viva cuba Yeah . Ye ah. Re ally? Yeah. In addi tion to the strong actions President trump has tak en economic an d diplom atic efforts. I want to assure all of y ou that America has also been there f or the Venezuel an people Over $100 million do llars i n human itarian su pport so far. Thank you. Yo u kn ow Karen and I saw first hand the hardship faci ng families who fled the collapse of Venezu ela when w e t raveled through the r eg ion last year.

Let me ur e them. A nd you, the United States of America stands ready to deliver humanitarian aid to the V enezuelan people in Ve nezuel a as well. W e are prepared to w ork with the le gitimate gove rnment of Venezuela, the Na tional embly and President Gui do. The american pe ople will marshal our resourc es and the resources of nations aroun d the world to provide m illions in h umani tarian relief. The truth is, it i s unconscionabl e t hat Maduro himself has publicly refused t o accept even a penny f rom America or the wider world in th e form of h umanitari an relief f or his peo ple. The t ru th is every day the d ictator rem ains in po wer is anothe r day of starvation and suf fering for th e sake of the me n, women and Children of Venezuela. Maduro mu st go thank you all for being her e today. Were truly honest by your pr esence and yo ur su pport.

The how to Prog ram excels at fosterin g s trategic partners hips and bringing together la w enforcement at all lev els. Federal, st ate and local. Ha ida also s erves as a lau nching pad in novative fo r innovative approach es to com bat drug trafficking. As se nior counsel or to the president , Kellyann e Conway calls upon her impressive background and experien ce toe offer guidance and address ing the d ominant iss ues facing our nation. Mis s Conway has taken a lead role to the presid ent's response to the opio id epidemic epid em ic. How to program is proud to work alongside he r to s ave lives as chair of the na tional How t o Directors Committee. P lease accept my sincere st gratitu de fo r all you d o for the height of program and the law enforcement community. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Kellyanne Conway. Thank you very much. Mr . McDaniel is grea t to see you again and to have you with us here today for a very speci al event with our vice p resident, M ike Pence. I met Mr McDanie l and some of t he other peop le in attendance today, last yea r in Atlanta, w hen I had theocr acy unity, really the grea t pleasure and privile ge to address you di rectly in a private setting. And thank y ou on behalf of the presid ent, the vice pres ident and the adm inistration for all the frontli ne work that you d o every s ingle da y to keep us safe. We recognize that the efforts to ke ep us all sa fe and secure now include tr ying to kee p pa ce with an d to break the back of what i s the most disturbing and most severe dr ug cris is in our nation 's history. The opiate and dru g crisis. I'm very p leased to help lead an effort f or this White House an d this administration to bend the curve in the right dir ection. You're now more lik ely to die from a drug overd ose in a car accident in th is country, an d we've all heard t he numbers, bu t I'm very happy t o report t o you through a lot of your great e fforts. We're sta rtin g to see the numbers go i n the other direct ion in terms off, l ess, prescr ibing, less overprescribing, I sho uld say mor e education for Americans to know how harmful some one else's leg al prescription can be for them, peo ple be coming conversant in their ev eryday lexicon with words like N arcan and the locks in and fentan yl. And so that's all a gr eat achievement. And in this administr at ion you are more reco gnized, more deep ly respecte d, and you are better reso urced and you des erve nothing less than that. So I thank yo u on behalf of all of us . But I'd l ike to also say a few thi ngs about y our work and how w e're here t o co ntinue to partner with you. Law enforcement an d Hai da play a very importan t ro le, obviously, in stopping human traffic king, tr afficking and, o bviously the flow o f drugs in our communitie s. So Mr McDani el is in Houston. He's in a border state . B ut this is eve rybody's bu siness because secu ring our sou thern border means tha t we 're stopping th e flow of thes illicit d rugs into al l of our communities . And I can tell you I travel on behalf of the White House and on this issu e frequently, there is no communit y in our natio n that's been spared none, and that's why we're ver y grateful to this pr esence, leadership a nd through our now director of ONGC P Ji m Caroline his acting capacity. Previ ously, he went to Ala ska last year and opened t he 50th and final st ate Haida area. Haida. And we 're so pleased for the first ti me in 10 o r 12 years t hat that hap pened because it s hows the commitment we h ave in making s ure that every n ook and cranny of t his great country has w hat it needs in ter ms off th e high int ensity drug trafficking resource is and manpower woman power. Reall y woman po wer. Yeah, we recognize, t hough in your cap acity and interdic ting and sur veilling and de tectin g and an alyzing and handling illicit and legal dr ugs like fentanyl. Increasingly, y ou're putting your health in your liv es at risk. But I al so w ant to no te your great work and the other two of the three p rongs in our opioid and drug demand crisis effo rts. So ce rtainly law enforcem ent interdiction, but also prevention educat ion. There you are group s like Pari who I b elieve are represent ed here tod ay trying t o educate people abo ut the harm of illicit drug use, goi ng into t he schools, havi ng community based programs an d making sure tha t the peo ple you see every day in your c ommunities in your regio ns understand the risk s that entail in using thes e illicit drugs, making sur e people know words like fentanyl . They understand tha t it's bein g laced in to meth and marijuana and cocaine and hero in increasin gly and street dr ugs. Certainl y you're also on th e front lines of health care, the treatment an d recovery. I meet so m any law enforcement officer t o say, I never thoug ht I'd be talking to he alth professionals every day or becoming on e myself. And indeed y ou are, because often you ar e providing that warm handoff from somebo dy who i s overdosing and needs profess ional health, health care. Help access to health care. And t hank you ver y much for doin g that, beca use I've been to these f ire stations . The president first lady visited one in Ma nchester, N ew Hampshire, last Ma rch and saw firsthand how some of our fire sta tions are converting a good piece of their spac e to combat dr ug overdoses. Because in m any commu nities, including your own peop le, you're far le ss lik ely to be calle d Teoh, a drug overdose into a fi re, for example, in ou r f ire stations. So we recogn ize that you are on the f ront lines, cer tainly of the drug i nterdiction and traffic king aspect , but also now incr easingly recovering trea tment an d i ncreasingly prevention edu cation, and we wanna thank you for all of those. You also ar e serving the 73 1 drug free com munities. And we ha d a wonderful event her e at the White Hous e, where the presid ent announced the highest amount of money an d greatest number of recipients ever in o ur drug fre e comm unity grant progra m in the nation's history. So thank yo u very much for be ing a part of t hat as well. Um, the effor ts are integral to a stronger, healthie r, more vibran t, safe and secure Ame rica. Our p resident and o ur first lad y, Mrs M elania Trump, truly work on the fro nt lines of this issue ev ery single d ay. This is a l egacy issue for a dmini stration and t hey're committed.

W e went to a company call ed Building Ind ustrie s Very Succ essful Manufactu ring company. And B elden has a cutting edge pr ogram wherein if yo u fail a drug te st as a current employee, or even as a prospective employees, instead of kicking you out and f iring you, they recognize that your job is often you r greatest, your gre atest path forwar d to recovery, the greatest path forward to reducing the stigma and the silence that m ay attend to your add iction or you r disorder, y our misuse disorder. And so instead of firin g, you were kicking y ou out of the employmen t chain. They de mand that yo u, if you keep your job or if you wan t to app ly, c ontinue to apply to them f or that in yo ur job that yo u go into treatment immediat ely and they've als o got skills training . They've They've teamed up with healt h professionals, a local community college, a very gr eat example. Belde n In dustries and there are others across the country.

His first hand has been leading the White House's negotiations and effort to make sure that we have a safe and legal immigration policy that has as its center port centerpiece, securing our southern border for many reasons.

We a ll know the statist ics of the heartbreak, the loss of l ife and devastated famili es from drug abuse a nd a ddiction in the nefarious dr ug trade i n th is country. But you're also r esponsible every day fo r the stories that never happened, the drugs t hat ne ver go t to the streets, the families that were never shat tered.

You disrupted or dismantl ed more than 270 0 drug trafficking a nd money laund ering organ izations. You al so got m ore than 23,000 firearms off our street s and made more t han 90,000 arrest. All told, you seized more than $16 billion in il legal drugs. Th anks to your cou rage and de dication, those drug s never reach ed our streets, our cities, our families, the American You know, wh en I was governor of the state of Indi a na, I put a special emphasis as the pres ident has nation wide on the scourge of opiate abuse a nd addiction. I've sa t with fam ilies at kitchen table s where ther e's an emp ty chair. I 've heard the sto ries I've also sat with wi th people w ho have overco me addiction and are on the r oad to re covery. I've seen firs thand the impact of the wor k that you're doing, and I want to assu re yo u of our admir ation an d our gratit ude. These stati stics are easy toe br eeze over. But you all lo ok into the eyes of people t hat have been vi ctimize d by this nefarious, straight by the drug cartels by drug dealer s and those who w ould prof it from selling these p oisons to our our Chil dren, our fam ilies, shattering co mmunities. Th e progr ess we've made wel l, I th ink, is better understood in individual stories i n ind ividual lives. And yo u all hav e been savi ng lives and you've been chan ging lives and we 've been maki ng progress. Progr ess is the result of your leadersh ip and your cour age, and I believe it's also a resul t of our president's commi tment to you and your mission since Day one of this admini stration. I'm pleased t o report we've taken action to give you th e support you need to acc omplish your mission withi n the first month of ta king off ice, President Trump signed an executive order to emp ow er law enforcement to comba t tran snat ional criminal organizations , drug cartels and g angs. MAWR effe ctively he signed into law the historic opioi d bill that e nables l aw enforcement t o combat the opioid crisis has never befo re he's take n action a nd signed legislatio n to combat the terrible reality of huma n traffic king that so often follow s a similar path of drug sm uggling. And this pre sident has not only bee n giving y ou the resource is, but after cha llenging ye ars for those i n the unifo rm of th e United States, this president and this administration have given the men and women of law enforcement the respect that you deserve every single day, and we always we're fighting for you because we kno w every day you're figh ting for the American pe ople, you're consider ing the lives of others more i mportant than yo ur own. We know it's a c alling. It's a pro found calling that invo lves sacrifice for you an d your families that you're mak ing a difference. But d espite the progress we've ma de, we kn ow they're a lit erally a river of illegal drugs still fl ows toward our count ry every single day. I rece ived a briefing just yester day at Coast Gu ard bas e Portsmo uth , dow n in Virginia and s aw firsthand the fl ows of narc otics co m ing out of S ou th America an d Central Ameri ca. I also l earned of of the dar ing Coast Guards man wh o just who just sailed i nto port with more than 1 5 tons of co caine they ha d captured f rom dru g smugglers at sea. This mission is succeeding every single day. But nowhe re is the crisis o f illegal drug trafficki ng mawr evident or our chal lenge more prof ound tha n in our n ation's southern bord er. And you know firsthan d ho w seriou s this crisis i s because the Southwes t bo rder high intens ity drug trafficking are a is among the most a ctive in this entire prog ram. Last year, custom and bor der protection seized mo re than £827,00 0 of il legal drugs entering our country at our southern b order, and that's just the dr ugs that they foun d. Mexican and Ce ntral American dru g cartels, as you we ll know, are th e main wholesal e provider of drugs to str eet gangs and deale rs across America, and they're deadl y trade bring su ffering and devastati on to families and c ommunities acros s this nat ion. As the pr esident sai d o n Tuesday ni ght, tens of thousands of innocent Am erica ns were killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and fl ood into our c ities. 300 Americans die every week f rom he roin, more than 90% of which come s acr oss our sou thern border. And all told across the na tion, as you k now, at th e front of this fight , more than 200 people lose their l ives to drug overd ose . Every singl e day. Our hearts gri eve for th e loss of so many i nnocent lives the y break for the families that have been left behin d. We honor them by reme mbering them. But we also honor the m by redoubli ng our commitment to secure o ur borde r and bring j ustice to those who wou ld p rofit from their suff ering. Yeah, just last week , Director Carol unveiled our a dministration's nation al drug control strategy. He described i t aptly as a st rategy of act ion. And so it is. That s trategy lays o ut our comprehensive pla n to combat illegal drug use and drug smuggling, an d the high intensity dru g trafficking area progra m is essential to our efforts. We believe in com bining the capabilit ies of the federal government, the expert ise of local law enfo rcement. It' s a power ful combinati on and you can b e confident of our cont inued suppo rt. Will a lso make new and renewed investme nts in la w enforcement at every level. As Presi dent, Trump renewed his call for Congress to ena ct stron ger drug pr otection a t our po rts. And w hen it com es to the southe rn border, as Congress is involved in negotiations, even at this very hour, let me assure you, we will not rest or relent until we have the technology, the personnel and the barriers required to secure our southern border. We will build that wall one way or another. you again. Thank you agai n for yo ur presence here today. But more importa ntly, than k you . Thank you for your service.

I'm I' m the son of a comb at veteran from Korea, and I' m the proud f ather of the United States Marine that couldn't be more p roud of the men and women of the armed fo rces of the United States o f America. But let me assure you the pride pride that ev ery Amer ican feels for th ose wh o serve in that uniforms eq ually applies to y ou. We know it . It seemed fashion able in recent years to cr itici zed law enforcement of ficers whenever tra gic circum stances woul d d eveloping communities arou nd the countr y. But I want to assure you that this president's at titude, our at titude, is emb lematic of the att itude of people all across this c ountry who feel gratitude eac h and every one of and t o your families, for the service that you rend er as you pro tect and serve our communitie s. And in this fig ht against drug dealers, drug ab use and addiction at every leve l o f go vernment, I want you to know that you have the s upport of this President, this administrat ion, but also know you have the support of the Amer ican peop le. And one other thing I wanna I want to assure you that you have the pr ayers of milli ons of American s every day who underst and that you have no ord inary job s.

To the city I just me an the suspicion over the place wa s fo r a so lution. To a conf erence w ith the greate r threa t that's really lik e a. Great thing for 6. Years. While we were just over a dd the challenger memori al and the Columbia memorial and and you heard me talk about my memories of those events. our classroom that day Miss Power s was crying a nd of course it affected all of us very deeply whe n she brought in the televisi on and showed us those events but it impacted our lives in a signif icant ways for people all across this country Gulf in 200 3 getting re ady to en ga ge in an operatio n that the president had called Shock and A we we had t he Colum bia i ncident again affe cting not just my life but the lives of all the people on the aircraft c arrier I remember thos e 2 incidents like yesterday Apollo one . A nd I'm going to be bruta lly honest I have no recolle ction of where I was during Apol lo ones incident I was n't alive yet. But I will also tell you that I kn ow the history and the histo ry is crit i cally important. A lot of p eople don't realize what Apo llo was about we we re in a c ontest of ideas betwee n 2 superpowers the Soviet Union and United States of A me rica and this was a contest of pol itical ideology it was a c ontest of technological ca pabilit y and it was it w as a contest between w ho could bring the world i nto their s phere and that's what the Apo llo program was all a bout that' s what t he moo n program was all abou t Apollo one was j ust a test they we ren't intending to launch that day it was just a test and of course we had this terrible incident line is this the United States of Americ a put forth e very muscle that w e had and w e were able to get to t he moon 1st a nd we had the vice president at the NASA headqu arters just. Oh I guess about a mo nth and a half ago n ow not too long ago an d he was remindi ng us of the A pollo 8 mi ssion about the impact o f our astronaut s in orbit aroun d the moon for the 1st time in human histor y and when they kid the mike on that Chri st massy the vice pre sident reminded us that they read f rom the Boo k of Genesis in the begi nning God creat ed the heavens a nd the earth and that remar k and that reading G enesis $11011.00 to $110.0 0 was heard all aro un d the world including regimes where it was illegal. To read scripture a breath of fresh ai r one out of eve ry 4 people on the pla net heard that bro adcast in cluding tens of mil lions of people behind the Ir on Curt ain this is what NASA is this is what NASA does this is the m ission for which t he A pol lo one crew died but here's the news stor y the ne ws story is this Apoll o is over but we're going back to the moon what they. of the leadership of the presiden t and the vice preside nt this time when we go back to the moon we're going to stay and we're al l very excite d about that eventuality and S ir we are movin g out as a famil y as a NASA famil y as fast as we can to get th at done and we are so gr ateful for your leade rship people here know that when President Tr ump became p residen t he recreated I th ink a critical function in the United States governm ent which is the Nation al Space Council and he put at the helm of the National Sp ace Council the vic e president o f the United States demo nstrating how impor tant space is to this admin istration and th en they follo wed it up with an increase in our budg et of $1700000 000.00 which has not happened in a long time maybe not in my adult lifetime there leaderships or we are very grateful fo r it this i s a solemn day fo r us but we rem ember the pu rposes fo r which the se f olks died we redouble our effo rts when bad things happen in NASA sir and you know this we regroup w e figure figu re out what happened and we mov e forward again tha t's who we are as a NASA fa mily and w e will continue to d o that ladie s and gentlemen the chairma n of the National Sp ace Council the vice presi dent of the United States Mike Pence thank to the great histor y of N ASA to Congre ssman Frank Lucas.

Rog er Chaf ee. And Gus Gri ssom from Mitchell I ndian a thank you it's humbli ng for me to stand o n thes e hills always but I must tell you to Gu s and these hero e s. And I want to thank you for giving me the opportu ni ty on this NASA day of remembrance to do jus t that I'm a little bit older than you Jim So I do remember the A pollo program. And I rem ember Gus Grissom how proud th e people of Indiana were and are of hi s lifetime of service you grew up in Mitchell Indiana just not very fa r from where I grew up a small southern Indiana town that might not have a population any b igge r than the crowd gath ered here served in World War 2 He worked hi s way thr ough produce a unive rsity he fought in the Korean War He fle w 100 combat missions just over 6 months and af ter meeti ng his required quot a he volun teered to fly 25 more combat missions but history had mo re plans for Gus Grisso m when just a fe w years la ter he became a part o f the 1st class of American astronauts in the Mercury program. Crew of Apollo one space exploratio n and the ir sacrifice on t hat tragic day may have caus ed some other nations to cower bu t inspired by th eir courage America redouble o ur commitment to space and a dete rmination to lead man kind i nto the vast bey ond S o we honor them tod ay we also memorialize t oday the 7 star voy agers who perished aboar d space shuttle Cha lleng er Dick Scobee Michae l Smith Judi th Resnick El lison Oni's w ho took Ronald McNair Gregory J arvis and of course Chr ista Mc Auliffe I know th at their remains lie not too far from here and I haven' t told my staff y et but I'm goin g b y Section 46 and before I leave for the pe rfec t. We all remember t hat moment when the Chal l enger fell when they reached out to touch the face of God. An d we'll ever be inspire d by their courage and sacrific e we al so remember the c ourageous crew of the space shuttl e Columbia who a re memorialized here a nd whose remain s also a line her e by Ri ck Husba nd Davi d Brown Mic hael A nderson Laurel salt and Clarke ca lled upo n a child law a law on mo an and Willi am a cool so c lose to home to be lost as th e ship broke up the hear ts of the American people broke and we're right to remember them and Challenger and Apollo one today it's remarkable to think that the had already committe d themselv es to serve their nat ion the Navy the Air F orce public s ervice but they didn't st op there they chose to risk everyth ing to help America lead into the great beyond the y consider our lives and our future more importan t than their own they loved our nat ion more than t hey love life and so w e do well as a n ation to pause on this NASA day of r emembrance and honor t hem so we mourn with those who mourn but we do not grieve like those who hav e no ho pe bec ause heroes give us hope the life the example in the courage that we r eflect on not just o n this recalling i t in the confident h ope that as they look down fr om the heavens th at they k now that we'll ne ver forget w hat they've done for America. But full measur e of devoti on and I couldn't be more proud to stand al ongside a presiden t and be a par t of that admi nistration that i s absolut ely committed to on ce again having the United States of Amer i ca leading in space. In his inaugural Space Council was actual ly during the campaign when he 1st asked me to d o it a nd he said I don't know ho w much interest you have i n space he didn't know that the only committee I ever v ol unteered to be appointed to in Congress was the NASA subcommittee . Did know that a little boy sitti ng in a basement l ooking at a black an d white televisio n would imagination be fired he motivated with pride for a country by the service of those we rememb er today he did kn ow my wi fe and I had actu ally vacation to Cape Can av eral when our kids were r eally on just t o go by and see the rockets so he said Mark there's the likes of whic h w e. We haven't seen in recent m emo ry and it's been exciting to watch renewing our commitment to human space exploration. The presi dent has made it ve ry clear we are goin g back to the moon and once we 're back on the moon the United S tate s is going to Mars. Have the great privilege last year's new clas s of astronau ts a new generation of he roes were mean t to. Men and women of extraor din ary and diverse bac kgr ounds and we've all answe red the call.

CSPANMP222201917	Mike Pence	2019-02-22	Vice President Pence Remarks to National Governors Association Luncheon	Welcome. W e just want to thank you all for being here. Um, it is our pr ivilege t o i nvite the g overnors and some members of their families here to the vice president's reside nce. We are thrilled t hat you al l are here. Um, we know we re ally do k now the sacrifice s that that tha t you all make. We know how mu ch you serve your co untry. We know ho w much y our family serv e as well. And we a dmire ever y single on e of you for stepping up fo r the call an d a nd serving your your stat es and you r country. I'm gonna take this op portunity to tell you about one o f my initiatives b ecause I've told hundreds a nd hundreds and hund red s of peop le that I would do t his. And s o they are counting on me. Last fall, I launched a campaig n to elev ate and educate our militar y spouses, and t hey have shared with me wonderful s tories about wha t it' s like to be a military spouse to ser ve alongside yo ur spouse i n the mili tary. We've gone all ove r the world a nd we st arted by li stening to every r a nk, every type of spouse, ev ery service, ever y branch, and they s hared some wonderful storie s. I envy them. I'm not a militar y spouse. I haven't ever been a milit ary spouse, but they shared such wonderful stories of having friends all over the world. B ut they also share a lot of c hal lenges. Uh, you know, th ey have. They ha ve some s trugg les being military spo uses. And this i s whe re you come in, Um , military sp ouses. You may not real ize move every 2-3 y ears and if you can imagin e moving every 2-3 year s um, they'r e usually single pare nts for a time. Uh, they want to be fulfilled . Our milit ary spous es are hig hly educated, ver y flexible, very reliable , responsible p eople. But they want t o be fulfilled as well and and imagine moving every two years and trying to find a job and tryin g to get your family settled an d get them i nto schoo l. They do have employm ent i ssues. This i s the biggest thi ng that they shared wi th us was the employm ent issue. The Depart ment of Defen se shared with us that 37 % of the milita ry spouses require state l icenses, and this is expen sive and ti me consumin g. And when I was firs t lady of Indiana , I remember Mich elle Obama and Jill b iden s hari ng the s ame issue with u s. And when I became second lady, I thought this issue w as solved. But because le gislatu res chang e all the time and this is a state issue, this issue is a constant iss ue. Each state has their own r ules, and so in each state y ou have diff erent regulatory agencies and different occupational boards. We've m ade a lot of good progress. I kn ow some of your states are doing some amazing th ings, and you're in compacts with other st ates for certain profe ssions, and i t's amazing. Bu t more work do es need to be done at the state le vel. We're asking if you can look into the p ossibility of pro viding these mili tary s pouses temporary licens es or per haps expedited licens es. Um, we're w e're wanting you to ens ure that the boards know the laws. T he University of Minnesota We wen t and visite d them. They di d a three year study, and they realized that what happens is, um, a state will make changes and maybe a ce rtain pro fession. They'll say, Yes , we'll exp edite. It wil l waive the fe e, let's get them empl oye d. But the perso n answeri ng the phone doesn't know tha t, and so it can be a very fru strating thin g. Um, but I just want to let you kno w that this is a great benefit to your sta te's, Um, if we ca n help get these spouses emp loyed, it improves your state economic grow th a nd development. Um , also, busine sses can grow, and we're asking you t o r each out to some of your businesses in your state to see if they have some cre ative ways to employ s pouses. Y ou know, we'v e worked with a lot of bu sinesses, and th ey're try ing to find way s in this generation. Were able to telec ommute, were able to d o so much where a spous e co uld keep her job as they mo ve or him. Um, it also benefits the military rea diness. A nd I think that's th e issue th at I think I want to make you also aware of, You know, our military. If a if a sp ouse is, yo u know what I 'm done. I' ve done seven years. I've done e ight years . It's my turn to work. It 's my turn to live in our h ome state. Then our m ilitary service members are going to get out of the mili tary, so it serves all of us to keep our military rea dy, and it's the r ight thing t o do, so I just w ant to let you kno w, my staff has been part nering with seve ral organizations . I'm so proud of them u niver sities, businesses, M icrosoft, L inkedIn, hiring our her oes. I could go o n and on and on. We're par tnering with the Department o f Labor and the Department of Defense, and we w ant to partn er with yo u. And we real ly want to help you in your sta tes and and gi ve you the resour ces. So, um, if my staff, I 've got them right here, if y ou if you're interested and y ou want to partner with us, Janet is my chief of staff, and Sarah's my policy director. Just reach out to them and we 'll get in touch wi th you. Um, bec ause you more than anyo ne else, you understan d the sacrifices that your fa milies are maki ng. So you understand tha t these mili tary spous es, it's the same thing that they do. And And just to let you know how much we appreciate you spouses and your Children who are here today, um, each spouse as you leave and each child we have a special gift to you, and it's from the second lady to the spouses and the Children. So please make sure when you leave that you get that It's just our way to say thank you to you, as you help us say thank you to our military spouses. Mhm, mhm. And now vice president of the United States. Well, thank you. Thank you all for being here . This is the day that we we look forward to every year. And if y ou are, how many of you is this y our first time in the vice president's res idence? O urs too. Uh so So wel come, Uh, as, uh, as your v ice president. Bu t a s a former govern or and first lady of th e great sta te of Indiana, it's really a joy for us to be able to gather with tho se of you that are leading our states with such di stinction. Some of you, we actually had the chance to ser ve with, and w e know your quality. Some of yo u a re our new frien ds. But I want to extend the wa rmest greetings to each and every one of you and and jus t honestly, j ust t o say thank you, we understand the job and ho pefully today and in the co urse of this weekend, a s you make your way to t he White House for what will be a very m emorable evening Sund ay night, a working meeting on M onday morning. I hope you also lea ve here Knowing the great resp ect that ou r family has for each one of y ou. And I also b ring greeti ngs from a man who I kno w ap preciates the lead ership of governors. All across this nation. I bring greetings from the 45t h presiden t of the United S tates President Donald Trump, and he wanted me to thank eac h and every one. Uh, and if you if th e if you 'v e liked the food, if you like the hospitality, uh, I'll give you I'll give you a chance to say thanks to to the wom an who insisted right after we were first elected to start this tradition with the Nation al G overn ors A sso ciation. Uh, she's extended the hospitality h ere to you and your families. Join me in tha nki ng the second lady. O kay. Okay. She did. She said what? Right afte r we we re elected, she hear d about the n G. A weekend c oming up and al l the gover nors in town, a nd she said we gotta have them ove r here, cause because we never got invited as an art ist. Y eah, it just wasn't a tra dit ion, but I'm so proud of her for, uh, f or open ing this special place to each an d every one of you, and I hope it. I hop e it makes her a great memory. Let m e also thank one of the great things, and I re ally enjoyed my time as gov ernor of Indiana, and I also reall y especially appreci ated the work of the National Governor s As sociation. Um , I kn ow there'll be meet ings of the dif ferent p arty organizations of g overnors. Those are g reat value. Bu t I always thought th at the NGA was really a ver y special forum th at that that was emblematic of of, uh, of ho w govern ors actually really operate. And you know, there's that old proverb that i ron sharpens ir on, so one person sharpens another and a lways found that at the time at th e NGA was the time to r eally share best practices an d id eas find matters of commo n cause and pur pose, which are not h ard to find when y ou're leading a state and when you look across state bounda ries are often dealing with the exact same i ssues that people aro und the country ar e dealing wi th. So I really want to say thanks to t he Nation al Governors Association and specifically to our friend, your chair man, Governor Steve Bu llock and, u h, and also to your vice chair Governor Lar ry Hogan. Thank you so much for makin g this happen means a lot. Steve's gonna have a word i n just a minute and after I finish off. But we really apprec iate you all, including t his in the NBA sched ule. It's a g reat honor fo r us and and hopefully is evide nced each and eve ry one of you , the spirit with which this administration appr oaches the work that each a nd every one of you do every single day. Let me let me thank one other group. Kar en already d id a great job doing it a second ago. B ut, uh , I mean to kn ow the president and the first family to know the pe nces and the se co nd fam ily. I think y ou can tell w e serve a s a fa mil y. Uh, and I think particularly in the role of being a governor and b eing the first family of a state in the territory, we know that the weight o f this responsibility is b orn as much by the spouses in t he room who are gathered here toda y. So let me just sa y thank you to a ll of the of of the spous es who are here. The f irst ladies and the first gentleman wh o are with us today. Le t's have a rou nd of applause. Toda y is really just about fellowship an d encouragement, a nd hopefully you'll have a ch ance to walk the grounds a little bit and see this place. Th e history of it is real ly unique. Um, the 1st 2nd family to live h ere were the Mondale's and in fact, Vice Pr esident Mondal e and I. We're speaking abou t the memories. All right, y ou're g onna applaud h im. A great public servant, a great public s ervant. I got a chance to spend s ome time with hi m when he was at the at the Ca pitol buildin g not long ago, bu t we talked about h ow his fami ly really inaugurated what's become an in credible tradition. Before you leave, I mig ht point you in the directi on just ri ght out the f ront door. If you walk a litt le bit that way, you' ll see a garden that litera lly commemorate s all of the second f amilies w ho've li ved he re in the extended families that the Childr en and the gr andc hildren and those famili es. And it's hard for me to desc rib e to yo u as a As a forme r governor and a friend. So many in the room just how humbling it is for u s to se rve here a nd to have t he privilege of being he re. But if the if the hou se looks like it might be a little bit older than t he 70s, you're r ight. It was actua lly built in the late 1 9th century as the, uh, as th e commanda nt's resi dence here. You're actu ally on a naval base. This is the nav al observatory, which is a working n aval ba se. And, uh, and and but in the 1970s, this b eca me the officia l reside nce o f the vice p resident of th e United States. A nd its it is, u h, it's it's not a not a p lace that a lot o f people get around to be a ble to see. It's an honor for us to li ve here. It's an h onor for us to wel come all of you here. And I ho pe I hope you leave with goo d m emories. Let me also say, I hope you've s ee n in the last tw o years those of you that ha ve served during that period of time, that, u h, this is a This is an adminis tration led by a president who truly beli eves in state based flexibi lity, innovati on and reform. We be l ieve in our governors, and we believe in o ur state govern ment Oh, the presi dent actually referred t o it as, uh, I think, at the v ery first meeting of the NGA Steve he said that his ambition was to have a true partnership of collabor ation and coop eration with America 's governors. And , uh and we've w orked to do just that. And, u h, for some o f you newcomers, yo u can yo u can talk to the folks t hat have been add ed a while, but we 're proud of the fac t that w e worked with state s to promote flexi bi lity on healt h care, to give a greater vo ice to states and land man agement. Obviously, we' ve worked very closel y with state leadership in combating the sc ourge of opiate abuse and addic tion that so many of you hav e led with distinction on. We work to open up our natural resources to respo nsi ble deve lopment , uh, and, uh , and I'll make you a p romise. And we'll ask for your help that in this Congress we're going to pass his toric infrastructure legisl ation th at will rebuild the roads an d bridges and infra of Ameri ca. Governors wil l p lay a leading ro le in th at. And , uh and and I have to tel l you if if you haven't noticed, the A merican peo ple elected a buil der to be presiden t and he wants to r ebuil d t he infrastructure o f this country. And we're already in discussions with leaders in both po litical parties in the Con gress. But But since it will be states that d eploy those re source s uh, and, uh, a nd and and implement that i nfrastructure, uh, we need your voic es at the table about what? Tho se what th ose needs are and let me make you a pr omise. As g over nors as well, Not on ly are we going to loo k to make a historic investment in infrastructu re, but we'r e looking to cut back the red tap e so that we can rebuild Ameri ca's infrastructure fa ster and more efficient ly with governors a nd stat es in the lead making that happe n. Okay. But lastly , in addit ion to al l of that type of partnershi p, and there are great fri ends in the room who have seen th eir states and their territorie s through great challenges in the last two years, I hop e I hope you all know how proud w e are of the leadership that our governors have pr ovided during times of natural disasters. We'r e awfully proud of Homela nd Secu rity, the efforts F EMA stepping up in those times. And I just want you to know that we're going to continue to work ha nd in glov e with your admi nistrations, whether it' s whether it's the hur ricane winds blowing, whether it's histor ic snowfall. Uh, we' re we're h ere. Charlie Baker was in office for 15 min utes when he got ab out 15 ft of sno w and did a phenomenal job for the people of Massac husetts. I remem ber it well, bu t we'r e here to partner w ith you. We're a pho ne call away because w e know it's thos e moments. It's those mo ments that people don't call Washin gton D. C. They call local law enforceme nt and first responde rs. They call t heir state officials and lea ders. And that's when you step into th e gap and elite. An d we 're here to partner wit h you and stand with you. And that's our solemn pledge to each and eve ry one of you. So wi th that, let me let m e let us ge t ba ck to just good fellowship again. It's an honor for Karen and me, uh, to be able to welcome you all here, uh, really, to pay a debt of gratitude as well to the job that each and every one of you do. I hope I hope you leave here with with confidence in the in the gratitude and the respect of the president, his vice president, our entire administration for the job that you do, the burden that you bear in the way that you serve the people of your great state and people of this great nation with real honor every day. So God bless you and your continued leadership, and it's an honor to be with you all. Thank you so much with that. It's my honor to introduce the chairman of the National Governors Association, Governor Steve Bullock. Steve, Welcome and thank you so much. Mhm Vice president, Mrs Pence, on behalf of al l of our nation's governor s, tha nks so much for once again op ening the doors to this bea utif ul home for us. As we kick off the National Governors Association winter meeting in t his lon g weekend, I still h ave fond memor ies of the t wo of you welcomi ng me to your residents we knew w ere the governor of and first lady of Indiana. An d I thi nk to me that undersco res kind of th e bedrock foundatio n of some of th e commonality that we re ally do h ave. We may no t agree on every policy on every decision in o ur respective s tates or the admi nistration, but t here's one area that we both agree o n cert ainly are we all agree on is that go vernors have a fund amental and meani ngful impact on the lives of the people that we ser ve. A nd this weekend we g ather to both col laborate to discu ss, mayb e at times to argue, but als o to illustrate the powers of the gove rnors in a cooperativ e relationsh ip wit h the federal governmen t, each and eve ry governor in t his room, A s you kn ow, both in service n ow and before on the front lines of th e decisions that happ en here, we have to deal direc tly with the acti on and the inacti on of Congre ss and th e administration and , like you were of te n at times frustra ted by the freq uent inaction on the basic fu nctions of governing that can happen in th e city. A s a former governor, I k now that you are one of the few i ndividuals that might actually unders tand the di fficult decisions that we have to confront and m ake, and you mentioned so many of the issues that we've been w orking on and also from, If you thin k from h ealth ca re and education to taxes, tariffs, infr astructure, gun sa fety, you know the range of issues that our nation's gov ernors face eac h and every day that w e serve, and there's no su bstitute for the experience of being a governor provides. We're enc ouraged knowing that someone who sat in the go vernor's seat con ti nues to rea ch out to us both. When we agree and when we disagree. We're still loo king forward to both the e vening Sunday night , but also a robust poli cy discuss ion on Monday with the ad ministration, t he president and yourself. Ce rtainly we all have real issues we need t o c onfront in th is country once it states in, the federal government must addre ss togeth er. And I'm an o ptimist as a governor and having three young Children . You have t o be optimistic, um, that together we can certainly jump start the wheels of cooperative governing again. So thanks so much for again kicking us off and setting us off on the right platform for the next few days that we get to spend together.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?458151-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-national-governors-association-luncheon	Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence spoke at a luncheon for the nation&rsquo;s governors, who were in Washington for the National Governor&rsquo;s Association winter meeting.

Let's give a ll the round of applause. T hank you one of the one of the elements of the crisis on our south ern borders that for th e 1st time ever. For the 1s t time ever the majority of individ uals crossing our border illegally a re families and unacc ompanied minors they're being dr iven by human trafficke rs and drug cartels th at are exploiting v ulnerable populatio ns and en ticing them to take a long a nd dangerous journey north through our border it's driving h uman tra fficking all across thi s country and Aliya has done a r emarkable jo b to rea ch out to come alongside to come alongside young people that ha ve been exploited in this human traf ficking that the that the drug cartels are drivin g and you're doin g it with co mpassion you're doing i t with care you're doin g with the heart of the people of G eorgia and the Am erican people and yo u have our thanks Ilia grand child. But I want you know a s you do you r work Preside nt Trump and I hav e your back is one of the very r easons why this presi dent stood so str ong over the over the mo nth of January to make sure that we got the res ources that we need to secure our border $2300000 0 000.00 for border se curit y addition al personnel additional resou rces and resources to constr uct a border wall and th e president dec lared a nat ional emergenc y to make e v en more resources av ailable I don't ha ve to tell all of you but wa lls work and we're going to build that wa ll we're going to secure our border and we're go ing to continue to su pport the men and wom en of ice here in Geor gia and all ac ross the countr y as w e do. Now I know I know you've go t a hard job and unfortunately with the debat e in the in the public squar e today sometimes it gets harde r heard on my way down he re that the mayor of Atlanta . I recently an nounced tha t. At t he cit y government woul dn't coopera te with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement when i t comes to detention of of criminal ille ga l aliens in this city. And I I it is am azing to think the mayor actually said that she would her words not b e complicit in an immigration policy t hat inte ntionally inflicts misery I would I would say to the mayor tha t. Crimin al illegal immigrants ga ng members on our stre ets are what inflict misery the flow of ill egal drugs like cocaine an d meth and Fenton all in fl ict misery and wr eck our fami lies and communities hu man trafficking inflicts m isery the Immigratio n and Customs Enf orcement the men and women who enforce ou r laws do not inflict miser y they bring safety and secu rity to the people of Atlanta and t hey deserve the respect of ever y elected officia l in this count ry. So thank you all fo r coming ou t today you know th e Bible says if you owe debt s pay debts if Hon or th en honor and r espect than respec t and I I just wanted to stop by today on behalf o f President Don al d Tru mp and our entire admin istration just pay a de bt of gratitude to each and ev ery $1. 00 of you if you don't our job. An d t hese da ys it can be a little bit harder because of the cr iticisms com ing in but I got to tell you. T he w ork this office is doing is truly inspiri ng. And I kno w the pe ople o f Atlanta peop le of Georgia peop le all ac ross this country are grateful e ver y day w hatever you might hear in the political debate now or in the days ahead just be sure the American people are with you and we're with you they understand just like this president understands.

The ong o ing discu ssions that are taking pl ace wi th the Mexi can delegation as you all are aware. Las t week Pr esident Tru m p anno unced action in th e form of a 5 percent t ariff that would b e imposed eff e ctive this Monday. Unless Mex ico were to step for ward and take a ction to address what is an und eniable. Humanita rian and se curity crisis at our southe rn border as was revealed just ye s. Today b y officials last month alone w e saw a $14 4000.00 peop le come i nto our country illega lly and i t is so overw helming our system and Presiden t Trump made it clear th at Mexico mus t do more Yester d ay the presiden t directed us myself t he secr etary of state an d o ur team to meet with the Mexican delegation at the ir request and hear them out . Progress was ma de t he Mexican delegation brough t fo r wa rd pro posals but as the pre sident said last night was not ne arly en ough and we made it clear yesterday at th e White House that Mexico must do sig nificantly more. To to end t his crisis of i llegal immigration at our border we cal led o n them to take even more step s more decisive action I'v e been r eceiving report s throughout the day as those negotiations have continued a t the State Depart ment and we are encouraged tha t. Frankly the Mexican delegation bro ught even more pro posals today. But I' ll be talking to the president later t onight over the co urse of thi s weekend about what's being proposed but the Ameri can people can be confid ent that whil e we continue to adva nce policies like the U.S. M.C. A. will con tinue to drive f orward polic ies fo r infrastructure legislation all the kinds of things that will co ntinue to sup port a growing American eco nom y this pres ident has no high er prio rity than e nding the cris is of illegal immigratio n that i s flooding our southe rn border people are b eing hurt on bo th sid es of the bo rder and the pre sident's made it clea r that it's time fo r Mexico to ac t to take such actions necess ary to stem this eno rmous flow of ill egal immig rants to our bo rder and as I said today we'l l also continu e to call on the Congress to act I m ean the truth is the drug cartels and human traffickers are usi ng loopholes in Amer ican law to entice. Vu lnerable fami lies to tak e the long and dan gerous jou rney north from Central Amer ica often a great risk to themselv es and grea t harm to themselv es and vu lnerable children a long the way the truth is Con gr ess in the midst of doing everything el se as I said tod ay ought t o ou ght to take this iss ue up to work with our adminis tration supporters in t he House and Senate close the loopholes and we believe tha t in c ombi nation with strong act ion by Me xico will end the crisis tha t the American people face at our southern border but let me say again those discussions are ongoing with the State Department will continue those discussions but the American people can be confident President Trump is going to continue to stand strong till Mexico takes the action necessary to end this crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border. Question They di d . Real ly. Well let me say I don't want to neg otiate in public . But we made it very clear that in addition to interna l enforcement that there would have to be new understandings from the United States and Mexico we began l ast fall to implement what 's known as the remain in Mexic o proposal at this poin t we're returning hundred s of people back to remai n in Mexico while th eir asylu m applications are bein g processed but we spoke about that we spoke about other arrang ements bu t the botto m line is w e made it very clear t hat Mexico has to step up they hav e to do more and th ey have to do more quickly when the Americ an people s ee what's happening a t our southern bor der as I talk to border state governors. T he heartbreaking st orie s of of of vulnerable famili es last month alone of $14 400 0.00 that cam e across ou r border. 100000 w ere families with c hildren no w again the drug ca rtels are essentially telling pe ople if you bring a dependent a child with you you can exploit l oopholes in our laws that has to change and it has to change on both sides of the border Congress needs to act but will conti nue to call on Mexico as these discussi ons continue to take act ions necessary and reach agreem ents with the Unite d States that will a l low us to in effect . To take th at enticemen t away from people tha t ar e being exploi ted by human traffick er s. What are the for m e. With Mexico. Media hur dle to get something done . Well let me say th e presid ent has no time to we've announce d that 5 per cent tariffs are going to be imp osed on all goods c oming in from Mexico on M onday an d and if we don't see the results that we need to see we' ll see action by Me xico in the months ahead those tariffs will increase but that being said the Mexican d elegation as ked for an opport unity to meet to bring us proposals about how t hey can address thi s issue and respond to the presiden t's call for act io n and we listen to them yesterda y as I said they they b rought a number o f proposals most ly having to do with int ernal security within Mexico th at we listened to but as the pres ident made clear we made clear to them it was not nearly enough we called on them to do mor e I'm encouraged that they came today with more but i t will be a matter for the president to cons ider wh at they're offering enough for us to evaluate t hose proposals to determine w hether or n ot it will be suffici ent to really bring t his crisis of illegal imm igration at o ur southern border too and that's our objective is to sustain that 5 percent tariffs wi ll be d etrimental to the U.S.. I. The re are discussions about those concerns. Lo ok the American e conomy is booming. We see 5800000 jobs crea ted in the w ake of the president' s effo rt to roll back red ta pe cut taxes unleash energy you see job creation all across Pennsyl vania and a ll across thi s country and w e'll continue to advance policies that will creat e a growing America but. We have a n undeniable cri si s on our southern bo rder the presid ent I've litera lly bee n talking about it. For t he pa st 2 years and we heard we hear d from. The other par ty that there was n o crisis for a time but no w I think every A merican recogn izes an d every ev ery leader and in the De mo cratic Par ty should recognize that the crisis is real it' s time to se t politics aside and Congres s sho uld come together and work in good faith t o pass the kind o f changes in ou r immigra tion laws that will t hat will take away the the enticement tha t human traffickers use to to attract vulnerable families to make a long and dangerous journey more we think that's the priority We'll continue to stand for a growing economy but ending the crisis on our southern border is the number one priority for this president and this administration right. Now . Will go in that one day and optim istic are you that an y rea l ly. Well. The presiden t announced 5 percent tar iffs wi ll be imposed on Mo nday all goods coming in from Mexico. That's the policy of the Unite d States pres ident. And said what he means and he meant what he said we made it v ery clear to the M exic an d elegation ye sterday that th at for anything to ch ange either before o r after Monday Mex ico has to ste p up Mexico has to take decisive acti on to end this su rge of illeg al immigrati on tha t is literally overwhelming our southern border. T here's actions they can take. We made recommen dations to them there' s been some movement on their p art that's been enco uraging but at th e end of the d ay we 'll as th ose discussi ons of wrapped up today we'll evaluate thos e proposals wil l prevent present them to the presi dent but ul timately Pr esident Trump will make the deci sion whet her or not the actions that Me xico is prepar ed to take are su fficient for us to to consider changing course but at this point. T he tariffs are are going to be impose d on Mon day we've made t hat very clear to the Mexi can delegatio n but discussions are going to c ontinue in the days ahe ad and our hope is. T hat Mexico will respon d. An d the presid ent's fully prepared not just t o impose the 5 percent tariff but to inc rease those ta riffs in the mont hs ahead but we hope for better we we h ope to see Mexico step up and ta ke such ac tion it's necessary to end this crisis of ill eg al i mmigration a t our southern border if they take that action in on us. We believe that will be the best neighbors they eve r had and we are. Yesterday w e were we we want to see th is issue r esolved because as as I said in the Mexican d elegation there are pe ople being hu rt on both sides of the border a nd the time has come f or Mexico to do more we 'll continu e to call on our Congr ess to do more to close the loophol es in our law but Me xico and the American people can be confident President Donald Trump is going to continue to stand firm until we end this humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border thank you	https://www.c-span.org/video/?461487-101/vice-president-pence-comments-mexico-tariff-talks	Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in York, Pennsylvania, that Mexico has to do more if it wants to avoid a five percent tariff on its goods beginning June 10, 2019.

THEY CALLED IT A WAR CRIME THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS ATTENDED THE OPENING OF THE PILGRIMS WALKED . THEY CALLED IT THE PEACE NEGOTIATOR SAID IT'S A LIE. THERE IS NO SUCH CONNECTION . THE OTHERS SAID IT WAS FALSE, A MYTHICAL TUNNEL. THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TWO WEEKS AGO UNVEILED A VILLAGE THAT CLAIMS TO PROVE THEIR ANCIENT ROOTS IN THE LAND EXCEPT THAT IT WAS FABRICATED. IT WASN'T REAL. AND HERE THE REAL HISTORY UNDENIABLE , IN THE STONES OF THAT WALK , THAT WHAT WE'RE 2.7 MILLION PEOPLE ON EVERY HOLIDAY WANT TO COME UP TO THE TEMPLE , RETURNING TO ITS PROPER PLACE . IT'S A SIGN THAT HISTORY IS TURNING . TIME WHEN JERUSALEM IS OPEN TO ALL FOR HIM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE JUDAIZING OF JERUSALEM 300,000 YEARS AFTER KING DAVID MADE IT HIS CAPITAL, NOT TO HAVE HOTEL NAMED AFTER HIM IN JERUSALEM BUT BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZED ITS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE , THE FULFILLMENT OF JEWISH DESTINY, OF THREE, FROM THE TIME OF ABRAHAM AND THE PROMISE OF ALL HISTORY, . THIS IS A WAR AGAINST THE JEWISH PEOPLE, JEWISH NATION, JEWISH PAST AND THE JEWISH FUTURE AND I BELIEVE YOURS AS WELL. SO I WANT TO MAKE A SPECIAL PLEA HERE TO ASK YOU AS I SAID JEWS MAY BE THE FIRST VICTIMS THAT WE'RE NEVER THE LAST, JEWISH HATRED IS CANCEROUS, IT METASTASIZES IN SOCIETY AND EVERYBODY EVENTUALLY GETS IN DANGER, EIGHT HAS NO GEOGRAPHIC OR LINGUISTIC OR POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. NO IDEOLOGICAL PATENT . IT CROSSES MOUNTAINS AND OCEANS, SPREADS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SO NO MORE CROCODILE TEARS OVER JEWISH VICTIMS. NO MORE MEMORIALS TO JEWISH DAD. YOU WANT THE WORLD TO STAND UP FOR THE LIVING JEWISH PEOPLE AND IN LIVING VIBRANT JEWISH STATE NOW AND FOREVER. [APPLAUSE] AND NO MORE OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS , EVEN BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS . WHO THEN FOLLOW WITH HALFHEARTED APOLOGY . ONLY TO BE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN CAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT RETRACT THE LIE , THE BIG LIE REMAINS. EVERYBODY FORGETS THE APOLOGY . NO MORE. YOU TOOK HITLER MONTHS TO SPREAD THE BIG LIE, IT'S NOW SPREAD IN SECONDS . WE HAVE TO STOP LETTING A SMALL GROUP OF EXTREMIST VOICES DOMINATE . WITH THEIR ILL-INFORMED AND BIASED COMMENTS . WE ALL HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER SO FROM THIS SACRED ASSEMBLY OF CARING AND MOTIVATED AND BLESSED PEOPLE , LET THE CLARION CALL GO FORTH . EIGHT STOPS NOW. NO EXCUSES, NO EXCEPTIONS, NONE. [APPLAUSE] THE ANTI-ISRAEL LIES STOP NOW. THE ATTEMPTS TO PICK AMERICA AGAINST ISRAEL STOP NOW. WE STAND TOGETHER . IN THIS BATTLE . THE ANTI-ISRAEL MOVEMENT ARE SHAMS. THAT REALLY COVERS FOR OTHER THINGS , BUT THEY CAN'T ADMIT WHAT THE REAL GOAL IS . SO ON CAMPUS AFTER CAMPUS , WE SEE THE DISTORTIONS TRANSLATED INTO COURSES , ONE OF COLUMBIA CALLED THE INVENTION OF THE JEW . THAT'S THE POISON FILLING THE MINDS OF THE NEXT GENERATION . THAT IS THE KIND OF MESSAGES THAT THEY ARE HEARING . SO THEN IT'S UP TO US . YOUR 7 BILLION AND US . I REMEMBER WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF CHINA VISITED ISRAEL AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU SAID BETWEEN US WE'RE BIGGER THAN A HALF-MILLION PEOPLE . I KNEW YOU GET IT EVENTUALLY. WE HAVE TO PUT ON CENTER STAGE THOSE WHO DESERVE RECOGNITION FOR THE COURAGEOUS STAND, OFTEN AT PERSONAL RISK . THOSE WHO SUSTAIN TRUE ACADEMIC FREEDOM, EVEN TRUE FREE SPEECH, WHO WANT TO SEE AMERICA FULFILL ITS DESTINY, VISION ASSURING THAT HATRED STOPS NOW . NO ONE IS IMMUNE AS THE WORDS OF PASTOR NINE MUELLER REMINDED US AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT WHEN THEY CAME FOR HIM. THERE ARE A PEOPLE WHO STAND UP BUT GET NO ATTENTION . SO NO MORE FOCUS ON THE BAD GUY , NEITHER IN CONGRESS OR IN GOVERNMENT CALLS OR IN ACADEMIA OR IN THE INTERNET OR IN ENTERTAINMENT. LET'S HIGHLIGHT THE HEROES LIKE PASTOR AND MRS. KATIE, THE PROFILES IN COURAGE TO STAND UP RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE PREVAILING CORRUPTED IDEAS AND CULTURAL APPROPRIATION . LIKE JK ROWLING, LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF WILLIAMS COLLEGE, CORNELL INJECTED THE BDS RESOLUTIONS, GOT PETITIONS AGAINST THEM MANNING LADY FIRED AND YET THEY WERE MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE RESOLUTE , DEMANDING TO STAND UP FOR THE TRUTH . WE WANT , [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD SALUTE THE GOVERNORS OF THE 26TH THAT HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-BDS LEGISLATIONS AND THEIR LEGISLATORS. LET THEM HEAR FROM YOU . LET THEM KNOW YOU APPRECIATE IT . IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM AS IT IS FOR ISRAEL. GOVERNOR CUOMO VISITED JUSTICE WE AND HE SAID IN ISRAEL THAT ISRAEL BUYS $5 BILLION IN GOODS FROM NEW YORK EVERY YEAR AND EXPORTS $8 MILLION. AND NEW YORK ONLY STANDS TO GAIN FROM IT. WE SHOULD SALUTE THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO LEFT THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE OF AN ANTI-SEMITISM AND ANTI-SEMITIC LEADERS . [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD SALUTE THE CHRISTIAN ZIONISTS IN SOUTH AMERICA WHO ARE PRESSING THEIR GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM . I WAS THERE, I SAW THEM, AND WITH THEM . THEY ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH AND THE BEST PEOPLE YOU WILL MEET . WE SHOULD SALUTE THE "" OF HOLLAND . THE VAN OATS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF , THE IMPORT HUNDRED 20,000 BOTTLES OF WINE INTO HOLLAND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE AND WHO REFUSE TO PUT A LABEL AT THE EU HAS LEGISLATED ONTO THE ISRAELI PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT IS BIGOTRY AND THEY WILL HAVE NO PART OF IT. [APPLAUSE] THE US AND ISRAEL WILL STAND TOGETHER I BELIEVE FOREVER. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CHALLENGING YEARS AHEAD WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION AND ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK'S TORAH READING IT TELLS THE STORY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WENT TO SYNAGOGUE , YOU DIDN'T? IN THE PREVIOUS WEEKENDS FOR OUR READING IT SAID TELLS THE STORY OF THE SPICE AND THERE YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THEY CAME BACK, THEY SAID WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS IN THEIR EYES . IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE GIANT SAID IT . THEY SAID IT. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY PERCEIVE THEMSELVES . IT WAS ISN'T WHAT THE GIANT SAW . AND IT'S WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES AS GRASSHOPPERS, WE LOSE . WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES AS THE GIANTS, WE WIN . YOU STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT THING . NOW THE TIME, NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS. [APPLAUSE] AND IN THE STORY WHICH I HAVE TOLD HERE EVERY YEAR BUT REPEAT BECAUSE THERE'S ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE HERE WHO ASKED ME TO , THEY'RE MY KIDS AND THEY HAVEN'T ASKED. YOU KNOW IN THE STORY OF THE SPIES , THE SCOUTS, YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SPIES IN WASHINGTON YOU SEE. YOU'LL HAVE A REPORT WRITTEN ABOUT YOU . HOW MANY OF YOU CAN NAME THE 10 CAME BACK WITH A NEGATIVE REPORT . HOW MANY OF YOU CAN NAME THE TWO CAME BACK WITH A POSITIVE REPORT ? THAT'S THE LESSON OF HISTORY, THOSE WHO STAND WITH ISRAEL ARE REMEMBERED FOREVER, THOSE WHO SPEAK AGAINST ISRAEL ARE LOST TO HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] ANGER AND FEAR DON'T SERVE US. WE MUST USE OUR ENERGIES TO CONSTRUCT WHILE THEY STRUCK. WE WILL DECIDE THE FUTURES , NOT LET OTHERS DETERMINE IT FOR US . NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS. HE MUST BUILD COALITIONS , REACH OUT TO FRIENDS, THEN , EMBOLDEN THEM . WE WILL BE THOSE WHO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, WE WILL ASSERT OUR LEGITIMACY, OUR RELEVANCE, OUR MEANINGFULNESS TO A YOUNGER GENERATION WHO ARE IN SEARCH . THEIR MINDS WILL BE FILLED WITH THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL FILL THEM. A RADICAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS? AN EXTREMIST PROFESSOR? OR THE BIBLICAL MESSAGE OR , THE TRADITIONAL MESSAGE. THE AGE OLD MESSAGE OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE WHICH CAN PROVIDE ALL THE ANSWERS ONCE GIVEN TO THEM. YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW TODAY ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURES. BUT AT THE COUNTRY SONG GOES, WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, YOU'LL FALL FOR ANYTHING . WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING. AND WE HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THEM IN THEIR TERMS AND IN THEIR MEDIUM WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GO ON THE INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND COMMUNICATE THEM , EVEN THE WORDS DON'T MEAN THE SAME THINGS ANYMORE . THE POWER IN THIS ROOM , OF THIS MOVEMENT , OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GATHERED HERE , OF THIS ALLIANCE OF SUPPORT FOR US ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP CAN OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES BY OUR WORKING TOGETHER AND LISTENING ALL WE CAN TO OUR COMMON EFFORT. WE WILL SEE THE FULFILLMENT OF THE BLESSING . GOD PROMISE WE HOLD, THAT WE SAY EVERY HANUKKAH IN THE BLESSING, WE THANK GOD FOR THE MIRACLES OF THOSE DAYS IN OUR TIME . THE MIRACLES OF THE FEW OVERCOMING THE MANY . THE RIGHTEOUS OVERCOMING THE EVIL. A FEW OVERCOMING , BUT PURE OVERCOMING IMPURE.THAT'S WHAT THIS ALLIANCE IS ABOUT . AND WE WILL SEE THOSE GLORIOUS DAYS WHEN THIS PROPHECY IS FULFILLED BY VIRTUE OF STANDING UP, SPEAKING OUT COURAGEOUSLY AND PROMISING NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS . [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE KNEW HE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO THE STATE AND COUNTRY THAT HAD GIVEN HIM SO MUCH. IN 2000 HE LAUNCHED A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LOCAL CORRECTION CONGRESSIONAL SEAT, ENTERING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT THE AGE OF 40 . THE PEOPLE OF EAST CENTRAL INDIANA ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SIX TIMES TO REPRESENT THEM IN CONGRESS. HIS COLLEAGUES QUICKLY RECOGNIZES LEADERSHIP ABILITY AND UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED HIM TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN . IN 2013 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE LED THE NATION'S CAPITAL WHEN THE HOOSIERS SELECTED HIM GOVERNOR OF INDIANA. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE IN 2016. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE ENTERED OFFICE JANUARY 20 WHEN HE 17. IT IS MY HONOR TO WELCOME MY FRIEND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO THE CU I SUMMIT FOR THE THIRD TIME. SINCE BEING ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, HE HAS REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS VALUES OF HARD WORK, FAITH AND FAMILY AND UPHELD HIS FIRM BELIEF THAT STANDING WITH ISRAEL IS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO . VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AS STOOD WITH CUIS FOR MANY YEARS AS WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL REMAINS CLOSE AND INSEPARABLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WILL YOU PLEASE DAN AND GET A WARM WELCOME TO A CONSISTENT AND FAITHFUL FRIEND , THE 45TH VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE . [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] HELLO CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL . THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME . WELCOME BACK TO OUR NATION'S CAPITAL FOR THIS WASHINGTON SUMMIT . IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL AND WITH I KNOW MILLIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE LOOKING ON. PASTOR JOHN HAGAN, MY THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR MINISTRY.IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR AMERICA AND FOR ISRAEL. TO MY FRIEND GARY BAUER WHO RUNS THE WASHINGTON OFFICE FOR CUFI, TO THE THOUSANDS OF PRO-ISRAEL AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN GATHERED HERE AND ALL THOSE LOOKING ON, HENCE THE FOUNDING OF THIS NATION , THE FOUNDING THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED A FEW SHORT DAYS AGO , THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAVE BEEN AT THE VERY HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE IN THE 6 MILLION THAT YOU REPRESENT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY CONTINUE THIS GREAT TRADITION WITH CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL, THE LARGEST PRO-ISRAEL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAND . THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS OF ISRAEL FROM ACROSS THIS NATION . AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF ISRAEL, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN TODAY BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM A FRIEND OF MINE . AND A MAN HISTORY HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE THE GREATEST FRIEND OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL EVER TO SIT IN THE OVAL OFFICE , I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP . PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS DAN IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR JEWISH MOTHERS AND SISTERS AND WE WILL ALWAYS DAN STRONG FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THIS PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE SERVED TOGETHER SINCE HE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS STATE AND I TELL YOU, HE'S A MAN OF ACTION . AND HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD. HE SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND HE MEANS WHAT HE SAYS AND FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN KEEPING THE PROMISES THAT HE MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AT HOME AND ABROAD . [APPLAUSE] IS TRUE, THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE WILL REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. WE CUT BACK TAXES, ROLLBACK REGULATION, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND SINCE ELECTION DAY BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 6 MILLION NEW JOBS INCLUDING MORE THAN A QUARTER OF 1 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST MONTH ALONE . [APPLAUSE] WAGES ARE UP . THE STOCK MARKET IS SOARING AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS NEAR A 50 YEAR LOW AND THIS PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN . WE'VE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE . JOBS ARE BACK . CONFIDENCE IS BACK . IN A WORD, AMERICA IS BACK AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED . I'M PROUD TO REPORT WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, THE UNITED STATES IS ONCE AGAIN EMBRACING OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD . PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. HE STANDS UP FOR AMERICA EVERY DAY ON THE WORLD STAGE. [APPLAUSE] AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE ARE STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND STANDING UP TO OUR ENEMIES . OUR NATO ALLIES ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE AND WE'VE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL . FIVE YEARS AGO , ISIS CONTROLLED NEARLY 85,000 SQUARE MILES IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE UNDER THEIR BRUTAL REGIME . TODAY, THANKS TO OUR ARMED FORCES , OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LAST INCH OF GROUND CONTROLLED BY ISIS IN SYRIA WAS CAPTURED . THE ISIS CALIPHATE IS NO MORE. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AS THE WORLD KNOWS NOTHING ELSE, THE WORLD KNOWS THIS : AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL . [APPLAUSE] THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, OUR ALLIANCE HAS LITERALLY NEVER BEEN STRONGER. [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] WELCOME BACK TO WASHINGTON DC . YOU KNOW, THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP IT'S TRUE. OUR ALLIANCE WITH ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH , FOR THE SAKE OF ZION I WILL NOT BE SILENT . IT WAS WRITTEN AND MY FRIENDS, THIS PRESIDENT FOR THE SAKE OF ZION HAS NOT BEEN SILENCED . [APPLAUSE] I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED ISRAEL WOULD HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO DEFEND ITSELF BY ITSELF . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER IN THE MILITARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. RESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO SHUT DOWN THE PLO OFFICE IN WASHINGTON OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REFUSED TO TAKE STEPS TO STOP FUNDING TERRORISTS WHO MURDERED INNOCENT ISRAELI CIVILIANS WITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS AND WHEN THE PLO REFUSED, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHUT DOWN THEIR OFFICE. NOW THE FACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT ALSO PROMISED TO CONFRONT ANTI-SEMITISM ON THE WORLD STAGE . AND SEE TO IT THAT AMERICA WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS TO BE A FORUM FOR INVECTIVE AGAINST ISRAEL AND LAST SUMMER, THIS PRESIDENT WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE SO-CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AT THE UN AND TWO MONTHS LATER PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDED ALL US CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNRAH . AND OF COURSE LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WHAT NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM HAD THE COURAGE TO DO . WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TO THINK I WAS THERE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS BEING MADE AND BEING PROCESSED AND TO SAY THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND TO MOVE OUR EMBASSY THERE, TO SAY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WAS AGAINST IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE KEPT HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WHEN HE RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM IS THE ETERNAL CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND MOVED OUT EMBASSY THERE. [APPLAUSE] AND BEYOND THAT FOR 20 YEARS AFTER ISRAEL'S REVERT, SYRIA HELD STRATEGIC GROUND KNOWN AS THE GOLAN HEIGHTS WITH ITS MASSIVE ARTILLERY IT HELD ISRAEL HOSTAGE . THIS CRUCIAL REGION CHANGE CAN ONLY AFTER ISRAEL WON A WAR FORCED UPON HER . EVER SINCE THEN THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO THE STRATEGIC SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL . BUT IN ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER , AMERICA HESITATED TO RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AND BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AT HIS SIDE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. [APPLAUSE] OUR PRESIDENT MADE ALL THESE DECISIONS , KEEPING HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE MADE THEM IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION , BUT I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF YOU HERE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ALSO BELIEVE THEY WERE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEACE . BECAUSE A LASTING PEACE CAN ONLY BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF TRUTH . SO WE PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM. THAT THOSE WHO LOVE HER WILL BE SECURE. AND EVEN AS WE PRAY, WE WILL WORK FOR PEACE . PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO FINDING A PATH THAT CAN LEAD TO A TRUE, JUST AND LASTING PEACE FOR ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE REGION. FOR PEACE TO BE LASTING AND TO THE REAL MUST BE NEGOTIATED . BUT PEACE CAN ONLY BE NEGOTIATED WITH PARTNERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE. HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT SEEKS THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL NEVER NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS HAMAS. [APPLAUSE] BUT LAST WEEK IN PURSUIT OF PEACE THERE WAS A HISTORIC CONFERENCE IN BAHRAIN . AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF PAINSTAKING EFFORTS, THE PRESIDENT'S EXTRAORDINARY MIDDLE EAST PEACE TEAM LED BY JARED KUSHNER UNVEILED A NEW VISION OF HOW THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE COULD BE EMPOWERED TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS VIBRANT AND PEACEFUL SOCIETY IF THEY CHOOSE PEACE OVER WAR. I KNOW THE CYNICS OUT THERE SAY THE PRESIDENT STREAMS OR PEACE ARE TWO BIG . IT IS ALSO TOO HIGH BUT IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN DAVID THEN GARY ON , ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER WHO SAID AND I QUOTE , ANYONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES AROUND THESE PARTS ISN'T A REALIST . SO WE WILL KEEP DREAMING AND KEEP WORKING FOR PEACE. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME ASSURE YOU , WHILE ANY PIECE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REQUIRE COMPROMISE, YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT OF THIS . THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL NEVER COMPROMISE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL . IN THE WAKE OF ALL THOSE ACTIONS FINALLY THE PRESIDENT ALSO MADE ONE OTHER PROMISE . HE PROMISED TO STAND UP TO THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR . AND HE DID JUST THAT. WHEN HE WITHDREW THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA FROM THE DISASTROUS AROUND NUCLEAR DEAL. THERE WILL BE NO MORE CASH FOR THE MULLAHS IN IRAN.AND PROFESSOR HAGAN MENTIONED I SERVED IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, I WAS ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. BACK WHEN I WAS IN CONGRESS WAS A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO BROUGHT TOGETHER SANCTIONS ON IRAN YEARS AGO . THOSE SANCTIONS WERE ISOLATING REGIME WAS IN BRINGING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON IT. BUT IN 2015, WE ALL REMEMBER WE THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS SIGNED , ALL OF THAT PRESSURE WENT AWAY. THE PREVIOUS AND MINISTRATIONS OPEL DEAL DIDN'T PREVENT IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, IT DELAYED IT. FOR ROUGHLY A DECADE. IN EXCHANGE, THE DEAL GAVE AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CASH SANCTIONS REALLY IRAN HAS USED THE PHONE MORE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON INNOCENCE ACROSS THE REGION. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WE HAVE REIMPOSED EVERY LAST SECTION THAT WAS LIFTED. AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, WE IMPLEMENTED A MAXIMUM CAMPAIGN TO CHANGE BRANDS MORE LINE BEHAVIOR AND HOLD THE REGIME ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK AS WE SEE , OUR ACTIONS ARE ALREADY HAVING AN EFFECT . THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THE REGIME'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRORIST MINIONS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST . THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS REELING UNDER UNPRECEDENTED US SANCTIONS. NOW AARON MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR HIS PEOPLE AND CONTINUING TO FUND ITS PROXIES WHO SPREAD VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND BREATHE OUT MURDEROUS HATRED AGAINST ISRAEL. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, DESPITE PROMISES"" TO THE CONTRARY IN 2015 , IRAN HAS BEEN EVEN INCREASING MORE OF THEIR MALIGN ACTIVITY AND VIOLENCE IN THE REGION AND WE'VE ALL WITNESSED IT. LAST MONTH AROUND ATTACK TANKERS PASSING NEAR THE STRAIT OF LOSE AND THEY DOWN AN UNMANNED AMERICAN DRONE. AND LAST WEEK AROUND EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF LOW ENRICHED AND RADIANT IN HALF. TODAY IT ACTUALLY PROCLAIMED IT WAS GOING TO START ENRICHING URANIUM BEYOND THE LEVELS PERMITTED BY THE AGREEMENT. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. IRAN SHOULD NOT CONFUSE AMERICAN RESTRAINT WITH A LACK OF AMERICAN RESOLVE . [APPLAUSE] WE HOPE FOR THE BEST , BUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR MILITARY ARE PREPARED . TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS AND PROTECT OUR PERSONNEL AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE REGION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE IRAN'S MALIGN INFLUENCE . WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING PRESSURE ON THEIR ECONOMY AND OTHER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AMERICA WILL NEVER ALLOW IRAN TO OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON . HISTORY TEACHES THAT WHEN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES BREATHE OUT VIOLENT ANTI-SOMATIC HATRED , AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE, THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD. EARLIER THIS YEAR, MY WIFE KAREN AND I STOOD AND PRAYED AND GRIEVED AT THE AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU NOT THE DEATH CAMP . IT WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPERIENCE . TO WALK THOSE IMMENSE ROUNDS. KILLING ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. AS WE GAZED DOWN AT THE REMAINS OF THE GAS CHAMBERS, AS WE WALKED PAST THE PERSONAL EFFECTS , THE PILES OF LITTLE SHOES THAT WERE GATHERED THERE. , IT MERELY REINFORCED OUR RESOLVE . THAT ANSWER TO THAT UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THROUGH THIS AND EVERY GENERATION MUST BE NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] ISRAEL WAS REBORN THAT WAS ALL , SO WE MUST AS AMERICANS MAINTAIN IT. WE CAN NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOSSES IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE FORGOTTEN BY FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD . WE MUST TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. WE MUST PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS . AND IN THAT SAME SPIRIT, WE MUST NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE CHEAPENED AS A CLICHC TO ADVANCE SOME LEFT-WING POLITICAL NARRATIVE . [APPLAUSE] BUT SADLY, SADLY IN RECENT WEEKS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE . LAST MONTH A LEADING DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS COMPARED OUR US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS . OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS , THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA SHAMEFULLY CAME TO HER DEFENSE . AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY MORNING ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS WAS ASKED IF THEY AGREED WITH COMPARING THE NOBLE AND COMPASSIONATE WORK DONE BY US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PERSONNEL DETENTION FACILITIES TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF NAZI GERMANY AND SHE ANSWERED ABSOLUTELY. TO COMPARE THE HUMANE WORK OF THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION WITH THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS AN OUTRAGE. THE NAZIS TOOK LIVES , AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS SLANDERED LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS AN INSULT TO THE 6 MILLION KILLED IN THE HOLOCAUST. AND IT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BY EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY POLITICAL PARTY EVERYWHERE. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND I WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND WE WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE SERVICE OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT , ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE ARE ACTUALLY ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO SEE NEARLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE, ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER . TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELL ADVERTISED LOOPHOLES IN AMERICA'S ASYLUM LAWS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COMING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER OUR FAMILIES. WITH VULNERABLE CHILDREN. ARE BEING ENTICED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND DRUG CARTELS TO PAY CASH TO MAKE THE LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY NORTH . AND IT'S A DANGEROUS JOURNEY. FRAUGHT OFTEN WITH UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE . 70 PERCENT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ONCE THEY PRESENT AT THE BORDER REPORT BEING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ALONG THE WAY. ACCORDING TO DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, NEARLY ONE THIRD OF YOUNG WOMEN TRAVELING TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE JOURNEY . OUR CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PERSONNEL DO COMPASSIONATE WORK TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MADE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY AND THEY PROVIDE THAT COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT EVERY DAY . UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ACROSS OUR BORDER ARE PROVIDED WITH FOOD, EDUCATION, CARE AND TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR DESTINATION CITY ALL TAXPAYER EXPENSE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKS TO PLACE THESE CHILDREN WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE FOSTER CARE. FAMILY UNITS WHO ARE KEPT IN ICE CUSTODY ARE SENT TO FAMILY RESIDENTIAL SECTORS WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE SHELTER AND CARE. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE FACILITIES ON OUR BORDER ARE OVERCROWDED. BECAUSE THEY'RE OVERWHELMED . SO THE LAST SIX MONTHS, DEMOCRATS DENIED THERE WAS EVEN A CRISIS ON OUR BORDER. THEY CALLED IT A MANUFACTURED CRISIS, REMEMBER THAT? AND IN SO DOING THEY DENY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE FAMILIES GOING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND AS I STAND HERE TODAY THEY CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES USED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS . TO EXPLOIT THOSE VULNERABLE FAMILIES. IN THE FACE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS PRESIDENT FROM GOOD STRONG. HE DEMANDED THAT MEXICO AND NOW MEXICO IS DOING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO SECURE THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER AND OURS . [APPLAUSE] AND JUST LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW A BIPARTISAN MEASURE PROVIDING 4.6 ALIEN DOLLARS IN HUMANITARIAN AID TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF HHS AND CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION . BUT YOU ALL DESERVE TO KNOW THE SAME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD THE GALL TO COMPARE OUR DETENTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS VOTED AGAINST PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE SAME FACILITIES THEY DENOUNCED . IN THE FACE OF THAT TYPE OF DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE . UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS. WE WILL PROVIDE COMPASSIONATE RELIEF TO VULNERABLE FAMILIES SWEPT UP IN THE CRISIS AND WE WILL FIX THIS BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL WE'VE REACHED A DECISIVE MOMENT IN HISTORY . SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE I BELIEVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. ALL OVER THE WORLD ANTI-SEMITISM IS ON THE RISE . WE SEE IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES , IN THE MARKETPLACE AND SADLY EVEN IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS . YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL WAS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE HERE IN WASHINGTON . I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY IN 2007 THAT I , A CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN WAS ASKED TO COFOUND THE CONGRESSIONAL ANTI-SEMITISM TASK FORCE WITH THE ONLY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR EVER TO SERVE IN CONGRESS , THE LAKE AND GREAT CONGRESSMAN TOM LAND HOUSE . [APPLAUSE] WE FORMED THAT TASK FORCE BECAUSE OF THE BROAD CONSENSUS THAT EXISTED IN THE CONGRESS THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS SUPPORT FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE BUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED . IT'S ASTONISHING TO THINK THAT THE PARTY OF HARRY TRUMAN WHICH DID SO MUCH TO HELP CREATE THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN CO-OPTED BY PEOPLE WHO PROMOTE RACK ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC. AND WORK TO UNDERMINE THE BROAD AMERICAN CONSENSUS OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. RECENTLY A FRESHMAN DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS TRAFFIC AND REPEATED ANTI-SEMITIC TROPES . WE ALL REMEMBER THEM. SHE ALLEGED THAT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL REFLECTED A ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY. SHE SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD AND I QUOTE, HYPNOTIZE THE WORLD. LET ME SAY THIS FROM THE HEART. ANTI-SEMITISM HAS NO PLACE IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THIS NATION. AND ANYONE WHO SLANDERS THE HISTORIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL SHOULD NOT BE SITTING ON A FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE MOST ASTONISHING OF ALL AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED , THE PARTY THAT HAS BEEN HOME TO SO MANY AMERICAN JEWS WERE SO LONG, RECENTLY EVEN MUSTER THE VOTES TO UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM IN OUR RESOLUTION. THAT'S WHY THE WORK OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY, CUFI IS BIGGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN CHRISTIANS UNITED WAS A GROUP OF A FEW HUNDRED BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIANS . LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU, THIS ORGANIZATION HAD GROWN TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION BELIEVERS . AND ON MY WAY OVER I WAS JUST TOLD CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL NOW HAS MORE THAN 6 MILLION MEMBERS. ALL ACROSS AMERICA. KAREN AND I HAVE SHE SAID 7 MILLION. IS A MOVEMENT THAT SPANS THIS NATION AND THE MOVEMENTS FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. [APPLAUSE] KERRY AND I HAVE ALWAYS TREASURED OUR RELATIONSHIPS AT CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL. WE WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF INDIANA . WITH YOUR STRONG SUPPORT I WAS PROUD TO SIGN THE TOUGHEST ANTI-BDS LEGISLATION OF ANY STATE IN AMERICA AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. BUT YOU DESERVE TO KNOW , REMARKABLY TODAY ALL BUT ONE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT VOTED AGAINST COMBATING BDS ACTS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SO LET ME GET THIS ONE MORE POINT. ANYONE WHO ASPIRES TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS STAND TOGETHER . BECAUSE AMERICA AND ISRAEL ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS . WE ARE MORE THAN ALLIES. THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL OUR FAMILY. DESCENDED FROM A COMMON TRADITION OF FAITH, WE'RE A FAMILY THAT UPHOLDS COMMON VALUES AND TOGETHER WE SHARE A COMMON DESTINY. YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH THIS YEAR, THAT BOND CAME INTO HIGH RELIEF. IN THE FACES OF TWO EXTRAORDINARY MEN , THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED TO THE NATION. ONE WAS A JEWISH AMERICAN HERO, SERGEANT AND LIKE IT, A VETERAN OF THE DAY AND THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE . TRULY A GREAT AMERICAN OF THE GREATEST GENERATION. YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH MARKED THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY AND WE WILL NEVER FAIL TO HONOR THAT HEROISM OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE GREATEST WAR. [APPLAUSE] BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, SITTING BESIDE SERGEANT CITED WAS JOSHUA KAUFMAN. SURVIVOR OF DACHAU. A REAL CONCENTRATION CAMP. SERGEANT DESIGNED TO HELP LIBERATE A YEAR AFTER D-DAY. THESE TWO MEN , MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES LATER WERE REUNITED THAT NIGHT. UNITED NOT JUST IN THEIR STORIES BUT IN OUR HISTORY , IN OUR CAUSE. OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE. 75 YEARS LATER, WITHOUT A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE , THEY STOOD TOGETHER IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES . AND IN THAT RELATIONSHIP, CULTURE AND UNBREAKABLE BOND . TO AMERICA AND ISRAEL. THE BOND THAT BRINGS YOU ALL HERE TODAY. IT WAS ULTIMATELY A BOND OF FAITH . I'M TOLD BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CAPITAL THAT THE PSYCHIC FAMILY AND KAUFMAN FAMILY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND HERMAN AND HIS BIBLE WITH HIM. THE BIBLE THAT HE HAD WHEN HE WAS IN SERVICE IN THE ARMY. THEY OPENED TOGETHER . AND THEY SAID PRAISE TO THE FAITHFUL GOD. [APPLAUSE] THAT BOND ENDURED THE HORRORS OF WAR , ENDURED THROUGH THE DECADES AND IT ALWAYS WILL. SO WHY ISRAEL?

Just compl eted october the first of two detention facili ties and this is very tough stu ff to see families that are swept up in th is crisis on our south ern borde r but I mu st tell you that different from what we hea r f rom many of the critic s. I couldn't be more impressed w ith the compassionate w ork that our cust oms and b order protec tion are doing here at this facility. This was a facility that was act ually constructed befo re DHS h ad the funding for it. And as you saw roug hly 1000 people are be ing detain ed here. Families are being detained . Every family tha t I spok e to told me that th ey were being well cared for an d different than so me of the hars h rheto ric th at we hear from d emocrats on Capitol Hill are customs and b order protection are d oing their level best to prov ide c omp assion ate care to these families in a manner The ameri can people wo uld expect. We a re in the center of the busiest po rt ion Of our 2000 mile borde r. And so wha t you are witnessing h ere and what we'r e going to witness at th e next fac ility is really w e're 60% of the people that ar e c oming across our borde r illegally or att empting to use loopholes in our laws are being apprehended. So we're g onna go to t he next facility. But I want to thank Senator Graham. I want to thank all the m embers of the Senate who have made this trip here to see for themselves. And now today the american peop le can see for themselves. President trump. Wan ted us to b e here and he wanted the cam eras to be here so th at you could see firsthan d how these families ar e being treate d and each and ev ery one o f the Children, each a nd every one of the pa rents that I spo ke t o told me they were being treate d well. One of the mothers just told me when I asked her, how are you being treated here? She said very good. Th at's wh at the american people expect. But t he american peop le also expec t us to ta ke the steps necessar y to end this crisis once and for all, that means border security. That means ask ing Mexico to do more as they are doing n ow. It mean s humani tarian aid to those swep t up in the crisis. B ut ultimately, as these s enators know, it will mean c hanging the laws of this country so that we clo se the loopholes that human t raffickers are u sing to entice vulnerable fam ilies like these to ma ke the long and dange rous journey nor th. To hea r small Children say T hat they walked for two a nd 3 month s to come to our border and come across illeg ally is heartbreaking to e very americ an and it's being driven by human traffickers and driven by the loopho les in our law that these senators are working hard to close and the president are truly grateful to each and every one of them. Because the real answer here is not more detention. The real answer here is to is to take away the tools that human traffickers are using to entice vulnerable family. But Senator Graham, I want to thank you and all the members of the Senate for coming here and seeing this for yourself. Only the only thing I can add is tha t everybody you s aw here to day will be rele ased into the U nited States In the next 20 day s, 90% of the people nev er show up for their he aring. It's a difficult journ ey to get here. Bu t as long as you come here An d you get rele ased within 20 days, they'll k eep coming.

Jim Briden stine, the gov ernor of florida, the honorable Ron DeSantis Ric k Armstrong. Son of Apollo 11 Comma nder Neil Arm strong the Apollo 1 1 lu nar mod ule. Pilot Buzz Aldr in. Well good a fternoon. I'm Ron de Santis gover nor of florida. It's an honor for me to b e here to commemorate uh what was rea lly one of the gr eatest achievem ents in the h istory of ou r country. Um whe n we put uh these men on the moon and Buzz uh thank you for all yo u've d one. You're a great her o. Thank you to the thanks to all t he members o f the Armstro ng family who have come and um you know th e saying of you know it was taking one s mall ste p for for one man being on the m oon represente d a giant leap for mankind. And I think t hat we have seen that over the yea rs. One just the fact that we did it After having said an audac ious goal less than 10 years ea rlier that we would put somebody on t he moon. A lot of peopl e didn't think tha t could be done. An d it's a testamen t to th e hard work of p eople like Buzz and Neil Ar mstrong, b ut also the United St ates being a free so ciety and being comm itted to do great things wa s able to achi eve that. And I thin k that was very v ery import ant. But also you l ook at what we no w know since t hen about the m oon, All the differ ent scientific discover ies just i n the last decad es. So many really neat things. Um and so I t hink it' s fitting that w e're here at Ken nedy Space Ce nter, not o nly to commemorate wha t happened 50 years ago, b ut also to recognize that tha t success has spawn ed really significan t developments right now in pr ivate industry. We se e it here with som e of the great companies and great entrep reneurs in the world, working hard to send mo re rockets into space. W e see it through the supp ort of the trump pe nce administ ratio n, which we in this com mun ity very much appreciate it. I want to a lso thank my friend Jim B ryd en Stein for re ally having a great vi sion as as the director of Nasa. So I'm excited to loo k back on that 50 years and wh at a great achievement it is. But I think the story of that is still being written because I think the things th at are gonna happ en um and the hopef ully relativel y near future are go ing to be really ones for the rec ord books and if these guys had not succeeded , you know, we may not be here being able to enjoy that today. And so it's my honor to introduce the director of the Kennedy Space center here in Nasa, which has just been such an iconic place for space robert cabana. Thank you Governor de Santis and thank you for your su pport for us h ere at KSC in t he spa ce coast. It's a rea l pleasure for me to have all of you here at the Kennedy space center during thi s historic wee k as we celebrate man's firs t s teps on the moon and to cont inue the con versation of that next giant leap that's goi ng to o riginate righ t here a t KSC. It's been 45 years si nce we last set f oot on the moon. And now our president ha s renewed the nat ion's focus on expandi ng humanity's presence beyond our home plane t. Working wit h U. S. Companies and international partn ers, Nasa will push the boundarie s of human exploration fo rward t o the mo on and on to MARS with the Art emis program. Na sa is building the i nfrastructure for expanding human exploration into the so lar system and the space laun ch sys tem. Rocket and Orion s pacecraft are the ba ckb one of our explorat ion plans. Along with the mode rniz ed space port here at KsC SLS and Orion r epresent the next era in space e xploration with unmatched capabil ities. The Orion space craft is built t o take humans f urther into s pace than we've ev er gone befor e. And wit h each mil estone we get that much closer to being fli ght ready. Orion is the safest most advanced space craft ever built and it w ill be flexib le and capab le enough to take us to a variety of destinations. Our part nershi p with Lockheed Martin is an integral p art of America's mo on. To MAr s explorat ion approach laid out by P residen t Trump Toda y, Lockheed Martin is bu ilding and pro cessing t he Orion spacec raft right here at KsC for upcomi ng Artem IS missions. It's my p leasure now to introduce an d welcome Marilyn Hewson Chairman, Presi dent and ceo of the Lo ckheed martin cor poration Maryla nd joined Lockheed Martin more than 35 years ago as an indu strial engineer Earlier t his year, time magazi ne identified her as one of the 100 most i nfluential p eople in the wo rld. She has serve d on se veral U. S. Governmen t advisory bodies, inclu ding a current appointment to the Nati onal Space Coun cil users advisory Group. Sh e's a fellow in the Royal Aeronautical Society and an associate f ellow in the American Insti tute of Aeronautics and astronautics. Maryland is a passiona te leader with a fervent com mitment to i nnovation in educatio n. Please join me in welcoming Maril yn Hewson. Tha nk you Mr. Vic e President Gover nor de Santis, members of Cong ress and other distinguishe d guests i s absol utely my honor to represent L ockheed martin today as we commemora te 50 Year Anni versary of Apollo 11. And I want to begin first by thanking the vice pr esident of the Unit ed States becau se he has wor ked tireles sly to help g overnm ent and ind ustry leaders to be em powe red to really focus on h ow we c an continue to lead i n space a s a nation and to continue the legacy of t he Apollo progra m. You know, the Apo llo 11 missi on was a launch ing pad for dec ades of le adershi p by our n ation in a ran ge of opportunit ies that we brought in terms o f of allowing us to have scientific dis covery and through t hat many scientific experime nts and op portunities that improved our our wa y of life. Bu t b eyond that it has i nspired so many And so many ge nerations since that time that has allow ed them to see w hat is po ssible in this final frontie r. So we are very proud of the opportunity to be here toda y to commemorate tha t lega cy that was left by those who partic ipated in Apollo 11. But since that histo ric achievemen t, we are now, as bob said very hon ored to be working with Nasa on many criti cal missions. But most importantly the n ext giant leap tha t we' re going to face an d that is taking h umans again to do t he moon. And we are very prou d to participat e in that with the Orion spacecr aft th at you can see o ver here with us today, o ne of tho se spac ecraft that will be in the next un screwed mission goi ng forward and th en we'll produce those that ar e moving forward today. I act ually have the d istinct privileg e o f introducing to y ou the indivi dual who' s gonna be responsible for implement ing t he administra tion's vision for the future of America and our endeavors in space. He began his career in federa l service with th e US N avy. He h onorably served as a p ilot on the USs Abrah am Lincoln and his experience i n the military and in ci vil ian life as a l eader h ave put him right up front and center to understa nd what w e fa ce in terms of the ne w space race, a ra ce that is very impor tant to our nation al security. A race that is very important to continue to advan ce sci entific discovery. So with that as I look at him and the leadership and the farsi ghtedness that he has that are so critica l to our american programs, I'm very plea sed to welcome to the s ta ge jim Bridenstine ti ene the administrator for Nasa. We ll as you know this is a wonde rful day, it's a da y of celebrat ion, not just from Nasa and the Uni ted States of Ame rica, but in fact for a ll of the world, I want t o thank Maryland for that great introduction and fo r your leadership. I know th is is as big a d ay for Lockheed m artin as it is for all of us. I also want to thank my go od frie nd Governor Rhonda Sa ntos, we were fre shman tog ether in the House of Rep resentatives. N ow you're leading this great state and I will tell you Rho nda Santis is a governo r who cares deeply ab out the Kennedy space center. He calls me from time to time to mak e sure I know how deeply he care s about this space center and just know that your gover nor is um doing g reat work on beh alf of the Kennedy spac e center. I also wan t to thank Repr esentative Scalise w ho is the minority whip and Representative Ad am Holt and I can see we have some some Nasa folks si tting over h ere by Represe ntative Adam Adam Holt know this, this is the g entleman who is the ra nking member on the committee that funds N asa so make sure you' re being rea lly nice to that gentleman ove r there also want to thank Repres entative posey who has spent a great deal of time with me in the house helping me understand the value of this center and of co urse he calls me f rom time to tim e to let me know what I s hould be doing do wn here so it's great to hav e Repre sentative po sey Representative Babin is the ra nking mem ber on the scie nce, the space subcommi ttee of the Scienc e commi ttee. He's a Texan and I wil l tell you he's h e he looks at space from an all of America approach and we're gratefu l for his se rvice in t hat in that rea lm. An d of course congressman mast and congressman waltz. These are two indivi duals w ho are keen on the nat ional secu rity aspect of space a nd who have been v ery helpful to us as an agenc y as we thi nk about the future and the str ategic presence of the Un ited States in space and of c ourse the most im portant person in the room mrs Karen Pence, thank you for cele brating w ith us today and of course there's somebody else t hat I will be intr oducing later. Um I also want to thank bo b cabana for helping t ransform this fac ility into a multi user spaceport. There was a day in the Un ited Stat es of America wh en the space s huttles were retir ing, the constellation program was being c anceled, bob caban a had a tough job to do here at the Kennedy s pace center and he has transformed it in a way that h as maintained the pre sence and now we have great news b ut in fact the ame ric an space program is coming back, it's coming back with a v engeance and I' ll be talking about that more i n a minute. But bob ca bana, You've d one a great job here an d we are so grate ful for your servic e. Most importantly , it is an orde r to have w ith us here. One of the men who first walked on the moon a half ce ntury a go, the legen dary the o ne and only Buzz Aldrin. I t is als o a pleasure to hav e Neil. Armstr ong son rick and grand son bryce w ith us here today, Rick and bryce. Thank you for helpin g us share Neil's legacy wit h the next g eneratio n of moonwalkers. And most importantly, thank you so much for sharing your dad and your grandda d, not just with the United St ates of A merica but the en tire world. We are gr ate ful for yo ur service as wel l. Landing m en on the moon was by far the hardest thing ever accomplishe d i n human history. It's be en calc ulated that for every hour Apol lo astronauts either fle w through space or walked on the surface of the moo n, approximately o ne million w ork hours on earth were ne eded. No othe r collective project, Not the pyrami ds nor the Panama Canal e ven came close. Although when I first s tarted r eading th is, I was wondering h ow they knew abou t the pyramids because that was 10,0 00 year s ago. B ut that's wha t peo ple say In a ll over 400,000 NASA empl oyees and con tractors From over 20,000 busines ses worked night a nd day to fulfill P resident John F. Kenne dy's visi on. Not just o nce, but six times. And les t we forget Wh at were we tryin g to do in the 1960s , this was a contest of great powers, the Unite d States of Ame rica against the soviet Union and i t was ab out tech nological prowess fo r sure. But more importantly it was about demon strating that our politi cal and econom ic system was superior to t hat of the s oviet union at th e time. And when Bu zz Aldrin a nd Neil armst rong walked on the moon, we were able to demo nstrate america n greatness despi te the intens ity of the space ra ce Neil Arm strong, Buzz Aldrin and M ichael C ollins Designed th e Ap ollo 11 p atch to represent th e intenti ons of Am erica an d the hopes of NASA. The pat ch depicts an eagl e landing on t he moon with an olive branch in its talons convey ing a m ission of peace rather than a mission of conques t. The bible says that one day the nations o f the world will learn war no more and quote, beat the ir swords i nto plowshares and their spears into pruni ng hooks, unquote. in fact, soon af ter Apollo 11 , the United States par tnered w ith the s oviet Union on wha t became th e Apollo Soyuz pro gram.

They continued to best ow benefit s on modern so ciety even today. Howev er, not all ad ministrations in the past had the vision n ecessary to advance humanity fur ther into the solar sys tem. And I know t his re gion of the United S tate s, the Space Coast in pa rticular fe lt it very hard wh en th e space shuttles we re retired and th e constellation prog ram was canceled . However, today, Similar to the 196 0s, we to o have an oppo rt unity to take a gi ant leap forw ard for al l of humanity. Presi dent trump and Vice President Pence have g iven us a b old direction as an agenc y to retu rn to the m oon within f ive y ears an d go fo rward to mar s their di rection is not simply empt y rhetoric.

But in the Artemis prog ra m we go to the mo on sustai nably and this time w e have a very dive rse, highly qua lified astron aut corps t hat includes women and in greek myt hology. Artemis happens to be the twin sister of Apollo and she's the goddess of the moon. So this time when we go to the moon, we in fact go with all of America After the 1969 Moon Landing. Armstrong Aldrin and Collins Signed a silkscreen patch Florida flown aboard Apollo 11. This is an interesting story and I don't think it's told enough. It's an interesting story. They flew on Apollo 11 a silk screen patch and presented it to Nasa for safe safekeeping for the future. The inscription on the patch reads quote, carried to the moon aboard Apollo 11 presented To the Mars one crew, unquote looking forward into the future. It is only appropriate that a patch which witnessed humanity's first giant leap should be there for its second giant leap. And with the legacy of Apollo and the leadership of President trump and Vice President Pence Nasa's future mission to MARS is fast approaching.

And I've been looki ng forward to thi s day, but all ow me to brin g greetings from another great space enthusias t and a great champi on of america n leadership in space . I begin today by brin ging greeting s from the 45th pr esident o f the United States of America. President Donald Trump today. Our nation pays t rib ute to th ree brave astronauts who s at atop a 360 ft rocket that lifted off from pad 39 a 50 years ago th is week, two o f whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pa y tribute to th e nearly 4 00,000 America ns, engineers, t echnicians, d esigners, whose sacrifices and d edication made it possible f or Apollo 11 to compl ete what anoth er president cal led the most hazard ous and dan gerous and gr eatest adve nture upon which mankind has ever embarke d. Let's hear it for all those who suppo rt it. These three brave astronauts. 50 years ago, When President Ken nedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a m an o n the moon and return him safe ly to the earth befo re the decade was out. It' s important t o re member that our co un try was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have th e rockets or the launch pads or the space suits or th e lander. We h adn't even invented man y of the materials or tools that we w ould need. Not only di d we not ha ve what we n eeded, we d idn't even know wha t we need ed, but President Ken nedy summa rized t hat epic endeavor in one simpl e sentence. We choose to go to the moon and ma ke no mistake about it. The moon was a choice . An american choice. And lik e every time the am erican peop le make up thei r mind, once that decisio n was made, american ingenu ity, grit and determination, th e achievement was i nevitable. The only ch allenges that rema in were cha llenges of engine ering and science . The moon didn't come ea sil y a nd it didn't come w ithout costs an d it did not come w ithout grave danger or without sacrifice. T o this day, Americ ans grieve. The loss of th ree brave as tron auts of Apollo one Who we re lost in a f ire on the launchpa d in January of 19 67. And we thin k of them and t heir families. Even today, The risks for Apollo 11 w ere so great. The odds were s o long that m any fear that even if our as tronauts made it to the moon, they m ight not make i t back. In fact history re cords that President N ixon prepared a spe ech in the eve nt of tragedy wh ere he would expl ain to the nation t hat the mission had failed. But of course the mission didn 't fail Af ter all. With 400,000 men and w omen behind the mission at NA SA and with t he hearts and pr ayers of the American people, how could it fail? And at th e contr ols of the Apollo 11 l unar module known a s Eagle S tood. two Great A mericans. Miss ion Commander N eil Armstrong and a man who is with us tod ay, lunar mo dule. pilot Buzz Ald rin. And c ircli ng overhead in lu nar orbit was Comm and module P ilot Michael Co llins just picture it 50 y ears ag o today. At almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfw ay into their pow ered descent on the fi nal leg of thei r landing on the moo n. There they were standing beside one another in a caps ule not much bigger th an a couple of telephon e boot hs, j ust minutes from touchdown. They thought they were r eady for every conti nge ncy after a ll. As Buzz t old me just a few day s ago, they ha d spen t two years intensive ly tra ining for this moment and th ey'd run almost 600 simul ated landings. All desi gned to be more difficult than the real thing. Eag le had just finis hed its roll over to position i tself for final approach. When al l of a sudden Neil A rms tro ng calle d out to Houston That Eagle had a 1202 alarm. The problem w as Nobody on boa rd or in Houston had any idea w hat a 1202 alarm was. Eagle's flight comput er was over loading. Not onl y could the y not s ee the moon out th eir windows, they they could n't know for certain how f ar they were f rom the surface, N ot a good way to fly an d y et h ow calm they were wo rking with the team ba ck here on Earth. They quickly res olve the pr oblem without betraying the slightes t anxiety. Peop le all over the wor ld were wa tching with no idea that a nything had gon e w rong, that my friends is what they used to call the r ight stuff. You k now, there's a r eason Neil Armstrong as well wa s called the Ice Commande r in his d ay when the origin al landing area tu rned out to b e so full of large boulders. That la ndi ng there woul d have doomed the mission. And the crew history recor ds that Neil A rmstrong calmly took con trol of th e lunar module, skimmed alon g the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe pl ace to touch dow n. And by the time h e fo und a safe spot, known t o all of us as t ranquility b ase, Armstrong a nd Aldrin had only 17 sec onds of fuel rema inin g. Like every one of m y generation. I remember tha t day 600 mill ion people around the w orld were watchi ng their TVs a nd listening to th eir r ad ios, waiting with a dmiration, anxiety and wond er. And I was on e of them, a little boy si tting in front of our black and w hite television in the bas ement of our hom e in indiana. Wh en tho se fir st snowy images of Ne il Armstro ng stepping off the bot tom, rung of the ladder, beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. On sunda y july 20t h 196 9 they made a n i ndeli ble mark . Not ju st on my imag ination , but on the ima gination of my genera tion and every ge neration to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that upon hearing Ne il Armstro ng's first call f rom t ran quility Base. Even the era' s gre atest newsman walter. C ronkite co uld only shake h is head and utter two words, O h boy! A ll at once, the nati on held its breath a s through the crackli ng broadcast we listen ed to. We hear d Neil Armstr on g use t hose immortal wor ds. Th at's one sm all step for man . One gian t leap for mankind. In that moment, The man of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of creation and they did more than win the space race. They brought together our nation And for one brief moment all the people of the world were truly now true to their creed. Astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes yet. For all they did for all the risks they took. If Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. They were heroes can stand up . We honor the men of Apollo 11 by rememb ering thei r epic voyage and telling thei r sto ry. But we also ho nor them by continu ing the work they so nobly an d courag eously adva nced in American space explora tion. Apollo 11 was f ollowed by five more successful moon missions, culminatin g in th e final h ist oric journey o f Apollo 17, Ame ri ca's last trip to the moon. As w e honor our Apoll o 11 astronauts. We are a lso honored t oday to be joine d by Apollo 17, Astronaut Harrison Schmitt, thank as Harriso n and I have discuss ed about his missi on. While the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well known as the fi rst words his fello w astronaut, Gene Cernan said more perha ps than anyone could have k nown a t the time. It's a challenge to our time. A s he stepped off the m oon On December 17 , 1972. Ge ne, he sa id these w ords and I quote as I take man 's last steps o n the moon for some tim e to come, History wil l record tha t America's challen ge of today has forged man' s destiny of tomorrow and then he ended by sa ying, we l eave t he m oon as we came an d God willin g, we shal l soon return with pe ace a nd hope for all mankind. Th ose were wo rds of challen ge in 1972. And i n our time as president trump said, this genera tion of america ns know is tha t it is Americ a's destiny to be the leader a mongst nations on our ad venture into the great unknown and standing before y ou today, I am pro ud t o repo rt at the d irecti on of the Pre siden t of the Uni ted States of Ame rica. Am erica will re turn to the moon withi n the next five years and the nex t man and the first woman on t he moon will be american as tronauts. We'r e going back A fter more th an 45 yea rs where one adm inistra tion aft er an other chose to limit Am erica's space progra m to low Earth or bit. Pr esident donald t has changed all th at early in this adminis tration. T he Presiden t revived the Nat ional Space Council within the White House to coordin ate all s pace relate d activities across the gover nment, including ma tters relate d to nati onal security and we've been h ard at work. T he Space Co unc il has helped bring together skilled lea ders in busine ss and industry to re vive and renew A merica's commitme nt to hu man space explorati on. And I'm ple ased that many me mbers of o ur user advisor y group for the S pace Council are w ith us today for this histo ric occasion, join me in welcom ing these dedicated and distin guished americans. President Trump also signe d space policy directive one challenging Nasa to lead the return o f americans to the moon, send the fir st americans to mars and en able humans t o expand and deepen our rea ch across th e solar sy stem. It is our miss ion. And as I speak to you today, I'm pro ud to report, we're i nvesting in n ew rocke ts, new spaces hips. We're w orking with priva te companies around this country to develop the new te chnologies of the fut ure. B y unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center in this nation. And within the next year we will once again send american astronauts into space on american rockets from american soil already. We've given our hum an explorat ion missions a ne wfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a ge neration. Last year, Nasa a nd american inno vators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gat eway and the lun ar surface base, all of which we will ne ed to suppo rt american s on the mo on and to train and prep are to send am ericans to mars and w hile we've made great st rides in advancing the president's b old vision for space. Unlike in years pa st we will have the bud gets to match it. That's why I'm especially grat eful toda y to be joi ned by some of the g reatest champio ns of american leade rship in space . In the Congress of the Unit ed States House minority whi p steve Sca lise Congres sman rober t Aderholt, congressman brian Bab in, congressman, Bill Pose y and other di stinguished m embers of Congre ss. Would you p lease r ise and allow us to express o ur a ppreciation for y our strong support of r enewed american lea dership With st rong bipartisan s upport. This president alread y signed into law t he largest Nasa budget e ver. And on th is historic occasion, I'm t old th at we've als o achieved a critic al milesto ne i n our effort to go to th e moon and beyo nd today. Thanks to the hard work of t he men of Nasa men a nd women o f Nasa an d and of american in dustry. The Orio n cre w vehi cle for the A rtemis. One mission is com plete and r eady to begin preparations f or its historic f irst flight in the coming years. Amer ican astronauts will return t o the moon a board th e Orion and they'll return with new a mbitions. We w ill spend weeks and months, n ot days and ho urs on the lun ar surface. This time we'r e going to the moon to st ay and to e xplore and develop new technologies, we will extract water from ic e in the perm anently shadow ed crater s of the So uth Pole. We will fl y on a ne w generation of spacecraft th at will enab le us to r each MAr s, n ot in years, but i n months. A mericans are leadi ng in space once again. An d today we're reminde d, we're reminded ho w ameri can leadership 50 ye ars ago, The accom plishment of Ap ollo 11 inspired o ur nation . Mr Preside nt said it i gnited our sense of ad venture and steeled our belief that no dream is impossible. No matter how lof ty o r chall enging. And as Buzz A ldrin said today in his words, look ing back on landing on the moon wasn' t j ust our job, it was a historic oppor tunity to prove to the worl d America 's can do spirit. So as we l ead in hu man space e xploration again, we'll car ry not only Ame ri can ingenuity and prid e, but most importa ntly will carry A meri ca's ide als into th e vast expanse of space, ideals of free dom and liberty . Apollo 11 is t he only event in the 20th century that sta nds a chanc e of being widely re member ed in the 3 0th cent ury, 1000 years from now, July 20 , 1969 will likel y be a date that will live in the m inds and im aginations of men and women . As long as there are men and w omen to remember acro ss this wor ld across this so lar sys tem and beyond. S o today We rem ember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that suppo rted them in t heir missi on Some 400,00 0 Americans. But today we also reaff irm our commitment t o unlock the mysteries of space and to lead. And as we continue on t his amer ican journey, we go with the same res olve a nd de termination of those who ha ve gone before. A nd we go with fa ith, faith in the c ourage of this n ew generation of astronauts, men an d women of the ch aracter and cal iber of those who have gone befor e. They are re markable p ioneers wh o will carry americ an l eadership into spac e, faith in the ingen uity of the men and women of Nasa and all of tho se across the ameri can space enterprise whose cre ativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match th at of thei r forebears who created a nd invented new w ays to explore and exp and human understan ding with america n leadership. And fi nally, I believ e as we go fo rward and millions of america ns believe in their hearts and have thr oughou t the generation s that will go forward with faith, that as those pioneer s p ut on the spacesuits climb abo ard the rockets. T hat wi ll believe that even if t hey rise on the win gs of the dawn, even if they go up t o th e heavens, that eve n there his han d will guide them. His right hand wil l hold him fast a nd that'll be o ur prayer. Tod ay, we mar k the 50th anni versary of Apollo 11 , we celebrate the he roic astronau ts who accompli she d that extraordina ry feat in human h istory and all those who supp orted them. And today we re solve for the sake of all they accomplished that America will lead in space once again and this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless The crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation pioneers and all who will support them. May God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you m m. Y eah. Oka y. Mhm. Mhm . Y eah. Mhm. Mh m. O kay. Yeah. Mhm . W hat? Mh m. T han k yo u mm . M hm. M hm. Mhm. But I, mm. Oka y.

You know it's bee n said to m e by a couple. Who have hea rd that there was a electrician sho wing up to a law yers house to do wo rk on the home I guess the y had h ad some problems work for a half ho ur hands a lawyer a bill all the way o r looked at the bill and says Oh I'm a lawyer I don't even Bill t his much you know for when I do billable hours and the electrician said oh yea h I know when I was a l awyer we didn't c harge as I didn't cha rge that much either and so but I think the po int is is that y ou know you lo ok at what . Are availabl e places like Mi ller and you know the voc ational skills not only pr ovide a pathway for peop le to have had jobs but really hav e jobs yo u know t hat can po tentia lly pay prett y dogg one good and if you look across the spe ctrum voc ational fields s killed labor fields a lot of times if you do that a nd you get the skill s you can do a lot better than some of the p eople who have gotten rea lly deep into debt trying to g et you know the deg ree that ever yone said they have to do and don't und erstand I mean I' m supportive of our universities and doing that but there's more than one way to succeed and so in Florida what we want to do is look at examples like Mi ller and c ontinue to pla ce a greater emphasis on v ocational edu cation appr entices hip programs we'v e got a lot of mon ey to do t hat more than ever and that include s vocational educat ion and high scho ols you can you do need skills beyond hig h school to succeed but a 4 ye ar break in Ivy university i s not the only way to get it and may not eve n be the best way for many people and people that pursue these fields you know dese rve every bit as much credi t as people that deserve that. Pursue more acade mic purs uits and so a s governor I want to continue to provide p athways for folks we like what's goi ng on here a nd we think t hat that there's more oppor tunities for th at so stay tuned W e've Only Just B egun what we' re going to do but I think it's g oing to be grea t and it's fitting given what w e just did in the leg islative session that w e h ave of Onka Trump here because she has really mad e these skill s a priority s he stressed appre nticeship s and I think they've set a lot of targets with a lot o f differe nt busin ess says and you kno w the read the response has been phenomenal and so I want to thank her for coming to Florida again and I want to thank her for all she's doing so it's my honor to bring up. Trump to say a few things here. how are you . Th is is an unbelievable faci lity and I act ually hold a very specia l place in my h eart for Mille r electric as he was o ne of the 1 st companies to sign our pledge to Ameri ca's workers which is about what the gove rnor was just talking about pa thways to opportu nit ies for all Am ericans and our piping hot economy with u nemployment rates at the lo west level the y've been i n near ly half a centu ry 3.7 percent ac ross the na tion with p retty much e very demographic experiencin g histor ically low u nemployment and the f act tha t for the 1st tim e in the history of this country there are more j ob vacancies than unemployed Americans we feel th at it's never b een a better time to se cure a great j ob and to learn the tool s and skills to to achieve yo ur dream and we've seen that evidence by man y of the p eople stan ding here tod ay and we got to meet w ith our earlier w ho are in Ba rking on an incred ible pathwa y in the e lectrical field so we a pplaud you and i t's very ver y exciting that Mille r e lectric w as one of the 1st companies to sign our pledge and c ommit to training a nd rescaling 250 American s and based on what I sa w toda y I thin k th at nu mber w ill go up this is booming so your great c.e. o. Henry told me that in the last 18 months since tax cut s based on tha t and all the other po licies that are bei ng rolled out t o suppo rt t he economic ag enda that this administ ration deregulati on and all of the other things that w e'r e doing to ens ure a robust economy that you have hir ed here over what is a 30300 p eople in 18 mont hs so that is exactly what we want to see and I think tha t's. A really bea utiful segue into into w hat we here toda y celebrati ng which is job creation and opp ortunity and pathways to tha t opport unity so just yest erday I was at the White Hou se with the preside nt and vice p res ident who will be up on stage in j ust a few minutes who has been an un believable champion both. In Washi ngton d.c. and during his time this go vernm ent governor for wo rkforce a nd vocati onal educat ion but we were in Was hington and we we re celebrating th e one year anniversary of this p ledge we st arted and we had sort of aggressive goals we were goi ng to try and secure 402 500 000 commitmen ts from the private sec tor all year l ater 300 companies of which this i s one have comm itted to over 1 2000000 job training opp ortunities f or Americans across th e nation s o we're incredibly excite d and we just thank y ou for hosting us here it's amazing to see the great work t hat you're doing and it r eally is a testament to.

CSPANMP19201945	Mike Pence	2019-09-01	Vice President Pence Remarks at World War II 80th Anniversary Event	MIKE PENCE SPOKE YESTERDAY AT AN EVENT IN WARSAW, POLAND COMMEMORATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF WORLD WAR II. THIS IS JUST UNDER 20 MINUTES. PRESIDENT DUDA, PRESIDENT STEINMEYER, OTHER PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS AND HEADS OF STATE, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND MOST OF ALL, THE NOBLE CITIZENS OF POLAND, IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE. ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT AND UNITED STATES AND ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO MARK THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY ON THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR II. TWO YEARS AGO, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CAME TO THIS VERY CITY AND SPOKE OF THE REMARKABLE BOND BETWEEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF POLAND, SAYING IN HIS WORDS, AMERICA LOVES POLAND AND AMERICA LOVES THE POLISH PEOPLE. TODAY, AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO STAND HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, A POLAND THAT IS SAFE, STRONG AND FREE. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, THE STORY OF POLAND IS THE STORY OF PEOPLE WHO NEVER LOST HOPE, NEVER BEEN BROKEN AND NEVER FORGOTTEN WHO THEY ARE AND TODAY IN THE HEART OF WARSAW, STANDING HUMBLY BEFORE THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER, WE HAVE GATHERED TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE COURAGE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE, THE SPIRIT OF A GREAT NATION AND THE PROFOUND AND LASTING STRENGTH OF A GREAT CIVILIZATION. WHILE THE HEARTS OF EVERY AMERICAN ARE WITH OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IN THE PATH OF A MASSIVE STORM, TODAY WE REMEMBER HOW THE GATHERING STORM OF THE 20TH CENTURY BROKE INTO WARFARE AND INVASION, FOLLOWED BY UNSPEAKABLE HARDSHIP AND HEROISM OF THE POLISH PEOPLE. DURING THE DECADES OF UNTOLD STRUGGLE AND SUFFERING THAT FOLLOWED THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR II, THE POLISH PEOPLE NEVER LOST HOPE. YOU NEVER GAVE IN TO DESPAIR AND YOU NEVER LET GO OF YOUR 1000 YEAR HISTORY. IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOW THIS DAY, YOUR LIGHT SHONE IN THE DARKNESS AND THE DARKNESS DID NOT OVERCOME IT. THE CHARACTER, FAITH AND DETERMINATION OF THE POLISH PEOPLE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. IT WOULD, IN TIME, TURN SHATTERING DEFEAT INTO GLORIOUS VICTORY. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ANY OF US [INAUDIBLE] THE HORRORS THAT BEGAN 80 YEARS AGO. WITHIN WEEKS, THE ARMIES OF NAZI GERMANY AND SOVIET DIVIDED THIS COUNTRY INTO OCCUPATION ZONES. THE NAZI LEADER ISSUED THE COMMAND FOR THE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMY AND ORDERED THE MERCILESS COMPASSION DEATH OF POLISH MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THOSE DUAL INVASIONS MARKED A CONFLICT UNLIKE ANYTHING THE WORLD HAD KNOWN BEFORE. AND, ONE WE RESOLVE HERE TODAY, THE WORLD WILL NEVER LOW , NEVER KNOW AGAIN. IN JUST OVER FOUR YEARS, ONE IN FIVE POLISH CITIZENS WOULD BE MURDERED AT THE HANDS OF THE EVIL IDEOLOGY BENT ON AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THE NAZIS SYSTEMATICALLY MURDERED COLONS , POLANDS. TENS OF THOUSANDS WOULD BE KILLED. OVER 21,000 SONS AND DAUGHTERS WERE MASSACRED AT THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS IN APRIL 1940 AND BURIED IN MASS GRAVES. RIGHT HERE IN THE CITY, MORE THAN 150,000 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN GAVE THEIR LIVES IN JUST NINE WEEKS OF THE WARSAW UPRISING. AND UPRISING WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DELIBERATE AND TOTAL DISRUPTION , DESTRUCTION OF THE CITY WHILE SOVIET FORCES STOOD BY AND ALLOWED THE SLAUGHTER. THOSE WHO ROSE UP DIED FIGHTING TO LIBERATE THESE BLOODSTAINED STREETS FROM FASCISM, DECATUR SHIP FROM COMMUNISM. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TWO YEARS AGO, THERE IS A COURAGE AND STRENGTH DEEP IN THE POLISH CHARACTER THAT NO ONE COULD DESTROY. TODAY, WE REMEMBER THE LONG ROLL CALL OF POLISH HEROES, THEIR NAMES AND THE MEMORY OF THEIR HEROISM WILL BE ENSHRINED IN THE HEARTS OF THEIR PEOPLE AND FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE FOREVER. THE LONG AND TERRIBLE WAR STARTED HERE IN POLAND, BUT BEFORE LONG, THAT DEATH STRUGGLE INVOLVED AND COMPELLED THE EXTRAORDINARY SACRIFICE OF REAGAN'S AND THE NATION ACROSS THE WORLD. TODAY, WE ALSO REMEMBER THE 16 MILLION AMERICANS WHO LEFT THE PEACE AND COMFORT OF THEIR HOME TO LIBERATE EUROPE AND STOOD AGAINST EVIL AND OVER 400,000 YOUNG AMERICANS [INAUDIBLE] FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLES OF NATIONS THEY DID NOT KNOW. TODAY, I REMEMBER MY COUNTRYMEN AND THEIR SACRIFICES WITH HONOR AND GRATITUDE. TODAY, WE REMEMBER THE CITIZENS WHO SERVED AND SACRIFICED TO SAVE EUROPE. WE RECALL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE FRENCH, THE DUTCH, THE CHECKS , CZECHS, GREEKS AND ROMANIANS AND OTHERS. THEY DEMONSTRATED A SELFLESSNESS THAT WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THE AGES. NONE FOUGHT WITH MORE VALOR AND DETERMINATION THAN THE POLLS , POLS. IN THEIR DECADES LONG STRUGGLE, POLAND PROVED ITSELF A HOMELAND OF HEROES. AS WE REMEMBER THE WAR THAT BEGAN HERE DECADES AGO, WE DO WELL TO PAUSE AND REFLECT ON THE CAUSES OF [INDISCERNIBLE] THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TWISTED IDEOLOGIES OF NAZI-ISM AND COMMUNISM REFLECTED THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD AND EVIL. THEY WERE DRIVEN BY AN H IT AND WE COULD URGE , ANCIENT AND WE COULD URGE AND IMPOSE THEIR WILL TO CONTROL THE LIVES OF AIR , ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN. ALL MORALITY BECAME SOCIALIST MORALITY. WHEN WE THINK OF THE DEPRAVITY OF TOTALITARIANISM, CONCENTRATION CAMPS, THE SECRET POLICE, STATE PROPAGANDA, THE DESTRUCTION OF CHURCHES AND ENDLESS HOSTILITY TO PEOPLE OF FAITH, ONE CANNOT HELP BUT THINK OF THE WORDS OF ANOTHER WHO LIVED UNDER SOVIET TOTALITARIANISM. PONDERING THE RUINOUS TIMES AND I QUOTE, IF I WERE CALLED UPON TO IDENTIFY THE PRINCIPAL TRADE OF THE ENTIRE 20TH CENTURY, I WOULD BE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING MORE PRECISE THAN THIS. MEN HAVE FORGOTTEN GOD. THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO REMAKE THE WORLD BY FORCE THE NOT HAVE THE LAST WORD. THERE WAS SOMETHING GREATER AT WORK. THROUGH THE BRUTALITY OF WAR AND THROUGH FOUR DECADES OF COMMUNIST RULE, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TWO YEARS AGO, POLAND AND THE OTHER NATIONS HAVE ENDURED A CAMPAIGN TO DEMOLISH THEIR FREEDOM, MALLS, HISTORY, IDENTITY AND FAITH. YET, YOU NEVER LOST THAT SPIRIT. YOUR OPPRESSORS TRIED TO BREAK YOU, BUT POLAND COULD NOT BE BROKEN. IN JUNE 1979, ONE OF POLAND'S GREATEST SONS RETURNED HOME. HISTORY RECORDS THAT IN THIS VERY SQUARE, HE PREACHED THAT THE POLISH PEOPLE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR HISTORY OR THEIR FUTURE, APART FROM THE GREATEST SOURCE OF THEIR STRENGTH. THE HOLY FATHER'S VISIT CAUSE A REVOLUTION , CAUSED A REVOLUTION OF CONSCIENCE. THE MOMENTUM OF THOSE NINE DAYS WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL IN 1989 IN THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION IN 1991. ON THAT DAY IN THIS PLACE, POPE JOHN PAUL II DEAD THAT MAN CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHO HE IS OR WHAT HIS TRUE DIGNITY IS FOR WHAT HIS VOCATION IS, NOR WHAT HIS FINAL END IS. WITHOUT CHRIST. WHEN THE HOLY FATHER SPOKE THOSE WORDS, THE MILLIONS OF POLES GATHERED HERE SPOKE FOR THEIR NATION AND THEIR HISTORY, LIFTING THEIR VOICES, THEY SAYING , THEY SANG WE WANT GOD AND THEIR HORSES ECHOED AROUND THE NATION AND THE WORLD. A MEMORIAL TO HONOR THAT HISTORIC MOMENT STANDS BEFORE US TODAY, JUST OPPOSITE THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER. IT IS A SYMBOL OF POLISH SPACE , SPACE , SP-POLISH FAITH. IT IS A TESTIMONY TO THE TRUE SOLIDARITY OF PEOPLE AMONG NATIONS IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN THAT SOLIDARITY IS SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF A PROVIDENTIAL CREATOR. TODAY, WE ARE GATHERED AS FRIENDS, ALLIES. FOR MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES, REPRESENTATIVES OF FREEDOM AND LOVING NATIONS. TODAY, THE FATE OF OUR PEOPLE IS SHARED BY FREEDOM AND SELF-DETERMINATION. LET US RESOLVE THAT THE WORDS IN THIS SQUARE THAT UNRAVELED THAT LONG NIGHT OF DEPRESSION, NOT JUST FOR THE PEOPLE OF POLAND, BUT ALL ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE. LET US RESOLVE THAT THOSE WORDS THAT HAVE SUSTAINED FROM THE BEGINNING WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. [NO AUDIO] [INAUDIBLE] AMERICA AND POLAND WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON OUR ALLIES TO LIVE UP TO THE PROMISES WE MADE TO ONE ANOTHER FOR THE AMERICAN AND POLISH PEOPLE KNOW THAT A STRONG ALLIANCE OF FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATIONS IS THE BEST DEFENSE. [NO AUDIO] TODAY, WE REMEMBER THOSE THAT WERE LOST AND THEIR LONG STRUGGLE. FOUR GOALS , FOR ALL THOSE WHO SACRIFICED HERE TO WIN A VICTORY. WE REMEMBER THOSE THAT WERE LOST ON THIS DAY AND WE ALSO DO WELL TO CELEBRATE AN ENDURING VICTIM FOR FREEDOM AND THE ROLE THAT THE PEOPLE IN POLAND PLAY BY THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR EXAMPLE . AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HERE TWO YEARS AGO, AMERICA NEVER GAVE UP ON THE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE POLISH PEOPLE AND WE NEVER WILL. [APPLAUSE] ON THIS OCCASION, IF ANY SHOULD DOUBT THAT THE DESTINY OF MANKIND IS FREEDOM, LET THEM LOOK TO POLAND, TO THE COURAGEOUS PEOPLE AND SEE THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE, A FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE STANDING ON A FOUNDATION OF FAITH. THEIR DECADES LONG STRUGGLE, THEIR COURAGE AND FAITH SHONE FORTH. THOUGH IT MAY TAKE DECADES, WHERE THE SPIRIT OR THE WARRIORS , LORD IS, THERE IS FREEDOM. HAVING PAID TRIBUTE TO THE PAST, WE NOW LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND WITH THE INSPIRATION, COURAGE AND RESOLVE OF THE POLISH PEOPLE FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, I CAN ASSURE YOU THE POLAND, AMERICA AND ALL FREEDOM LOVING NATIONS IN THE WORLD WILL MEET THAT FUTURE TOGETHER. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS POLAND AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?463864-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-world-war-ii-80th-anniversary-event	Vice President Pence delivered remarks at an event in Warsaw, Poland, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II.

CSPANMP39201949	Mike Pence	2019-09-03	Vice President Pence Speaks to Reporters in Dublin, Ireland	HEY, EVERYBODY. V.P PENCE: THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, IT IS AN HONOR TO BE AT THE AT AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. WE JUST FINISH A GOOD MEETING WITH BUSINESS LEADERS OF COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN IRELAND, AND ACTUALLY ORIGINATE YEAR, AND IT IS TRULY REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THAT TRADING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. AMERICAN COMPANIES ACTUALLY SUPPORT OVER 100,000 JOBS HERE IN IRELAND, BUT IRISH COMPANIES SUSTAIN MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, EVIDENCE OF A ROBUST TRADING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED MY MEETING TODAY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICAN EXPORTS INTO IRELAND. THE REALITY IS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS GROWING WHILE THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME WEAKNESS. THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS SOARING, OUR STOCK MARKET IS SOARING, 6 MILLION NEW JOBS CREATED, UNEMPLOYMENT AT 850-YEAR LOW, WAGES RISING AT THEIR FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN A DECADE. EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ONCE TO DO MORE BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES. I MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO DIRECT VARADKAR TODAY THAT WE ARE ANXIOUS TO BUILD OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON BREXIT AND THE UNITED STATES'S COMMITMENT AFTER BREXIT IS COMPLETED TO NEGOTIATING A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.K., BUT I TOLD THE LEADER OF IRELAND TODAY THAT WE ARE ALSO EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO HAVE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EXPAND TRADING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE PROSPERITY FOR ALL OUR COUNTRIES. THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT BROAD RANGE OF SECURITY ISSUES, INCLUDING HUAWEI. WE HAD A FRANK CONVERSATION WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ABOUT OUR CONCERNS THAT A CHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED BY CHINESE LAW TO GIVE THEIR GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO ANY DATE THAT THEY ACQUIRED, WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO OUR ECONOMIES, EVEN ON ACCESS TO THE SECURITY IN THE LAST. I WAS GRATEFUL THAT PRIMIE MINISTER VARADKAR INFORMED ME THAT THERE WERE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE HUAWEI ISSUE AND APPRECIATED HEARING FROM ME ON THAT. FINALLY ON THE SUBJECT OF BREXIT, LIMITED CLEAR THAT THE U.S. SUPPORTS THE UK'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE AU BEST TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT BEING SAID, WE RECOGNIZE IRELAND HAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE NORTHERN BORDER, AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN ENSURING THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT THAT THE U.S. HELPED TO BROKER MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO IS PRESERVED, BUT I DID ENCOURAGE PRIMIE MINISTER TO CONVEY OUR UNIQUE CHALLENGES, AND ENCOURAGE THE E.U. TO COME TO THE TABLE. I WILL BE MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER BORRIS JOHNSON, AND HE MADE VERY CLEAR YESTERDAY THAT HE IS DETERMINED TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE E.U., BUT I ENCOURAGE HIM TO CARRY THE MESSAGE OF IRELAND'S UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO OUR OTHER ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE E.U., AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH, AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL PARTIES TO ACHIEVE A BREXIT THE OWNERS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, BUT AT THE SAME TIME AVOID ANY AND THE SIRI DISRUPTION OF COMMERCE. THAT SAID , ANY UNNECESSARY DISRUPTION OF COMMERCE. THAT SAID, I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. IF BREXIT RESULTS IN A HARD BORDER, TO THE U.S. SEES THAT AS A VIOLATION OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT, AND IF SO, DO YOU AGREE WITH SPEAKER PELOSI AND OTHERS WHO SAY THAT UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, THEY FREE-TRADE DEAL WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE? V.P PENCE: THE MOMENT BUT IT IS COMPLETED, WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.K. LET ME SAY, I AM ENCOURAGED TO LEARN THAT ALL PARTIES HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO HONOR THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. WHEN WE THINK OF THE DECADES OF VIOLENCE TO THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE ALONG THE BORDER. THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT WAS AN ARRANGEMENT THAT BROUGHT THE END OF THE VIOLENCE, BROUGHT PEACE TO THIS ISLAND, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO AFFIRM OUR BELIEF THAT THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT NEEDS TO BE INTACT. WE REMAIN CONFIDENT , IF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL COME AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH WITH PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT SOME OF THESE MORE COMPLEX ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEAL THAT WAS NEGOTIATED BY THERESA MAY WAS REJECTED BY THE PARLIAMENT. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCUMBENT ON ALL PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH IN BREXIT AGREEMENT THAT RESPECTS THE DECISION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND DO THAT IN AN ORDERLY WAY. DOESN'T AN AGREEMENT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE FOR THERE TO BE A TRADE DEAL? DOESN'T AN AGREEMENT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE FOR THERE TO BE A TRADE DEAL? V.P PENCE: I WILL LEAVE THE DETAILS TO OTHERS, I THINK I'VE ANSWERED THAT THE RED WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND A FORM THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT, BUT WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH TO ACHIEVE BREXIT IN A WAY THAT HONORS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND INVOLVES THE LEAST DISRUPTION HERE IN IRELAND OR ANYWHERE ACROSS THE REGION. I MIGHT BE TAKING A RISK IN ASKING THE QUESTION AGAIN, BUT IN DECLINING TO CONDITION THAT THE U.K.-U.S. AGREEMENT ON NO HARD BORDER IN IRELAND, YOU SEEM TO BE ENDORSING PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON'S APPROACH TO THIS, AND THE IDEA THAT THE U.S. WOULD YOU WILLING TO GO FORWARD EVEN IF IT DID DISRUPT THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT BECAUSE YOU THINK THE BREXIT REFERENDUM IS MORE IMPORTANT. IS THAT A MISREADING OF THE SITUATION, AND IS THERE A RISK IN ENDORSING PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON, WHO JUST NOW LOST HIS CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY A FEW MINUTES AGO IN THE U.K. , I AM CURIOUS OF YOUR REACTION TO THAT AS WELL , IF IT GIVES YOU ANY PAUSE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ARE APPROACHING THESE NEGOTIATIONS IN YOUR MEETING NEXT WEEK? V.P PENCE: THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RESPECTS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO AFFIRM THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. IT WAS A HISTORIC AGREEMENT THAT BROUGHT AN END TO VIOLENCE IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND, IT WAS DECADES OF VIOLENCE. WE ALL GREW UP WATCHING THAT HARDSHIP, LOSS OF LIFE, AND IT WAS BROUGHT TO AN END. I REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT IF BOTH PARTIES COME TO THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH, WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT BY THE END OF OCTOBER, A DEADLINE CAN BE MET WITH BREXIT. ONE OF THE IDEAS FLOATED IS A THAT THREE-MONTH DELAY FOR THE DEADLINE FOR BREXIT, GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT IS SO IN FLUX, DO YOU THINK THAT IS A GOOD OPTION? V.P PENCE: I WOULDN'T CARE TO COMMENT ON THAT. WE WANT TO BE VERY RESPECTFUL OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE PEOPLE OF THE U.K. HAVE SPOKEN AND NOW, YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT REFERENDUM PASSED. THERE IS A NEW PRIME MINISTER, A NEW GOVERNMENT, MUCH DYNAMICS TO ALL OF THIS THAT IS GOING ON. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SUPPORTS THE UNITED KINGDOM'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE WILL RESPECT THE PROCESS. . WE WILL A FORM OUR COMMITMENT TO AGREEMENTS IN THE REGION THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO PEACE AND STABILITY. BUT WE WILL RESPECT THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO LEAVE THE E.U. DEMOCRATS HAVE CRITICIZED DO TODAY FOR STAYING AT THE TRUMP PROPERTY IN DOING BACK, THEY SAY THAT YOU ARE ENRICHING THE PRESIDENT. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT RACISM? V.P PENCE: IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN IRELAND. FOR MANY REASONS. IRELAND IS IMPORTANT AS A TRADING PARTNER, BUT IN SO MANY WAYS, FOR MORE THAN 30 MILLION AMERICANS, IRELAND IS FAMILY, AND I AM ONE OF THEM. IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO BE IT WERE TO COME BACK AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE VERY HOMETOWN OF MY MOTHER'S GRANDMOTHER. WE WILL HAVE DINNER TONIGHT AT A LITTLE POP THAT I WORKED AT WHEN I WAS 22 YEARS OLD WHEN I CAME HERE SHORTLY AFTER MY GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY, AND A RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IS THE HOUSE WHERE MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER GREW UP. SHE OFTEN SPOKE OF THE CASTLE THAT WAS OUT THE WINDOW OF HER BEDROOM, AND TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE AND REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, OUR ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC TIES, AND ALSO TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE SAME TIME TO CONNECT TO THE VOTES OF MY FAMILY, I THINK SUPPORT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND IRELAND. IF YOU THINK OF THE BONDS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE IRISH AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH SHARED HERITAGE AND FAMILY. THAT IS WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME, BEFORE OUR ORIGINAL TRIP PLAN TO AT LEAST SPEND ONE NIGHT IN DUNE BAY. I UNDERSTAND OF THE BY DEMOCRATS, BUT IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GO THERE, YOU WILL FIND IT IS A FAIRLY SMALL LACE, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AT TRUMP NATIONAL AND ACCOMMODATE THAT UNIQUE FOOTPRINT IN THAT COMES WITH OUR SECURITY DETAIL AND OTHER PERSONNEL MADE IT LOGICAL. WE CHECKED IT WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE APPROVED AS STAYING THERE. I WAS PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO THAT FAMILY HOMETOWN AND TO BE ABLE TO STAY THERE. AND NOT JUST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, BUT ALSO TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT HELPS ME CELEBRATE WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND THE CONNECTION BUT SO MANY TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FEEL TO IRELAND.

GOVERNOR REYNOLDS, SENATOR GRASSLEY, SENATOR ERNST, FORMER CONGRESSMAN DAVID YOUNG. THE EPA'S ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE CAP GRASSLEY. ALL THE LOCAL LEADERS AND GUESTS AND NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE HAWKEYE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT WONDERFUL, WARM WELCOME. I AM REALLY HONORED TO SEE YOU ALL TURNED OUT TODAY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING SOME TIME AWAY FROM WORK AND YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO IOWA AND THE NATION. LET ME SAY THANKS TO A FEW FRIENDS WHO ARE WITH US TODAY. NOT JUST DO I WANT TO THANK HER FOR THAT OVERLY GENEROUS INTRODUCTION BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THERE IS NO MORE DYNAMIC, HARD-WORKING GOVERNOR IN AMERICA THEN GOVERNOR TIM REYNOLDS. HE IS DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB FOR IOWA. AND LET ME THANK ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE WHO I HAVE COME TO KNOW WELL IN MY DUTIES AS VICE PRESIDENT. AND I FIND MY WAYS THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON A REGULAR BASIS. I GET A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS, ANATOLY THIS ONE IS AMAZING. HE LIKES TO SAY THAT THEY WAS IN MOTHER AND A LEADER. THEY ARE BORN AND RAISED HERE AS COMBAT VETERANS I TELL YOU TODAY, THEY ARE A CHAMPION FOR IOWA AND THE CONSERVATIVE AGENDA. THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING SENATOR JONI ERNST FOR STRONG CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU, SENATOR. FINALLY, IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE WITH FRANKLY A HERO OF MINE. I FIRST DISCOVERED HIM ON C-SPAN BACK IN THE 1990'S. [APPLAUSE] WHEN HE WAS SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. I SAID I LIKE THAT GUY. HE WOULD GO ON TO SENATE AND IN FACT TO SERVE IN CONGRESS FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU HE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION OR HIS FELLOW IOWA FARMERS LIKE NO ONE ELSE. HE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR OUR CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND IS OBVIOUSLY A TERRIFIC GRANDFATHER. THANK YOU FOR , JOIN ME IN WELCOMING SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS. LET ME MENTION ONE MORE. WHO WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADED TO IOWA, HE LOOKED JUST LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. HE IS A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF IOWA AND A MAN OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA PUT THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THREE YEARS AGO. I BRING YOU GREETINGS FROM THE 41ST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. BUT IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK ON A FARM. ESPECIALLY GREAT TO BE HERE AT A GREAT FAMILY FARM HERE IN IOWA. I GREW UP SOUTH OF HIGHWAY 40 MYSELF. SOUTHERN INDIANA. I DID NOT GROW UP ON A FARM, BUT WE HAD SOME COWS AND I HUNG OUT ALL THE TIME WITH FRIENDS ON FAMILY FARMS. THIS ONE WE WERE STANDING ON TODAY IS SO EMBLEMATIC OF WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT FAMILY FARM. ROB MANNING IS THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF FARMERS IN HIS FAMILY WHO HAS STILL TO LAND AND RAISE ANIMALS FOR FIVE GENERATIONS. TODAY, THE HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN HAVE HELPED THE HAWKEYE STATE URGED ITS PLACE AS THE NATION'S LARGEST CORN PRODUCER, SECOND-LARGEST SOYBEAN PRODUCER, AND THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF PORK IN THE COUNTRY. THE TRUTH IS, WHEN YOU GROW AND RAISE HERE YOU EXPORT AROUND THE WORLD, SO WILL YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING THE MANNING FAMILY AND THE WHOLE TEAM HERE? ALL THE LEADERSHIP AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATION. THE TRUTH IS, WHEN YOU GROW AND RAISE HERE IN IOWA, YOU EXPORT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT TRADE TODAY. WE HAVE TALKED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR IOWA WORKERS AND IOWA BUSINESSES. BUT BEFORE THAT, LET ME TAKE A MINUTE TO REFLECT ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN THE CONFIDENCE THE PEOPLE OF IOWA HAVE PLACE IN THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN I THINK OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE YEARS OF ACTION. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE YEARS OF RESULTS. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. BUT WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED IOWA. AND I THINK ABOUT IT. THIS PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED MORE BILLS ROLLING BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE THEM ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SIGNED A MEASURE TO ENSURE FARMERS AND RANCHERS CAN OWN THEIR LAND IN FEE SIMPLE, AS WE LIKE TO SAY. PRIVATE PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON THE PRESIDENT REPEALED THE DISASTROUS WATERS OF THE USA RULE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO KEPT A PROMISE WHEN HE SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR LARGE BUSINESSES. AND WHEN HE DID THAT, HE ENDED THE DEATH TAX FOR NEARLY AMERICAN FARMER. THAT IS NO LONGER A TAXABLE EVENT. MOBILE ALSO PASSED REFORMS THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR FARMERS TO IMMEDIATELY DEDUCT THE PERCENT OF THE COST OF NEW EQUIPMENT. ANY RENT AROUND FARMING NOSE INPUT COSTS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN BEING ABLE TO LITERALLY WRITE OFF THOSE COSTS IN A SINGLE YEAR, IT MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. SO IT'S NOT RED TAPE AND CUTTING TAXES. WE'VE ALSO UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY. NEXT YEAR, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE IN NEXT , NET EXPORTER OF OIL FOR THE FIRST TIM EIN 75 YEARS? AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, WITH THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND THE UNRELENTING LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR GRASSLEY. WE REACH 50 MILLION GALLONS EVERY YEAR. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FUEL AND FEED THE COUNTRY AS WELL. THEY HAVE CREATED 6.5 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCLUDING 22,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE HAWKEYE STATE YOUR. BUT I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE FOR ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, WE STILL HAVE GOT WORK TO DO. AS WE HEARD FROM THIS STAGE EARLIER, WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US OVER ONE YEAR AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP THE LARGEST TRADE DEAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE UNITED STATES MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT. I WAS THERE ALL ALONG THE WAY FOR A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS AND THE PRESIDENT GHANI HARD BARGAIN. HE PUT AMERICAN JOBS AND FARMERS FIRST. INITIATED A GREAT DEAL. AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AND THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE REFUSED TO BRING US TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT'S WHY I AM HERE I CAME TO IOWA TODAY TO TURN UP THE HEAT. I CAME TO IOWA TODAY TO SAY IT'S TIME FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS TO DO THEIR JOB. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND PASS THE USMCA THIS YEAR. THE TRUTH IS, WE ALL KNOW IT. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN SPENDING ALL OF THEIR TIME ON ENDLESS INVESTIGATIONS AND A PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT. BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER. THE TIME HAS COME FOR CONGRESSWOMAN CINDY AXNE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT IOWA TO PUT IOWA FIRST, AMERICA FIRST , AND PASS THE USMCA THIS YEAR. AND I MAKE YOU A PROMISE. WHATEVER THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS CHOOSE TO SPEND THEIR TIME ON, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR YOU AND THE AGENDA THAT IOWA VOTED FOR. COUNT ON IT. WHERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS TO DISTRACT US FROM WORKING ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO STOP DELIVERING ON A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE SO JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO STOP FIGHTING FOR THAT AGENDA IS THAT AGENDA HAS MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I STAND BEFORE MEET WITH OUR NATION AND LIBERTIES. UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT A 50 YEAR LOW AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. THE TRUTH IS, THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS COME ROARING BACK. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES, THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PRESIDENT, IN CONGRESS AND STATEHOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THIS ECONOMY HAS MOSTLY COME BACK BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF MORE FREEDOM FROM A MORE OPPORTUNITY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE STEPPED UP, AND WITH THEIR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT, YOU BROUGHT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BACK. IT IS ONE STORY AT A TIME, ONE FAMILY AT A TIME. IT IS STORIES LIKE A FARMER THAT HEARD ABOUT ON THE WAY HERE NEARBY IN DALLAS CITY WHOSE FAMILY HAS BEEN A PILLAR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GENERATIONS. I WAS TOLD TODAY THAT WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED OUT, THE FAMILY'S DRAFT FORCES TO PLOW THE FIELDS AND HAD TO PRACTICALLY FEEL LIVESTOCK BY HAND. TODAY, THAT SAME FARM HAS DRAWN NATIONAL ATTENTION BY USING STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE PRODUCING MORE AT LOWER COSTS, MAKING THIS COMMUNITY, STATE, AND NATION PROUD. WILL YOU JOIN ME IN RECOGNIZING TOM BARRETT AND THE WHOLE BARRETT FAMILY FARM? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, TOM. WE ALSO HAVE WITH US THE FIRST GENERATION OWNERS OF A FARM JUST A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD. THEY STARTED IT THREE DECADES AGO WAS JUST A FEW DOLLARS TO THEIR NAME. SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE GROWN THE FARM TO MORE THAN 150 EMPLOYEES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS WHERE THEY'VE RAISE THEIR FOUR DAUGHTERS AND TWO SONS. THEY ARE PROOF OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. SO WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO TWO HARD-WORKING FARMERS THE REPRESENT EVERYTHING THAT IS GREAT ABOUT AGRICULTURE. BRETT AND TERESA, WHERE ARE YOU? TAKE ABOUT. , A BOW. I MENTION THESE TWO FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY EMBLEMATIC OF EACH AND EVERYONE THEY ARE PROOF THAT YOU GIVE AMERICAN FARMERS AND WORKERS A LEVEL LIKE AN HOUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS CAN COMPETE AND WIN WITH ANYONE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE BEEN OPENING UP MARKETS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT DONALD TRUMP RENEGOTIATING OUR TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA. EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH JAPAN THAT WILL EXPAND DIGITAL TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL TRADE BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO JAPAN. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO PUT CHINA ON NOTICE THAT THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER. WE HAVE TAKEN A STRONG STAND DEMAND CHINA OPEN THEIR MARKETS TO WHAT WE MAKE AND WHAT WE GROW AND TREAT AMERICAN BUSINESSES FAIRLY. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TAKING A STRONG STAND, BUT JUST THE LAST FEW WEEKS CHINA ANNOUNCED THE PURCHASE OF MORE THAN 2 MILLION METRIC TONS OF SOYBEAN. AND AS I LEARNED ON THE WAY HERE , WE ARE GOING TO WELCOME A CHINESE DELEGATION TO OUR NATIONS CAPITAL LATER THIS WEEK. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING FORWARD WITH CHINA, BUT I PROMISE YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND FARMERS. SO WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS, BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE STAGE TODAY, WHEN WE GET THE USMCA DONE, IT WILL BE A BIG WIN FOR AMERICAN FARMERS. IN THE TRUTH IS WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL FARM ON THIS BREEZY DAY BECAUSE IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO ACT. IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO PASS THE USMCA. AND YOU KNOW WHY. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION, THE USMCA IS GOING TO ADD BILLIONS TO OUR ECONOMY RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE. AND WE PREDICT CONSERVATIVELY IT WILL MAKE 75,000 JOBS. THEY ALSO PROPOSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPORTS BY MORE THAN $2 BILLION. HERE IN IOWA, THE STATE ALREADY EXPORTS MORE THAN $6.6 BILLION IN GOODS AND SERVICES TO CANADA AND MEXICO. IN FACT, NEARLY HALF OF ALL OF I WAS EXPORTS GO TO MEXICO AND CANADA AND NEARLY 100,000 GOOD PAYING IOWA JOBS DEPEND ON EXPORTS. THAT IS WHY YOUR GOVERNOR, YOUR SENATORS, YOUR PRESIDENT IS DEMANDING THAT CONGRESS PASS THE USMCA AND PASS IT THIS YEAR. IOWA IS DEPENDING ON IT. TRUTH IS, FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN BECAUSE THIS GREAT STATE IS THE NATION'S SECOND-LARGEST AGRICULTURAL STATE. YOU PRODUCE MORE THAN $10.3 BILLION IN GOODS EVERY YEAR. WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW. IT WILL CREATE MORE PROSPERITY ALL OVER THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO COME AND TALK ABOUT IT. WE CAN GET IT DONE, BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US TO DO IT. I CAME HERE TO TURN UP THE HEAT, BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR ISLANDS TO TURN UP THE HEAT ON YOUR DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS AND TELL THEM I WHAT NEEDS THE USMCA THIS YEAR. WILL YOU DO IT? [APPLAUSE] I WANT YOU TO REACH OUT TO ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WASHINGTON DC. SAY I RAN INTO MIKE ON A FARM THE OTHER. HE WAS POINTING OUT TO ME THAT HALF OF OUR EXPORTS FROM IOWA AS GOVERNOR GO TO CANADA AND MEXICO. AND WE GOT THIS GREAT NEW TRADE AGREEMENT THAT IS A WIN FOR AGRICULTURE, A WIN FOR IOWA AND YOU NEED TO GET IT DONE. TELL THEM WHAT THE USMCA WILL MEAN TO IOWA FARMERS. BUT LET ME SAVE YOU A NICKEL. YOU DON'T NEED TO CALL SENATOR JONI ERNST SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY BECAUSE THEY ARE LEADING THE CHARGE IN THE UNITED DATES SENT FOR THE U.S. MC AND , SENATE FOR THE USMCA. WE COULD NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR THE ILLUSION. BUT HERE, THERE ARE PEOPLE TO CALL. CALL CONGRESSWOMAN CINDY EXLEY. CALL ABBY FINKENAUER. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, CALL CONGRESSMAN DAVE MESSAGE , DAVE LISSETTE AND TELL THEM IOWA NEEDS THE USMCA. AND BY THE WAY, AFTER YOU MAKE THAT CALL, IT SEEMS THAT EVERY FOUR YEARS YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH IOWA. SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICIANS MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE STATE GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR'S ELECTION. THIS FIRST IN THE NATION STATE IN IOWA. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU NEED TO KNOW, EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS OPPOSED TO THE USMCA. SO IF YOU RUN INTO THEM AT A DINER OR A STREET CORNER, YOU NEED TO TELL THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND THAT I WOULD NEED THE USMCA. I TELL YOU, ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOVE IS THAT IOWA IS SO MUCH LIKE INDIANA. PEOPLE WITH BIG HEARTS AND STRONG OPINIONS. SELECT THEM HEAR YOUR OPINION. IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY IN A BUSY WEEK TAKING SOME TIME TO FOCUS ON AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. AND LET ME SAY AGAIN HOW GRATEFUL I AM. GIVE THEM ONE MORE ROUND OF APPLAUSE, THEY ARE JUST INCREDIBLE CHAMPIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE KAREN AND OUR FAMILY, LET ME JUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, IT IS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. THANK YOU FOR THE CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE PLACE IN YOUR PRESIDENT AND HIS VICE PRESIDENT FINALLY, LET ME SAY IT'S ALSO GREAT TO BE BACK ON FARM. I AM PRETTY PARTIAL TO FARMS. THE TRUTH IS, FARMERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH THE LIFE OF THIS NATION, YOU CAN NEVER CALCULATE ALL. , ALL OF IT. AND I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, BUT THROUGHOUT THE LONG HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. FARMERS IN THE FAMILY FARMERS HAVE INTRUDED SO MUCH VITALITY TO OUR COMMUNITIES, TO OUR STATE, FARMERS HAVE SERVED IN OUR ARMED FORCES. THEIR PATRIOTISM AND THEIR VALUES HAVE STRENGTHENED THIS NATION THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY. I'M ALWAYS STRUCK WITH THAT BOOK I TRY AND OPEN EVERY SINGLE MORNING IN A QUIET TIME. HOW MAY TIMES WE ARE TOLD TO CONSIDER THE FARMER. I BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE, IN THE FARMER, WE FIND ALL THE VIRTUES THAT LEAD TO A HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE. HONESTY, INTEGRITY, HARD WORK, RESILIENCE, FAMILY, AND FAITH. SO YOU BEING OUT HERE TODAY, THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE SHOWN TO THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS VICE PRESIDENT, OUR AGENDA, MEANS THAT MUCH MORE TO ME. BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE AMERICAN FARMER. IT COMES FROM THE BEST OF AMERICA. AND IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS THAT LIE AHEAD, WE MAKE YOU A PROMISE. WANTED A MORE HUMOROUS THINGS I EVER HEAR IS THAT PEOPLE STOP ME AS I'M TRAVELING TO THEY SAY TO TELL THE PRESIDENT JUST TO KEEP GOING FORWARD. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEVER HAVE TO TELL PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. I TELL PEOPLE ALL ARE VERSUS STRIPPED OUT OF THAT PICKUP TRUCK, IT ONLY GOES FORWARD AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO STOP FIGHTING FOR THE AGENDA THAT IOWA VOTED FOR. I PROMISE. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO STOP FIGHTING. NEVER GOING TO STOP FIGHTING FOR THE POLICIES THAT PROVIDE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND STRENGTHEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION OF OUR FORCE AND REBUILD OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WHEN WE GET THIS USMCA DONE, WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL KEEP AMERICA GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU, IOWA. GOD BLESS AMERICA.

I t hank you thank to say 4 more k ids I'm like No 9 is g ood 9 is good but when you hav e a wife who is t he mothe r of 9 and also ha s to put up with me she doesn't get to get out as frequently and so I'm gratefu l that she's been abl e to spend the d ay with us wi th our vice president and the 2nd lady of the United wife Cynthia we're s o bless ed by the leader ship we have it's so many levels at the natio nal level and I was struck by even the openi ng invocatio n I was struck by th e words about how i ndeed we were knit toget her in our mother's wom b and I men tion that only to say t hat I lo ok out at this audience a look at the diversi ty of people in this c rowd of divers ity of people on th is ti cket that you hav e heard fro m. There's nev er been a ticke t so represent ative of Kentu cky and of America e ver put f orward in this state o r almost any state if yo u look at t he slate of c andidates th at we have b lack white Hispanic male female urban rural peop le from Ken tucky peopl e born o utside of Kentucky this is the face of Kentucky both now and into the future and As I see thes e faces and I k now their back st ories I realize that indeed we are each of us i ndividual ly fearfully and wo nderfu lly made we are the Image of God Each one of us and in my suppor t for the unborn to gi ve the voice to the voice less t his is the role of gov ernment th e role of government is to give t h e strength. To those who have no one to life liberty the pursui t of happiness tho se things that are in th eir early noble ri ghts the things that were e ndowed by our creator government did n't give them to us government doesn't have the right to tak e them from us how wonderful that we are the party t hat understands this And I s ay t his wit h no disrespe ct to people who ha ve Ben and maybe I'm gu arantee in th is cr owd still are registered on the other side I wil l say this for those who are still reg istered Democrats your par ty at th e national level i s leaving you be hind it's leaving you behind and h ere's the wonderf ul thing I will say this as the top elected Republican in the Commonw ealth of Kentucky i t's never too late to do the right thing you can come on ov er Come on in the water's fine pr etty good over h ere because not only do we stand unapologe tically for li fe not only do respect stand unexpected apologetically for ou r constitution in t he defense of ou r constitutio nal rights includi ng our righ t to keep and bear ar ms not only d o we stand with G od and country we stand for the flag of the United States of America. An d we do that ag ain in Kent ucky whether we're Dem ocrat or Repu blican because we know that the core fundament al values upon which this stat e upon which this nation were built are the very value s that we embody we'd be in Kentucky an d that for those of y ou that are visi ting from the outside that ar e part of the na tional press cor ps this is Trump country l et there be no. Doubt about I How I A nd the reason i t is the reason it is not because thi s man is from here not beca use he has everyth ing exactly in common with those that are a ssembled here but b ecause he l oves America and these peopl e w ho love America . We love the Un ited States of Ameri ca the land of the free t he home of the brave we d o believe in being on e na tion under God indivisible. And when we s ee all the divi sion that is tearing us apart we saw the animos ity the victory all the insa nity of w hat was coming out of Wash ington even just y esterday where the mock ery that is being made of the poli ti cal process and the d isregard of t he disrespect by the elected officials themselves in Washington of t heir very jobs the respect th ey should have fo r their very o ffice for the Co ngress itself for the di sregard of the rule of l aw in the voice of the people n onetheless we stand unapologet ically and firmly on the si de of what is right in on the side of support for the man that we elected to be the president of governor an d I will tell you this I 'm grateful for the fact that in the l ast 4 ye ars we all know we hear the sta ti stics we have e xperienced them we are the statistic s to a degree and we know wh ere we have Ben with respect to ec onomic development we kn ow where we've been with respect to per capita incom e we know where we bet as it relates to this that o r the other thing bu t guess wh o's been in charge f or $96.00 of the last 100 y ears not us but that's pr etty much the realit y of it on the 4th Republican. G overnor in the last 1 00 years we 've never in histo ry ever el ected consecut ive terms a Republ ican governor in th e history of Kentucky but guess what we're about to make history On November the 5t h i n 4 days we're going to make some h istory and it has no thing to do with the part y I'll be honest i t's not so much our versus d. us versus them it is a bout these core v alues it is about voting your values and not your party it is about sta nding unapologetical ly for the thi ngs we've j ust described th is is the greatness of w ho we a re as a commonweal th for wh o we are as a natio n we have no re ason to apologiz e for these things we have no reason when we have people on this coast that coas t and in pocke ts of cities here and the re telling people w ho believe as we b elieve that we're supposed to keep ou r mouths shut wh ile there's a wide open N onsense nonsense. And I'll tell you what on November th e 5t h the people of Kentucky are going to sen d up a m ighty roar there 's going to be a loud roarin g going up .

Men and women of the Commo nwealth of Kentucky you are looking a t the most accomplished and dive rse Repub lican ticket in the history of the Commonwealth of Kentuck y just to extraordin ary grou p of Americ a own Turke y needs a senator Ralph Al varado the lieutena nt gov ern or of the old turke y needs Michael Adams to be yo ur next secretary of st ate he's gonna make it easy to v ote in hard to achieve the old Kentucky while you're at it can talk and he's the sam e these other great Republic an leaders b ack to the s tate house when you relax Tr easurer Ali son Ball aud itor Mike Armin and agriculture commissioner incredible Republican ticke t we're going to actual ly build on the progr ess that Ken tucky and Am ericans h ave made over t he la st 3 years you know when I look back over the last 3 years of our administ ration I think there's only one way you can describe it's been 3 years of action. All the progress here in Kentuck y is being reflected all acr oss America the unemploy ment rate h as h it a 50 year low there's more Americans wo rking today than ever before in Am erican history and the u nemployment rate for African-Ame ricans in Hispanic Ame rican s is the lowest level ever recorded this the rising here in Kentuck y thanks to his leaders hip and t hanks present trumps lead ership the nationa l level wages are risin g across A merica at the fastest clip in more than 10 years and maybe what means most o f the President me wages are rising most rapidly all over Americ a and President Dr also prom ise d the promise to rebuild our military President Donald Trump ha s do ne just that y ou know in the la st 3 years prison Trump assigned the l argest increases in our natio nal defense since th e days of Ronald Reagan. We're finally g iven our soldiers sailors airmen Marines with our allies and we' re standing up tournamen t's our NATO a llies are contributi ng more than eve r befo re to our comm on defense and we've taken the fight to radical Islam ic terrorist s on our term s on their soil clo ser to home work ing with government. Prisoner T h as taken decis ive ac tion decisive action to end the crisis of illegal immigration at our southern And the courageous me n and women of our bord er patrol over the l ast 4 months apprehen sions on our southern border are down by nearly 70 percent and we've al ready started to build that wall here in Kentucky to deal with the cris is of illegal immigrat ion but he's a nat ional voice the president I c ouldn't be more gra teful for your stand fo r the rule of law an d speaking of th e rule of l aw. With stron g support of your gover nor and the people of Kent ucky President Trump has has appointed of long a nd Law and Order or stand in for our constitut ional lib erties but as I sai d before all see again Karen and I couldn't be more pr oud to stand with a govern or and to serve with a p resident who st and without apol ogy for the sanctity of human men and women th e choice in t he election here in Kentu cky couldn't be cle arer 6 couldn't be h ighe r here in Kentucky you have the proven con servative in govern ment. Fi ghts every day for Kent ucky's Jobs too k his families an d Kentucky's values and you can say the s ame about hi s opponent I m ean truth is Andy Bashir sto od with Hillary Clinton in the last election. to raise your taxes raise taxe s on hardworking famili es here in Kent ucky and if this year won't stand up for the right to life you wouldn't ev en d efend laws that were passed here in Kentucky to defend to be sure is dominated by left wing radical s . Comi ng up with ideas ev ery day like the G reen New Deal Med icare for al l free health care for illegal immigrants sanctu ary cities I mean the truth is an opportunity before t he polls close on a mem ber 5 th if you support Governo r Matt Bevin's agenda an agenda dismayed Kentucky more prosperous vote Republican And they' re Kentucky's ti red of the endless investigat ions and their pa rtisan impe achment if you want to send a message in the do nothi ng Democrats that Ke ntucky su pports President Donald Trump opportunity to force minimu m but it's going to take all of us to get it don e and you all know the history here in Kentucky the governor just to uched on so we need to go to work I truly d o believe that. Kentucky can lead the way in t he nation this y ear and set th e st age for next year. On ce we reelect g overnment for 4 more years we can make it clear we' re going to reelect President Donald Trump for 4 because I'm going to charge you to go out a nd do some S ome All right so if you take a nose n umb er one 1st and foremos t between now and when the electi ons polls close on next Tuesday into Mike in care and the other day . They were out there with Madele ine and I got to t ell you he said you co uld te ll him I'm ex cited about Kentucky but the vice president came here and just told us years ago you know every single pol l said we were going to l ose from every sing l e poll. Bu t I knew I knew something different wa s happe ning sort of our present is because we were traveling a round the country I mean I looked ou t at the same sh ining fa ces I'm looking at today I k now there were millions of Americans ac ross Kentucky and across this country wh o knew we could be strong again who knew we could be prosper ous again and they were talking to one you kn ow the truth is the most powe rful media in this country t oday yesterd ay and always is not your network news it's not your newspapers it's not your social media it's word of mouth and respects yo u hear from you about an i ssue that's important to them in their family and their values and so I have to make sure you vote wit h a friend I want you to go ta lk to s omebody at work at worship in your neighborhoo d over a ba ckyar d friends just count on the diffe rence t hat this gov ernor has made for K entucky the w ay he has stood for Kentucky's jobs securities and values days as the governo r said a minute a go that there's so much emph as is o n what divides us in thi s country but I'll alw ays believe that there is so much more that unites us in these United States of America than c ould ever divine and ch ief a mong t hat is faith Ok a nd so on th is one I. Am n ot so m uch asking y ou to. To pray fo r our cause or our can didates but on this one I just en courage you to pray for Ke ntucky for America pray for all the people. but your governor believes those ancien t words th at Americans have cl ung to and much more challen ging times than we could ever imagine are still true today if his people wh o are calle d by his name will h umble t hemse lves and pray he'l l do like he's always don e in a long and storied his tory of this co mmonwealth and this n ation w ill hear from heaven and heal heal this land to catch in time is wasted you guy s got people to talk t o. There's w ork to be done before th e sun sets in the polls close on Tuesda y bu t I just want to tell you I absolu tely believe t hat if all of us do a ll that we c an to work into l abor in the days ahead to tell the sto ry of the pro gress that Kentucky has made in that America has made the le adership of Governor Matt Bevin in your stat e House lead ership President D onald Trump in the Wh ite House we're going to de liver great victory on Tue sday for all t he people of the state I truly b elieve and that w ith Governor Matt Be van in the state house with this grea t tea m for 4 more years with Preside nt Do nald Trump in the White Hou se and wit h God's help.

I HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF , WITH THEIR GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS. WE WENT THERE TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY AND REENACTED THAT MARCH ACROSS THE BRIDGE. I HAD MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WITH ME. THOSE A DAY I'LL NEVER FORGET. WE GATHERED AND HAD A WORSHIP SERVICE IN LIKE THEY HAVE DONE 35 YEARS EARLIER, WE WALKED TO THE BRIDGE AND AS WE WERE WALKING UP, THERE WAS AN OLD PASTOR NAMED DR. F D REIS AND I WAS WALKING WITH HIM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THERE, THE BRIDGE IS ACTUALLY STEEP AND YOU HAVE TO WALK UP TO THE MIDDLE BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER SIDE AND THE PASTOR TOLD ME THEY HAD WALKED TO THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A SEA OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND POLICE AND MOUNTED OFFICERS AND I LOOKED AT HIM AS WE LOOKS DOWN ON THE SCENE 45 YEARS LATER , I SAID TO HIM DID YOU THINK ABOUT TURNING BACK? HE SMILED THE WAY WALDMAN SOMETIMES SMILE AND HE SAID WE HAD ALL PRAYED AND DECIDED TO GO ON REGARDLESS AND SO THEY DID. WHEN THAT MARCH WAS OVER, THE BRUTALITY OF THAT MOMENT WOULD INSPIRE THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND HELP TRANSFORM THIS NATION INTO A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE OF THEIR COURAGE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH. WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER OUR LOOKED AT DR. REESE AND STUCK MY HAND OUT FOR WHAT THEY DONE FOR THE COUNTRY AND HE LOOKED AT ME ONE MORE TIME AND SMILED. HE SAID DON'T THINK ME OR WHAT WE DID HERE, GOD DID SOMETHING HERE. THAT IS PAID , FAITH. THAT IS THE FAITH OF THIS COMMUNITY. FAITH THAT GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE GONE THROUGH FOR CENTURIES. IT IS STILL DRIVING US TODAY TO A MORE PERFECT UNION. FAITH THAT WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS LIBERTY. THAT MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINDS , WINS AND IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND REACH MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE WILL RENEW AND STRENGTHEN AS NEVER BEFORE THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. MEN AND WOMEN, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET YOU HEAR FROM THE ONE YOU CAME TO HEAR. HAVE CONFIDENCE, HAVE FAITH. WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR TO DO IT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF WE DO WHAT WE CAN BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY 2020, WE WILL DELIVER ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY FOR EVERY AMERICAN COME NOVEMBER 2020. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE, MAKE AMERICA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WITH YOUR HARD WORK AND TELLING OUR STORY TO EVERY COMMUNITY, WE WILL PUT PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. (music) (music) (music) THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE TO BE HERE BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WE LIVE HERE TODAY, IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO SAY YOU ARE SUPPORTING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT IS QUITE INTERESTING HOW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE AND HOW TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE AND CHANGE THEIR MINDS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. YOU GO BACK SINCE THE DAVE'S , THE DAYS OF SLAVERY. THEY TOLD THE ONES IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE YARD AND THE ONES IN THE YARD BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE FIELD AND ON AND ON IT WENT TRYING TO DIVIDE PEOPLE TODAY, THEY SAY IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE, THEN YOU ARE SOMEHOW AN UNCLE TOM, A HORRIBLE PERSON, A DEMON, WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAFT , CRAP. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME OUT. IT DOES NOT BOTHER ME ANYMORE BECAUSE I ONLY WORRY WHAT GOD THINKS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ASK ME COME UP , ASK ME, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU , WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? YOU'VE CHANGED. [NO AUDIO] AND THEN TO NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT AND THEN TO BALTIMORE, A BASTION OF LIBERALISM. THEN I DID SOMETHING THAT LIBERALS ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO. I LISTENED TO A CONSERVATIVE, I LISTENED TO RONALD REAGAN. I SAID HE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A HORRIBLE, RACIST PERSON, HE SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY MOTHER AND AT THAT POINT I STARTED THINKING FOR MYSELF. IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY MEDICAL CAREER TOO. THAT IS THE REASON THAT GOD GAVE US THESE CONFLICTS , COMPLEX BRAINS. FOR GOD GIVE YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN BE A SHEEP AND FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE OR TO THINK FOR YOURSELF? DON'T YOU FIND IT FASCINATING THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST? IT SEEMS LIKE SOME YEARS AGO, JESSE JACKSON GAVE AN AWARD IN NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE HE OPENED UP SOME MONEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK PEOPLE. IS THAT WHAT A RACIST DOES? HE IS THE ONE WHO FINALLY GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT [INDISCERNIBLE] WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE, HE BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF HBCUS THAT COULD GET MORE MONEY THAN EVER, OPPORTUNITIES SO PEOPLE COULD TAKE THE MONEY AND DIRECTED TO THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE, AND ECONOMY OR YOU HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN HISTORY AND IT GOES ON AND ON. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF THE IS A RACIST, HE'S A AWFULLY BAD ONE. HE NEEDS TO GET A LESSON FROM THE REAL RACISTS WERE PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF YOUR SKIN COLOR YOU HAVE TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY, THOSE ARE THE REAL RACISTS. THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT A RISING TIDES , RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL. THE MEDIA LIKES TO PICK ON HIM, ANY LITTLE THING. HE'S NOT PERFECT. THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS PERFECT WAS JESUS AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND ALL THE INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE MISSIONARIES. TALK TO YOUR FAMILY, TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. IF ALL THEY'RE DOING IS LOOKING AT CERTAIN MEDIA, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE AND SO THEY PERPETRATE THIS HORRIBLE IMAGE OF HIM BEING A BAD PERSON. I TRY TO WORK WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHEN WE WERE HAVING A DEBATE AND I CANNOT HEAR MY NAME, I WAS STOOD THERE , I STOOD THERE. I WAS , I COULD NOT HEAR MY NAME. I STOOD THERE AND HE WAS ONLY ONE WHO WAITED UNTIL THEY STRAIGHT WITHOUT , STRAIGHTENED IT OUT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DONALD TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU. WHAT A GROUP. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. IT IS A BIG CROWD OF PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK BEN CARSON FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. ALWAYS A GREAT GENTLEMEN, GREAT MAN. GLAD TO BE HERE TO LAUNCH OUR NEW BLACKS FOR TRUMP. AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT. WHAT DO YOU PREFER? WE ARE DOING WELL, WE HAVE OUR BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. THE SUPPORT WE ARE GETTING FROM THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND DEVOTION. 2016, THERE WAS A MOVEMENT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU MADE A GOOD , MADE UP A GOOD PORTION OF THAT. I HEAR YOU KNOCKING THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE, IT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO EVERY COMMUNITY AND CAMPAIGN FOR EVERY LAST AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IN 2020. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE TOOK ON THE WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS. THEY COME AT YOU, BUT WE ARE WINNING LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER ONE BEFORE. WE TOOK ON THE CORRUPT MEDIA AND POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS FAILED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR DECADES AND WE ARE STARTING TO LEARN THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT WERE POSSIBLE. EXACTLY THREE YEARS AGO TONIGHT, THE PEOPLE SPOKE IN WE TOOK OUR COUNTRY BACK AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WON AN EXTRAORDINARY VICTORY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND ONE YEAR FROM NOW WE WILL WIN ANOTHER INCREDIBLE VICTORY AND WE WILL DO IT FROM A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FROM AFRICAN-AMERICAN PATRIOTS. ALTOGETHER, WE HAVE NEVER DONE BETTER. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS THE ORIGINAL HOME OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND NOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE RETURNING. IT WAS A 100 YEAR TRIP AND COMING BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PEOPLE FORGET IN LINCOLN WAS REPUBLICAN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 2020 CHANCE A MAKE IT A CHANCE THAT YOU TAKE . WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT VOTE FOR ME, THAT WAS TAKING A CHANCE BECAUSE I WAS NOT A POLITICIAN. NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME TRUE MUCH MORE SO. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE NUMBERS AND MAKE 2020 A YEAR OF CHANGE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON. WE'RE GLAD TO BE JOINED BY HARRISON FORD , HARRISON FLOYD. WHERE IS HARRISON? HE DID NOT EVEN GET A GOOD LOCATION. HARRISON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB YOU ARE DOING AND HERMAN CAIN AND PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT. THANK YOU. , P ARE. THIS GUY, I SAID IS HE REALLY A PASTOR? , DARRELL, COME UP HERE. THIS GUY, I SAID IS HE REALLY A PASTOR? HE IS TOUGH. ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED IS IF I CANNOT WIN THE DEBATE, I'M TURNING IT INTO AN ARGUMENT. JESUS SAID OF ABRAHAM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MY DAY? HE SAW IT AND HE WAS GLAD. WE SEE IT, WE ARE GLAD ABOUT IT. IN 2016, COURAGEOUS BLACK PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND ANNOUNCE THEIR SUPPORT. WE SAW THE DAY OR EVERY FIVE PERSONS WOULD CRITICIZE US, ONE PERSON WOULD HEAR US. ONCE SOMEONE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE, OTHERS SAY THEY CAN STEP UP TO THE PLATE. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN NOTHING YET. WAIT UNTIL WE SEE THE HARVEST AND 2020 , IN 2020. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. A VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH US RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, KATRINA. ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I MET. I SAID I'M THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AND SHE SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE HERE WE ARE. GREAT JOB YOU HAVE DONE. AND A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN WHO IS CONSTANTLY DEFENDING ME [INDISCERNIBLE] WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY FORMER GOVERNOR SONNY PURDUE. HE HAS GIVEN AWAY A LOT OF THE MONEY FROM CHINA. HE IS THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND HE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE SENATOR DAVID PURDUE . WHERE IS HE? I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SO INSTRUMENTAL. WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING, GEORGIA WAS NOT DOING GOOD AND NOW IT IS DOING PHENOMENAL. WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR, BRIAN. THE STATE IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS. BRIAN KEMP, A LOT BETTER. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WARRIORS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE AND HAVE BEEN REP FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY HELP US WITH ALL THE WITCHHUNTS. WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE RICK ALLEN. REPRESENTATIVE, MEANING CONGRESSMAN BARNEY CARTER. JODY HEISE, YOU KNOW. AND A WARRIOR LIKE THE PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. I WATCHED HIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VERY NERVOUS WHEN HE STARTED GOING AFTER EVERYONE. SHE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE AND HE'S ALSO A SPECIAL MAN, CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. WE ALSO HAVE A FIRST LADY AT THIS. YOU HAVE A FIRST LADY IN JORDAN , GEORGIA NAMED MARTY CAMP , KEMP. LIFE IS NOT SO EASY FOR BRIAN, HE IS WORKING ALL THE TIME. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JEFF DUNCAN, FORMER TOUR OF PLAYER BY THE WAY. ATTORNEY GENERAL CHRIS CARR, THANKS. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ELECTIVE OF KENTUCKY IS HERE. WE HAD A GREAT KENTUCKY, BUT GOT NO CREDIT FOR IT. REALLY WORKS HARD AND , WORK HARD AND ALMOST ONE. WE BROUGHT HIM UP 19 POINTS IN THE MEDIA SAID THAT WAS A BAD NIGHT FOR TRUMP. WE WON FIVE OF THE SIX RACES. THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR KENTUCKY. DANIEL, HE WON BY A LOT. A LOT OF FUN FROM THE NET BEFORE. YOU SET A RECORD FOR WHAT YOU ARE RUNNING FOR. WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE THREE YEARS AGO, I LOOKED AT THE FISCAL RECORD OF THE DEMOCRATS AND ASKED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I CAME OFF THE STAGE AND THEY SAY I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE THAT. I SAID I READ A LIST. LAST IN THE ECONOMY, LAST IN WAGES, [INAUDIBLE] I HATE TO SAY THIS, I DO MY WORST WORK OFF SCRIPT AND I DO MY BEST OFF SCRIPT AND IT MAKES THINGS EXCITING. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT TO BE MADE. THEN I MADE YOU A PLEDGE THAT WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, I WOULD BE YOUR GREATEST CHAMPION AND YOU DID. YOU CAME OUT, WE DID VERY WELL. I CAME NOT AS A POLITICIAN. I CAME AS A BUSINESSMAN /TELEVISION STAR. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THE APPRENTICE AND I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO A JOB. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. THEY SEE WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH JUDGES. WE HAVE PICKED 157 AND WILL BE AT 180 SOON. I SAID HOW MANY, THEY SAID 142. TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUDGES. TO CREATE , TWO GREAT JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT WHOLE SITUATION WITH JUDGES BECAUSE WE'VE A LOT COMING. THERE ARE SOME SAYING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU DO, I SAY MILITARY AND DEFENSE. WE HAVE TOTALLY REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE DID A BIG NUMBER ON THE GOT IT LAST WEEK , AL-BAGHDADI LAST WEEK. THEY WERE PLAYING GAMES , THEY WEREN'T PLAYING GAMES. THEY DID NOT GO THROUGH THE DOOR. I'M WATCHING THIS LIKE YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND THEY BOOM, BOOM. I SAID WHY DON'T THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR? THEY SAID BOOBY-TRAPS. IT MAKES SENSE. HE KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF ISIS. THEN WE TOOK OUT HIS SECOND AND WE HAVE OUR EYES ON HIS THIRD. I VOW TO FIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR FUTURE. EVER SINGLE ONE WAS THE WORST. THEY HAD STATISTICS SAYING THIS IS BAD AND WE TOOK CARE OF IT. NIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE BEST NUMBERS YOU HAVE. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS FOR GRANTED. I THINK 100 YEARS. WHEN DETROIT LAST HAD A REPUBLICAN MAYOR IN 1962, IT HAD A STRONG, BEAUTIFUL ECONOMY AND AFTERNOON OF THE 60 YEARS OF CROOKED DEMOCRATIC RULE, IT IS ONE OF THE POOR CITIES IN AMERICA. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CITIES IN AMERICA. PHILADELPHIA, THE POVERTY RATE DOUBLED. THE CITY HAS HAD A DEMOCRAT MAYOR EVERY YEAR SINCE 1952. NATIONWIDE, 58% OF MURDER VICTIMS UNDER THE AGE OF 22 ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY WANT YOUR VOTE THEN FORGET ABOUT YOU FOR FOUR YEARS, SIX YEARS, TWO YEARS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. IDEA WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. THIS GUY ADAM SCHIFF, HE IS A CROOKED POLITICIAN. NANCY PELOSI GO BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS. OF ALL THE WASHINGTON SELLOUT THAT HAVE BOARDED , THAT HAVE WOUNDED. THE BETRAYAL OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS UNBELIEVABLE. DEMOCRATS VOWED TO DEFEAT OF SPECIAL INTEREST AND SCHOOLS, THERE WERE SCHOOLS OF ANYBODY IN THE COUNTRY BY FAR. IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. THEY SHIPPED YOUR JOBS OVERSEAS, HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. WE CANNOT GET NANCY PELOSI TO APPROVE YOU MCA , UMCA. DEMOCRATS OPENED BORDERS TO RUTHLESS GANGS, MASS IMMIGRATION WAS HURTS , WHICH HURTS THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY PASSED CRIME BILLS THAT HURT YOUR COMMUNITY. IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU HAVE STAYED SO [INDISCERNIBLE] TO BE HONEST. NOBODY KNOWS WHY. UNDER THIS IN MINISTRATION, ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED AND IT IS CHANGING EVEN FASTER. WE ARE DOING , UNDOING THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY DEMOCRAT RULE IN CREATING NEW PROSPERITY. WE HAVE DONE MORE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THREE YEARS THAN THE BROKEN WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT HAS DONE IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS. WE HAVE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT IF I WOULD'VE SAID TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. IF I SAID THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, I WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCORIATED. LAST MONTH, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HOW DO YOU LOSE THAT ARGUMENT IN A DEBATE? THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, IT WAS 60%, 70%, HAS NOW REACHED THE LOWEST NUMBER EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY RATE HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HISTORIC LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, MOST NEW HIRES ARE MINORITIES AND WOMEN. WAGES ARE RISING REALLY FAST, UP 9% SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT WAS UNTHINKABLE IN THEIR RISING FASTEST FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN? ALMOST 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING 150,000 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN. THAT IS A LOT. WHEN I HEAR 150,000, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT MEANS WE FILL THE YANKEE STADIUM THREE TIMES. WE HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB DESTROYING REGULATIONS AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A SHORT WHILE, WE PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUTS, SAVING THE TYPICAL FAMILY $2000 YEAR AND MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN CONTRACTS AND FINANCING TO MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH HAVE , HAS RESULTED IN 20,000 BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL JOBS. WITH US TODAY OUR CALPINE ENGINEER LOOKING , KELVIN KING. HE'S A GRADUATE OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY WHERE HE WAS ALSO AN ALL-CONFERENCE FOOTBALL PLAYER. TODAY, THEY OWN A GENERAL CONTRACTING BUSINESS. PLEASE COME UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. HE LOOKS SO HAPPY. HE SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. ONLY 80 ONLY 80 SECONDS. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS REALLY COOL OTHER WAY. I AM A BUILDER. WE OWN A CONSTRUCTION FIRM HERE IN AS A BUSINESSMAN I STARTED IT SEVEN YEARS AGO OUT OF MY BEDROOM AND WE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH CASH TO MOVE TO THE BASEMENT AND WE OPERATED OUT OF MY BASEMENT FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT JUST LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE AND OPERATE OUR VERY OWN FROM THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OFFICE BUILDING OVER NEAR THE BRAVES STADIUM. BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THIS PRESIDENT, THE ECONOMY IS THE STRONGEST OF MY LIFETIME. MAYBE TOO LONG TO CONSIDER HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND EMPLOYEES. WE ARE HIRING. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS RELIES ON HER ABILITY TO IGNORE THE DISTRACTIONS WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE POLICIES, DON'T SIT ON THE SIDELINES. YOU GET IN THE GAME AND AS AN AIR FORCE VETERAN, I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOUR UPGRADE OF THE BA HEALTH SYSTEM , THE V.A. HEALTH SYSTEM. IN THE WORDS OF A TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, THE PRIVILEGES OF BEING AN AMERICAN BELONGS TO THOSE BRAVE ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE, THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE BLACK COMMUNITY A PRIORITY AND THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS. YOU WILL GET OUR VOTE IN 2020. THANK YOU. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVERY DAY WE ARE REVERSING TRADE POLICIES THAT HAVE SHATTERED BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS. [NO AUDIO] ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS HELD BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE TOTALLY GONE. IN THE LAST THREE DECADES, 27% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS, PHILADELPHIA LOST 74%, BUT THE DAYS OF SHIPPING AMERICAN JOBS OVERSEAS IS OVER. 10,000 PLANTS ARE BEING OPENED IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE WE TOOK OVER. ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL AMERICANS, WE ARE NOW PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE STANDING UP TO ABUSES AND REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, A GIANT VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS FROM COAST-TO-COAST. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS HAVE COME UP WITH THAT NAME. I DON'T THINK , THEY GO LET'S IMPEACH HIM, LET'S , WE CAN'T BE HIM, SO LET'S IMPEACH HIM. GOOD IDEA. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS ARE BLOCKING THE VOTE ON THE USMCA. THEY WOULD RATHER HURT THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS BEEN HURT , HELP BLACK CONSTITUENTS. WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES IN THREE YEARS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WILL STOP EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE USA. WE ARE THE HOT PLACE WITH THE HOTTEST ECONOMY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. TO KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA, I WITHDREW FROM THE HARRIS CLIMATE ACCORD. DEMOCRATS WANTED TO INVEST IN PROJECTS AND I WANTED TO INVEST IN BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. SO TRUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY ALL GO BACK, SEE HE WANTS TO BE A DICTATOR. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. WE CREATED 9000 OPPORTUNITIES, SOUTH CAROLINA WAS INCREDIBLE. 8 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVE IN OPPORTUNITIES THAT EVERY DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST. THE REPUBLICANS GOT IT PASSED, NOT EASY. WE HAD NO VOTES FROM DEMOCRATS AND NOW DEMOCRATS SAY WE HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND THEY WILL NEVER ADMIT THAT PUBLICLY. I SAID TIM SCOTT , TIM SCOTT YOUR SENATORS WERE INCREDIBLE. IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE EXTENT IT HAS HAPPENED, TO DRAW INVESTMENT TO THESE COMMUNITIES, WE SLASHED THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO ZERO BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE COMING IN WITH IRIS MONEY AND NOW THEY ARE THRILLED TO COME IN WITH MORE. PROPERTY VALUES HAVE SKYROCKETED AND VALUES ARE UP 20%, 30%. WE ARE PROUD TO BE JOINED BY AN ARMY VETERAN AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. HE IS BUILDING A NEW CONCRETE PLAN TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE HOME OF THE BRAND-NEW F-35 FIGHTER JETS AND I WILL BE IN ALABAMA TOMORROW WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. THAT WILL BE A GOOD GAME I THINK WILL STOP , GOOD GAME I THINK. COME ON UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. I CAME READY FOR THIS ONE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR. I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I'M JUST A REGULAR HUMAN BEING FROM ALABAMA AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I GOT A DEGREE IN ALABAMA. I AM STANDING ON THE SAME STAGE AS DONALD TRUMP. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. RIGHT BEHIND US, THE STARS & STRIPES, THE AMERICAN FLAG. I THINK GOD TODAY THAT WE ARE ONE NATION. WHAT IT STANDS FOR IS SOUTH DADE AIR CONDITIONING. IT IS OUT OF HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA AND ORIGINATED BACK IN 1987. WE BECAME KNOWN AND THEN I FOUND A REASON TO BECOME A WAR FIGHTER , SO BACK IN 2009, WE WENT ON AND CREATED A LOT OF JOBS AND THEN THE RECESSION HIT. IT GOT EVERYBODY, BUT I FOUND MYSELF IN DEBT OVER ONE MILLION SOMETHING. THERE IS A REASON THAT GOD DO WHAT HE DO. WHEN I GOT THERE, I MET A FOOTBALL PLAYER, AND AUBURN FOOTBALL PLAYER , AN AUBURN FOOTBALL PLAYER. WE DID SOME THINGS IN ALABAMA THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. I KNOW HE WILL PROBABLY BE ME UP, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE GRANDSONS, ONE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAD HOLES BACK IN HIS HAND BACK IN 1965 AND WE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY. BY MEETING WITH HIM, I WAS ABLE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP DOWN TO A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. CAME HERE AND MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN'T COUNT THEM OUT OUT, SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT STAGE. WE HAVE FOUND A NEW ERA. FOUND A NEW ERA. THEY HAVE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY ZONE. [NO AUDIO] YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE COMING TO VISIT. EVERYONE WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES COMING AND IT HAPPENED THAT AFTER THEY GOT THERE, HE WAS IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE WERE DOING ALREADY IN THE BUSINESSES WE CREATED. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WE HAVE A NEW PLOT IN A NEW OPPORTUNITY ZONE. TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES THAT BECAME AVAILABLE. GENERALLY, ONE OF HIS TEAMS CAME DOWN AND WE HAD A 100% GROWTH PATTERN OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS , PARTICULARLY NOW WE WILL HAVE A 200% GROWTH THE NEXT 18 MONTHS. THIS IS THE NEW ERA FOR THIS NEW VISION AND I CAN SAY HELLO TO THIS AUDIENCE AND THIS NATION. WHILE I'M GOT A YEAR, I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE STATE OF THE [INDISCERNIBLE] BUT I KNOW IT IS STRONG. IN MY CLOSING, I WILL SAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES PRESENT, MR. DONALD TRUMP. GOD BLESS SDAC IN THE NEW JOBS WE ARE ABOUT TO CREATE AND SOMEWHAT, ALABAMA , IN JOB. , WHAT A JOB. HE IS DOING SO WELL IN THE CONCRETE BUSINESS, I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BE A POLITICIAN POLITICIAN WHAT A GREAT JOB. AFTER MY ELECTION, I HEARD FROM COUNTLESS AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. THEY ASKED ME TO GET INVOLVED IN A CAUSE THAT IS DEAR TO MANY OF THEM. IN THIS ROOM, I SEE SO MANY OF YOU, FOR WHOM IT WAS SO IMPORTANT, THAT IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. LAST YEAR, WITH THE HELP OF JARED. STAND UP. HE WAS INCREDIBLE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR MANY YEARS, THEY NEVER CAME CLOSE. INCLUDING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIED. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY. THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TRY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GET IT. WE NEED TO ROLLBACK THE UNJUST PROVISIONS OF THE 1994 CLINTON CRIME LAW, WHICH WAS SO UNFAIR TO YOUR COMMUNITY. WHICH SEVERELY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE ARE ALSO ADVANCING SECOND CHANCE HIRING TO GET REHABILITATED CITIZENS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD BACK TO THE JOB. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE GOING FOR US. THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD WE ARE GIVING CHANCES TODAY THAT YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE. PEOPLE ARE SO HAPPY. EMPLOYERS, PEOPLE THAT PAY THE CHECK EVERY WEEK. THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULT. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT. THEY LISTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS, WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN DOING THIS. WE SAY HIGHER AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIGHER ALL AMERICANS. , HIGER , HIRE AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIRE ALL AMERICANS. THE LAST TWO YEARS, MURDERS IN AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES HAVE DROPPED BY MORE THAN 10%. TO PROTECT THE CHURCH ROLE OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, WE INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HBCUS BY OVER $100 MILLION. [APPLAUSE] THEY DO A GREAT JOB. SOME NEEDED SOME HELP. THEY DO A GREAT JOB. WE CAN'T LOSE THEM. WE ARE DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE HARD LEFT OF REGRETS HAVE BEEN DOING NOTHING FOR YEARS. FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH ONE GOAL, OVERTURNING THE VOTES OF THE 2016 RIGGED ELECTION THAT WE HAD. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, OVERTURNING IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. FIRST IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. THAT WAS THE MUELLER REPORT. THE BIGGEST LIE EVER PERPETRATED AMONG THE , UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. RUSSIA, GIVE ME A BREAK. IT FELT BETTER BECAUSE I SAW THEM TWO WEEKS AGO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID, THAT JILL STEIN, THE HEAD OF THE GREEN PARTY, THAT WILL SEE GABBARD, I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE RUSSIAN OPERATIVES. THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF THESE WOMEN, BUT I KNOW THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. WHEN THEY SAID IT ABOUT ME, IT ME TOO USED TO GET OUT OF IT. IT WITHIN TWO MINUTES. PEOPLE SAID, WE THINK SHE IS NUTS. DERANGED, HYPER PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT, A SINISTER EFFORT TO NULLIFY THE BALANCE OF 63 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. IT'S ALL A HOAX. DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DESTROY THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND THE PILLARS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN THEIR CRAVEN PURSUIT OF POWER AND MONEY. IMAGINE IF DEMOCRATS PUT 10% OF THE ENERGY THEY DEVOTE TO ATTACKING ME AND MY ADMINISTRATION, TO INSTEAD MAKING THIS A BETTER COUNTRY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD DO? THEY DON'T CARE, BUT WE DO. THAT'S REALLY THE TRUTH. I THINK YOU ARE LEARNING THAT QUICKLY. WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA, NO. SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD OUT THE DOOR, TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. IT SHOULD HAPPEN. THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. , SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THEY ONLY WANT TO USE RADICAL SOCIALISM AND THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS SO ANYONE CAN COME IN. THEY HAVE BAD PEOPLE WANTING TO COME IN. WE HAVE STRENGTHENED THE BORDERS. WE NEED VOTES TO GET RID OF LOOPHOLES. THEY ARE CALLED LOOPHOLES. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, COURTESY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE PUBLIC BENEFITS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FOR AMERICANS. FOR THE MONEY WE SPENT ON ILLEGAL ALIENS, WE COULD REBUILD OUR ADVERSITIES , OUR INNER CITIES, FIX OUR TERRIBLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS WANT TO REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OVER THE WORLD, TO PLACES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. EVERY DAY, DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES ARE RELEASING DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS AND GANG MEMBERS LIKE MS 13 ONTO YOUR STREETS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. LAST YEAR, DEMOCRATS EVEN SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, TO PRESERVE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, NEVER HAVE THEY FOUGHT THAT HARD TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY DON'T FIGHT THAT WAY. I SEE THEM. I AM WITH THEM. THEY DON'T FIGHT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE LEGAL ALIENS COME IN, HEALTH CARE, SCHOOLS, I JOKINGLY SAID ONCE, ROLLS-ROYCE IS, EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS AN , A ROLLS-ROYCE. THE MEDIA SAID THEY ALL GET ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THIS IS A LIE. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. THEY DON'T GIVE THEM ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THEY GIVE THEM JUST SHORT OF THAT. DEMOCRATS CARE MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS OR OUR MILITARY. OR CITIZENS ALL OVER. THEY CARE MORE, AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECOME , CARE MORE , AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BECOME FORGOTTEN AMERICANS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THEY ARE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE WAGING AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON HISTORIC VALUES AND TRADITIONS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTACK LAW ENFORCEMENT ERRORS THAT KEEP US SAFE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SAFE. WE WANT SAFETY. WHEN I READ THE LIST OF 10, 1 OF THE LIST WAS THAT IS THE MOST UNSAFE, AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT. LIKE HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE. WE WANT TO BE SAFE. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE, CRUSHER RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND SILENCER PASTORS. PASTORS ARE BEING SILENCE. NOT ANY LONGER, BECAUSE OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. YOU'RE PASTORS AND MINISTERS ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. WITHOUT RETRIBUTION. AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP. THEY HAVE BEEN THE CONSCIENCE OF OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS WANT TO DRIVE FAITH OUT OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND ATTACKED CHRISTIANS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS CHERISH OUR NATIONS RELIGIOUS HERITAGE. WE WILL ALWAYS CHERISH THAT. IT MEANS SO MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY LOST THAT INCREDIBLE GROUNDING. THE VITAL AND INDISPENSABLE ROLE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES AND OUR SITE , SOCIETY. WE HAVE SOME MINISTERS HERE AND PASTORS HERE. YOU HEARD FROM ONE, HE IS AN INCREDIBLE MAN. WE HAVE MINISTERS AND PASTORS AND OTHERS THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL LOOK UP TO WHEN THEIR VOICE HAS TO BE HEARD. THEY HAVE TO BE HEARD. THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT VOICE AWAY. IT WON'T HAPPEN. DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, WHERE IT WAS AFTER BIRTH. THAT'S EVIL. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO STOP LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT. THROUGH HEAVY AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACROSS OUR LAND, YOU DON'T NOT CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALREADY LEFT YOU ALONG. , A LONG TIME AGO. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE RADICAL SOCIALISM, OPEN BORDERS, OUT-OF-CONTROL POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, YOUR JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, YOUR CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS, LIBERAL EXTREMISTS TO RUN YOUR LIVES, THEN TODAY, THEY SAY WELCOME TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HONEST ABE. REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND HARD-WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR AND CREED. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY KNOWS OUR RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND FREEDOMS , LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS ARE GIVEN TO US BY THE HAND OF GOD. GUIDED BY THAT OF TRUTH, DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR , PUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR SAFE STREETS, AND A GOVERNMENT THAT LISTENS AND ENTERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DRAINING THE SWAMP, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING THE CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS, CRONY LOBBYISTS, THEY BRING THE MEN AND THEY PAY FOR THEM. THEY ARE DISGRACING A CLASS OF PEOPLE AND A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M NOT TALKING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. I'M TALKING ALL AMERICANS. THEY ARE DISGRACING US AS A NATION. THEY HAVE DISMISSED YOU, HURT YOU, AND THEY HAVE SABOTAGED YOU FOR FAR TOO LONG. IT IS TIME TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTATORS IN FRONT. WE HAVE COMMENTATORS IN THE BACK AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME IN THE FAR BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE? THEY ARE GREAT. THEY GET IT. THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. SOME OF THEM DID NOT GET IT AT THE BEGINNING. THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THEIR DAY IS OVER. YOUR DAY IS HAS JUST BEGUN , YOUR DAY HAS JUST BEGUN. THAT'S WHY WE NEED EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND EVERY LIKE-MINDED VOTER TO TAKE PART IN OUR RIGHTEOUS CAMPAIGN TO EXTEND BLESSINGS OF ALL-AMERICA TO ALL OF OUR CITIZENS WE NEED YOU TO SHARE OUR MESSAGE OF JOBS, OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW. REACH OUT YOUR FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, CHURCHES AND COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING YOUR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, WHICH WE ARE BRINGING BACK INTO OUR NATION. WE NEED THEM. TELL THEM TO JUDGE US BASED ON THAT. AND ALL THAT HAVE ACHIEVED. WE HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN ANYBODY HAS ACHIEVED EVER. IT HASN'T BEEN DONE ON THE SPEARS FROM THE MEDIA AND LIES FROM THOSE DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO. THEY WANT TO DEFEND. THEY ARE DEFENDING THEIR TURF, BUT IT IS NO GOOD. TELL THEM YOU WERE FIERCE AND BRAVE AND PROUD AND INDEPENDENT. BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY HAS GROWN. I DROVE COULD HAVE SAID THAT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALLER AUDIENCE. PEOPLE ARE SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING. GO OUT AND ENJOY THE , JOIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. GET YOUR FRIENDS AND JOIN IT. WE WILL DO THINGS NOBODY EVER DREAMT OF FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. WITH YOUR HELP, AMERICA'S FUTURE IS OURS TO BUILD AND BUILD UPON AND MAKE EVEN GREATER THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. AMERICA'S DESTINY IS OURS TO REACH. AMERICA'S GLORY IS OURS TO ACHIEVE. WHEN MY ADMINISTRATION AND MILLIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS JOIN FORCES, WE WILL BE A TOTALLY UNSTOPPABLE FORCE. THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. REMEMBER, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LET YOU DOWN. TALKING ABOUT OVER 100 YEARS. WE WILL DELIVER A FUTURE OF JUSTICE, OPPORTUNITY, PROSPERITY AND DIGNITY TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD ACROSS THIS LAND. OUR NATION IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ECONOMY LIKE THIS BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. IT MAKES THINGS EASIER. IF OUR OPPONENT HAD GOTTEN, THIS ECONOMY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU VERY STRONGLY THE BEST IS YET TO COME. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS. I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT COULD NOT GET IN. YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. IT'S MY HONOR TO HAVE BEEN THERE WITH YOU. IT WILL TOGETHER AND ACHIEVED TOGETHER AND SUCCEED TOGETHER. , WE WILL WORK TOGETHER, ACHIEVED TOGETHER AND SUCCEED TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS AMERICA.

Me xico Canada agre ement to r eplac e NAFTA and put this new trade agreemen t in place negotiating tha t agreement was one of President pr esi dent trumps top priorities when he came to o ffice he's gotten it do ne that disa greem ent will increase trade and it wi ll level the playing fie ld for American workers the p res ident wanted disagre ement not just 2 entr ies trade b ut because he thought NAFTA wasn't a fa ir enoug h deal for the Ame rican worker u.s.m. c. a fix is tha t it's the m ost protec tive labor a greement in history of u.s. trade negotiations and we need our Congress i t we ll.

That Work. This is a growing economy and a growing state a growing nati on and it's remark able to.

I t's been 3 years of res ults. It's been 3 years of promises made and promises president promised to rebuil d our milita ry restore the ar senal of dem ocracy and aft er years of reckless budge t cutbac ks that I'm sure y ou felt here in this community Presiden t Donal d Trump deliv er this president h as act ually al ready signed twi ce the largest increases in our natio nal defense sinc e the days of Ronald Reagan in cluding the lar gest pay raise f or our men and women in uniform in more than 10 are now the best equipped bes t trained most technological ly advan ced fighting force in the history t he war and we reminded the worl d of that just a few short weeks ago did n't wait when th e United State s Special Forces desc ended on a co mpound in no rth Syria and to ok out the leader of ISIS without one the president also propose d w ill be by far the largest de fense budget in American h istory $75000000 0000.00 to make the strongest fight ing force in the history of the world str onger Still it would fund a n end strength of more t han $20000 00.00 active and reserve m ilitary personnel pres ident's budge t also modernize o ur armo red brigade to p rovide resou rces for 12 bat tle force ships 2 l arge on man ned surfa ce ships 110 fi ghter aircraft.

You're re ally crafting the me ans for Americ a's finest t o defend this nation an d I know you continue to do it with the care in the concern and the d edication of the people of if and delivered for generations in strengthening our national defense of the last 3 ye a rs. But the people of Wisco nsin deser ve to know. That things are getting a little tied up in W ashington t hese days. While Democrats in Congress cont inue to spend all their t ime on endless investigations in a part i san impeachmen t. They have been able t o find time to fund our national d efense or give us the i ncreases that Pres i dent Trump knows w e need. To really encroach. Furby thing that's happening in Washi ngton d.c. the disgr ace is also w hat's not happen ing in Washin gton d.c. as you know Congress just delayed again a $ 2000000 0000.00 increase in our national defense and because t hey failed to pass a defense bill this w eek. They had to pass a re solution they had to pass a resolution that would. That wou ld make the D epartment of Defense delay new acquisition programs this year and potentially ships that need repair s . And there's real consequenc es to wha t's going on in Washi ngto n d.c.. While they c ontinue their politics as usual. It's ha ving a real impact on the life of the nation an d our na tional defense. Well I th ink the American peop le deserve better and it's time for Congress to put politics Congress want to spend their time on Presiden t Trump and are going to ke ep on fighti ng. And we're g oing to keep on deliv erin g with all of y our help and skill we're going to keep on giving ou r soldiers our sailors our airman our Marines and our Coast Guard t he resources and the equipment the y need to accomplish the ir mission and defend this nation so help stand tall in the worl d again s tand with our a llies stand up to our enemies but he a lso said we could revive the Americ an economy when he and I were campaigning across Wi sco nsin 3 years ago this econom y had grown by more t han 2 percent for the l ast 8 years and people w ere saying that was the new normal the presiden t Donald Trump knew bette r pr esident Donald Trump live right out of the gate in our 1st year we cut taxes across the board for working f am ilies and busine sses just like t his we rolled back mo re federal red tape in this admin istration than any adm inistrat ion in American history we 've unleashed Americ an energy we're no w going to be a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the 1st time in 75 not like I got t o telling y ou and since Elec tion Day busin esses large and smal l just like t his one the growing al l across this countr y 670000 0 new jobs have been created across America jobs in Wisconsi n in Michigan alo ne miss ing Croom remember th e last administration we had a pr esident the Whi te House who was asked what it was go ing to do to bring back manu facturing. I'm a little bit biased here you know I come fro m a state just like Wi sconsin where we we do 2 thi ngs especially well we make thi ngs a nd we grow thin gs right and we actually had a pres ident in the summer of 2016 wh o said that manufacturing jobs 200000 jobs that have be en lost wo uld never be coming b ack to remember he was actually asked what he was going to do to bring manufacturin g back and h e said he says What do you have a magic wand. But we di dn't need a magic wand. We just need a president Donald Trump good paying manufacturin g jo bs right here Wisco nsin it's not just been about manufa cturing you k now over all the unemploym ent rates at a 5 0 year low here in Wisconsi n is ju st 3.3 percent in fact right now the unemployme nt rate is be low 5 percent in 48 states i n this country and as I stand before you today 9 states 9 states across this countr y have the lowest un em ployment levels ever rec orded in just t he last few month s the unemployment rate for women hit a 65 year low and the unemploymen t rate for African-America ns and Hispa nic Ameri cans is the lowest leve l ever r ecorded the Ameri can dream is working for everybody and every American sh o uld be proud. You kno w it's not just been about more jobs it's been about better job . And since Presid ent Trump was ele cted the average Ame rican household ha s seen your disposable income go up by $ 5000. 00 a year. Un der the last administration the average American $3000.00 a year in incom e and you all f elt. And y ou're seeing how i t's all how it's al l improved and wage s have been going up t hey're going up it 's faster than they have in more than 10 years a nd they're r ising most ra pidly the president I c ouldn't be more proud wages today are rising most see it in this great comp a ny I hear about it all over the co untry Karen and I slipp ed aw ay for a lon g day and a half vaca tion about a few months ago. We went down to Sanibel Island Florida you ever heard of it it's right over there near Fort M ye rs Great Plains we were sitting out there on the beach true story had a ball caps on our sungl read a book trying to catch a little bit t ime on. And these 2 big boys came walking b y both wearing Budweis e r shirts man after my own heart. And they did one of them stopp ed and looked at me becau se a local newspape r it said that we were o n the island. And on e of the st op look to me said yo ur pants aren't yo u. And I said yes or I am. And h e said listen next time you see the president he said You tell him t o keep doing what he' s doing because I mad e twice as much money last years I mad e year before. And I said you k now what I'm going to tell h im that word for word and I did. And then he took 2 ste ps away turned back around and said and I don't know what you do the keep grow you see a community thrivin g that's a ll. It's all happ ening for 2 reasons number one because you've got a president who u n derstands. You've g ot on tired ministration great allie s in Congress and understan d what makes the most po werful free marke t economy in history the world work less taxes less regulation more low cost A merican energy b etter and fair trade deals and we've bee n fight ing for me every day. But t he truth of matter i s President I also know the o ther half of the reason that A merica is prosp ering is bec ause fr ankly the work ing men and wo men of America are the hardest working people in the world nobody canno t work the American wor ker and it's people like all of you gathered here that's why I'm really part icularl y excited to be here peo ple I'm told like a lead ship buil der here Marin I'm told he started here is a welder 40 years ago . He later bec ame an electri cian h is son had followe d in his footsteps and j oined the co mpany line like so many others that I 've a lready met today and now this father and son are wo rking side by side on th e l. c.s. Minneap olis St Paul it's a grea t family effort c ontributing to this communi ty contributin g to the defense of this nation so would you join me in showing Chief Polic e also in our mi dst he wore the badge for 30 years before joining this c ompany as your security manager when he d id he join nearly a dozen of his family members who were already here. Weld ers electricians and co mpany spo keswoman it really w as already a family affai r but he brought his leadership skills his bac kground his experien ce to come here and make sure that all y ou create here is pro perly se cured and protected fact I'm told one of his daug hters . Actually met her husband here. That's what we call a bonus. And the y've now been married fo r 5 years and they've got a 3 year old son named Pearson joi n me in thanki ng Jeff score a nd the entire score family for their service to this community t his company an d this nation where are Really the Cleavers sco r e. Wh ile skis and all the other fami lie s and Senate here are just em blematic of a ll of you the truth is what you've proved in this company. Is tha t when we level t he playing field when we allow American bus inesses in America n workers to compete we can compete an d win ag ainst any workers anywhere in the world of you about the promises kept b y this president this administrat ion and I want you all kno w that we re cognize that it's thanks to a ll of you. And that leadershi p and support we've had from prospering like never befor e and this presid ent I promise y ou is committed to ensurin g this pro sperity reach es every Amer ican home but to do that we need to match the right jobs w ith the right workers in the skills in these compa nies also leading in that it's well it's remarka ble to th ink that for more than a year and a h alf there ha ve been mo re j ob openings in America the n there are Americans looking for work more job openings then there a re unemployed Americ a ns. It's extraordi na ry so wor kers in the skille d trades like so ma ny of you here a re in high dema nd it's true and that demand is only going to continue to gro w as this economy is revived and is growing strong er by the day w orkers with your uni que abilities and skills are goin g to be n ecessary to drive a growing American eco nomy. A nd the truth is closin g wh at the experts ca ll the skills gap. Has to be job one and I promise you that you have a president and a vice every American has acces s to educat ion they want to f ollow their dreams when I was governor of t he state of Indiana I was r eflecting on the fact that back back when I was comin g out of high scho ol in th e 1970 s.. Things wer e different I'm sure the y were in Wisconsi n too right I mean ther e are some people he re w ith h air the same color s mine right I mean when I when I we nt to high school there wasn't. We a ll c ame in in the scho ol the same way some of us to turn left and go d own t he study a.p. English som e a situation right and go down to indu strial arts w e ate the same cafeteria we cheered the same tea m we walk ed acr oss the same stage and gra duation day al l right I mean but somewhere along the w ay it is t rue isn't it our high sch ool got out of the business of offering educat ion and training for ev ery American on every p athway and I d on't have to tell the people here at f m m what good paying jobs and great career s there her manufacture and that's why this president has taken decisive action t o make v ocational edu cation and job training more accessibl e than ever before in our 1st year the president ex panded apprenticesh ips and vocat ional training to he lp every American adapt t o this c hanging and growing economy and last y ear we launched with the help of e ven this company somet hing called the pledge to Ameri ca's workers . To en courage businesses in every field to e xp and opportunities for trainin g for American worker s and American jobs by signing the pledge like this company do it companies committed to create training opportunities over the next workers either through apprenticesh ip continu ing educatio n or on the job tra ini ng now w hen the this is I'm reall y excited to tell you thi s when the pledge for America's workers was launched. year goal was 50000 0 training opportunit ies in apprentices h ips . But I got to be honest with you we didn't we did n't hit th at number as I stand befor e you today more than 370 compani es have pledged almost 15000000 tra ining opportunities and apprenticeships you just give the great team here you r c.e.o. aga i n. Give them a ll I think it's here if a man has committe d to 3000 appre nticesh ips and job t raining post right here in this company you and g.m. and all of you fo r this incredible commitme nt to Wisconsin and Mich igan for leading by ex a mple. The t ruth is you know t here are people maybe looking on r ight now I mean there the literally te ns of Americans that m ight be watching this on C.-Span Might be excited to hear yo u know what I go up to Wiscon sin and there's compa nies up there that are rea dy to h elp me get the tra ining so I can work on one of these and I can b e a part of something real ly impor tant not just for my fam ily and for my community b ut for my nation those trai ning opportunities we're go ing to have even mo re people that can fill this jo bs in this growin g economy here in Wiscon sin will be more com peti tive on the world s tage as well I mean the truth is under the pr esident's lea dership Ame rican workers ar e competing an d winning with workers all over t he world President Tru mp promised to wor k on making sure our econo my had the conditions where companies a nd workers could grow and pr osper but this pre siden t as I mentioned also promised to fi ght for t rade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal President Donald Trump has delivered Korea he sign ed 2 new trade agreeme nts with J apan and we're working toward a free trade a greement wit h them an d Pr esident T put China on notic e he said the era of eco nomic surren der is 0 and Chin a is at the negotiating table brix and we're goi ng to work with them we're e ven talking to the Euro pean Union about a deal a close r to home the re's a deal that's done that I want to ask for your he lp on before I slip away and catch a plan e back t o Indian. I don't know if you all know thi s but President when he campaig ned through Wisconsin s o that we can do better tha n NAFTA you know fro m the t ime NAFTA was signed in 1995 by Presiden t Bi ll Clinton w e literally saw tens of thousand s of factorie s close in this cou ntry and jobs open south of the bord er President Trump said we can do better we righ t out of the gate start ed in nego tiations with our neighb ors in Mexico and Can a da and I'm going to tell you present a hard bargain. T he man w ho wrote The A rt of th e d eal one year ago closed the deal and the u s m c a is a win for Wisconsin workers and American jobs I don't have tell your families conce rt about da iry I mean there's a lo t you can go if your friends at work and dairy aro und here there's a lot go ing on up in Canada tha t was really wo rking agains t the vitality of our dairy industry here in th e upper North west present Trump stood Schroe n with Prime Min ist er Trudeau h eld firm and we deli vered we delivered for dairy we delivered a win for American agriculture has bee n down for a year but a gain one more e xample of something Congress ap parently hasn't had time to get to. The midst of everything else they're doing the truth is Speak er Nanc y Pelosi has ha d the u.s. m.c.a. on her desk for a year . She continues to say they're on a path to yes but the truth is Democ rats in Congress have re f used to bring it to the floor. Because I truly t hink if they bring it to the floor of t he Congress it's going to hands it's going to be a win for Wisconsin and a wi n for American workers and I came he re today to say The time h as co me for Demo crats in Congress to put politics aside put America 1st and this Mexico Canad a agreement that we negotiat ed a y ear ago it's going to add about $70000000 000.00 to our economy and create more tha n 17 5000 jobs incl uding we predict that American manufacturin g workers are going to g et another ra ise his wages will continue to in crease as export s expand i n fact f or Wisconsin the u.s.m.c. a becomes law in the United Stat es will increa se its exports of milk and c heese by 68000 tons. S o we need to get this done with the last thi ng I just want to mention to you a nd I wan t to ask for you to get into because the truth is the clock is ticking. We all know there's a big p resident ial election coming n ext year and if you think Congr ess has a hard time getting an ythi ng done when it's not an election yea r just wait for an election yea r t o come so the time has come for Congress to. To act and I want to encourage you here in W isconsin to reach out to your memb ers of Congres s but let me le t me save y ou a nickel you don 't need to call Senator Ron J ohnson because he's leading the charge for the u.s. m.c.a. in to you don't need to cal l one of the rising sta rs in the Republi can Cong re ss 17 aeration Wis c onsin I grew up in a small busines s f amily.

CSPANMP91202075	Mike Pence	2020-01-09	President Trump Rally in Toledo, Ohio	THANK YOU, WANT TO START BY COMMENDING SENATOR SANDERS AND CONGRESSMAN, FOR INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION IN ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR SENDING HERE TO STOP A WAR WITH IRAN. THE CONSTITUTION IS BEEN MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES. WHAT THIS BILL DOES, IS REAFFIRM TWO IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES IN THE CONSTITUTION. ONE, THE CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DECLARE WAR. AND TWO, WITH THE POWER OF THE FIRST. SO WITH THIS ACT SAYS, MOMS AND DADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHO PAY TAXES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WILL NOT GOING TO SEND YOUR SUNS AND DAUGHTERS TO A WAR IN IRAN UNLESS THE CONGRESS HAS ACTED. IT IS THAT SIMPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO SEND THOSE KIDS TO WAR UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS. NOTICE BILLS VERY CLEAR THAT YOU CAN OF COURSE FORUM ACTS OF LEGITIMATE SELF-DEFENSE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM THIS PRESIDENT AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY FROM THE FOLKSY SET UP ON A HILL, IS THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR FLAMES MADE THAT THERE WAS AN IMMINENT ATTACK ON OUR FORCES OR THE UNITED STATES. NONE. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS HE REPEAT OF WHAT WE SAW IN AT THOSE EARLIER CASES THAT HAD BEEN MENTIONED. AS IN VIETNAM AND MOST RECENTLY, IN THE CASE OF IRAQ WHERE PEOPLE MANIPULATED BACKS AND MANIPULATED BACKS AND INTELLIGENCE AND MANIPULATED WELL, APPLICATIONS OF LAW. TO JUSTIFY UNNECESSARY WARS OF CHOICE. SO THIS ACT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT REAFFIRMS THAT THE 2001, AND 2002, AUTHORIZATIONS DO NOT GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO GO TO WORK. ONE THING MARLEY FOR ALL THE WORK OVER MANY YEARS ON THAT ISSUE. BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS PEOPLE LIKE VICE PRESIDENT PENTZ, ALL OUT THE TOTALLY FALSE AND. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] [BACKGROUND SOUNDS] [BACKGROUND SOUNDS] [BACKGROUND SOUNDS] WELL HELLO TOLEDO. . [SCREAMING]. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE BUCKEYE STATE. . . . FOUR YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW LIKE ALL OF YOU, I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN WORKERS, I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR FAITH AND FREEDOM, AND THE AMERICAN FLAG I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERING] AND WHEN THIS PRESIDENT AT, AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TAKES DECISIVE ACTION TO DEFEND AMERICAN LIVES, WE STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERING] [INAUDIBLE] YOU KNOW WHAT BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO HAS GROWN INTO A MOVEMENT. A MOVEMENT OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE. HERE IN OHIO YOU BELIEVED WE COULD BE STRONG AGAIN. YOU BELIEVED WE COULD BE PROSPEROUS AGAIN. OHIO SAID YES TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND 2016, AND I KNOW OHIO IS GOING TO SAY YES TO FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT. IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS OF ACTION. IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF RESULTS. IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT, AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, OHIO. [CHEERING] I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT, PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [CHEERING] UNDER THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WE HAVE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. [APPLAUSE] AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL ISLAM MAKE TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW WE ARE THE LAST ADMINISTRATION SENT PALLETS OF CASH. [BOOING] TWO TERRORISTS IN IRAN, UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [CHEERING] AND WENT ONE AMERICAN LIFE WAS LOST AT THE HANDS OF IRANIAN BACKED MILITIA JUST A FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP LAUNCHED THE FIRST AIRSTRIKES AGAINST IRANIAN BACKED MILITIA IN TEN YEARS. [CHEERING] AND WHEN MILITANTS STORMED OUR EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD, PRESIDENT TRUMP SENDS IN THE MARINES, SECURED OUR EMBASSY, AND THIS PRESIDENT SAID NO MORE BENGHAZI. [CHEERING] AND WHEN AMERICAN LIVES WERE THREATENED BY THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TOOK ACTION AND CUSTOM SOLEIMANI IS GONE. [CHEERING] AND IN THE WAKE OF THAT ATTACK, IRAN RESPONDED BUT THANKS TO THE PROFESSIONALISM OF OUR MILITARY, POLICE SUFFERED NO AMERICAN CASUALTIES AND IRAN APPEARS TO BE STANDING DOWN. [CHEERING] THAT IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE, THAT'S THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERING] NOW THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY, AND HIS WORDS THE UNITED STATES IS ALWAYS READY TO EMBRACE PEACE WITH ALL HIS SECRETS. BUT UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, AMERICA WILL ALWAYS SEEK PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. [CHEERING] SO WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY, BUT TO ENSURE AMERICAN DOMINANCE ON LAND AND SEA AND AIR, AND SPACE, PRESIDENT TRUMP LAUNCHED THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF OUR ARMED FORCES IN 70 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE HAS ARRIVED. [CHEERING] BUT THIS PRESIDENT ALSO KNOWS THAT NATIONAL SECURITY STARTS WITH BORDER SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP WE HAVE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN BORDER SECURITY, APPREHENSIONS ON HER SOUTHERN BORDER ARE DOWN BY 70% AND WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO BUILD THAT WALL. [CHEERING] BUILDS THAT WALL. A BUILD THAT WALL. BILLS OF THAT WALL. AND THIS PRESIDENT AND OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD STRONG FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS THIN BLUE LINE AND ON THIS NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY, LET'S SAY THANK YOU TO ALL WHO SERVE AND PROTECT. [CHEERING] ANTICIPATE FOR THE RULE OF LAW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ALREADY APPOINTED MORE THAN A HUNDRED A.D. PRINCIPAL CONSERVATIVE COURTS AND ON EVERY LEVEL AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU, THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD ALL THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND THE SECOND MOMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERING] AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO THE MOST PRO LIFE PRESIDENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [CHEERING] SO IT'S ABOUT SECURITY, IT'S ABOUT LIBERTY. IT'S ABOUT OUR VALUES, AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S ABOUT JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. [CHEERING] FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. HE WENT STRAIGHT TO WORK. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BORDER. WE ROLLED BACKED RED TASTE TAPE AND HISTORIC LEVELS. WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND THOUGHT THROUGH FREE AND FAIR TRADE. AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS BOOMING. [CHEERING] SINCE ELECTION DAY 2016, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS INCLUDING ALMOST A 95000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE BUCKEYE STATE. [CHEERING] UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT A 50 YEAR LOW. THE STOCK MARKET IS SOARING AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. I MEAN THE TRUTH IS, THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP IN THE STRONG SUPPORT OF OHIO'S CONSERVATIVES IN CONGRESS, WE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [CHEERING] BUT TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT, WE NEED YOU TO DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THAT OHIO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING] FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE JOBS. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE JUDGES. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST FOUR MORE YEARS TO DRAIN THAT SWAMP. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW THE CHOICE OF THIS ELECTION COULD NOT BE CLEARER. STEAKS COULD NOT BE HIGHER. TODAY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY, HE STANDS BY OUR MILITARY ARE WORKERS AND THEIR FREEDOM. HE NEVER QUITS, HE NEVER BACKS DOWN. HE BELIEVES IN YOU AND FIGHTS FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] AND THE CONTRAST IS TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY RADICAL LEFTISTS. [BOOING] WHO WANT HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, A LATE TERM ABORTION, AND SOCIALIST POLICIES THAT WOULD CRUSH THIS ECONOMY. AND WORST OF ALL, AFTER A SHAM INVESTIGATION, THOSE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ACTUALLY VOTED TO IMPEACH OUR PRESIDENT. THEY RUSHED THEIR PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT THROUGH THE HOUSE. REMEMBER THEY SAID IT WAS URGENT, AND NOW NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN SITTING ON THOSE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT FOR ALMOST A MONTH. IT IS A DISGRACE. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS, DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RUN DOWN THIS PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT RUN AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT. [CHEERING] THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T DEFEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN NOVEMBER OF 2020. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAD THEIR SAY IN DECEMBER, SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR SAY REAL SOON. AND COME THIS NOVEMBER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR SAY. WHEN WE VOTE TO SEND PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, FOR ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED DESPITE THREE YEARS OF NONSTOP RESISTANCE, I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, I AM WITH HIM JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY AND I CAN TELL YOU. MEN AND WOMEN OF TOLEDO, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING FOR YOU. AND NOW IT IS OUR TURN TO FIGHT FOR HIM. [CHEERING] IT'S ON. WE NEED YOU TO KEEP BRINGING YOUR ENTHUSIASM, KEEP VOICING YOUR SUPPORT AND TELLING YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS ALL THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PRESIDENT. AND IN THESE DIVIDED TIMES, IS THIS ELECTION YEAR BEGINS, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. HAVE FAITH IN THIS PRESIDENT, WHOSE DRIVE INVISION HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HAVE FAITH IN OUR FELLOW AMERICANS WHO KNOW WE CAN MAKE AMERICA AND OHIO GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND LASTLY, AS THIS ELECTION YEAR BEGINS, HAVE THAT KIND OF FAITH AS WELL. THAT IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM WHO HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS LAST GREAT HOPE OF EARTH, THAT HE WILL YET BLESSED OHIO AND AMERICA BEYOND ANYTHING WE COULD EVER ASK OR IMAGINE FOR IN THE WORDS OF YOUR STATE MODEL, THE PEOPLE OF OHIO KNOW, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. [CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I CAN TELL YOU PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE REAL DEAL. HE IS A MAN WHO SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND MEANS WHAT HE SAYS. AND HE FIGHTS TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I KNOW WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND WITH YOUR STRONG ALLIES IN CONGRESS AND IN YOUR STATE HOUSE, AND WITH GODS HELP. WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE STATE OF OHIO. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG, AND WE ARE GOING TO REELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AND KEEP AMERICA GREAT.

[CHEERING] YOU REMEMBER I WAS HERE A LOT, YOU REMEMBER 2016, WHAT YEAR THAT WAS, RIGHT? [CHEERING] AND 2020 IS GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER, NO DOUBT. [CHEERING] I AM THRILLED TO HOLD THE FIRST RALLY OF 22 MORONI RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. [CHEERING] AND AS WE BEGIN THE NEW YEAR, OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING. WAGES ARE SOARING, WORKERS ARE THRIVING, AND AMERICA'S FUTURE HAS NEVER EVER LOOKED BRIGHTER. [CHEERING] WIT WE ARE THE ENVY OF EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE CREATED 7 MILLION BRAND-NEW JOBS SINCE OUR ELECTION. [CHEERING] AND WE WILL SOON BE REPLACING THE DISASTER KNOWN AS NAFTA WITH THE INCREDIBLE BRAND-NEW USMC A, THE HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OHIO FARMERS, WORKERS, AND MANUFACTURERS. BUT REALLY A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE UNITED STATES, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE AGREEMENT. [CHEERING] YOU REMEMBER I CAME AND I TALKED ABOUT, I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW BETTER TRADE DEALS ARE. WE DID A BRAND-NEW AND WITH KOREA. SO NOW WE HAVE SOUTH KOREA WE JUST FINISHED A BIG $140 BILLION WITH JAPAN ON GENERAL 15th WE ARE SIGNING A MONSTER, A BIG BEAUTIFUL MONSTER, 40 TO $50 BILLION TO OUR FARMERS, THAT'S OUR FARMERS WILL BE TAKEN AND I KEEP SAYING GO BY LARGER TRACTORS. GO BY LARGER TRACTORS, THERE'S NO WAY, I DON'T IF YOU KNOW THE STORY BUT MY PEOPLE WANTED 20 BILLION IN PURCHASES, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S A LOT OF CORN. $20BILLION. AND I SAID MAKE IT 50. CHINA HEARD ME AND THEY SAID OKAY. THEY SAID SIR, THE FARMERS CAN'T PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID LET THE FARMERS TELL ME THAT, TELL THEM TO GO OUT, AND REMEMBER TO GO BUY A BIGGER WHAT? BUY A BIGGER TRACTOR. SO 40 TO $50 BILLION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IN THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE CAR COMPANIES, WE BROUGHT A LOT OF CAR COUNTRIES INTO OHIO, YOU KNOW THAT. A LOT OF THEM ARE COMING IN, A LOT OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT IN. THEY'RE COMING IN FROM JAPAN, THEY ARE COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THIS IS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE THEY WANT TO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES. I USED TO GO AROUND AND TALK ABOUT HOW EVERYONE IS LEAVING, THEY WERE ALL LEAVING. A LOT OF YOU ARE VICTIMS OF THAT LEAVING. THESE COMPANIES WILL EVEN GO TO MEXICO, THEY WOULD LEAVE TO GO TO CANADA THEY WOULD CLOSE UP FROM CHINA. NOW THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK, NEW ONES AND OLD ONES, THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK AND MANY ARE COMING RIGHT HERE TO OHIO. [CHEERING] AND JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT, OHIO JUST HAD THE BEST YEAR ECONOMICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR STATE. THAT'S NOT BAD. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] AND THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER, IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER. BUT WEEKS AGO I SIGNED THE LARGEST EVER INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, $738 BILLION, AND WE CREATED THIS SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE. AND EVERYBODY IS EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERING] USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF DEVASTATING DEFENSE CUTS, WE HAVE FULLY REBUILT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, SOME OF IT STILL COMING IN. WE HAVE EVERYTHING. WE'VE GOT NEW PLANES, WE'VE GOT NEW ROCKETS NEW MISSILES, NEW EVERYTHING. AND IT'S EITHER HERE OR COMING IN. $2.5TRILLION IN NEW INVESTMENTS. OUR MILITARY IS NOW STRONGER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERING] AND IF YOU REMEMBER, THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I TOOK OVER WE WERE DEPLETED, OUR MILITARY WAS TOTALLY DEPLETED. AND BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF OUR MILITARY, HAVE WE TAKEN CARE OF OUR VETS. [CHEERING] WITH CHOICE. THAT WAS A BIG THING. I USED TO GO AROUND AND THE VA WAS A TERRIBLE SITUATION. PEOPLE WOULD WAIT WEEKS AND HE IS RIGHT THEY SAY YES IT WAS. YOU DON'T HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. CHOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU KNOW WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS. FOR 44 YEARS THEY TRIED TO GET ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO WORKS OVER THE VA YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. THEY COULD BE SADISTIC, THEY COULD BE THIEVES, THEY COULD BE WHATEVER THEY WERE, YOU COULD NOT GET RID OF THEM. WE GOT ACCOUNTABILITY APPROVED AND NOW WE SAY YOU ARE FIRED GET OUT. WILL GET SOMEBODY ELSE. [CHEERING] FORTY-FOUR YEARS. [CHEERING] WHEN MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, CHOICE. VA, VETERANS CHOICE. SO NOW YOU WAIT IN LINE AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU BE WAITING IN LINES FOR FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS. YOU COULD NOT SEE A DOCTOR. NOW IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT, YOU GO OUT TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR, YOU GET YOURSELF TAKEN CARE OF, WE PAY THE BILL. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT HAS MADE. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BIT NEWER TO THIS GAME,. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [INAUDIBLE] [BACKGROUND NOISES] [INAUDIBLE] [BACKGROUND NOISES] THAT'S OKAY, GO HOME TO MOMMY. THEY'RE GOING HOME TO MOMMY. THEY ARE GOING HOME TO MOMMY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS. THANK YOU SECURITY. DO WE LOVE LAW-ENFORCEMENT BY THE WAY? [CHEERING] SO WITH THE VA HAGGIS TO GO AROUND AND SAY WHY DON'T THEY DO THAT? WHY DON'T THEY GO TO PRIVATE DOCTOR WORK SOMETHING OUT. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A BRILLIANT PLAN. I SAID I AM TELLING YOU I'M SUCH A SMART GUY. [LAUGHTER] I SAID THIS IS THE MOST BRILLIANT THING EVER. I WENT BACK TO MY PEOPLE AND A SET I HAVE AN IDEA. IF A VETERAN SICK AND THEY CAN'T GET THE KIND OF SERVICE THEY NEED OR THEY SIT NEED A CERTAIN KIND OF DOCTOR, I HAVE AN IDEA, SUCH A GREAT IDEA. YOU ARE GETTING GO OUT TO THE PRIVATE YOUR GET A PICK UP A DOCTOR AND GET YOURSELF FIXED UP. WE ARE GOING TO PAY THE BILL, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THEY SAID HOW BRILLIANT IS THAT. THEY SAID SIR, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT FOR 48 YEARS, BUT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET IT APPROVED. SO IS VERY, VERY DISILLUSIONED BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOOD AT? GETTING THINGS APPROVED AND WE GOT IT APPROVED. [CHEERING] SO WE SIGNED THAT 11 MONTHS AGO, AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT HAS MADE IN TERMS OF YOUR LIVES IN PEOPLE'S HEALTH. PEOPLE WOULD WAIT IN LINE FOR WEEKS, AND SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T VERY SICK, AND THEN END UP BEING TERMINALLY ILL BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET TO SEE A DOCTOR. NOW THEY GO OUT OUT TO GET A DOCTOR AND WE TAKE CARE OF IT WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. [CHEERING] SO WE ARE USING THIS GREAT POWER, NOT TO PURSUE CONFLICTS, BUT TO REALLY PRESERVE, AND I MEAN THAT IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD PRESERVE PEACE. WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS MILITARY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S A GREAT FIGHTING FORCE AND I HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. I REALLY DO. [CHEERING] YOU SAW AN EXAMPLE OF THAT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. SO WE SEEK FRIENDS NOT ENEMIES. BUT IF YOU DARE TO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN GRAVE PERIL. [CHEERING] WE'VE NEVER HAD A MILITARY, WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE WERE LOOKING AT PLANES THAT WERE OLD AND TIRED. FIFTY TO 60-YEAR-OLD PLANES, YOU'VE HEARD THIS STORY, THE GRANDFATHER FLEW IN THE SUN FLUME, THE CURRENT WONDERFUL PERSON FLEW THEM THE WHOLE FAMILY FLEW THEM. THOSE ARE ALL GONE NOW FOLKS, THOSE ARE ALL GONE. [APPLAUSE] IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR U.S. SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES EXECUTED A DARING RAID THAT KILLED THE BLOODTHIRSTY FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, THE ANIMAL KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] AND THE ENTIRE ISIS IS DESTROYED AND HIS TERRORISTS EMPIRE, AND HE WAS A MONSTER, HAS BEEN TOTALLY DEMOLISHED. WE KILLED THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ISIS WARRIORS FIGHTERS, AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF THEM RIGHT NOW LOCKED UP WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. NOBODY HAS EVER DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THREE YEARS. [CHEERING] AND I WILL SAY THIS, WHEN WE TOOK IT OVER, IT WAS A MESS. WE DID IT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT WHEN WE TOOK IT OVER IT WAS NOT GOOD. AND LAST WEEK THE UNITED STATES ONCE AGAIN TOOK THE BOLD AND DECISIVE ACTION TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES AND DELIVER AMERICAN JUSTICE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [CHEERING] FOR YEARS THE SADISTIC MASS MURDERER, QASSEM SOLEIMANI PLANNED AND EXECUTED ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN TARGETS KILLING AND WOUNDING THOUSANDS OF U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS AND MANY, MANY THOUSANDS AND EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE. AS THE LEADER OF IRAN, TERRORISTS CUTS FORCE, SOLEIMANI SPREAD DEATH, DESTRUCTION AND MAYHEM, ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR BEYOND. HE ORDERED THE VIOLENT ASSAULTS ON THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD AND YOU SAW THIS WAS THE ANTI- BEN GHAZI. WE GOT THERE VERY QUICKLY. WE GOT THERE VERY QUICKLY, THIS IS JUST THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WE DID IT EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF BENGHAZI WHERE THEY GOT THERE SO LATE, ALL THEY SAW WHEN THEY GOT THERE DAYS LATER WERE BURNING EMBERS FROM DAYS BEFORE. [CHEERING] WE GOT THERE VERY EARLY, WE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND SAID WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT? AND THAT WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BENGHAZI HAD THEY BROKEN THROUGH THE FINAL PANELS OF GLASS. THEY WERE BREAKING IT AND BREAKING IT HAD THEY GOTTEN THROUGH WE WOULD'VE HAD EITHER HUNDREDS OF DEAD PEOPLE OR HUNDREDS OF HOSTAGES, AND THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I CALLED UP OUR GREAT GENERALS I SAID GET THEM OVER THERE NOW. [CHEERING] AND ONE OF OUR LEADERS, ONE OF OUR REALLY ADMIRED PEOPLE SAID SIR, WE WILL HAVE THEM THERE TOMORROW I SAID NOPE, GET IN THE PLANES RIGHT NOW HAVE THEM THERE IMMEDIATELY AND THEY GOT THERE IMMEDIATELY. [CHEERING] FORTUNATELY, BUT HE DIRECTED THE RECENT ROCKET STRIKES THAT WOUNDED FOR AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS, BADLY WOUNDED AND KILLED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THAT WAS JUST BEFORE WE HAPPENED TO HIT HIM. SOLEIMANI WAS ACTIVELY PLANNING NEW ATTACKS AND HE WAS LOOKING VERY SERIOUSLY AT OUR EMBASSIES AND NOT JUST THE EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD, BUT WE STOPPED HIM AND WE STOPPED HIM QUICKLY, AND WE STOPPED HIM COLD. [CHEERING] SO AT MY DIRECTION THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ELIMINATED QASSEM SOLEIMANI AND ENDED HIS RAMPAGE THROUGH, NOT ONLY THAT PART OF THE WORLD, BUT A MUCH BIGGER PARTS OF THE WORLD, HE WAS ALL OVER. HE WAS A BAD GUY, HE WAS A BLOODTHIRSTY TERROR AND HE IS NO LONGER A TERROR ASKED. HE IS DEAD. AND YET NOW I SEE THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS HAVE EXPRESSED OUTRAGE OVER THE TERMINATION. [BOOING] OF THIS HORRIBLE TERRORIST. AND YOU KNOW INSTEAD, THEY SHOULD BE OUTRAGED BY SOLEIMANI'S SAVAGE CRIMES AND HIS COUNTLESS VICTIMS WERE DENIED JUSTICE FOR SO LONG.

I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. [APPLAUSE] OH TO HAVE SOME VETERANS HERE TONIGHT. THERE ARE SOME REALLY BAD WHEN SOME REALLY SICK ONES. THEY HAVE ONE GOOD ONE BY THE WAY. ONE GOOD ONE. [CHEERING] I HAVE ONE GOOD ONE. BUT LOTS OF BAD ONES. VERY, VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE, AND WE HAVE SOME GREAT ONES TOO WE HAVE SOME GREAT JOURNALISTS AND REPORTERS. BUT THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF DISHONEST MEDIA PEOPLE. LIKE I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE BEFORE. THEY WRITE THINGS THEY KNOW ARE WRONG, THEY WRITES, IF YOU WATCH FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, THINK OF IT. AND THEN THEY GET PULITZER PRIZES WHEN THEY WERE ALL WRONG. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? GET PULITZER PRIZE FOR BEING WRONG. THE PULITZER PRIZE DOESN'T MEAN A THING. IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE NOBEL PRIEST PRICE I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. I MADE A DEAL, I SAVED OUR COUNTRY, AND I JUST HEARD THAT THE HEAD OF THAT COUNTRY IS NOW GETTING THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR SAVING THE COUNTRY. I SAID WHAT DID I HAVE SOMETHING DO WITH IT? YES AS LONG AS WE KNOW, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. [CHEERING] I SAVED A BIG WAR, THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEM. BUT UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE WILL NEVER MAKE EXCUSES FOR AMERICA'S ENEMIES. WE WILL NEVER HESITATE IN DEFENDING AMERICAN LIVES. AND WE WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. [CHEERING] AND IT NOBODY HAS IT LIKE WE'VE DONE IT. AND IT IS WEAK, WE, IT IS NOT ME IT IS WE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS PLACE HOLDS LIKE TEN OR 11000 PEOPLE, OUTSIDE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET IN. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT. [CHEERING] AND I WILL TELL YOU, MAYBE I'M WRONG, BUT THIS IS BIGGER THAN IT WAS IN 2016. BECAUSE, IN 2016 I SAID WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. BUT NOW I HAVE COMPLETED MORE PROMISES THAN I HAVE MADE. I'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED MORE. [CHEERING] RIGHT? FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. AS AN EXAMPLE MANY OF YOU WERE HERE, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL RED HATS. KEEP AMERICA GREAT. THAT'S COOL. [CHEERING] IT I NEVER TALKED ABOUT DID YOU EVER HEAR ME DURING THE ELECTION TALK ABOUT SPACE FORCE? I NEVER TALKED ABOUT SPACE FORCE DID WE EVER SPEAK ABOUT IT, NO. THERE'S MANY THINGS WE HAVE DONE THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT. LIKE RIGHT TO TRY. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT FOR 44 YEARS, RIGHT TO TRY. IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SICK TERMINALLY ILL, AND THEY CAN'T GET MEDICINE THAT POSSIBLY WORKS IN VERY WELL. WE HAVE THE GREATEST LABS AND DOCTORS IN THE WORLD. THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS AND MEDICINES IN THE WORLD. IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING THEY ARE PRETTY SURE IS GOING TO WORK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER SIX YEARS, THEY WOULD TRAVEL TO ASIA, THEY WOULD TRAVEL TO EUROPE, THEY WOULD TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD TO TRY TO GET A CURE BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT SELL THEM THE MEDICINE. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON MAKING THE PEOPLE SICK. I SAID WAIT A MINUTE THEY'RE GOING TO DIE. THEY ARE GOING TO DIE. WHILE SIR WE CAN'T TAKE THE LIABILITY. I SAID THEM WILL DROP A STATEMENT ASSESSING ALL LIABILITY, TAKING ALL LIABILITY AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. AWAY FROM THE HEALTHCARE COMPANIES. AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS. [CHEERING] AND WITH THE GREAT HELP OF THE LOT OF REPUBLICANS, AND WE HAD SOME DEMOCRATS HELP US, WE PASS RIGHT TO TRY. AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS. MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SAVED. YOU KNOW THE DRUG COMPANIES DID LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE THAT SICK BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT THEM. THEN WE WON'T INCLUDE THAT WILL KEEP A SEPARATE LIST OVER HERE. THEY SAID ZERO WOULD YOU DO THAT? I SAID YES I WILL DO THAT. BUT I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RIGHT TO TRY, I NEVER SAID I GOT IT DONE AND I GOT IT DONE. THAT SOUNDS TOUGH THERE'S NOTHING EASY IN THIS COUNTRY. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY WHO IS THE TOUGHEST COUNTRY TO DEAL WITH MR. PRESIDENT. HE USED TO CALL MCDONALD'S AND I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY A LONG TIME I'D LIKE TO SAY 20 YEARS BUT IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THAT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU BECAUSE IT'S TOO LONG. I SAID CALL ME DONALD YOU'VE ALWAYS CALLED ME DONALD. HE SAYS I CAN'T YOUR MR. PRESIDENT. HE'D SAY HEY DONALD SCOTT TO DINNER BEFORE, AND NOW HE'LL SAY LET'S GO OUT TO DINNER. NOW HE SAYS MR. PRESIDENT SIR, HOW ARE YOU. WHAT? HOW ARE YOU? BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE AND HE CALLED AND SAID WHAT YOU'VE DONE HE'S NEVER SEEN A THING LIKE IT. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT. WE ARE ALTOGETHER DOING SOMETHING NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE ELECTION, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF WHAT WERE DOING RIGHT NOW, DON'T FORGET IT'S A LONG WAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. WE'VE GOT TEN MONTHS, THAT'S A LONG WAY. THIS IS MY FIRST STOP OF THE YEAR FIRST MAJOR STOP OF THE YEAR. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] THIS IS IT, LET'S DO ONE OF THOSE CALLS RIGHT NOW DO YOU MIND? IS THERE ANYTHING MORE FUN THAN A TRUMP RALLY? HERE WE ARE. SO WE HAVE THE GREATEST PHRASE OF ALL TIMES MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I AM A LITTLE SUPERSTITIOUS I WILL NEVER END IT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. ICL THIS HATS CHANGING A LITTLE BIT. BUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND I SAID YOU KNOW TODAY, WE JUST HIT THE HIGHEST STOCK PRICE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. SO YOUR 4O1K. [CHEERING] SO YOUR 401KS ARE AT RECORDS, YOUR STOCKS ARE GREAT, BUT WHAT REALLY MEANS TO ME IS JOBS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE HAVE THE BEST JOBS, THE BEST EVERYTHING, RIGHT? SO WE JUST HIT, BUT I CAN'T SAY MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, OUR MILITARY IS BEEN REBUILT WE ARE DOING GREAT NUMBERS ECONOMICALLY OUR COUNTRY IS THE STRONGEST IS EVER BEEN, YOU HAVE FACTORIES MOVING BACK INTO OHIO YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT RIGHT? SO WHEN I SAY MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, WITH ASSORTED MEANS IS WE DIDN'T GET THERE, BUT WE DID GET THERE. SO NOW I HAVE A NEW THEME, IT'S CALLED KEEP AMERICA GREAT. KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [CHEERING] NOW, I AM A VERY LOYAL PERSON. AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT CHANGING THE THEME BECAUSE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WAS THE GREATEST POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY. [CHEERING] I MEAN KIRK AND HILARY, SPENT. [BOOING] SPENT THREE OR FOUR MORE TIMES THEN US. SO CROOKED HILARY YOU SHOULD LOCK HER UP I WILL TELL YOU. CROOKED HILARY SPENT THREE OR FOUR TIMES MORE, SO I WANT TO BE , AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS A GREAT CAMPAIGN. IN I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE IT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE 2016 IN GOA SOMETHING, SOMETHING EVER HAPPENS AS COUNTRIES GET TO GO TO HELL, HATE TO SEE IT. YOU KNOW THE RECORDS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE RECORDS BECAUSE IT USED SUDAFED HAPPENS YOU WILL SEE THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE GOOD. BUT I HAVE TO NOW SAFE JOY WANT TO CHANGE THE GREATEST THEME IN POLITICAL HISTORY? MAKE IT AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN WITH KEEP AMERICA GREAT. RIGHT? [CHEERING] SO, LET'S TAKE A LITTLE APPLAUSE OKAY RIGHT? WE'LL GO MAKE AMERICA GREAT CLAP IF YOU LIKE THAT ARE MOST SAY KEEP AMERICA GREAT CLAP IF YOU LIKE THAT. OKAY READY FIRST, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] READY, KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] USA. USA USA. YOU LIKE ALL THAT? THAT'S LIKE A FREE POLE. THAT'S A FREE POLE, AND WE ARE DOING GREAT IN THE POLLS BY THE WAY. WE SEGMENT TALK ABOUT THE POLLS WE WILL START TALKING ABOUT THAT SOON. WE ARE DOING GREAT IN THE POLLS. THIS IS LIKE A FREE POLE, OTHER PEOPLE WOULD HAVE ALL THIS MONEY AND THEY GIVE SOMEBODY A MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY WILL ASK 200 PEOPLE THAT QUESTION. AND THEN THEY WILL SAY WELL, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS BETTER. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE THING WHEN THAT IS TRUE. I WOULD'VE SAID INSTINCTIVELY, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN COULD NOT BE BEATEN. I HAVE PROBABLY DONE THIS TEN TIMES, I HAVE NEVER HAD IT WIN. IT'S KEEP AMERICA GREAT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO WE WILL USE BOTH. [CHEERING] AND WE ARE GOING TO USE BOTH. [CHEERING] BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THERE IS NO WAY, BUT THIS HAT IS A HOT SELLER WE ARE SELLING THAT HAT LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SOLD A HAT BEFORE. [CHEERING] KEEP AMERICA GREAT, WE ARE GOING TO USE BOTH BUT KEEP AMERICA GREAT, THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE DOMINANT THEME. SO FOR THOSE YEARS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE REGIME. BIG GAVE IRAQ $150 BILLION INCLUDING. [INAUDIBLE] [BOOING] AND A HARD CASH. CAN YOU IMAGINE? 1.7, $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. SO THE FOOLISH IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL FINANCE IRANIAN AGGRESSION WHILE ALLOWING A QUICK PATH TO NUCLEAR BREAKOUT. THAT'S WHAT IT DID AND IT BY THE WAY IT EXPIRES SO SOON THEY CAN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T DID NOT BEFORE. BUT THEY WILL NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. [CHEERING] BY SUBSIDY SUBSIDIZING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS LEADING US DOWN THE PATH OF WAR. WE ARE RESTORING OUR WORLD TO THE PATH OF PEACE. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. SPEED THROUGH STRENGTH. AND OUR COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT AND I THINK SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT IS GOOD WE SANCTIONED THE HELL OUT OF IRAN. [CHEERING] THEY HIT US WITH 16 MISSILES AND I SAID TO HOW MANY, WE WERE READY TO GO. WE WERE READY TO GO. I SAID HOW MANY? HOW MANY DIED QUESTION HOW MANY WERE WOUNDED? SO I HEARD SIR, NONE. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] WE HAD A GOOD WARNING SYSTEM. NONE. HOW MANY WERE HURT? NONE SIR. SO WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WE WERE READY. WE WERE READY. NOT THAT I WANTED TO, BUT WE WERE READY. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT VERY LUCKY. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY GREAT REPUBLICAN LEADERS. AND MAN WHOSE HELP ME RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF VERY SPECIAL GUY REPRESENTATIVE BILL JOHNSON. WHERE IS BILL. THANK YOU BILL. THANK YOU BILL. GREAT JOB. GREAT JOB.

AND A WOMAN WHO IS REALLY BECOME A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, SHE TOOK OVER THIS PARTY, WE FOUGHT LIKE HELL. WE HAD SOME OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD THEIR MIND ON TAKING OVER THE PARTY, BUT THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE AGAINST JANE. [CHEERING] AND THE MAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF MY CAMPAIGN IN OHIO, I HAD A CHOICE OF FIVE PEOPLE. I SAID I LIKE THIS GUY'S NAME. I DON'T KNOW WHY HIS NAME IS BOB BUT DO CHECK. WHY DO I LIKE HIS NAME? I SAID BOB, HOW ARE WE DOING HE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN BIG SUR BECAUSE YOU KEEP HEARING YOU CANNOT WIN UNLESS YOU WIN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. THAT'S THESE GUYS. [CHEERING] AND ONCE I WAS LEADING OHIO BY A LOT IN THE POLLS, THEY NEVER SAID THAT ANYMORE. THEY WERE SAYING IT WHEN THEY THOUGHT I WAS NOT GOING TO WIN BUT WE WERE AHEAD RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. BUT BOB DID A FANTASTIC JOB. AND BOB I CALL HIM UP AND I'D SAY BOB WE DON'T HAVE THE GOVERNOR, WE DON'T HAVE THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S A MINOR PROBLEM IS RUNNING AS A REPUBLICAN. AND HE PUMPED OUT ON US. WE DON'T HAVE ANY AND HE SAID SIR YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE. [CHEERING] I SAID SO BOB LET ME ASK YOU OUT OF CURIOSITY, I DON'T HAVE THE LEADERS WITH US. IS THAT GOOD? OR BAD? HE SAID SIR THAT'S GREAT YOU JUST WENT UP THREE POINTS. HE SAID DON'T WORSE OR YOU ARE GOING TO WIN AND WE WON BY A LOT AND NOW YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE ARE UP A LOT MORE THAN WE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] THANK YOU BOB. AND THANKS TO REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? I HAVE A 95% APPROVAL RATING. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? [CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW WHO'S SET. [INAUDIBLE] WE DO, WE DO, AND RONALD REAGAN AN 87%. [CHEERING] AND THEN ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS BACK THERE, THEY PUT ME IN LIKENESS WITH THE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. SO WHO DO YOU LIKE BETTER? TRUMP OR ABRAHAM LINCOLN? I SAID ABRAHAM. [CHEERING] [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] I SAID WHO DO YOU LIKE BETTER AND THEY DID A POLL, THEY SET I THINK I REMEMBER THE NUMBERS ALL YOU KNOW IS WE WON AGAINST ABRAHAM, HONEST ABE. WE WON. FIFTY-THREE TO 47, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? ABRAHAM LINCOLN. I WOULD BACK TO THE FIRST LADY NICE AT FIRST LADY, I JUST BEAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND A POLE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE PULLS BACK THEN, BUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, I CAN ALWAYS SAY CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY CANDIDATE THAN ANY RAN THAT ANY PRESIDENT OTHER THAN MAYBE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHEN HE'S WEARING HIS HAT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I LIKE ABE LINCOLN, BUT WE ARE DOING WELL. WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT. BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL. OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL. AND WHEN WE WENT OUT, WE STARTED, WE WENT RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE POLLS. IT WASN'T LIKE THESE FOLKS TODAY. THEY ARE 2% OR 3% IN THEIR CLIMBING. WE WERE RIGHT TO THE TOP FROM DAY ONE. WE NEVER MISSED A CENTERSTAGE IN THOSE DEBATES. WE ACTUALLY GOT HIGHER RATINGS, THEY DON'T GET GOOD RATINGS ANYMORE. I SHOULD WATCH, I'M SUPPOSED TO WATCH BUT IT'S LIKE MY JOB TRIED WATCH. WATCH THE COMPETITION. BUT IT'S LIKE WATCHING DEATH. [LAUGHTER] THOSE DEBATES ARE BORING. THEY ARE BORING. YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH THOSE THINGS FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS YOU GOT TO BE REALLY COMMITTED TO THE COUNTRY TO DO THAT. [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE SOME REAL BEAUTIES. DID YOU SEE POCAHONTAS? [LAUGHTER] AND BERNIE, BERNIE IS GOING UP. HE'S SURGING. [BOOING] CRAZY BERNIE IS SURGING. AND BIDEN DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ. HE'S GOTTEN THE WRONG FOUR TIMES. [LAUGHTER] : : WHERE IS HUNTER? NOW, I SAID WE HAVE TO HAVE WEARS HUNTER AS A WITNESS AND THEY SAID WHERE IS HUNTER AND I'M NOW MADE HIS FIRST NAME WEARS. WHERE'S HUNTER? HERE IS A GUY WHO MADE NO MONEY, GOT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY OR THE NAVY, GOT THROWN OUT, HAD NO JOB, NO NOTHING AND WENT FROM THAT TO 19 MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AS SOON AS SLEEPY JOE BECAME VICE PRESIDENT. MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AND WITH ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD DO THAT FOR MILLIONS , I WOULD. [LAUGHTER] HE MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN UKRAINE TOOK CARE OF HIM HOW ABOUT CHINA? HE WALKED OUT WITH 1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE AND NEVER DID IT BEFORE. HE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OIL AND GAS AND MAKING A FORTUNE. WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU HUNTER? I WILL TELL YOU I SORT OF HOPE IT'S A JOKE BECAUSE HE WILL HEAR WEARS HUNTER EVERY SINGLE DEBATE NINE TIMES A DEBATE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEN YOU HAVE MAYOR PETE BOOTED JUDGE AND NO ONE CAN PRONOUNCE HOW THE HELL TO SAY HIS NAME SO THEY CALL THEM MAYOR PETE. MAYOR PETE. HERE COMES MAYOR PETE. DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB. HOWDY DOODY. HOWDY DOODY. PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER ALFRED AND DON'T SAY THAT BUT HE LOOKED MUCH YOUNGER THAN THAT, I MUST SAY. YOU HAVE MAYOR PETE AND GIVE ME A BREAK. CAN YOU BELIEVE MAYOR PETE THIS WILL BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? HOW WILL HE BE AGAINST NEGOTIATING PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA? WE JUST MADE ONE HELL OF A DEAL. YOU WILL SEE THE NUMBERS VERY SOON. ONE HELL OF A DEAL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY DID NOT LIKE THOSE TARIFFS AND THANKED THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AND AMERICA, MOST IMPORTANTLY, IS RESPECTED AGAIN, RESPECTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS NATO HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE PROTECT EUROPE FROM RUSSIA AND THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, 15 YEARS, 18 YEARS AND THE NUMBERS ARE LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. I WENT OVER AND SAID YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR BILLS. YOU ARE DELINQUENT. AND THEN THEY DON'T LIKE ME. THEY SAID WE LIKE OBAMA BETTER. THEY SHOULD LIKE OBAMA BETTER. OBAMA WOULD GO IN AND SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING, APPRECIATE IT, BYE-BYE, I'M GOING BACK TO WASHINGTON. I'LL BE VIOLATING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. I'M GOING TO HAWAII TO PLAY GOLF. I TRIED TO PLAY A ROUND OF GOLF AND IT DOES NOT COST THEM ANYTHING BUT HE FLIES TO HAWAII BUT IF I DRIVE 20 MINUTES IT'S LIKE HE'S PLAYING GOLF TODAY. HE VIOLATES THE CARBON FOOTPRINT BUT JUST THINK OF IT, THINK OF WHERE WE HAVE COME. THINK OF WHERE WE HAVE COME. A GREAT CONGRESSMAN FROM TENNESSEE AND THEY HAVE A GREAT STATE AND VERY EARLY VOTING PROBABLY THE EARLIEST AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW, I JUST LEFT TENNESSEE AND THIS WAS IN NOVEMBER AND THIS WAS THE ELECTION 2016 AND SAID I JUST LEFT THIS INCREDIBLE STATE OF MIND AND I LOVE THAT STATE. SIR, WE'VE SEEN LINES OF PEOPLE THAT DID NOT VOTE BEFORE BECAUSE YOU NEVER WERE INSPIRED TO VOTE AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEVER VOTED. THEY HAD HATS ON OF TRUMP AND PINS FOR TRUMP. TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE THE BANDS ON LIKE A MS. UNIVERSE THAT SAYS TRUMP PENS AND THEY HAVE BUTTONS ALL OVER AND SHIRTS SAME TRUMP AND TRUMP PENS AND I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT. IF EVERY STATE IS LIKE TENNESSEE SIR, I HATE TO TELL YOU BUT YOU WILL HAVE ONE HELL OF A VICTORY AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU DID IT. YOU DID IT AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE YOUR NUMBERS, EVEN BIGGER NUMBERS BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THE ELECTION BUT I THINK THE CROWDS TODAY ARE BIGGER THAN THEY WERE THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. LAST TIME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, ELIZABETH WARREN, SADLY REFERRED TO, SHE OF GREAT INDIAN HERITAGE, REMEMBER I USE TO SAY I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THAT SHE HAS AND I HAVE A SONG. I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT. BUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE IS DOING AND WHAT SHE IS SAYING THE LIVES , LIES AND DECEIT AND FRAUD. WE ARE GOING TO DO SO GREAT AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE SPECIAL. IT WILL BE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS, THE EVANGELICALS CALL SOME OF THE GREATEST PASTORS, MINISTERS, PREACHERS AND THEY JUST CALLED TODAY FIVE OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE AND THEY SAID THINGS THAT WERE INCREDIBLE AND THEY SAID THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE CHURCH THEY CAN REMEMBER SOME OF IT HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 30, 40 YEARS AND THEY HAVE SAID THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ENTHUSIASM LIKE WE SEE FOR THIS PRESIDENT AND FOR THIS PRESIDENCY, ALL OF US, LIKE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE GREAT FRANKLIN GRAHAM, BILLY GRAHAM'S SON, FANTASTIC MAN AND HE SAID TWO WEEKS AGO MY FATHER, BILLY GRAHAM, VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE. BILLY GRAHAM WASN'T SOMEBODY WHO WOULD VOTE AND SAY HE VOTED BUT FRANKLIN GRAHAM SAID BILLY GRAHAM MAY BE THE GREATEST OF ALL, MAY BE THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME HE SAID, MY FATHER, BILLY GRAHAM, WHO WAS VERY OLD AT THE TIME AND TROUBLE AND HE WAS NOT WELL AND HE VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP AT WHAT A GREAT TRIBUTE THAT WAS TO MEET. GREAT FAMILY. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 51 YEARS. AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICANS AND ASIAN AMERICAN ON DEPLOYMENT HAVE ALL REACHED THE LOWEST RATES EVER, EVER, EVER RECORDED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WAGES ARE RISING FAST AND GOING UP VERY FAST AND THE BIGGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE, MAKES ME HAPPY, ARE FOR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 40 MILLION , THINK OF THIS, 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE NOW BENEFITING FROM THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT E, EACH RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF OVER $2200 A YEAR. NOW, AMERICA , THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. IT'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I'M RUNNING. AMERICA LOST 60000 FACTORIES UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. 60000. YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT I KNOW IT'S TRUE BECAUSE I'VE SET IT 50 TIMES AND THE FAKERS BACK THERE HAVE NEVER CORRECTED ME. NO, IT'S TRUE. IF I WERE SLIGHTLY OFF AND IF IT WERE , IF I WAS UP BY TWO FACTORIES THERE WOULD BE A HEADLIGHT DONALD TRUMP TOLD A FIB. DONALD TRUMP GETS TO BE A PINOCCHIO AGAIN. NO, THINK OF IT. 60000 FACTORIES, PLANTS AND FACTORIES CLOSED. THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND CHINA AND THE 60000 , TAKE A LOOK AT A MAP AND PUT 60000 LITTLE , YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE THAT MANY BUT IT IS. 60000 CLOSED. GONE. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] RIGHT NOW IN A VERY SHORT TIME WE HAVE ADDED 12000 BRAND-NEW FACTORIES AND MANY MORE ARE COMING IN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE COMING IN IS WE'VE ILLUMINATED A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS SAVING THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD $3000 A YEAR IN TOTAL INCOME GAINS FOR MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD WILL REACH OVER READY, $10000 FOR A FAMILY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] $10000 A FAMILY. I WANTED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR $10000 AND THAT INCLUDES WHAT WE'VE DONE IN MEDIAN INCOME IN A MATTING AND THEY ARE THE TAX CUTS WHICH ARE TREMENDOUS, $2400 AND ADDING REGULATION CUTS AND THE WHOLE PACKAGE OVER $10000. UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH IT WAS $450. UNDER BARACK OBAMA IT WAS $975, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP IT HAS BEEN $10000. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN THREE YEARS, DON'T FORGET, PRESIDENT BUSH EIGHT YEARS, $450. PRESIDENT OBAMA, EIGHT YEARS, $975. PRESIDENT TRUMP, THREE YEARS, NOT EVEN, NOT EVEN. BUT THREE YEARS, $10000. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW WE ARE GOING UP. WE ENDED THE LAST ADMINISTRATIONS WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE ENDED THE WAR ON CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL COAL AND IT IS BEING SHIPPED TO VIETNAM AND BEING SHIPPED ALL OVER THE WORLD WHILE EVERY DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WANTS TO SHUT DOWN OUR COAL MINES WE ARE PUTTING OUR MINORS BACK TO WORK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CLEAN COAL. WHAT THEY DO WITH GOAL TODAY IS INCREDIBLE. CLEAN COAL. WITH HELP OF ENERGY WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN OHIO THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE WERE NUMBER ONE AND EVERY TOP DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE HAS PLEDGED TO ILLUMINATE AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. HOW DOES THAT WORK BY THE WAY? [CROWD BOOS] THERE IS A STATE KNOWN AS TEXAS AND I ONE THAT STATES BY A LOT JUST LIKE OHIO, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO TEXAS AND SAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR OIL, OR NATURAL GAS ANYMORE. DO YOU REMEMBER BETO? HE SAID I WAS BORN TO BE PRESIDENT AND ANYBODY THAT SAYS THAT AND I SAID THAT'S THE END OF HIS CAREER. HE HAD THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE AND I WON'T MENTION THE MAGAZINE. HE WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND RIGHT AFTER THAT HE CAME TUMBLING DOWN HE IS FROM TEXAS SO HE WAS AGAINST RELIGION AND AGAINST OIL AND AGAINST GUNS. ABRAHAM LINCOLN COULD NOT WIN IN TEXAS WITH THAT PLATFORM. THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLATFORM. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE OIL INDUSTRY AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU SHUT DOWN HALF YOUR BUSINESSES, REALLY MORE THAN THAT. THE REST WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY BECAUSE THE COST OF ENERGY WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE. WE HAVE ALL FORMS OF ENERGY AND WE ARE DOING GREAT BUT THEY WANT TO CRIPPLE YOUR STATE'S ECONOMY BUT THE VOTERS OF OHIO WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. YOU WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OUR AIR AND OUR WATER RIGHT NOW IS CLEANER THAN IT'S BEEN IN 40 YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SADLY, I CAN'T SAY HISTORIC BECAUSE A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE WAS NO ONE HERE. I ASSUME TWO, 300 YEARS AGO IT WAS CLEANER PROBABLY, YOU NEVER NO, BUT OUR WATER AND AIR IS AS CLEAN AS IT'S EVER BEEN AND I TOOK US OUT OF THAT HORRIBLE PARIS ACCORD AND I ALWAYS SAY HOW ARE YOU DOING WITH THE PARIS ACCORD? DON'T ASK. THEY HAVE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THAT WAS PUT IN THERE TO HURT US, IN MY OPINION. IT WAS PUT IN THERE TO HURT US. WE WERE PAYING MONEY TO INDIA AND MONEY TO CHINA AND CHINA DID NOT KICK IN UNTIL 2030. WE KICKED IN IMMEDIATELY AND HAD TO PAY MONEY. RUSSIA KICKED IN AND LET'S SEE, THEY KICKED IN BEFORE THEY WERE WEIGHT, 1996. THAT WAS A VERY DIRTY TIME OF AIR SO WE KICK IN NOW AND IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE. WE WOULD HAVE SPENT TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE WOULD'VE HAD TO CLOSE UP, I THINK, AT LEAST 25-30% OF OUR BUSINESSES. WHO THE HELL WOULD MAKE A DEAL LIKE THAT? RIGHT? WHO THE HELL? YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA AND CHINA AND LOOK AT INDIA AND THEY ALL GOT THESE MASSIVE BREAKS. WE GOT NO BREAKS AND PAIN MONEY AND I SAY SOMETIMES TO FRIENDS HOW ARE THE YELLOW VESTS WORKING OUT? THEY DON'T LIKE RAISING THEIR TAXES AND SENDING THE MONEY TO FARAWAY PLACES THAT THEY'D NEVER HEARD OF. WE ARE IN GOOD SHAPE AND IT TOOK A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO DO THAT AND I SAID I WILL GET KILLED ON THIS ONE AND I DIDN'T AND I WAS APPLAUDED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE GET IT. THE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING AND TIRED TO BE RIPPED OFF BY THE REST OF THE WORLD. THEIR TIDE OF BEING RIPPED OFF BY THE REST OF THE WORLD AND FOR DECADES CAREER POLITICIANS PROMISED TO DEFEND THE WORKERS OF OHIO AND THEN THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON AND VOTED FOR THE SAME GLOBALIST POLICIES THAT DEVASTATED YOUR COMMUNITIES AND SHIPPED AWAY YOUR JOBS. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE, OHIO KNOWS THAT. BUT BUT THE BETRAYAL OF OHIO WORKERS ENDED THE DAY I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE AND YOU SEE THAT. I IMMEDIATELY CANCELED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, JOB KILLING CATASTROPHE WHICH WOULD HAVE DEALT A DEATH BLOW TO THE UNITED STATES AUTO INDUSTRY AND THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT WAS A DISASTER THAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN NAFTA. I ALWAYS SAY THE WORST DEAL AND I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE CAR INDUSTRY AND MANY OF YOUR INDUSTRIES AND THAT WAS A SET UP FOR THE UNITED STATES TO GET FLEECED. THE U.S. MCA WILL SAVE THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY CREATED OVER 100,000 NEW AUTO JOBS AND OUR FACTORIES WILL NOT BE CLOSING AND MOVING TO OTHER FARAWAY LANDS. WE WILL KEEP IT RIGHT HERE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE BECAUSE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT AUTOWORKERS OF TOLEDO AND THE HOPE OF JEEP. HOW GOOD HIS JEEP? I HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER ACTION AGAINST CHINA'S PRODUCT TRADE ABUSES INCLUDING TARIFFS ON $370 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE MADE GOODS MY BRINGING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR TREASURY AND I GAVE SOME OF THAT MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE TARGETED TO OUR FARMERS AND FARMERS DID JUST FINE AND NOW THE DEAL IS DONE AND THE OTHER DEALS ARE DONE AND THE FARMERS ARE DOING VERY WELL. WE LOVE OUR FARMERS. THEY NEVER COMPLAIN. THEY NEVER COMPLAIN. WHEN THEY GO AND TALK TO THE FARMERS, WHAT YOU THINK A PRESIDENT TRUMP? CHINA IS DECIDING NOT TO BUY ANYMORE AND THEY SAY THE FARMERS SAY WE WILL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR A WHILE BECAUSE CHINA AND THESE OTHER NATIONS HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF FOR YEARS AND THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AND WE ARE WITH THE PRESIDENT. HOW GREAT IS THAT? HOW GREAT IS THAT? BUT OUR STRONG ACTION PAID OFF AND WE WILL SIGN THAT TERRIFIC AND FULLY ENFORCEABLE PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA AND AGAIN WE ARE KEEPING THE TARIFFS ON BECAUSE WE WILL USE IT FOR ANOTHER LINE. WE ARE TAKING BILLIONS, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID? WERE NOT PAYING FOR IT BECAUSE CHINA DEVALUED THEIR CURRENCY AND PUT MONEY INTO THE POT BUT WERE NOT PAYING FOR IT NOW THE SAUDIS SAY HE WAS RIGHT AND IS OUR TRADE DEFICIT HAS COME SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN. IT WAS JUST IN THE PAPERS TODAY. THE TRADE DEFICIT HAS COME DOWN AS A RESULT OF OUR ACTIONS STEEL MEALS ALL ACROSS OHIO ARE ROARING BACK TO LIFE. JS W STEEL IS INVESTING $500 MILLION IN MINGO JUNCTION, REPUBLIC STEEL IS REOPENING THE LORRAINE MILL THAT THEY IDLED IN 2016, CHARTER STEEL IS BUILDING 81 UNDER $50 MILLION MILL IN CUYAHOGA HEIGHTS AND $85 MILLION IS BEING INVESTED IN A FACILITY IN MARION, OHIO. THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THAT. THE STEEL INDUSTRY WAS DEAD AND NOW IT IS VIBRANT. ALL TOLD, AMERICAN STEEL COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY MAKING $13 BILLION WORTH OF NEW INVESTMENTS ALL ACROSS OUR NATION. THINK OF THAT. THEY WEREN'T INVESTING TEN CENTS CENTS. THE INDUSTRY WAS DEAD AND NOW IT'S VIBRANT. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER NATIONS WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION AND FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHILE WE ARE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE WASTING AMERICANS TIME WITH DEMENTED HOAXES AND CRAZY WITCHHUNTS AND THINK OF IT. FROM THE DAY I CAME DOWN THAT ESCALATOR IT STARTED. WHO THE HELL ELSE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE STUFF? DO I GET SOME CREDIT FOR THAT? TWO MOST GUYS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CORNER WITH THEIR THUMB IN THEIR MOUTH SAYING MOMMY, MOMMY, TAKE ME HOME. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS WE ARE FIGHTING TODAY ARE THE SAME ONES WHO TOOK A SLEDGEHAMMER TO OHIO JOBS IN FACTORIES AND DESTROYED YOUR FACTORIES AND DESTROYED YOUR JOBS THEY ARE LOSING AND WE ARE WINNING AND AMERICA'S COMBAT CONTINUES FULL SPEED AHEAD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ON NO ISSUE HAD DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS FOUGHT FOR TRADE THEN THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. FAR LEFT RADICAL POLITICIANS SUPPORT DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, DEMONSTRATING THEIR CONTEMPT, SCORN AND DISDAIN FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY. THESE JURISDICTIONS RELEASE DANGEROUS VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS OUT OF THEIR JAILS DIRECTLY ONTO YOUR STREET WHERE THEY ARE FREE TO ROB, ATTACK AND KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS BUT WE STOPPED IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AND BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATS OPEN BORDER POLICY THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS AND THEY WANT PEOPLE FLOWING. COME ON IN, COME ON IN. INNOCENT AMERICANS ARE BEING BRUTALIZED AND MURDERED BY ILLEGAL ALIENS CRIMINALS. ONE KEY EXAMPLE HERE IN OHIO THAT YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WENT ON A DEADLY CRIME SPREE ATTEMPTING TO RAPE A 14 -YEAR-OLD GIRL THEN RAPING AND MURDERING A 60 -YEAR-OLD WOMAN THEN IS SHOOTING ANOTHER WOMAN WHO TOOK A SHORTCUT THROUGH THE PARK AND WAS WALKING WITH HER CHILDREN AND FINALLY THE POLICE CAME. WE LOVE OUR POLICE. THEY WERE ABLE TO APPREHEND THIS TERRIBLE CRIMINAL. THANKS TO DEMOCRAT POLICIES MS 13 GANG MEMBERS ARE THE WORST. WE ARE ALLOWED TO INFILTRATE THE COUNTRY. I CALLED THEM ANIMALS AND NANCY PELOSI SAID THEY ARE NOT ANIMALS. THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER DISTRICT. HER DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE MOST DISGUSTING, DIRTIEST AND USED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY BUT NOW IT'S A DISGRACE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. DRUG NEEDLES ALL OVER THE PLACE, THE HOMELESS ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF, TENSED DOWN, MAJOR THOROUGHFARES, WHAT HAPPENED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN PARTICULAR HURT , HER DISTRICT AS SHE LIVES IN THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE BUT THEY TERRORIZED OUR CITIZENS INCLUDING KILLING THEIR VICTIMS WITH MACHETES. MS 13. THEY KILLED HIM WITH MACHETES. DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'S MORE PAINFUL THAN USING A GUN. FEDERAL AUTHORITIES RECENTLY DISCOVERED AND ROUNDED UP MORE THAN 20 FILE MS 13 GANG MEMBERS IN CENTRAL OHIO AND THEY WILL BE SENT TO JAIL OR FRANKLY, IF THEY HOLD THEM, I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HOLD THEM, THEY WILL BE SENT THE HELL BACK HOME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LAST YEAR ALONE ICE OFFICERS, WHO BY THE WAY OUR HEROES, BRAVE PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND YOU COULD DO IT OVER THERE. MOST OF YOU , THEY HAVE THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE KILLERS AND OUR GUYS ARE HERE AND THEY WANT TO CALL THEM NESTS.

THEY GET SCORNED AND WE TAKE OUT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS 13 NUMBERS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THEY THROW THEM INTO THE BACK OF A VAN AND WE GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ICE OFFICERS WORKED WITH OHIO POLICE TO REMOVE 1280 DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS FROM YOUR STREET AND YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT IS NOW AND DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM OVER THERE? GO AHEAD. TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME. GOOD. THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. DON'T FORGET THESE PEOPLE HERE, UNLIKE YOU UP THERE, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THREE DAYS SO THEY WILL BE , I DON'T KNOW. IF I HAD TO WAIT THREE DAYS I THINK I WOULD LIKE YOUR SEATS BETTER. I LIKE YOUR SEATS BETTER. BUT DEMOCRATS STAND FOR CRIME, CORRUPTION AND CHAOS. REPUBLICANS STAND FOR LAW ORDER AND JUSTICE. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE SAW , WE DO NOT SIDE WITH LAWBREAKING CRIMINAL ALIENS. WE ARE REMOVING THESE ILLEGAL CRIMINALS AND GANG MEMBERS FROM OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS AND IS SENDING THEM HOME AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM BACK IN AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT IT IN TWO SECONDS THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 75% SINCE MAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, CATCH AND RELEASE , WE CATCH THEM, TAKE DOWN THEIR NAME AND THEN WE REALLY SEPARATE WHAT CRAP IS THAT? THESE ARE THE POLICIES WE INHERITED. YOU CATCH SOMEBODY, TAKE THEIR NAME AND SAY PLEASE COME BACK IN THREE YEARS AND WE RELEASE THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT EVERYONE GETS SUED. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE. WHAT ABOUT THE LOTTERY? VISA LOTTERY? WHAT ABOUT THIS? THEY PUT THEIR , THESE PEOPLE GO TO AMERICA AND I WILL NOT USE NAMES BECAUSE I WILL BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING BUT FROM HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR WE HAVE ONLY IN OHIO COULD THAT HAPPEN. [LAUGHTER] WHO IS THE MAN THAT DID THAT? [LAUGHTER] WHO IS THAT? ANYWAY, AND HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA THEY HAVE THIS LOTTERY AND THE PEOPLE I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WE MADE GOOD THINGS. THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THEIR PEOPLE BACK. THEY WOULD SEND THEM HERE AND GOING TO OUR COUNTRY AND WE BRING THEM BACK UNDERPASS AND MINISTRATIONS AND AFTER THAT THEY WOULD SAY WERE NOT TAKING THE BACK AND WERE NOT TAKING THEM BACK SO TAKE THEM THE HELL OUT OF HERE WERE NOT LETTING YOU LAND YOUR PLANE SO WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT CLIENT PLANE OVER TRYING TO GET A COUPLE PRISONERS, BAD PEOPLE BACK, NOW THEY TAKE THEM BACK.

THEY CANNOT GET THEM BACK AND WE TAKE OVER THESE ABSOLUTE THUGS AND THESE GANG MEMBERS AND WE BRING THEM BACK AND THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM WE CANNOT LAND THE PLANE OR GET ANYTHING THROUGH THE BORDER AND THEY COME TO THE BORDER THIS WAY BUT NOT THAT WAY. NOW THEY TAKE THEM BACK AND THEY BEEN GREAT. NOW WE PAY THEM A LOT OF MONEY, $500 MILLION A YEAR BY YEAR, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? I SAID LOOK, WE WILL NOT PAY ANY MONEY ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TREATING US RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY'VE BEEN GREAT. THEY'VE BEEN GREAT. THEY TAKE THEM BACK. HOW MANY WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THEM BACK? HERE IS THE BIG THING. YOU READ IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY IN THE FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WE WON THE BIG AND BEAUTIFUL LAWSUIT WHERE THEY WERE SUING US, THE WALL IS BEING BUILT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE BUILT ALREADY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AND WE ARE RELEASING $4 BILLION OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION FUNDS TO BUILD THE BIGGEST SECTION OF THE WALL AND IT'S LITERALLY BEING SIGNED NOW AND WILL BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION VERY SHORTLY IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'VE ALREADY BUILT OVER 100 MILES OF WALL, HUNDRED MILES. BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF THE WALL BUILT AND IT'S ALREADY HAVING A BIG IMPACT. HOW ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS? WALLS DON'T WORK. WE WANT TECHNOLOGY. AS A BUBBLE YOU DO CONNECT THEY WANT DRONES. WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUSHING THE CARAVANS AND HAVING A DRONE FLY AROUND WILL NOT HELP YOU TOO MUCH. OKAY. NOTHING LIKE THIS. FIVE YEARS AGO THE DEMOCRATS ALL WANTED TO WALL BUT THEY NEVER COULD GET IT BUILDS. THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BUILD IT. I DO. I THINK WE BUILT 500 MILES AND WE HAVE MORE UNDER CONTRACT BUT WE WON OUR BIG CASE. THEY SAID SIR, WE HAVE GOOD NEWS. THEY OVERTURNED A HORRIBLE DECISION FROM THE COURT AND NOW YOU CAN FUND THE REST OF THE WALL I SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THEY WANT TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS AND SANCTUARY CITIES IN THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE STONE COLD CRAZY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT IS INTERESTING THAT AS I AM SAYING THIS STUFF THEY WANT CRIME AND CHAOS BUT I SAY NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HATE ME. THEIR POLICIES ARE A DISASTER. THEY ARE BAD POLITICIANS AND HORRIBLE POLICIES BUT THEY STICK TOGETHER AND THEY ARE VICIOUS. THEY ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY DO TO PEOPLE IS A DISGRACE BUT THEY STICK TOGETHER AND THE REBEL BEGINS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, REPUBLICANS WE WERE 196-NOTHING IN THE HOUSE AND I HAVE A FEELING THE SENATE WILL BE GREAT ALSO. WE TOOK IN THREE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CONGRESSMAN ANDREW LEFT THEIR PARTY AND SIGNED ON FOR OUR PARTY. WE'VE DONE IS THAT NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING THEIR CUES FROM THE SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS AND THAT GIRL. [CROWD BOOS] OMAR, AOC, TO LEAVE, ISN'T SHE A NICE WOMAN? WHAT A GROUP BUT THEY ARE THE LEADERS OF THE PARTY. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT'S HOW THEY GOT INTO THIS IMPEACHMENT, THE LEADERS OF THE PARTY ARE THIS AOC. [CROWD BOOS] TALIB AND OMAR. AND PELOSI MEETS THEM AND SHAKES AND QUIVERS AND IS VERY , BUT YOU KNOW WHO THE LEADER OF YOUR PARTY IS, ALL OF YOU. YOU ARE THE LEADER OF YOUR PARTY. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING A SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE THAT WOULD STRIP 180 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS AND MASSIVELY RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS. A LOT OF YOU HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. THEY WILL TAKE THEM AWAY FROM YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE DOING THIS AND I DID IT WITH , I CAME UP WITH HIS GREAT NAME AND THEY CAME UP WITH DIFFERENT SOFTLY SAID SHE WAS A TOTAL FRAUD AND EVERYONE BELIEVE ME AND SHE WENT DOWN BUT THEN SHE CAME OUT AND IT DOESN'T HELP ME TO DO IT A YEAR AND HALF BEFORE THE ELECTION. THAT'S WHY WITH THE GREEN NEW DEAL I WANT TO SAY GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK IT AND THEN SAY WE WILL NOT USE THAT. I LIKE IT WHEN THEY SAY NO LONGER CAN YOU FLY AIRPLANES, NO LONGER CAN YOU HAVE COWS IN THE PASTURE AND NO LONGER CAN WE DO ANYTHING, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANYMORE. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, I LOVE IT, IT'S GREAT AND SHOULD BE DEBATED SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY SERIOUSLY WE WILL NOT TALK BADLY ABOUT THEM AND WE WILL SAY IF THEY ASK ME ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY A GENTLEMAN JUST ASKED ME BACKSTAGE AND SAID IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION I WILL LET YOU KNOW THE FACTS AND THIS DOES NOT MATTER WHERE WE ARE TOO FAR AHEAD OF THE ELECTION. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, THAT'S THE BEAUTY, IT'S AMAZING THAT I SEE THIS CONGRESSMAN WHO HAS BEEN THERE AND WHITE HAIR, BEAUTIFUL WHITE HAIR, NOPE, NOT YOU. [LAUGHTER] HE'S WITH AOC. HE IS SAYING YES, WE HAVE TO GO AND IT'S A GREEN NEW DEAL AND I'M SAYING IS HE FOR REAL? I DON'T KNOW IF HE BELIEVES IT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR 20 YEARS IN CONGRESS AND I'VE SEEN HIM AND KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT AND HE'S ACTING LIKE HE BELIEVES IT BUT WE WILL TAKE OUR TIME AND RELAX IN ABOUT YOU WILL JOIN SOME RALLIES ABOUT ONE MONTH BEFORE AND YOU WILL HEAR THE REAL FACTS BUT I'M TIRED OF TALKING THEM OUT OF THINGS TEN MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION. BERNIE SANDERS HEALTHCARE PLAN WOULD COST OVER $32 TRILLION, MORE MONEY THAN WE MAKE IN FIVE YEARS. THAT'S MORE MONEY THAN WE WILL EVER MAKE. HE IS INDEED CRAZY, NO, NO, LET ME TAKE THAT BACK. IT'S A GREAT PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. SURE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER HIS PLAN STRONGLY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE FAKE NEWS WILL DO. THEY WILL TAKE MY LAST WORDS AND HIS GREAT PLAN WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IT STRONGLY AND THEY WILL CUT EVERYTHING OUT IN THE FRONT AND SAY DONALD TRUMP IS IN FAVOR OF BERNIE SANDERS GREEN NEW DEAL. [CROWD BOOS] THEY CAN DO MORE WITH THE TAPE THAN THEY CAN WITH A NEWSPAPER. THEY WILL DO THAT BUT YOU WILL SEE IT. TRUMP SUPPORTS THIS PLAN. THEY ARE SICK. REPUBLICANS WILL DEFEND MIDDLE-CLASS TAXPAYERS AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR OF YOUR CHOICE. WE WILL PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIAN. YOU WILL HAVE YOUR PHYSICIAN. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE TERM BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] RADICAL MCGRATH'S ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE STILL HAVE THAT AMERICAN DREAM.

'S ON THEM TO CHINA. PLEASE SEND US 200 TANKS AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEND YOU ANY TANKS AND WE WILL KICK YOUR ASIS. WE GOT TO MAKE OUR OWN TANKS. YOU GOT TO MAKE OUR OWN TANKS. I DID SOMETHING BASED ON MY INSTINCTS. THOSE INSTINCTS SOMETIMES WORK BETTER THAN ANYTHING. BASED ON MY INSTINCT I SAID YOU CAN'T CLOSE THIS PLANT AND I WENT TO THAT PLANT AND SPENT TWO, THREE HOURS TALKING TO THOSE WHO WORK THERE AND I LOOKED AT THE HYDRAULICS AND I LOVE THE WHOLE THING, THE WORLD OF TRACTORS AND ALL THAT STUFF AND I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT AND I LOOKED AT THE CARBINES AND THE METAL AND HOW PERFECT EVERYTHING WAS IN THE TARIFFS AND HOW PERFECT IT FIT AND IT WOULD FIT WITHIN 1100th OF AN INCH AND I SAID HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS ANYPLACE ELSE AND WE WILL BE EXPANDING ON MILITARY REBUILDING SO WITHOUT WILL MAKE OUR TANKS AND I SAID KEEP IT OPEN AND IT WAS ALL CLOSED AND IS ANYONE HERE FROM LIMA? RIGHT. IT WAS )-RIGHT-PARENTHESIS THEY ANNOUNCED IT WAS CLOSED AND IT WAS ALL SET TO CLOSE AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T CLOSE THIS PLANT AND THE NUMBERS I JUST GAVE YOU WERE MAKING ALMOST 500 TANKS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL NEVER REOPEN A PLACE LIKE THAT AND YOU NEVER COULD HAVE GOTTEN THOSE WORKERS THEY ARE SKILLED PEOPLE AND IF YOU DID IT WOULD COST YOU BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO IT AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS WHAT YOU HAVE SO THAT WAS SOMETHING I'M DEAD THAT I'M PROUD OF THAT I REALLY OVERRODE A LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO CLOSE IT. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE FURTHER RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. FIFTY-TWO YEARS.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A LOT OF CROOKED PEOPLE. DISGUSTING CROOKED PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, POVERTY TO PROSPERITY AND TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULTS IN MORE PRODUCTS, PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. NOBODY KNEW THAT.

Mexico i s doing mor e tha n ever b efore to secure their southern border. And o ur how about this appr ehensions today A re dow n by mo re than 80% from one year a go on our so uthern bord er. An d I d idn't for get We've alrea dy started to b uild that wall 1 00 miles and c ounting and trust me, w e' re going to build it all. An d as we secure our border as we uphold the rule of law, Let me make you th is other pro mise As the gra ndson of a n Iri sh immigrant wh o came through Ellis Island in 1923. Once we secure our border, we're goi ng to pass immi gration reform that puts Am erica first. We're g onna have a merit based immi gration syste m and fix this immigrati on system once and for all, w e're go nna do it. We're gonna do. And let me also save t o support the rule of la w.

O ka y. And on a day, o n a da y wh en dem ocrats in the se nate actually voted down legislation that would protect the li ves of Ch ildren that sur vive abortions. I coul dn't be more pr oud to serve as vi ce president to a president who s tands for the righ t to life. Think abo ut that. And today democr ats in the Unite d States Sen ate voted down the born alive infant protection. And ma ny democrats inclu ding th e democrat governo r of Virginia, actual ly openly advocated and fant asize. A nd as I stand before you today, y ou know, just recognize this. Every on e of the leading democrats running for president h as actually said there's no room for pro life american s in today's Democr atic Party. Mhm. So let me say this .

A nd every pro life american is welc ome. Yeah, so it's about se curity. It's been about our liberty and it's been about our most che rished values. And on e other thing unde r this preside nt. It's been abo ut job s, jobs, jobs from the first d ay of this a dministr ati on. Preside nt trump said we c ould revive the ameri can economy. Remember the last administration, We had a p resident in August of 2016 wh o looked a t a s tate like Mi chiga n or my home state of Indiana and the loss of 0.5 milli on manufacturing jobs. What m agic wan d do you h ave? Well, we didn't ne ed a m agic wand. We ju st needed president donal d trum p in the White House. This president went stra ight to work wit h ou r, with our allies in C ongress, in cluding so me great conserva tives from here in m ichigan. We c ut taxe s a cross the board for work ing families and businesses large and small. W e rolled back more feder al red tape than any adminis trati on in history. We u nleashed american energy and we fought for free and fa ir tr ade. Nafta is gone . The U. S. M. C. A. Is here. That's a big dea l. And now as I st and before you today, I don't have to t ell you here in michigan, the am erican economy is bo oming Since electio n day 2016. Almost eight m illion jobs have been created by businesses large and small, including 100 a nd 2000 jobs right h ere in the Great Lak es State . And wages arise, wages are finally going u p agai n. And what mean s the most to the president and me is wag es are rising mo st rapidly for har d working b lue collar americans.

Yeah , tr ue, yeah, yeah. An d then he walked away, had a warm smile on his fac e and turned ba ck and h e said, I d on't kn ow what you do, but keep doing what you're doing t o. And I told him I would, I mean I'm telling you the american peopl e know it. I mean thank s to your support. Thank s to the confidence michi gan place in t his presiden t and this president's l eadership in three short years, we 've made America great aga in. Y eah , no idea. Yeah. You got it to keep America great . We need michigan to decide rig h t her e and right now that you're going to vote f or four more years for president donald trump in the whit e house. Th at's how we keep America Great. And think abou t it when you're out t alk ing t o your neighbors and friends sa y, you know, I ran into mike the other day in Troy and he was ta lking to me about this, think about it, w rite this down. If you're taking notes , four more years means more j obs, four m ore years means more judges four mo re years means more support for our troop s and it's g onna take at least four more years to dra in that swamp. T hat's, we're draining. Yo u know, the choice in this e lection couldn't b e clear. Bu t honestly, men and women in michigan, the stakes coul dn't be higher today. Y ou have a presiden t who loves this cou ntry, s tands by our military , our workers , o ur freedoms, he belie ves in yo u an d he be lieves in everything that's always made America great. And he fights for you every day and then you got the se democrats r unning for presid ent. I mean, did y ou all see t hat? You'l l see that deb ate in las Vegas last week. Ye ah, I didn't wa tch all of it either . I mean that wasn't a democrat deb ate. That was a dem olition derby. W hat a train wr eck. Now look, midwest, we know what a de molition d erby is, right and it makes a lot of sound over. Seri ously. I mean, you kn ow, I gr ew up in a small town, county fair comes to town, right? So everybod y with the creamiest cars i n town would driv e them into the infield and crash them into eac h other until only on e was driving. So now you've got all these democrats wi th the creami est ideas in politics smashing i nto each other an d eventually there 'll stil l be one st ill running. But I think we al l know h ow this is gonna end . Yeah, t here's gonna be a monster truck with a T on t he hood that' s gonna dri ve int o the infield and ro ll over t he top of the house. That What's that? Mhm. Right. You know? Yes, I me an, you k now, th e med ia has been spe nding the last few days try ing to figure out who wo n the debate. So let's help them out. President donald tr ump, won the democrat debate in a knockout no c ontest, lights out, it's gonna happen again tonight. You know, the truth is t oday's Democrat ic Party has been taken over by radical l eftists. I actually actua lly sta rted in politics as a te enager in the Democratic Party. Did I was the youth, I was the youth, I was the youth democra t party coordinator in Bartholome w County i ndiana, I was I was, but I heard the vo ice of my second favorite P resident Ronal d Rea gan and I knew I belo nged to the Republican Party. But when I se rved in Congress for 12 years, you know, I knew m any of the democ rats, but I gotta tell you, I don't recognize the Democratic P arty today , the Democratic Party today is dominated by people that wa nt to raise taxes, have open bor ders, supp ort late term abortion and socialist po licies that would crus h our economy. I mean, it' s a mazing to t hink the democrats f ront runner boas ts o f being a Dem ocratic socialist and he is h e a ctually recently prais ed the literacy program u nder t he dictat orship of Castro in cuba Ye ah. And another one of t heir candidates actually s aid that he coul d teach anybody to farm. H e s aid you dig a hole, put seed in it, put dirt on top of it, add water and up comes corn. Bye. Well, I don't know what's a more ignorant state ment believing t hat socialism works or that farmin g is easy. I mean, it's a maz ing truth is when you look at their radical agenda , you can see why democrat s have spent the last three years trying to run down this presi dent b ecause they know t hey can't run aga inst this president. Th ey tried to impeach our president because they kn ow they can't defeat Pr esident Donald Trump in Novembe r of 2020. S o I want to enc ourage a ll of you and ev ery day that r emains be tween no w an d e lection d ay.

I have to tell y ou folks, I hav e faith, have fa ith in this preside nt who I served with every day, whose drive and vision have made America great again and they're going to m ake this co untry greate r than ever before.

So I wa nt to thank you. I w ant to thank yo u on our be half. But let me also extend thanks and greetings from a friend of mine, a man who loves the co mmonwealth of p ennsylvania. I told him t his morning tha t I was headed to the keystone state and to be honest with you, I tho ught he sounded jus t a little bit jea lous. So allo w me to bring greetings a nd gratitude from the 45th p resident of the United States of America. President Donald Trump really is a privilege to be her e on the president's beha lf tod ay. Not just to say thank yo u, but to be ou t among peopl e across the Pittsbu rgh area. Today. It even stopped David's diner for maybe the b est Reuben I've eve r had i n my life. And I'm here to t ell you pennsylv ania a gr eat ameri can combat has begun and you're leading as I stand before you today , every sta te in Amer ica has already beg un to reopen for bu siness. And nearly three quarters of Ameri ca's small businesses have also begun to r io, building on a s tron g foundation That t his president laid over the last three years t hat saw the creation of m ore t han seven million job s. Following our efforts to cut t axes roll back regu lation, fight for free an d fair trade and un leash american ene rgy. I'm pro ud to report to you that On this day , one week ago the pr esident and I stood in the rose garden and we' re pro ud to announce that in th e month of May. Thanks to har dworking americ ans. Like all of you, our nati on saw the largest one month increase in jobs in american history. I gotta te ll you, I w as, I was preparing to b e on television that mo rning and I was here wh en all the economists were pre dicting they were all talki ng about the fact that they thought we might lose Eight million more jobs in these cha llenging times and that t he unemplo yment rate mi ght go up to 20%. But t he am erican peo ple prove the m wrong and bu sinesse s large and sma ll crea ted more than thr ee mil lion jobs by the middle of May alone. And we're going to contin ue to move forwa r d. I was ta lking t o some economic experts over the last week and they sa id that at the time tha t that jobs report came o ut that Cliff only ab out 50% of sm all businesses in tho se first few week s of may have begun to re open. Now accordi ng to the US Chamber w e estimate t hat more than 80% of smal l businesses are o pen to one degree or another. A nd so for all the encouragement of those numbers, great tes tament to the resili ence and faith a nd hard work of the american people. We're very confiden t that it's just the beginning and this american comeback has just begun. It's true. do all the things tha t made this econo my great o ver the last 3.5 years created mil lions of jobs. And let me also say from my heart we're gon na make law and order a centerpiece of the great american comeback. say from my heart what happene d to George Floyd in Minneapoli s. It was a tra gedy. It shocked the consc ience of th e nation. Preside nt trump's mad e it clear, justice will be served. There's no excuse for what happene d to George Floy d. There's als o no excuse for ri oting and l ooting and the v iolence tha t ensued here in P ittsburgh and around the country. Eve ry american cherish es our First ame ndment rights and we respe ct the concerns and free doms of pea cef ul protesters. I'm goin g to promise each o ne of you that we're as we did today at a chu rch in th e Pittsburgh area, Presi dent did yesterday in D allas. We' re going to continue to liste n, we're gonna have ears to hear, we're goin g to learn an d we're going to lead, but we're not going to defund the police I think all of you know, mos t of the m en and women who se rve in law enforcement e very single day, put on the u niform, stand on the t hin blue line are really the b est of us. I grew up, one of the heroes of my youth was my u ncle who was a Chicago polic e offi cer for 25 years . So we're working to day in the afterm ath of that, th e tragic death of George Floy d. We're sitting down with law enfor cement leaders at ever y level around the country and we'r e working with community leaders as we did today. The president anno unced yesterday, we're in the proc ess of, of drafting e xecutive action that w ill encoura ge police departm ents nationwide to m eet the high est standards in the u se of forest to h ave more resources for training and de escalati on. But I want to tell you all here in pennsylvania, we're no t gonna stop there. The tr uth is that m any african amer ican families in o ur maj or citie s for more than a half a century have labored under failed policies of liberal democ ratic leade rship, depriving the m of jobs and o pportunities and education e xcellence. That's wh y yesterday president tr ump made it clear we' re gonna work wit h law enforcement a nd communi ty leaders to f ind ways that we can improve, give th em m ore tools and mor e resources. But we're going to wo rk, we'r e going to work to expand jobs and opportunities and education excellence for african american families and all the families of our major cities. we're going to build on the progre ss we've made. I I couldn't be more p roud to tell you t hat as we sa w those seven million job s created in th e last 3.5 years. We have the lowest une mployment ev er recorded for a frican ameri cans and h ispanic americ ans. This presi dent actual ly passed legislation with my frien d Senator Tim Scott th at created more than 4000 opportu nity zone s that have al ready attracte d more than $100 bil lion o f job creatin g invest ments in o ur major cit ies. In fact, with, with some of tha t foundation at work. I n that last job s report. I just mentioned There were more th an 300,000 jobs c reated in that May report for African America ns alone. We're go ing to increase a frican american co mmuni ties access t o capital, build on the oppor tunity zones and help them crea te mor e jobs. But it's not just abo ut jobs, it's also about making sure th at young people comi ng up hav e access to th e kind of education, including vocational training, that t hey need to enter job s in great work p laces like this and to be a part of a growing eco nomy. And the truth is th at the president and I are goi ng to keep worki ng every single day to give african ame rican famili es in our cities and every family the right t o choose whe re their Children go to school, whether that's a public or private or parochial or religious school. so it's about education innovation , it's abo ut prosperity and jo bs, but also on e of the things we l earned dur ing Sema and my work on the co rona virus task force was the un ique and mor e severe impa ct of that virus on african americ ans in our country. And it wa s really a refle ction of the f act that we have hea lth disparities for many africa n american fa milies in our in ner cities. So the president also said yesterday that o ur te am is going to be working , we're g onna be wo rking to brin g free market pr inciples and solu tions to allow af rican american famil ies to have access to the same world cl h ealth care that every americ an deserve s. And so it's about, it's a bout reform. It's about pu blic safety , but it's ab out prosperit y and education and hea lth care and we are no t going to res t until we c ontinue the wo rk that we make this a mor e perfect union. And together we open America up again for the prosperity of all of our citizens. And I'm here to tal k about t he great ameri can come bac k and the truth is it wouldn't be p ossibl e today, wouldn't b e possible to day without the stron g leadership of Preside nt donald trump and th e cooperation and compassi on of the american peo ple or the in genuit y and hard work of all the companies like this one ke pt food o n the table, ke pt important medical dev ices he aded to our hea lth care system. You kept Ame rica m oving in t he most challenging times. But it w as the Preside nt's leadersh ip early on. I can tell you as the leade r of the White House coro navirus task fo rce that bought us invaluable t ime. It w as not ev en before the m onth of ja nuar y was over. P resident T suspe nded all travel from China. He put the health of America 1st. It's true. the White House coronavirus tas k force, we worked wi th companies just l ike this one unpreced ented level. You know, when the president a sked me to do this work at the end of february, he said to me that he wanted a whole of government approach. But it was very clear t o me early on what he rea lly wanted was a w hole of A merica approa ch. The presiden t brought i n major indust ries, pharmaceutica l industries to begin the re search on new medicines and vaccines. He brought i n, he brought in industries th at would be in the proces s of creating medic al equipment and s upplies. I mean with what we stood up at an unp receden ted level, almo st on a wartime f ooting in this country was extraordinary to watch. In fact, I'm prou d to r eport to you th at just in pennsyl vania alone, The pr esident' s direc tion, we were able to deliver more than 660 mill ion masks and gowns and face shields an d other personal protective equipment for our outstanding healthcare workers maybe most meaningfu l to us at all. As, as we , as we looked ove rseas wh ere the coronav irus was impacting c ountries, pa rticularly in eu rope, we saw hospitals being overw helmed. We saw peop le bei ng denied ac cess to equipmen t l ike ventilators. But bec ause of the energetic efforts tha t the president deploye d and bec ause of a merican industry, I'm pr oud to r eport to you that no ame rican wh o requir ed a ventilat or was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We made sure our health care work ers and the pe ople that they were se rving those famili es had what they needed in the moment through the most diff icult days of this pandemic. An d we've also been expa nding testing acr oss th e boar d. Again, it was ear ly in th e process that the p resident rec ognized that the ol d way of doing t esting for this ki nd of illnes s was simply not go ing to scale to the volume th at we would n eed. He brought in these vast commercial l aboratories , he challenge d them to begin to work together. In fa ct, when I was tappe d at the end of februar y to lead the Whit e House c oronavirus t ask force bet ween the C. D. C. And state public heal th lab s. We've only done about 8000 c oronavi rus tests. As of this mo rning. Mor e than 22 million tests have been performed all a cross the United States of Am erica. It's an extraordinary exp ansion of a ccess to testing from the outset of this pandemic. The american p eople have res ponded have stepped up, ma de great personal sacrifices each of us d id and our own famili es. I mean it's worked a great hard ship o n our people but it was an exa mple of the american people's wil lingness to put The heal th of others. 1st family members of neighbors of co wor kers and e ven people that they had never met. So all of the Amer ican peo ple did what needed to be done th rough those 45 days and chief among them were the peopl e that use the products that you make here at th is great company. And I want to tell you , you've, y ou've been on you r feet onc e. But would you mind getting o n your feet for all the doctors, nurses, health care workers and first responders who took care of our families as if they were their own Just truly astonishin g to see the way healthc are workers ac ross this country s tep ped up, they and millions of amer icans did what needed t o be do ne. Whether it was w ork from ho me scho ol y our kid s at home or give some space to seniors in yo ur family or in your neighborhood wo uld be most vulnerabl e to the worst o utcomes. Some closed d own busin esses. I'm proud to say th at, tha t we were able ove r this time to provide businesses large and small across t his country with the resources that, that they ne eded to get through this di fficult time paych eck protectio n p rogram t hat the president just e xtended one week ag o has made it pos sible for m any small busi ness to keep people on the payroll and avoid losing losing vital momentum in t heir companies and in the ir workers. Th e truth is because of what we all did t og ether as a nat ion, we slow ed the spread, we flatten the cur ve, we saved lives and eve ry single day we're one day clos er to putting t his coron avirus in the past for all that we've acco mplished, Ther e are some, some great partn ers all along the way. Seema mentioned that we f orged a partner ship with gov ernors all acros s this natio n. We spe ak to them ever y single week, don' t we? On an ongoing basis about our, our nat ional response. But I must tell you that the re lief ef forts that the Con gress of the United States fo rge in a bipartisan m anner. W e're in t he highest keeping of public service . President said earl y on, we want people to have access to famil y leave. We wan ted to ma ke sure there w as direct payment s for famili es that w ere impact ed by the coro navirus, support f or businesses, large and small, critical industries hea lth care workers and f irst responders and leaders in congress responded and three o f them are with us here today. And I, I'd like y ou to give a vigo rous round of applause to three great friends of mine, great fr ien ds of the president and gr eat partners in the progress that we have made Congressman G. T. Thompson, congressman, mike kelly and congressman guy wrenching thaler. Thank you so much because of what they've done, because of wha t you've done because of the leadership the presid ent prov ided As I said at the outset . Now, all 50 states have begun to re open in a safe and r espons ible manner even whil e continu ing practices that kee p our families and c ommunities safe practici ng good hygiene. We're going back to wo rk, we're g oing back to worship, we're g etting out the stores, the r estaurants like th e one I dined at today and we'r e enjoying the gre at o utdoors after go ing with out what we once to ok for granted. W e're al so american manuf acturing back to work from t he earliest stage of our administration. This presid ent has fought for manuf act urin g worke rs and compa nies just like t his one Like the 700 employees at Oberg I ndustries here in Pen nsylvania.

You make the t ooling for alu minum cans that have prot ect ed the foo d supply all t hroughou t this pandemic. You ma ke parts that are crit ical for knee replacem ents, hip replaceme nts, neck a nd back surgeries. Th at center for Medicaid Medicare Ser vices makes avai lable to americans eve ry single day.

I'm proud to say that I a m the proud fat her of a Marine Corps aviator and the proud father in law of a Navy pilo t And so we appreciate Speaking of grea t people in unifor m, I just had lunch at Dav id's diner with an other one , good friend of mine and a great frie nd of the people of pe nns ylvania and a great citizen of the Safe.

Who really is a joy to be here on the preside nt's behalf today as we be gin this tran sitio n to great you know as I stand befo re you today I'm pro ud to report. That after the difficul t times through whi ch we have passed as a nation in this country a nd nearly 3 quart ers of Ameri ca's small busin esses have a lread y begun t o reopen. We're opening up Am eri ca again and you're part of on the strong foundatio n of the 1st 3 years of this administra tion after we cu t taxes rolled back reg ulations for all for free and fair trad e unleashed American ene rgy sup ported Ame rican ethan ol we saw 70 00000 jobs created by businesses large foundation on ce we started ope ning up Ameri ca you might have seen it a little more than a week ago in the mo nth of May Th e people of America sa w t he largest one month increase in job creation of a greater exampl e of America's resilien ce and stren gth than those nu mbers mean the expert economis ts were all telling us that in t hat report that we would likely lose u p to 8000000 jobs. And they said tha t unemployme nt governor was likely going to g o from 14 percent mayb e up to 20 percen t. But the American peo ple proved the m wrong and b usinesses large and small create d 2 and a half 1000000 jobs and I do n't know if you're ab out i t yet but just this morning after eco nomists predicted that retail sa les would increase by maybe 8 percent for the month of May back to work. The recovery is o n we're going to ma ke our economy str ong again a pr om ise on the same age nda tha t created millio ns of jobs over the past and I want to take the opportunit y to say tha nk you for 2 st alwart leaders wh o stood with Preside nt Trump and I every step of t he way when we were rolling back regulations when we were standing up for American farmers and we were cutting tax es for our milit ary in this st ate is so well se rved by the principled conservative le adership of Senator Chu ck Grassley and Senator Joni Ern st Would you mind sho wing your appr eciation for the se 2 outstanding.

As I stand before you toda y I promise you a center p iece of our t ransition to gr eatness is go ing to be law and order. Let me say fr om my heart. What ha ppened to Geo rge Flo yd was a tragedy and a discrete. Shoul d have never hap pened sh ock the conscience of our nation there 's no excuse f or what happened to George Floyd. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that has ensued. cherish our 1st a member we respec t the concerns of peac eful protes ters. We're going to listen we're going to learn and we're go ing to lead but we 're not going to de f und the police . I mean you all here Winneba go no people in Iowa no most of t he men and women who put on the u niform of law enf orcement e very day are the best of us the best this country ha s all . But over the past several weeks Presi dent Trump and I ha ven't taken tim e. In th is challeng ing national moment to listen we sat down with leaders in law enforcement we sat down wi th leaders in the African -American communit y as President said toda y from the Rose Ga rden we a re one na tion. We grieve tog ether a nd we heal together. A nd today af ter l istening and learning P resident Trump signed an execut ive order that will make i mmediat e resource s and trainin g available to p olice depart ments across Ameri c a to improve stand ards for the use of force deescalation and accountability. We're going to help our police improve. Governor Cameron will .

It's presen t Trump s aid i n Dallas we're going to move an agenda that promot es public safety bu t we're also going to ke ep moving an agend a that promotes jobs prosperity opportunities for al l our minori ty communities in cities across this cou ntry. Just like we did ov er the last 3 year s which saw the lowest une mployment ever recorded for Afri can-Americans that saw this presi dent create m ore than $8 000.0 0 opportunity zones in communit ies across the country attrac ting billions of dollars of investment we're g oin g to work to bring jobs an d investmen t to under-served comm unities we're going to address the especially about during the coronaviru s pandemic we' re going to bring market soluti ons to give our mino rity communities more ch oices in their health care family the right t o choose whe re their child ren go to sc hool a public p rivate or pa rochia l school it'll be th e parent s show us. And I'm ve ry confident. Even in these challe nging times that we'll do what Americ ans have always done will form a more perfect union. Toget her we' ll move our nation forward toge ther wi ll put Ameri ca ns back to work a nd togeth er we were we will open up America again it's happening before our eyes. today would not have bee n possib le without y our hard work and determina tion but let me also say it would not have bee n possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump. In partnership with governors and with the American people a single coronavirus case i n this count ry this presi dent shut down all t ravel from China t o Boston valu able time to stand up our nat ional response you know it's remarkable to think at the end o f February when he asked me to lead the Whi te House c oron avirus task force we' d actuall y performed less than 8000 coronaviru s tests i n the entire country b ut today we're testing roughly 60 times that number every commend your governor Governor Camero n olds is alrea dy tested nearly a quar ter of a 1000000 pe ople through the test I will program in her tirele ss effort she's put the healt h o f Iowans 1st and I was been s etting the pace setting the pa ce in the progress that we've ma de in this pandemic and openi ng up this great sta te again Governor thank you again for your le adership and your example. when they need it and includin g more than 1580000 00 masts and do wns and face shi elds and per sonal protective equ ipment here in Iow a alone and thanks to that same ingenu ity and hard work of American manufactu ring I'm pr oud to tell you no American with coronavir us who ever needed a venti lator was e ver denied a ventilator in the United States that' s a national accomplishment. of this pandemic the American peop l e. Made great perso nal sacrif ices to pr otect the health of their family their neighbors an d people that they ne ver knew. And our docto rs and nurses and healt h care workers and 1st responders rendered care to our famil ies as if they were their own . When we give them a round of appl ause we've got here are .

Thanks for bringing your t alents t o this moment thank you all for responding you know because of the hard work beca use the hard wor k people are drawn becau se of all of you we met t his moment. We met this moment not just with the whole of America th e whole of governme nt response but we met i t with the whole of America response the American people step forward just like you all did and. It's a demonstration of the resilience and the faith in the resolve of our people and Governor Cameron olds and al l the good people of the Hawk eye State I'm p roud to report t o you here and across A merica. We slowed th e spread. We flattened the cur ve w e saved li ves and that's wh y we're op ening up America again you did. in a safe and responsibl e way you know we befo re we got through thos e 45 days t o slow the spread the president had us issued guidelines to g ive counsel to governors like yours about how a phased reopen ing could work to streng then the economy while pr otecting the he alth of our fami lies while continuin g the practices of keep ou r fa milies and communities safe people ar e going back to work and going b ack to worsh ip to get back t o our to our lives. A nd the American people sh ould be proud goin g b ack to stores going back to res taurants with the h elp from the men and women Winneba go we're also enjoying t he great outdoors I 'm told like almost never before in putting American manufacturing back 4th you all have been worki ng h ard been maintaining your s ocial dist ancing doing you r daily health checks you 've been taking care of your neighbors and your coworkers you've been putting the health your n eighbors 1st and it's a remarkabl e example that y ou've said here. Remar kable example 5500 s trong men an d women of Win nebago are emble matic of manufactu ring workers al l across Ame rica who are the backbone of this econom y. Like a senior machin e set up operator wh o want told started work ing here right out of high sc hool s o you could s ave up to trade school but I realize you years . I do the math you kn o w. When most of started here after this place bee n gone about 1 0 years. I've been here e ver since made incredible difference you to help set the pace for the company that's making a g reat difference not only i n this community not only in this state but a ll acros s the nation yo u know I was just told b y some of the leadership here of the company that Americans are buying R .V .'s at a pre tty rap id pace. In fact usua lly I think we heard that roughly abou t a 3rd of buyer s every year are 1st time buyers it's pushing in American made R.V.' s . You all should be prou d. That you made it ha ppen I mean thin k about this p resident has said g as prices are low summer is almos t here what better time to g o see Americ a in the Great. back in the Hawkeye Stat e to be able to ta lk about this great American comeb ack but al so to just say th ank you not just on behalf of the president of the United States but just on the every gr ateful nation. It's men and women like you i n companie s like this that. Keep ing America rollin g or getting America. Rol ling a gain I mean it was i t was companies in essential i ndustri es that liter ally never stopped an d c ompanies like this one like Rod who who transform t hemselves to be a part of the solution for health care workers and for families wh o want to mo st challenging ti mes in the life of our nation it was the pe ople who make things in the people who grow things who stepped up and so I 'm proud to be able to be here to pay a d ebt of gratitude t o each and e very $1.00 of you. Just to say thank y ou for what you'v e don e. Yo u know it seems like these day s you turn o n the television that. Seems like there's more t hat divides us these days than. Ever been true in my lifetime but you know I. Actually think otherwise there will always b e more that unit es us in these United S tates of A merica tha n could ev er di vide us an d chief among those vi rtues is a love of free dom and the faith of the American people. of Iowa and people acros s this country have stepp ed up. Kept doing the right th ings practicing hy giene and social distancing But getting back to work getting back to th eir lives getting back out an d support ing all those great lo cal busine sses affirms my bel ief that. This is a fre e dom loving nation. We love our fr eedom and we know how to us e it wit h common sense and care for others but I also know as t he president often say s that. It's a nation of f aith. I hear i t everywher e I go. I was at Sal ly's restaurant . Try the h ambu rger. She opened u p today for the 1st time since the pandemic struck. You know as I w alked around Sally's r estaurant I have more than a few people say those words that I hear. Just about everywhere I go in America and that is wh en people look at you and they lower the ir voice a little bit and they just say. I'm pray ing for you. And you always know what people mean . When it come s from the ir heart. And so let me just say as I close t hat if you're a if you' re inclined ab out the hea d and and then t h e new fr om time to time I encourage you to do that d uring these chal lenging times. Thank you I'm always some wom an p eople pray for u s with those of us tha t have public responsibilities bee n on this one I'd.

I'm here in my persona l capacity so I can talk a lit tle politics first of all. Thank you for today. But thank you for n ovember 8th 2 016. When Wi sconsin hel ped put us over the t op to win the preside ncy of the Unite d States. You helped shock the politica l system and in deed the world at th e time. And we know you're going to do it again. Why ? Because every electi on is a choice and this elec tion is a choice. It' s a choice bet ween the past and joe biden and the fut ure in t and pe nce. It is a choic e between Mhm Yeah . Is a choice b etween celebrating the 30th anniversary of whe re schoo l choice moveme nt really beg an here in Milwauke e, allowing every forgo tten chi ld to have an other oppo rtunity for a bette r education, a be tter life. Yeah. A nd joe biden, who bragged recently t hat if you elect him, quote charter s will be gone . Ladies and ge ntl emen, we differ philo sophically in thi s country on many issues and very deeply and w e have to respect e ach othe r's opinions. But the fact is on school choice and educa tional freedom an d charters and eac h child having a better start at life th rough their academic ca reer. I've never he ard a good a nswer from the opponen ts on why they would stand in the sc hoolhouse door and deny those kids and exit and entra nce into somewher e better. So t hat is the choic e. Here's another cho ice. Do you want to cho ose between ca ndidates t hat c ongra tulate and capitu late to awful leader s or do you w ant the one that took ou t Soleimani in Al Baghd adi like that? Yeah. Ye ah. Do you want judges that make up the laws ? They go along to fit p olitical i nter est pressure groups , the polls Or do you wan t the 199 just on e shy of 200 federal judges that we've go tten throug h Trump and pen ce? Absolutes. They built an incredib le economy wit h lo wer taxes and fe wer regulations and allow ing energy d ominance such that the US became a net exporter of oil and nat ura l gas for the first time in US history. Yes . Small businesses are flou rishing. Yea h. And yes, we a lso are dealing w ith the global pand emic and the unemployment num bers and the death and destruction and for ma ny people desola tion that ac companies it. But we 're resilient . We're America and Americ a t urns to its leaders and turns i nward to themselves and turns to e ach other in ti mes such as this. It is a contrast a nd a choice in leadership as well. It is some one who has sai d, I will always put Ameri ca 1st. Ameri ca. America ns. American interests , Am erican alli es here and abroad. And that does mean s tanding up for the americ an worker wh o watched our american wealth and our jobs and a lot of our pride shi pped overseas over d ecades and is now bringi ng it back here to America . It's al so a c hoice. Ladies and g entlemen, between somebody w ho last week bragged ab out being endorsed by p lanned parenthood, the n ati on's largest abo rtion provider that gets a half a billion doll ars i n taxpayer funding every year and trum p pence. The first p residen t and vice president in his tory to attend the mar ch for Life and have made g ood on pieces o f legislation and ex ecutive orders ever sinc e. It is a choice be tween one vision of china That says we should ha ve a $1.5 bill ion dollar trade deficit a year, half a half a billion tr ade, half a bi llion dol lars billi on dollar trade defi cit here with china tha t's also peddling t heir fentaNYL and their poi son into our kids means an d into our communiti es and the presid ent. Vice p resident stood up to china are goi ng to hold them accounta ble for th at virus b ut also got us to recalibrate tra de deals to benefit America and the american worke r. For the first time, we have an enforceable writ ten trade deal that p uts china on the h ook to buy amer ican goods and s ervices including from o ur american farmers and la dies and gentlemen. It is also a con trast for our vete rans and our mi litary. In th e last administration, vete rans were literall y wait ing in line. It's almo st six years to the month. Next month, si x years you wa tch veterans waiting in l ine for care, dyin g, waiting in l ine, waiting for an appoin tment. And now 5 9.9 million veterans las t year access health appointments throug h the V. A. In large part because President trump and Vice Presi dent Pence have a choice and mission act allows you to a ccess care o ut side the villa if you need it . They have the whistle blower and Accountability Protection Act, which means p eople who are hurti ng veterans no longer have a job. And more of our veterans and military s pouses. An issue that do have jobs. A n issue t hat our s econd lady, mr s Karen Pence, has done such tremendous wo rk on helping our milit ary spouses, 92% of who m are female and a majori ty of whom have school age d Children to help them find employ ment. Their unemployment rate was four times t he average for women in t his count ry. It is also a cho ice between a military t hat for thr ee consecutive years now has over $700 billion 10 years. And the m ilitary that fel t depleted and demoralized and defeated. Mhm. Ladies and ge ntlemen, I have n o i dea who joe b iden is go ing to pick as his running mate. It doesn' t matter. It doesn't matter more of the same governor walker please stand up again becau se we love you and tha nk you. T hank you. Thanks f or keeping school choice and so many other great thin g s here alive in Wiscon sin's great t o see your son's my b est tonight. Ladies and gent lemen doesn't matter. He picks as his V P because whoever he o r she is, I mean Hillary Clinton had a great , she had a great opp ortunity to pick a compelli ng VP and she ch ose one of the fiv e people in the entire world who would not upst age he r anybody remember. Oh, go od fun. You must, you mu st have the name ti mothy, kaine. Good 1 t o Remember. Yeah, I wo uld see them together and loo k like and mi ddle aged cou ple g oing to couples co un selin g. I don' t t hink it's s cared any w orld leader or any terrorist group away and I don't think it was very compelling to lots of americans.

And I wa nt to tell you I'm W isconsin, I'm in Wiscons in today for real ly one rea son and o ne reason only. And th at is that W isconsin and Ameri ca ne ed four mor e years of Pres ident D onald trump in the White House. Yeah. You kn ow uh like all of you and I'm thanks for standing there. T hat w as just great . I can try that one more time . Anybody el se here for four more years for President Donald trump in the White House all year. Mhm You know like all you're d oing right now. I 'm here because I sta n d wit h President do nald trump w hen this president stands up for american jobs and a merican wor kers, I stand wit h President donald tr ump when this Pre sident stands for law a nd order and liber ty and jus tic e for all am ericans, I sta nd with Pres ident Donald tru mp. O kay a nd wh en this president st ands up for fa ith and family a nd life and the ame rican fla g, we stand wit h Presi dent donald trump. Ye ah, sure. You know, fo ur years ago a movement was born mo vement made up of everyd ay americans fro m every walk of life an d here in Wisconsin. You believe we could be strong again? You believ e we could b e prosperou s again. You said Yes to Pres ident Donald Trump in 2016. A nd I know that Wisconsin is going to say yes to four m ore years of President Donald Tru mp in November of 2020. An d it's be cause when you l ook at the r ecord of the last three years, there's only one way you can des cribe. It's been 3 1/2 years of acti on. 3.5 years of results. It's been 3.5 years of pro mises made an d promises kept. I mean think about whe n the presid ent, I were campaign ing all across Wiscon sin with governor walk er and all the other g reat lea ders that you have he re. He was pro mising he was promisi ng to rebuild our military to cut taxes for workin g families an d small busi nesses. We said we'd r oll back red tap e, we'd unleash ame rican energy fight for f ree and fair tr ade and that we woul d stand up for t he values that have al ways made this country grea t. And on ev ery single pr omise Presiden t Donald trump delivered. I mean, the e conomic agenda alo ne in the first thr ee years, we saw busin esses large and small cre ate mor e than seven millio n jobs and we s aw manufacturing come roaring back all across the Heartland . Any membe r ba ck when Barack, Obama and joe biden s aid that we nee de d a magic wan d to bring ma nufac turing b ack. Well, we didn't need a magic wand in those first three years. We just ne eded President Donald Trump in the White House 5 00,000 manufacturing j obs created in the first t hree years alone. All right, yeah. In this econ omy. There you go. Yeah. We ha d a manufactu ring renai ssance underwa y. We really di d in those f irst three ye ars. And maybe most im portant, remember when th e President said that he w as going to fight for the forgotten men and women in this cou ntry. I mean, the truth wa s for many, many years, a ll across the Heartland . We we frankly saw th at while while e conomie s were growing or eb bing and flowing, t he one thing tha t wasn't moving was the in come of work ing families . And this presiden t roll ed his slee ves up and we went to work. And the truth of the mat ter i s that not onl y were we see in this economy expand, but we saw wages rising across the boar d for the american people. And what meant the most of the pres ident of me was wages w ere rising in our first three yea rs, most rap idly for h ard working blue collar amer icans. Th e forgotten men and women have forgott en no more. He wa s working an d unemployment was setti ng re cord lows and we couldn' t be more proud of the fact that unde r this adminis tration, in tho se first three y ears we saw the low est unemp loyment eve r record ed for af rican americans and hispani c americans. The american dr eam is working again for ev ery american. T he economy alone was on an incredible r oll and the n c ame the worst pand emic In 100 years that stru ck our c ountry, sp end one of the mo st challe nging time s in the histo ry of our country. But i n the midst of that, even be fore t he first coro navirus case was gene rated in this country, t ransmitted from one american to another. Presi dent trump took act ion. He sto od u p the White House coronavirus task force b efore jan uary was out and this president did what no other president had ever done befo re when he suspended all trave l from china into the Unite d States o f America. I mean, the truth is the president's action unprecedented as it was, I ca n tell you firsthand, having le d the coronaviru s task for ce since late february, it bo ught our nation in valuable time to stand up a nation al response on virtua lly a w artime footing. Under the pre sident's leaders hip, America produc ed and delivered h undreds of millions of medical s upplies to th e incredible he althcare worker s of this country in all 50 s tates. And let's hear it f or o ur doctors, our nurses, and all of those who cared for ou r familie s. Th ey are ama zing americans. And they rose to th e challenge at th e President' s direct ion. We also reinven ted testing from a s tand ing start, liter ally when I was tappe d to lea d the coronavirus task force using th e old mod el of lab based tes ting, We only test ed ab out 8000 Americ ans for the coronavirus. But because t he president broug ht the private sect or together commercial labs from all across t he country, We're test ing mo re than 500,0 00 American s every single day. And we manufactured, we manufactured medical equip ment on a w artime footing. I mean, working with gre at compani es like like G. E . Healthca re and Ge neral Motors and ford, we ro lled our slee ves up. They repurposed lines. We produce ventilators a t an unp recedented r ate. And no ame rican who require d a ventilato r was ever denied a ventilator in the Uni ted States. Unde r the Presiden t's leadership, we m et this moment an d we're meeting this m oment with american compas sion, with i ngenuity, w ith courage and with faith And be cause of the fo undation that we laid in this economy. As I stand h ere today, some 40 states, just like Wisc onsin are o pening up again. We 're putting ameri cans ba ck to work. Mhm. M hm. Mhm. It' s a te sta ment to the res ilien ce o f t he american pe ople tha t That we se e cases t hat are stable or even declining i n 40 states . Acr oss the country. We ha ve some outbreaks i n the south and we'r e focusing energy on those. But all 50 states are op ening up again. All 5 0 states are putting Ameri ca ba ck to wo rk and b ecause of the s trength and t he resilience of the ame rican people afte r all that we've been throu gh as a nation. I t's remarkab le to think that in the month of May alone We h ave the largest one mon th increas e in jobs in Americ an history. 2.5 mil lion jobs created all acr oss America. Yeah. Mhm. You know the great amer ican comeback has b egu n and presiden t trump is leading th e way. Yeah, that's true. Under th is president's l eadership w e built the gre atest economy in history an d this presiden t is going to do i t ag ain. Now joe bid en and the democrats , they have their plan. R emember joe bide n and Barack O bama in th eir time pre sided over the slowest ec onomic reco very since the G reat De pression. I me an, liter ally created jobs at a slowe r pa ce of any time , Post re cession Nearly in the last 100 yea rs and back then, j ust like joe biden in tends to do right now, they're pre scription for putting a mericans back to work. Joe biden wants to raise your taxes, joe biden wa nts to roll out an aval anche of regulations, th ings like the Green new de al, right? He wan ts to stifl e ame rican energy and get back to the old days of economic surrender to china. Mhm. Well, that's not gonna happen becau se we're go ing to let reele ct President Donald tru mp for four more years in the White House. We 're going to cut taxes, rol l back regulat ion, unleash american energy and fig ht for free and f air trade every day. We did it before and we're going to d o i t again. Those are th e the economy is jus t part of the s tory. You kn ow, I have to tell you to pr ovide for the common defens e. His first object of t he fe der al government and t his preside nt from early on ha s be en leading the way and after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw there wa s a portion of our hair craft in the United Sta tes Air Force when w e were swo rn in on inauguration d ay that were actually gro unded so they co uld use these airplanes as spare parts t o keep other planes i n the air. We ll, Pres ident Donald trump changed all that. This presi dent has s igned t he largest incr ease in ou r natio nal defense since the days of Ronald R eagan. We've rebuilt our militar y, we've restored the arsenal o f democr acy and we're once again gi ven our soldier s, sailors, ai rmen, marin es, Coast Gu ard, the res ources an d the support that they nee d to accomp lish thei r miss i on and come home safe . And I can tell you, it's it means so much to al l of us I know t o have a presiden t who cares so deeply about the men and wom en of ou r armed forces. You know, I'm your vice president. B ut the highest title I'll ever hold is D. A. D. And I'm the proud father of a U nited States Mari ne. Yeah. Mhm. And I'm the fath er in law of the Unite d State s Navy Pilot. And I couldn't b e more proud to serve with a presiden t who cares about o ur men and w omen in uniform and all of our veter ans all acros s America And o ur troop s got the larg est pay rai se they had gotten in about 10 years un de r this preside nt's signature. And al so we're making s ure that w e're going to remai n as dominant in th e heavens as we are on l and and s ea and e arth does this President starte d and created the Space force. I was actua lly, I spoke at the g raduation sco tt. I spok e at the graduatio n, the United States Air Force Academy and I got to swear in the 1st 85 co mmissioned officer s in the United Stat es Space F orce the role. A nd how about the support for vete rans? You kn ow when we took office I'll never forget tra veling across Wisconsin , traveling across Americ a. We heard, we heard heartbrea king stories of long waiting lists fo r people to g et in Tuva f acilities. W e actually heard tales veterans pas sing away while they were waiting for treatment at t he villa. Well t hose day s are over this presiden t signed of a accou ntability act. We have fired thousands of em ployee s from the V. A. That weren't given our veterans the health care they dese rved. An d veterans c hoice is now available to every veteran in Amer ica. We're g iving our veterans acce ss to the world class health care that you earn in the uniform of the United St ates. So we love o ur beds . How about could the veterans amo ng us if you're able , would you m ind standing and just giv ing us a chance to say th ank you one more time. Thank you for your ser vice. Thank you for your servi ce. Thank you sir. Thank you for your service. And I ha ve to tel l you it ha sn't just been about our nationa l d efense and our economy. T his presi dent, presidents also been out ther e fighting for a qu ality of opport unity i n educati on for families all acros s this c ountry. You know, Kellyann e and I were just a t a great e vent at the W alkinshaw st em Academy. We we re talking about the fact that Wisconsin h as led the way ha s led the way in edu cational choic e For m ore than 30 years, but it was Gover nor S cott Wa lker that took it statewide for families in this state. Thank you. Governm ent. The president. I have long believ ed that have lo ng beli eved that every parent s hould be able to choose where th eir Children go to sch ool regardless of their area code and income. An d Wiscons in with a grea t le adership that you've had here fr om governor Tommy Thom pson to gov ernor scott walker. You've been leading the way. And I want to promise yo u this presiden t, t his vice presi dent, Secretary Betsy DeVos and o ur entire team are goin g to wo rk to expand e ducational ch oice to every family in America. Mhm. But t hank you for leading Wisconsin a nd thank you governor. And it's been it's al so been about the rule of law And l aw and order under th is presiden t from day o ne. You know, I thin k you all know what most america ns know th e men and wo men who serve in law enfor cement. Most of the men and wo men who put on th e uniform of law en forcement ev ery da y a re t he be st pe ople in this country and we honor th eir service and th at. Yeah , you do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean every american kno ws what happened to George Floy d was a traged y shoc ked the conscien ce of the nation and justice will b e served. Yeah. Th ere's no e xcuse t o what ha ppened to Ge orge Floyd bu t there's al so no e xcuse for the rioti ng and looti ng and violence that ensued in citi es across America. Mhm. Weeks ago when rioti ng and looting was overwhelm ing, many of o ur major c ities joe biden sent out a press rele ase. Presi dent Donal d trump sent in the N ational Guard . Mhm. He se cured our nation' s capital and call on ev ery go vernor in Ame rica to do the same and we quelle d the violence. Mhm. And in the days t hat followed, we've be en sitting down wi th l aw enforcemen t, we've been listen ing to leader s in th e african ameri can commu nity. We're lookin g for ways as the presid ent articulated abo ut a week ago in h is executive order to improve public safety and im prov e the lives of our afr ican american neighbors. We're li stening, we're learning and w e're le ading, but we're not going to defun d the police. Mm. Mhm. Yea h. Yeah. Yeah. So it 's bee n abou t law and order and the rule of law. Th at also means th at it's been about mak ing sure that the men and wom en who sit on our courts at every level Uphold The Constitutio n of the United States as written. An d this we ek, Presiden t Trump w ill nomi nate his 20 0th judge to the feder al court of the United States. And I can tell you, they are all men and women who will uphold the God given liberti es enshrined in our constit ution , like the free dom of religio n, the freedom of sp eech and the Second Amendment r ig ht to keep an d bear arms. Yeah, we've made so much progres s over the last 3.5 years and strength ening the constitutio nal foundations of ou r federal courts principles to which th ey had here. But as we've been reminded over the past fe w weeks, we have more work to do. We need more c onservatives on the Supreme Court of the United S tates , so we n eed f our mor e years of President donald trump in t he White House. T hat's exactly why, that's exactly why thi s President just announced a couple of day s ago, just like he di d four years ago , he's going to re lea se a list of principled c onserv ative nominees tha t we will nominate to our courts at ev ery level in the secon d term of the trump administrat ion. So get ready. So we stood for a strong na tional defense g rowing economy, the rule of law and ou r most cher ished constit utional princip les. But what b rings us here today is tha t this presi dent, li ke no other president in m y lifetime has stood and def ended our first freedom. The f reedom of religion . Yeah, yeah. You kno w, I l ike to tell p eople that I'd l ike to tell people I'm a christian, a conser vative and a r epublican in that or der and I co uldn't be more proud to be Vi ce president, to a pres ident who has stoo d st rong for faith and fre edom in America. He has ever y day, as the president said that l ast saturday in Tulsa and I quote , we wil l ne ver stop fighting for the sacred valu es that bind us together. As America believ e in t he dignity of work and in the sanctit y o f life. We believe in fa ith and family. He said, not in gove rnment, bureaucracy a nd we live b y the words of our national motto in God, we trust. Yeah. Mhm. Yea h. Yeah, me anin g you have a preside nt and vice presiden t administration and understand that the the greatness of America does n't come fr om the corridors o f government or bus tling fact ories so much as it c omes from the chara cter and th e faith of th e american people and t his president and our adminis tration from d ay one in one insta nce after another have be en defending th at freedom and defending those va lue s every step of the way. I mean from early on i n th is administration the presid ent took step s, he took steps to end t he last adm inist ration's assaul t on the lit tle sisters of the poor. And then there was th e Pea ce Cross. Di d you hear about that one? It was what was called a pi ece cross i n Maryland. It was bui lt decades ago to our fallen her oes in World Wa r One. But left wing activists wante d to take i t down when pres ident trump to ok action. We sto od stro ng And the Supreme Court vote d 7 - t wo. A nd t he Peace Cross is s tanding today. Mhm. Yeah. Mhm . And you might not h ave heard about t his one under the l ast administration bibles wer e a ctually being removed from via hospital room a nd even disp lays, ther e was a display of a missing m an table. You k now what t hat is? It wa s in the lobby of the new Hampshire viva and some grou ps sent a letter a nd said that y ou've go t to ta ke that bible. It was an army issued bible off the tab le. But Pres ide nt t took action. He t ook action . We issued a new pol icy that allowe d not only for the display of bi bles but we made sur e ch ristmas, carols and p rayer can happen all acr oss our V. A hospital. And w hen President trump said the bi ble stays okay. So he's b een standing up for our freedoms here at home but he's be en s tanding up some of our mo st cherished ideals as wel l. You know, four president s in a row that made a promise to the american peop le co ncerning our mos t cherished ally. But it was President Donald tr ump who kept the p romise wh en he moved the ameri can embassy to Jerusalem, t he capital of t he state of Israel. M hm. Un der this pre sident, if the w orld know s n othing el se, the wor ld knows this, Americ a stands with Is rael. So we stood wit h people of fa ith all acr oss t his country, of every faith fo r that first f ree dom and for the ideals t hat we cherish. B ut there's one issue that means mor e to me than m aybe anyone els e and that is that t his president has stood witho ut apolog y for the sanc tity of hu man life because yeah. Mhm. And the contrast w ith the Democ rati c Party of joe biden could not be more st ark. I he ard Joe biden was j ust endorsed by planned p arenth ood of Americ a. Joe bi den support s abortion on demand and ev en changed h is historic position to n ow support taxpayer funding o f abor tion. I m ust tell you, I must t ell you thi s President st ood strong for the sanct ity of life an d it was my great hono r to c ast the tie brea king vote to allow states like Wisconsin to defund plann ed parenthood. We will stand f or life in this adminis tration every da y. So standing up for lif e and for liberty and for our most che rished values is a t the very heart, ve ry hard of the wo rk tha t this president has done. And I know that p eople of faith all acr oss this country , knowing and in these t roubl ed times for what we' ve seen over the pa st sever al weeks, maybe. Now it's more imp ortant than eve r. You know, just last night, just across the street from th e White House, V anda ls defaced ST john' s chur ch again after trying to set it a fire or a few week s ago, the y als o tr ied t o te ar down th e statue of Pr esident Andrew Ja ckson. So let me be cl ear burning c hu rches is not protest, dese crating synagogues is n ot free speech. Th ere will be no tole rance for vandalis m or violence in th e United Stat es. We will prosecu te those who do i t to th e fullest extent of t he law. Yeah . Mhm. So we've had a n incredible story to tell. N ow it's your tur n Wisconsin to t ell it again. It's a story about american strength, about american jobs but Ame rica and during the gre at tria l of the last four months, it 's about law and order. It's about liber ties and life an d it's about deciding r ight here an d right now That we're going to defeat J oe Biden on November three and re elect Preside nt. Donald Trump for fo ur mor e years. M hm man, I can te ll you. Mh m. I don't think i t be news to anybody in this room that you ele cted a fighter to be president of the Un ited States. He's been fig hting for yo u every single day. Wisconsin now. It's now it's o ur turn to fi ght fo r him. It's all it's all. Yeah. Right. So I need you to bring all this same enthu siasm. Keep voicing your support, keep talking t o your neighbors and your fri ends. Eve ry day we got about four months a nd two weeks to get this th ing done in Wisconsi n and all across the country. And I know you will. I know yo u will do. I mean bec ause the truth the matter is that we're for all that we've done as a nation for all that we've been through. We're just getting sta rted. I mean, think about when you talk to y our neighbors and fri end s, remind him that four more years me ans more support for our troops. four more years means more jobs. fou r more ye ars means m ore judges and it's go ing to take at least f our more years to drain that swamp. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. M hm. Mhm. Yeah. So Wisconsin, I ne ed you to bring it. Th e silent majority c an be si lent no more. Well, t his has r eally been gr eat. I appreciate yo u all coming out and let me also say to ov erflow, tha nk you for coming out. I don't, yeah, I mean h e's used to ov erflow. I'm no t reall y, I 'm very humbled. You come out very moved by t he enthu siasm that I've seen here today. And let me just take this opp ortunity to say thank you. Wisco nsin. Thank you for the privil ege of being the vice president is the greatest. Yeah . Mm, mm. Mhm. I'll tell you as I 've traveled a cross this country a nd I've t raveled a lot ov er the last 3.5 years, four If you coun t the campaig n and for th is small town boy fr om southern indiana, I'm more convin ced than ever of two thing s. This is a freedom lovin g nation and this is a nation of faith. It truly is. I mea n when you see the way the american people are step ping forward in the w ake of all that we 've been t hrough ove r the la st four months, we're safely and responsi bly rec laiming our businesse s, r eclai ming our community lives . That's truly inspir ing. But not surprising. The american p eople love freedo m. We forfei ted some of our pers onal fre edom to put the he alth of our families and our neighbor s first. A nd and we know we're going to continue t o be to use common sens e as we go fo rward in the days ahead. But I see that I see that love of freedom ev erywhere I g o in all 50 states, as we see t his great american come back as we're opening up A merica again. But l et me also say, I just know as th e president says man y times, this is a nati on of faith. I mean t he sweetest words that I ever hear and I kn ow the s weetest words of president over h ere and when peop le wal k up t o you and y ou sp eak across a rope line or drop an email, send the letters when people say, I'm praying for you and you know, they are, I hear those words. I literally hear them every day as travel across this country and I never fail to be deeply moved. And so I just want to encourage each one. We talk about the records, we talk about the progress as we talk about the choice In the next four months in two days. I hope you'll take time to Talk to the one who has always had his hand on this great nation And on this one and on this one, I I hope you permit me to say, I'm not really asking you to pray for the cause or pray for an outcome. I'm just saying in these divided times in the life of our nation, in these times where we've endured such great challenges through this pandemic. I just encourage you to pray for America, pray for all the american people and when you pray be confident, be confident as we face challenges in health and challenges in our public discourse that if his people who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray. He'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this country. He'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land, this one nation underdog indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for all the americans. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm gonna slip away. I've got a plane to catch going to head back to Washington D. C. But I can't wait to tell him about you people tonight. But the enthusiasm we see here in Wisconsin, I'm absolutely convinced. But if all of us do all that we need to do in the next four months and two weeks to tell the story of this president to lay out the choice to the people of Wisconsin to work and to pray. I know we're going to have President donald trump In the White House for four more years. We're gonna make this country more prosperous than ever before. We're gonna make this country more secure than ever before. We're going to bring America together as never before and we're gonna make America great again again. Thanks everybody. God bless you.

I want to thank al l the distinguished guests w ho are here with us to day you know the. W orki ng with Senator Rob Portman working with y our great governo r Governor Mike De Wine and others this president went to work. Right afte r the people of Ohio said yes 3 and a hal f years ago we cut taxes across the board for working families an d for s mall businesses we we re roll back more federal red t ape than any admini stration in American histor y we unleashed Americ an energy and the kind of energy inno vation that yo u're going to see in the valley now for deca des to come we foug ht for fre e and fair trade in t he values an d ideals that have alway s made this country gr eat and o n every single promise Pr esident Trump delivered for the people of Ohio and the people. And you know that's especiall y true when it comes to automotive jobs into manufact uri ng for the 1st year of ou r biggest ration the pres ident said he was going to put f ree and fai r trade trade deals tha t put American j obs in American workers 1st back at the c enter of American policy we put China on notice that the era of air.

T hat's how we' re doing folks that's how we ha ve t aken the incentive that was i n NAFTA to move jobs south o f the border that's all gone w e're going to kee p automotive jo bs growing right here in O hio and right here across the United. And he think back on of the 1st 3 years of this ministration the resu lts re ally speak fo r themselves you s aw businesses large and small c reate mor e tha n 7000000 jobs includi ng 500000 m anufactu ring job s o f which 48000 new automotive jo bs were created in ju st 3 years it was a m anufacturing ren aissance that was un de rway and rea lly what was most meaningful to th e president to me wa s not just t he job s were be ing added but wag es were r ising in w hat was most exciting to u s as wages were r ising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans The Fo rgotten Man a nd Women of Ame rica w ere forgotten tha t no more. The American Dream was working working agai n for eve ry American the p resident I c ould n't be more proud tha t in our 1 st 3 years we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans the American dream came roaring back under President Donald Trump it's true. Our econom y was on an incredib le roll the s tock market se tting records jobs being create d wa ges rise. And then as we all know then ca me the w orst pandemic in a 100 year s to strike our coun t ry from overseas. But i n the midst of that. As the head of the White House coron avirus tas k force I c an. Every step of the w ay. President Trump e xercise the kind of leadership that ev ery American on dec isive action be lit erally befor e the month of January w as out he stood up a task fo rce brin ging a w hole of go vernment respon se p rep ared but even b efore the 1st c oronavi rus case was t ransmitte d from one American to anoth er this pres ident susp ended all travel from China into th e United States of Ameri ca he put the health o f America 1st. And I c an tel l you fi rsthand I can tell you firsthand the president 's decisive a ction decisiv e action on that January day bought us invaluable time to stand up a nati on al response and in that tim e from here in Ohio and all acr oss the country you saw on the Amer ican people produc ed and delivered hundre d s of millio ns of medical supplies to our incredi ble health care workers in all 50 s tates in fact. C an we just hear it for our doctors a n d our n urses and all of the inc redible health care. Th at are right u p to this moment. With t hose struggling . Rabbit. And we reinvented testing literally from a standing start you kno w when I was tapp ed to lead the coronavirus task f orce in late February we were u sing the old system of test ing where you send samples to a state lab or yo u send them to the c.d.c. when we don't we done a few 1000 te sts by the end o f February but because the pres ident brought t ogeth er mas sive c ommercial labs in this country challeng e them to step forward and meet this mo ment we're actua lly testing m ore than 50 0000 Americans eve ry single day in we'll soo n have tes te d 30000000 A mericans all across this country we met the m oment we met the moment with America n in novation. And I ha ve t o tell you American manufactu ring step ped up in so many ways t o meet that moment for those cr itical medical supplies that maybe none more importan t with the way that we s aw many of our g reatest manufacturin g c ompanies s tep forward partne r with the federal government to pro duce ventilators i n a n unprecedented rate. You know what w e' ve heard from some countries overseas early on was th at many people were succumbing to the corona virus because they did n't have the equi pment like ventilat ors to see them throu gh th e worst of the disea se. Oh we'r e going to make sure that d idn't happen in Ame rica and I couldn 't be mo re proud t o tell you that thanks to the president's leadership thanks to th e way American manufacturing s tepped up no American who require d a ventilator was ever denied a v entilator in t he United States that's a national. You kn ow and we met this moment we met this mom ent I believ e with co mpassion and ingenuity we s aw we saw th e people across Oh io across America with the health of their family and their neig hbors 1st in t hos e 45 days to slow the s pread o f the people of Ohi o with continued practic e good common se nse and good hygiene prog ress. A nd because o f the foundation that w e laid in this e cono my in those 1s t 3 years I'm proud to rep ort to you as we stand here today including Ohio all 50 states have starte d to open up our e conomie s again. And whi le you see in the new s over the past week o r so we have rising ca ses in outbreaks in s everal south ern states I want to assure you. Our ta sk force and our enti re ministr ation is w orking contin uously with leaders in the States to respon d I'll be traveli ng to Texa s in Ar izona in just a f ew days to m eet with the governors and heal th officials there b ut I want you to know that it's a testament to testament to the resilience of th e Ame rican people that l ike here in Ohio and beyond in some 38 states acro ss the country cases are stable o r even declining and I want to say the people of Ohio and your gove rnor Mike De Wine have set a standard for the na tion thank yo u for leading. With Well they're al l the A merican people do and we're putting America back to work today is one mo re example of a great Americ an comeback the t ruth is because of th e foundat ion t hat we laid in this e conomy together over the 1st 3 years even as we begin to open up Americ a in the mo nth of Ma y we act ually saw the larges t one month increase in jobs in American h istory 3000000 jobs created and that w as before more than half of small busi nesses were e ven open yet a nd a l ot of economists ac tually predict e d that we would lose $8000000.00 jobs that month the unemployment rate might hit 20 percent b ut if you didn't hear abo ut it not only d o we create $3000000.00 jobs last month but but t he unemployment rate didn't go u p to 20 percent it actually dropped down from 14 percent to 13 percen t and we're continui ng to see un employment claims c laims steadily decli ne across the co untry Americ a is coming back.

It came d own the stairs and with the Secretary of State at my side , they handed e ach one of us three by five card that's n ow framed in my offic e. One side was a word of than ks to us and to the pr esident and on th e other side it was a bible verse as they w ere praising th e Lord for be ing freed from captivity. They were men of failed Yeah . M hm, mm hmm. The american peo ple know most of those who put on the uniform of law enfor cement every day are th e best people in this country. They walk out the door every morning. The y risked their lives to prote ct us and o ur families. We all know the t ragic events o f recent days and let me say there's no exc use for what happ ened to George Floyd an d j ustice will be served. Come on. But there's also no exc use for the rioting, looting and violence that ensued. Mhm. is not protest , tearing do wn statues is not free spe ech. There will be no toleran ce for vanda lism or vio lence in the Unit ed States and we will prosecute Finally, celebrating freedom means standin g up for the va lues and liberties that we hold d ear. As dr Je ffrey said, t hat includ es App ointin g now 200 judges to our federal c ourts, who wil l all uphold th e God given libe rties enshrin ed in our constitution, lik e the freed om of speec h, the freedom of religi on and the second ame ndmen t right to keep in bare arms. Oh yeah. None of it would have be en possibl e without the strong s upport of the t wo senators from tex as who have stood with this pre sident every ste p of the wa y we want to thank Senato r Ted Cruz and join me now in thanking Senator john cornyn Yeah , ye ah. And with the steady council of pasto r robert jeffers, ou r president has a lso defended reli gious liberty from the first day of this administration. We restored enforcemen t of the n ation 's consc ience laws, we ended enfo rcement of the johnson am endment. So the freed om of speech does not end at the front door of house s of worship in America. Yeah . Mhm. And like no other pr esident in a merican h istory, preside nt donald trump ha s stood wit hout ap ology for th e sa ncti ty of human li fe. Mm hmm. Yeah, I think. Mhm. M hm. This president an d our ad ministration celebra te freedom ev ery day by up holding the ideals on wh ich this nation was foun ded and defendin g them in each and every ac tion. And now we find ourselves in a challen gi ng time in our nation's hist ory. We've gone through one of the worst pandemics in the history of this country, an economic down turn. None of us expected. And fo r a time we saw chao s engulfed the stree ts of many of our major cities. We've seen statues of some o f our nation's greates t heroes being torn down. And one ca n't help but wonder that ancient qu estion. But if the foundati ons crumble, how can the righteous stand? And yet in the mid st of such trials, american chri stians have hope . We remember the countless trium phs we've won even in our darkest ho urs, victories a gain st empires, against injus tice, again st diabolical tyra nnies across the world. Yeah. During these times we do well to remember that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. religion and moralit y are the essenti al pill ar s of civil soc iety. And in his fa rewell address, he warned in vain. Would that man claim t he tribute of patriotism? Who should labor to subvert these great p illars of human happine ss? T hese firmest props of the duties of men and citizens? He added reason and experience both forbid us to expe ct that nat ional morality c an prevail in the exclu sion of re ligious principle. Dur ing the tum ultuous da ys of the revolut ion, john Adams w rote to a friend that quote , it is religion an d morality alo ne, which can establish the pr incipl es upon whi ch freedom can secur ely stand. And when he b ecame president, he s aid, our constitution was made only for a moral and religio us people. It i s holy inadequate for the g overnm ent of any other. It is the faith of th e american p eople that has s ustain ed us throug h every dark h our of this nation's hi story and it is the faith of the american people that will sustain us through these days. through even greater challenges , guiding us in our relentless dr ive for a more perfect union for l iberty and justice for all, A s Abraham Lincoln said whil e Visiting Independence Hall in Philadel phia in 1861. Speaking o f our founding, he said, quote, th ere was something i n that declar ation givin g liberty not only to the people of this countr y b ut hope to the w orld for all fu ture time. He added it was that which gave promi se that in due t ime the weights sh ould be li fted from th e shoulders of all men and tha t al l should have a n equal c hance. Mhm. Mhm. And it happened dr martin Luther King Jr s aid of the s ame founding d ocuments tha t they w ere a pr omissory no te of America p romise that was made that all are create d and a re endowed by th eir creator wi th certain inalienable rights. And in the fires of a civi l war in the mid st of the civil rights was the faith of the american pe ople that d rove us toward a m ore perfec t union and the faith of the american people will continue to perfect our nation for generations to come. Foundation of freedom is fai th. And as President Lin coln remind ed us in wor ds that perhaps provid entially hav e already been on t he wall of this church thi s morning In a thank sgiving message o ur 16th president s aid it is the duty of natio ns as well a s of men to rec ognize the sublime t ruth announced in the ho ly scriptur es and pr oven by all history tha t thos e nati ons only are blessed is God is the Lord. the title o f pastor jeffr ies latest book and let's start pray ing for Ameri ca ag ain. Yeah, y ou're told and we're tol d that the prayer of t he upright pleases him and the pr ayer reaches heaven is holy dwellin g place . And in these t imes of great anxiety fo r many the bible tells u s don' t be anxious about a nything but in every form of prayer an d petition with tha nksgiving, Present your reques ts to God with th e promise that th e peace of God that p all understan ding w ill g uard your hearts a nd minds in christ jesus. Yeah, y eah. As our nation fac es these difficult days, I believ e more than e ver that we stand in the need of pr ayer coming here today. I I thought I I w anted to encour age you as you ce lebrate freedom i n this coming w eek . Practice prayer in a rene wed way. As we think about the challen ges, the the loss of More than 125,000 o f our country. And we thi nk of the grief of those families. We think of those that are still s truggling with this dis ease today, those of it endure d ec onomic hardsh ip and the mids t of the challenges we face. Let's cla im that ancient promise that if his people wh o are called by his name will humb le themsel ves and pra y, he'll do like he's alway s don e thr ough the long and storie d history o f this nation. He' ll hear from h eaven and heal he al t h is land. Yeah. Yeah. Ye ah. S o thank you for letting me join you For this , celebrate Freedom Sunday here at 1st Bap tist Al an I would have j ust come just a sit in a pew becaus e it has been g ood for my heart to wors hip w ith y ou all thi s m ore.

Wel l th ank you, I leave here today t hat God does it work and I ha d oc casion to be reminded that even when it doesn't seem that way God is still working a lit tl e bit earlier this week. Yo u see, I received a letter from a pa stor who leads the church not far from Jacksonville florida. He told me of a time that he and his new bride w ere attending a s very seminaria n Wilmore Kentucky 1 977. It was a place where they held in the spring every ye ar, a christia n music festival . They pre sent the gospel with pr eachers, Th ey present wha t was then the early v ersions of contemporary c hristian music have young peopl e attend from al l over the midwest. But he w rote to me that in 1977 they had decided at the seminary to just c ontinue the event. But he and his new bride fel t called to do the work. He wro te to me and sai d that several frie nds told us tha t it would be very hard on our new marri age and that we should n't do it. But he said w e answered t he call, we gathered a few other s eminarians to help us and t hey worked a who le year to arrange the ev ent In the spring o f 1978. And t hen he said then the night ca me the culminati ng evening on satu rday nig ht wher e he and h is ne w bri de w er e walking through the camp area, it was raini ng, they were disapp ointed, they th ought it all have bee n for naught and then he s aid and that's because I didn't know that that night a futu re vi ce president of the U nited S tates of America would be giving his life to jesus ch rist. Yeah, ye ah, yeah, yeah , ye ah. He wrote to me , I cannot write this w ithout tears and I c ould not rea d it w ithout tears because I rem ember that nig ht sitting o n a hillside, it wa s raining and it was like I I heard the words f or the first time. God so loved the world that he sent his on ly begotten son th at whoever m ight believe i n might not p erish bu t have eternal life . An d I stood up and I walked down that night. Not o ut of a sense of intel lectual assent beca use my heart was broken with grat itude for what had been d one for me on t he cross. I'm worki ng on a letter to that pastor, which I will not be ab le to write with out tears. And I'm s imply going to say to him and his wife now I know who else to tha nk for t hat night. So many y ears ago, the lesson in his letter was eve n when things don't seem li ke they're going th e way we expect ed, th ey're goin g the way he ex pected. Ye ah. Yeah . Okay . Mhm. A nd we can claim those other ancient wor ds that have be en over the fireplace in our home in indiana, in the governo r's re sidence, in the Vice President' s residenc e today. They read before , I know the p lans I have for you, plans to p rosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope in the future. And I believe with all my heart on this, celebrate freedom sunday and every day that if we will but hold fast to him, we'll see our way through these challenging times. We will restore our nation's health. We will renew our freedom and we will inspire people across this land with our witness of the love and compassion and strength that comes in a personal relationship with jesus christ.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473479-101/vice-president-pence-celebrate-freedom-rally-dallas	Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the First Baptist Church of Dallas' Celebrate Freedom Rally.	473479-101	Speech

Departme nt of Justice we live by t hat compass as well so I want to ra ise something tha t some p eople seem to have forg otten in the 2 years p rior to the start of this administratio n in 20 1520168 wa s a s ignificant nationwide increase in vio lent crime as the ov erall viole nt crime rate w ent up by nea rly 7 p er cent and murders nati onwide went up b y over 20 percent so sta rting in 201 7 We've been fixing that with som e success for each of the 1st 3 ye ars of the cu rren t ad ministr ation the nation wide rate of vio lent crime has decre ased each y ear violent crime nationwide decreased in 2017 it decr eased in 2018 it decreased ag a in in 20 90 the viol ent crime rate is decreased 5 percent and the murder r ate decrea sed 7 perc ent. So I'm pro ud of the progress th at we h ave made to fig ht crime together especially to reverse the increase in c rime rates from 2015 in 2 016 the fact i s that strong par t nerships of federal state and local law enfo rcement c an produce better resul ts for th e public that we all serve. Ho w do we get the crime ra te t o trend downward the answer is with better policies and bett er feder al partnerships with lo cal law enforceme nt in $27.00 team beginning in 2017 our United States a ttorneys around the nation including my f riend and colleague Bill McSwain her e in Philad elphia each develope d a customized strate gy by wo rking with state loc al and tribal law enforc ement to ta rget and pri oritize prosecuti ons of the most dange rous individuals in the most dan gerous areas and und er this d irection the Department of Justice has char ged the grea test numbe r of violent crime d efendants since we s tarted to trac k this category more than 25 years ago and we've increased fe deral illegal fire arm prose cutions by an amazing 44 percent compared to the last 2 year s of the prior administrat ion we've also continued to h elp provide fundin g support to our s tate and local pa rtners inc luding anothe r round of g rants that we annou nced just this week for 2 9 commu nity policing p rojects now the l ast few w eeks have b een a challenging tim e for those of us in law enforcement we all want a j ust and fair legal system we all want a syste m with strong relatio nships between l aw enforcement and th e comm unities we serve. A nd we w ant to en sure that public sa fety is not compromised we especi ally want to preserve the prog ress that has been made since e arly 2017 so it's very troubling to see inc reas ed violence i n our major cities during the Ju ly 4th weeken d includi ng 31 people shot a nd 7 kil led right here in Phil adelphia so I have a s imple point to make when it comes to viole nt crime we cannot affo rd to repeat mi stakes from the fa t past and we c annot af ford to have an increas ing rate of viol ent crime we canno t accept violent c rime n ow that doe sn't mean ac cepting abuses either but we must not diminish res pect for the l aw enfor cement profess ional s who protect our com munities a nd in particular w e nee d to remembe r that 134 law enforcement o fficers made the ultimate sacrifice las t year in t he l ine of duty losing their lives t hat's 134 in add ition this so metimes doesn' t get enough att e ntion more t han 58000 office rs were assau lted while protecti ng the public and just in the past few wee ks alone while facin g civil unre st around the nati on hund re ds of law enforcem ent offi cers were inju red so I know th at the challenges you fac e today are more compl ex mor e difficult more exten sive tha n ever before I kno w that you start y our sh ips each day with o ne purpose in mind to keep our communities saf e and perform your duties having no idea what dangers you may see during the day in March of thi s year Sergeant James O'Con nor made the ul timate s acrifice when attempti ng to apprehend a homicid e suspect.

Ther e really is why Presiden t Trump and I and I'm ti red ministration back to blue we stand wi th the men and wom en serving on the thin blue line every day you literally are what separates order from chaos you make it possible for the greatest of the world to thri ve and pros per every day and for every Amer ic an to be able to live i n peace and security bu t we live in a time when t he radical left is presenting the Am eric an people with one fal se choi ce after another like lately we 've been we've been hearing p eople say that we've got to choose betw een funding our police an d f unding our communiti es t he urging of t he radical left you've seen i n some citi es aroun d the country are alread y starting to make that wrong choi ce Minneapolis it was just reported ha s begun dismant ling their pol ice departme nt N ew York City 's Mayor de Blasio has actually. A cut the n.y.p.d. s budget by about a $1000000000.0 0 and I hea rd the just yester day Joe B iden s aid that well armed poli ce in his words becom e the enemy and he said tha t he would quote absolutely c ut funding f or law enforc ement so I want you to hear this directly from me u nde r t his president a nd this is min istration we're no t going to def und the police not now not after a while t his president is b ack in the blue by making m o re res ources available to law e nforcement acr oss the country that's wh ere that 's a false choice. Pe ople understa nd we can suppo rt law enforcement and support our communities from day one our mi nistrations been work and to do just that we back the blue I'm pro ud to report by f unding nearly 40 00 new police officer positi ons through t he cop s program a nd as the deputy a ttorney general ju st said w e back the blue by prosecuting vio lent crimes more than ever before re sul ting in a historic de crease in crime to show for it yo u've done the work on the thin blue line and we'r e putting them awa y. On her her own yo u know the American pe ople no no nobody hates bad cops more than good cops and t hat's why this p resident's also back the blue by s igning an executive ord er that immediately provides la w enforcem ent across t he country with the resources t hat you need t o impro ve training and accountability and to pr event bad cops from moving from one de partment t o another the truth is we do n't need to choose between s upporting o ur police. And supportin g our c ommunitie s and we also do n't n eed to cho ose between suppo rting our police and sup porting African American families here i n Ph iladelphia or any where in America we can do both we have done b oth and we wi ll keep doi ng both every da y. And let me b e clear and I know I speak for eve ry law enforc ement officer in this room there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd and many justice will be served but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and protests the turn violent that followed I actually heard we've seen in recent days the Philadelphia area burning church es is not prot est tearing down st atues is not free speech and we're going t o contin ue to st and with t he freedom of speech and the freedom to pea ceably a ssembly of every America n but we will jo in with you to sta nd against the rioters and the lo ote rs and the anarchists who would p ull down ou r statues and t r y and destroy our communit ies. We're going to su pport la w enforcement as you keep th e peace and we're g oing to pr osecute those who van dalized our cities to the fullest extent of the law. T he old earth is the Am erican peo ple know the public safe ty is vital it's vita l to the prosperity o f our communities it 's vital to the heal th and well being of our fa milies and to back the blues is to back all Amer icans. We also know that when communities are safe they can thrive and thrivin g communities for all America ns includ ing our minority communi ties and our African-Ame rican communities and our record pro ves that you know prior to the outset of th is pandemic yo ur presid ent cut taxes roll b ack regul ations unleashed Amer ican energy fought for free and fai r trade we s aw 7000000 jobs created and we sa w th e lowest unemployment ever r eco rded for African-A m ericans and Hi spanic Americans .

Remember the early conversatio ns with the governor w ith bot h of your senato rs, members of the delegat ion in Congress abo ut the deep concern that we had par ticular ly for new Or leans early on beca use of the efforts o f everyone in this room, because of the co operation of the peo ple o f th at great city in t his great state. Uh , we uh we we not only slowed the spread, b ut w e w e bent the c urve and we 're going to do it aga in. Thi s is a serious time wi th rising cases acr oss Lou isiana and all a cross t he Sunbelt. But as all of y ou know, because o f your efforts, b ecause of the unprecede nted nation al r esponse marshaled by our president, because of the seamless partnership wit h your governor and be cause of the extrao rdina ry support that we've re ceived fr om memb ers of Congress. We have mor e resources today to de al wit h this pandemi c than eve r before. Will be br iefing the governor today will be traveling to LS U later tod ay to talk about increasi ng testing. In fact, we have a ne w surge site in in baton rouge among surge sites in testing that are be ing implemented around the country. PPE has been made avai lable in the hundreds of millio ns of supplies, therapeut ics like Rem de sivir con tinue to be distri buted to stat es including Louisiana and I 'm p roud to report that w e' re moving forward ag gressively at wa rp speed on the developm ent of a vaccine. B ut each and ever y one of y ou hav e been the hands and feet of L ouisiana's response an d on behalf of y our president, on behalf of the entire White H ouse coron avirus task force, I just came by to sa y thank you, thank y ou for the long hours that you p ut in. Th ank you fo r the sacrifices that your fami lies have made. I read this mornin g in my devotions t hat were to o run the race marked out for us with per severance and faith and I just want to promise you as we r un this race as we meet this mome nt, whether you be an emergency ma nagement or in the National Guard or part of th e great fema team here Work ing with our region six team Tony Robinson wo rking with our ou r le ader at fe ma Pete Gaynor who was here in Loui siana just ye sterday we're gonna ma ke sure the peo ple of Louisiana and this te am have what you need when you need it and we' re going to st ay with you ever y step of the way with that. I'm gonna turn the po di um Govern or over with yo ur permissio n to two senators w ho have been r emarkable par tners for the president a nd our entir e administr ation in this effo rt. The availa bi lity of a national r esponse, the av ailability of reso urces to the state under the cares act. Suppor t for families, sup por t for businesses will cont inue to allow us as we deal with ris ing cases to contin ue to responsibly open up our economy to be there for families in Louisiana and we trust us, we'll talk later today to get our kids back into school so I might just enjoy ask you to join me in thanking senator john Kennedy and Senator Bill Cassidy. And I'd like to invite them to bring a few remarks. Yeah, thank you all. Thank you Governor. Thank yo u Mr. Vice presiden t. M any of you know that I am a physician who w orked in Louisiana's c harity hospital sys tem for many years. And although a physician at the outset, it was clear thi s is a public health crisis th at has ensna red the economy . It has ensna red the educati onal opportuni ty and the employment opp ortunity fo r everyone. And I thin k about that beca use one I look out acr oss everybody with this, what th ey do in front of them prisons, heal th care, soci al services, workforce. Th is is an all of go vernment all of soci ety issue that req uires an all of go vernment response. I will say as a physician w ho worked wit h those w ho have been particul arly hit by this, bo th by health by loss of educat ional opportunity and los s of employment that your response in y our admin istration has recogn ized that as well as the Governor's. H ow do we actually address the educational opportunity? Not ju st for L. S . U. And southern Nichols and other state unive rsities but for the se condary and pr imary schools. How do we g et people back to work bu t support them until t heir place of employmen t reopens. So hats off to the ad ministration for recognizing this is not just public health, it is the whole ball of wax. I wil l also add that there are is sues I would be telling I would not be c ompletel y transparent if I didn't say several tim es a week. I do n't get somebody call ing. I don't have swab s. We don't have re agent, we have inadequate testing. I'm out of PP the govern or, Mark coope r and I are in spe ed dial because I'm always like b ugging them. Listen, we need somebo dy to help. You've helped. For example, o ne group I said we can get FDA to give emergency appr oval for a com pound or to m ake re agent i f you need it. But I do think there are other solu tions you're going to see today solutions Loui siana has broug ht up to address some of t hese issues. I'll also bring to you a idea later on of wh at states can do with Congre ss's permis sion to band together to increase the numb er of tests that m ight be available, not jus t for thi s date, but for our surroundin g states and across the na tion. But I close in t hanking you and the president dr berks . Admiral Ge rard for making yourself available. You always have been. Uh And I thank you not just for your availability but for your perspective and your perspective and for your energy. Thank you. Mr Vice President. Yea h. Mr Vice Presid ent. You honor us w ith your prese nce today . I w ant to I want to tha nk him so much. And and presid ent trump as well. The Vic e president has been both a rock and a rock star thr ough this entire ex perience. Um He visits wi th us reg ularly on capitol h ill. I've s een him in ma ny different sit uations. one thing I 've never se en is him lose his composure dr Cassid y. You probably s hould check his blood pressu re. I think it's about 80/40 bec ause he he just he is even kill ed as he can be and that's w hy he's got such good judgme nt. I wa nt to thank th e american taxpaye r for help ing Louisiana so much. We a ppropriated about $1.5 billion d ollars t o state and loca l government. $300 million doll ars to our p ublic school s. $200 million $500 million dollars to our hospitals. $70 0 million. Or rather $7 billion do llars for our small businesses. I don't know what our un employment compensati on numbers are but there their hig h that money didn't just fall from h eaven. We thank heaven Bu t it came out of taxpaye rs po ck ets. No. 31 o f the things w e are going to talk abo ut today is school . We've got to g et our public schools open. Um I know p eople are s cared and I know p eople are worr ied and they sh ould be. But th ere's a way t o open these schools safely. We h ave had 30 Children under the a ge of 15 as 30. Too many But 30 Childre n on the age of 15 who have d ied from COVID-19. For wha tever reason, Childr en are not as suscep tible. And I believe tha t keep ing our public scho ols and our charter schoo ls clos ed wil l hurt our kid s far more than the cor onavirus ever co uld. For a lot of our kids in Lo uisian a schoo l was the most s table th ing in their li ves, Germany Fran ce. Denm ark Norway, Sweden, Japan , South Korea Austria and even Vie tnam have ope ned their public sc hools safely without outbr eaks. And we can too. Th e final point I'd like to make, I'd just like to say to the p eople in Louisiana, some of m y colleagu es in Washington an d this is America you' re entitled to believe and say what you want. An d I hop e we can con tinue that tradit ion. But so me of my collea gues believe that the go vernment ma de the United States the gr eate st country in all of human history. And I don't I just don't agree with th at. I think I think what made this country s o great is ordi nar y people doing extraordi nary things. We're goin g through a rou gh patch r ight now. But that's how we're gonna get through it. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things as we work together to try to save lives and livelihoods and God bless each and every one of you for your good work. Thank you. Appreciate you bet chris good to mee t yo u. Th ank you very m uch. Thank you. T hanks for al l you r tha nk thanks keep u p the great w ork. Okay. We know what seaso n it is to Okay, do you know how to do it down here? We're gonna make sure you have ever ything everything you need to deal with. Whatever co mes in h urricane s eason. Okay? Alright. Tha nk you. Th ank you, Tina. Keep up the great work.

WATCH LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. WATCH ANY TIME ON C-SPAN.ORG, OR LISTEN ON THE GO WITH THE C-SPAN RADIO APP. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND TRADE AT AN EVENT IN WISCONSIN. THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO TOUTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE! [APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, WISCONSIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME. TO CONGRESS MINGLING GROSSMAN, CONGRESSMAN BRIAN STILES, STATE SENATORS, MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, HONORED GUESTS AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE IN RIPON, WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE BADGER STATE WITH SO MANY GREAT AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER GREAT FAN OF THE BADGER STATE, A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AND HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND WAS IN THIS STATE NOT LONG AGO. ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH AS AN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP DID KEEP EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE RESULTS WERE EXTRAORDINARY. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS AT A RECORD PACE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, FOUGHT FOR FREE AND THEIR TRADE, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS ALONE, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION NEW JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WAGES ROSE AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS. 10 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY AND 7 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF FOOD STAMPS. BEYOND THAT, WE REACHED THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THREE YEARS OF PROGRESS AND RENEWAL, BUILDING OUR MILITARY, REVIVING OUR ECONOMY. BUT THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK OUR NATION. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK UNPRECEDENTED ACTION. HE PUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AMERICA FIRST FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS. BEFORE THE MONTH OF JANUARY WAS OVER, HE SUSPENDED TRAVEL FROM CHINA AND STOOD UP THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT WHICH BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA APPROACH. WE HAVE MARSHALED THE FULL RESOURCES OF AMERICA TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SUPPORT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF DOCTORS AND NURSES US THE COUNTRY. I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE , AS WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WILL , WE WILL WORK 24 HOURS A DAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATES IMPACTED, ALL HOSPITALS AND GREAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE THE SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT WE WOULD WANT A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY TO HAVE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE MEETING THIS MOMENT WITH AMERICAN COMPASSION AND AMERICAN RESOLVE. WE ARE ALSO OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION PRESIDENT TRUMP LAID OF LESS TAXES AND LESS REGULATION, INTO SHORT MONTHS, MAY AND JUNE, SAW RECORD-BREAKING JOB CREATION. WE HAVE ADDED 7 MILLION JOBS ACT TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. [APPLAUSE] WE ALL KNOW, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY. IN 110 DAYS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. I CAME HERE TO THE CITY OF RIPON , WISCONSIN CAMERA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , WISCONSIN, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS BORN, TO DESCRIBE THAT CHOICE. IN 1854, THEY WROTE THAT THE DECISION TO FOUND A NEW POLITICAL PARTY HAD BEEN ""FORCED UPON US BY THE SLAVE POWER AND IN THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM."" THEY SAID THEY WOULD COOPERATE AND BE KNOWN AS REPUBLICANS, AND SO THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. [APPLAUSE] SEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, , SIX YEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, WHO USHERED IN THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW, I KNOW OUR PARTY WILL REELECT ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHEN WE REELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY, TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AND TO TALK ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT, BUT SO ARE THINGS FAR MORE FUNDAMENTAL AND FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR BLUE. IT IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKET, THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO THEM A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. LIKE THOSE FIRST REPUBLICANS, WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US ARE TEWOWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. OUR ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THERE ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM , THEIR ROAD LISA SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET US ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD SET AMERICA ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. AMERICA IS A BLESSED AND EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY, UNIQUE AMONG THE NATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN AN ASYLUM OF HOPE FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE, AS THE WORDS ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DECLARE. MANY OF OUR GREATEST CITIZENS HAVE COME FROM CORNERS OF THE RULED , OF THE WORLD RULED BY SOCIALIST REGIMES. IF YOU EVER DOUBT WHETHER THIS COUNTRY IS SPECIAL AND UNIQUE, JUST TALK TO ONE OF THEM. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THAT PATH READ HIM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED OR COLOR. AMERICA'S FAMILIES ENJOYED RECORD LOW CRIME RATES, RECORD HIGH PROSPERITY, THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF A GOVERNMENT DEVOTED TO LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT NOW ALL OF THAT IS UNDER THREAT. JOE BIDEN HAS REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS A TRANSITION CANDIDATE. BUT MANY WERE ASKING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY , A TRANSITION TO WHAT? NOW WE HAVE THE ANSWER. RECENTLY, JOE BIDEN COMBINED FORCES WITH THE SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE DON'T NEED TO GUESS WHERE THEY ARE PLANNING TO TAKE AMERICA. BIDEN AND SANDERS RECENTLY RELEASED A DOCUMENT FROM THEIR UNITY TASK FORCE OUTLINING THEIR AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY. READING THAT DOCUMENT, I THOUGHT JOE BIDEN WON THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY, BUT LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENT, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE BERNIE WON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AGENDA, THE ONLY THING IT IS UNIFYING IS JOE BIDEN TO THE RADICAL LEFT. CONTRARY TO THEIR RADICAL AGENDA, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REBUILDING THE ECONOMY BASED ON FREEDOM AND FREE MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID IT ONCE BEFORE AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AT THE ROOT OF THE BIDEN-SANDERS AGENDA IS A BELIEF THAT AMERICA IS DRIVEN BY IN THE, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT , BY ENVY, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HARBOR ILL WILL TOWARD THEIR NEIGHBORS. THE RADICAL LEFT BELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST BE INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES TO CORRECT THOSE AMERICAN WRONGS. THEY BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DICTATE HOW AMERICANS LIVE, HOW WE SHOULD WORK, HOW WE SHOULD RAISE OUR CHILDREN, AND IN THE PROCESS THE PRIVATE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM , DEPRIVE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY AND SECURITY. THEIR AGENDA IS BASED ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL. OUR AGENDA IS BASED ON FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] JUST LOOK AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR RECORD AND THE BIDEN AGENDA. PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES BY $5.5 TRILLION, THE LARGEST TAX CUT AND REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN PLANS TO INCREASE TAXES BY NEARLY $4 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE ALONE. TWICE AS MUCH AS HILLARY CLINTON EVER PROPOSED. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY CUT TAXES, BUT WE HAVE ROLLED BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE AT A HISTORIC CASE , PACE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS REPEALED MORE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAN IN THE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, ENABLING ECONOMY TO ADD A MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTH ALONE. , 8 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ALONE. JOE BIDEN WOULD PROPOSE AN AVALANCHE OF REGULATIONS ON OUR ECONOMY, STIFLING THE ECONOMY AND COSTING AMERICAN JOBS. WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN JOBS, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER, AND HE STOOD UP TO CHINA. [APPLAUSE] HE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS TREATMENT OF HONG KONG, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. JOE BIDEN PRETENDS TO BE TOUGH ON CHINA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT NO BIDEN HAS HELPED CHINA ALL ALONG THE WAY, ATTAINING MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS IN THE WTO. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOTHING WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT TO PREVENT THE OUTSOURCING OF MILLIONS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING TO THAT COMMUNIST NATION. AND RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR OUR HIGHEST IDEALS AT HOME AND ABROAD. IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO WITHDREW AMERICA FROM THE JOB KILLING PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND SAVED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WANTS TO JOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AGAIN, PLACING A CRUSHING WEIGHT ON AMERICAN BUSINESS AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE U.S. HAS ACHIEVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NO LONGER RELYING ON THE MIDDLE EAST FOR OIL, AND NOW AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD DESTROY OUR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, RETURN TO THE WAR ON COAL, PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S IMMENSE ENERGY RESERVES AND POSE A REGIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ON LITERALLY EVERY NEW BUILDING ON THE UNITED , IN THE UNITED STATES, EVERY HOME, EVERY BUSINESS, THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE COST OF LIVING FOR FAMILIES AND THE COST OF BUSINESSES, AT THE COST OF JOBS. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED A HISTORIC DECLINE IN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD SET US ON AN INEXORABLE PATH TO SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN A STRONG BORDER FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AS OUR PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY TIMES, DON'T HAVE ORDERS, YOU DON'T HAVE A NATION. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, I AM PROUD TO REPORT WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT 200 MILES OF THAT BORDER WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND ICE EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS FOR OPEN BORDERS. THEIR AGENDA CALLS FOR AN END TO DEPORTATIONS, SUPPORT FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, THREE LAWYERS AND FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ALL PAID FOR BY AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND CLOSER TO HOME, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ALLOWING EVERY PARENT TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GOES TO SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR AREA CODE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IN WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SCHOOL CHOICE MOVEMENT IN AMERICA, YOU DESERVE TO KNOW. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL , PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL. YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO END SCHOOL CHOICE. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND DEFENDING AMERICAN JOBS AND HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. REPEALING THE HYDE AMENDMENT, ENDING A POLICY THAT SUPPORTS ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. HE EVEN SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, ALLOWING INNOCENT, UNBORN CHILDREN TO BE ABORTED UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. SO IT IS ABOUT OUR ECONOMY, IT IS ABOUT OUR WELL-BEING, IT IS ABOUT OUR VALUES. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION AT HOME. LET ME SAY, DON'T EVER DOUBT , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THIS ADMINISTRATION STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] THE PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT EVERYDAY ARE THE BEST OF US. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY. THEY CONSIDER OUR LIVES MORE ORGANS THAN THEIR OWN , OUR LIVES MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR OWN AND THEY HAVE OUR SUPPORT. IT IS A FALSE CHOICE TO THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL SO LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMPROVE THE LOOK SAFETY, AND STAND WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES AND ALL MINORITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. , OF LIFE AND OUR CITIES AND TOWNS. [APPLAUSE] BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, IN HIS WORDS, ""SYSTEMICALLY RACIST,"" AND DESPITE HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA HAS A ""IMPLICIT BIAS"" AGAINST MINORITIES. JUST RECENTLY, WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD SUPPORT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, JOE BIDEN CAPITULATED TO THE RADICAL LEFT-WING MOB. HE WAS ASKED IF HE SUPPORTED CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE REPLIED, AND I QUOTE, ""YES, ABSOLUTELY."" HE WOULD WEAKEN THE THIN BLUE LINE THAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL STAND WITH THOSE AND STAND ON THE THIN BLUE LINE AND WE WILL NEVER DEFUND THE POLICE. WE WILL DEFEND THE POLICE EVERY DAY. THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] THE HARD TRUTH IS YOU WON'T BE SAFE AND JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA , IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. THE RADICAL LEFT EXPERIMENT OF DEFUNDING THE POLICE IS FAILING FAMILIES IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALREADY. RECENTLY AMID DEFUNDING EFFORTS AROUND AMERICA, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. ATLANTA SAW A 19% RISE IN SHOOTINGS, A 9% INCREASE IN MURDERS. IN CHICAGO, A 42% RISE IN SHOOTINGS AND A 39% INCREASE IN MURDERS. IN PHILADELPHIA, 54% RISE IN SHOOTINGS. A NEARLY 20% INCREASE IN MURDERS. AS A RESULT OF MAYOR DE BLASIO'S DISBANDING OF THE ANTI-CRIME UNIT IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH IS A DECISION MANY AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS ARE BEGGING HIM TO REVERSE, THAT CITY HAS ALREADY SEEN AN INCREASE OF A STAGGERING 277 SENT , 277% AND THE NUMBER OF DEMS SKYROCKETING , OF VICTIMS SKYROCKETING THESE ARE SHOCKING NUMBERS BUT NOT SURPRISING. HERE IN WISCONSIN, THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE HAS SEEN A 50% INCREASE OF NONFATAL SHOOTINGS AND A100 PERCENT INCREASE IN MURDERS FROM THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR. IT IS ON PACE TO BREAK THE RECORD OF THE HOMICIDE RATE SET 30 YEARS AGO. THIS IS A FRIGHTENING PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA AND ACTION. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE VERY POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO UNSAFE STREETS AND VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN YOU HEAR JOE BIDEN CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, THE PEACE OF MIND THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ENJOY AS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. WHEN YOU CONSIDER JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA IN HIS EMBRACE OF THE RADICAL LEFT, IT IS CLEAR , JOE BIDEN WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THANA A TROJAN HORSE FOR A RADICAL AGENDA. SO RADICAL, SO ALL-ENCOMPASSING IT WOULD TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY INTO SOMETHING UTTERLY UNRECOGNIZABLE. IT IS NO WONDER THAT SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT IF JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED, HE WOULD, IN HIS WORDS, TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY AND BE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT IN A CENTURY. THE BIDEN-SANDERS AGENDA WOULD SET AMERICA ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. AS OUR NATION ENDURES THIS TIME OF TESTING, WE WOULD DO WELL TO TELL OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS IT IS TIME FOR CHOOSING. WE NEED TO TELL OUR FELLOW AMERICANS THAT WE CAN CHOOSE TO STAY ON THE PATH THAT STARTS FROM THE BELIEF IN THE GOODNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL AND FOUNDED ON FREEDOM, ALWAYS STRIVING FOR A MORE PERFECT UNION. JUST LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE AT A ROUNDTABLE WITH A CUBAN IMMIGRANT NAMED MAXIMO ALVAREZ. MAXIMO ESCAPED COMMUNIST CUBA AT 13. HE WAS ONE OF THE LESS KIDS TO FLEE WITH A GROUP OF NUNS IS CONFIDENT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE COMMUNIST DICTATOR THAT BERNIE SANDERS HAS PRAISED IN THE PAST. MAXIMO HAD A STARK WARNING FOR OUR COUNTRY AT THAT FORUM. HE SAID, ""WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR BACKYARD TODAY I EXPERIENCED AS AN 11-YEAR-OLD."" HE WENT ON TO SAY, ""I REMEMBER VIVIDLY ALL OF THE PROMISES CASTRO GAVE, I REMEMBER THE PROMISES WE HEAR TODAY ABOUT FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE LAND."" THEN HE RECALLED WHAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THE GLORY OF AN AMERICAN. HE SAID THAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM, ""DON'T LOSE THAT PLACE, BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THAT PLACE, YOU WILL HAVE NO PLACE TO GO."" AMERICA IS A BEACON OF HOPE AND FREEDOM FOR ALL IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MAXIMO'S ADMONITION REMIND US OF ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO FAMOUSLY REMINDED US THAT FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTENSION , EXTINCTION. WE DON'T PASS IT ONTO OUR CHILDREN IN THE BLOODSTREAM, IT MUST BE FOUGHT FOR, PROTECTED, HANDED ON FOR THEM TO THE SAME , TO DO THE SAME. OR, PRESIDENT REAGAN ATTIC, , ADDED, ONE DAY WE WILL TELL OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN THE U.S. WHEN IT WAS FREE. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM AGAIN. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS RIGHT IN HIS TIME. I PROMISE YOU THAT FIGHTER IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN. AND SO WE MUST FIGHT FOR HIM. [APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE. WE HAVE TWO PATHS FORWARD. ONE OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, THE OTHER OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. WE CAN EITHER BE TRUE TO OURSELVES ON WHAT HAS MADE THIS NATION A BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD OR WE CAN BECOME LIKE THE VERY PLACES THAT MANY OF OUR ANCESTORS FLED AND THAT MANY STILL FLEE TO COME HERE. IN PONDERING THE DECISION BEFORE US, I CAN'T HELP THINK OF THE WORDS OF THE GREAT AMERICAN POET, ROBERT FROST, MY WIFE'S FAVORITE POET. HE WROTE, ""TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A YELLOW WOOD AND I TOOK THE ONE LESS TRAVELED BY AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE."" THE TRUTH IS, THROUGH THE LONG AND STRAIGHT HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY , AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS CHOSEN THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED BY, THE ROAD OF FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND I KNOW WE WILL DO SO AGAIN. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE LIKE OUR PRESIDENT AND THOSE WHO FOUNDED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SOMEBODY YEARS AGO HERE IN RIPON, I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND I KNOW THIS IS A FREEDOM LOVING NATION. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW THE LOVE OF FREEDOM'S IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN AND I KNOW WE WILL CHOOSE WELL AGAIN THIS NOVEMBER BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH. FAITH THAT EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND US FREEDOM , LESS FREEDOM, THEY STAND FOR FREEDOM, THEY FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, AND THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY SINGLE TIME. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A FREEDOM LOVING NATION. IT IS ALSO A NATION OF EIGHTH , FAITH. IT IS ON THAT HOPE I STAND AS WELL. THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS FREEDOM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS BELIEVE AS I DO THAT WHEN WE STAND UP FOR THE GOD-GIVEN FREEDOMS OF LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, THE FREEDOMS WON AND DEFENDED THROUGH OUR NATIONS HISTORY, WE MAKE HIS WORK ON THIS EARTH OUR OWN. AND THAT MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINS. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY OR SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I HAVE NO DOUBT IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE CAN, EVEN IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 3, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH. WE WILL BE THERE FOR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND AND WHEN A GREAT VICTORY FOR FREEDOM AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE YEARS , FOUR MORE YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS WISCONSIN AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

Go t you know, I gotta laugh. Y ou know, you're i n Somers et county whenever the vice president of the Unit ed States i s greet ed by a banner hang ing from a cr op spra yer and and we have a truck w ith big squ are bales of h ay um t ha t we u se for protection fo r the um if our resi dent for mer Matt moss, who wh ere is matt bacteri a helped l ead you in the pled ge of allegiance. U m was t he farmer that arrang e these thin gs for us at this time I'd lik e to thank the secur ity details that have been h ere for about the past week. The penn sylva nia state police and the local law enforcement . T hat is, yeah, that t hat is here . Some of them ar e not here, but you are, you are respected in Somerset county and we admire the jobs that you do on I know you heard some of th is story f rom our vice president Br uce, B ut 25 yea rs ago I got my wife on board too distort this company. We we mor tg aged our house , we took out a lo an and I blew my savings and I really bet my family's financial the employees that you see sees in front of you took the idea that I had and they're really, the on es when I started i s what they took. And this is what you see that they built Over I know Bruce had mentione d that, you know, wha t we do here basically is we ma ke glue primarily and as you c an imagine, w e compounding of glue and putting it int o packaging is no t easy because glue s ticks to everything. The machines want to f reeze u p. Which w here's JR JR here somewhere JR JR deals a lot with thread lockers. You know, the things you put on nuts and bolts if they don't co me loose. He was a g uy that you k now what our team does is we solv e problems. And JR is t he guy that had to de al wit h the issues of w hen we got i nto thread locker of ho w do we keep someth ing that is made to set up against metal ru n through a me tal machi ne. So he made a lot of re ports himself . But these guys that this work force is wonderful. We we problem solve on a d aily basis And we produce out of this plant approximately 250,000 squeeze tubes and cartridges every day hands to use fo r maintaining your vehicl es, maintai ning your homes and also for new cons truction. Th e starting of this company really was a ent repreneurial, great entrepreneurial stor y which we don't have time to get in to ri ght now but um, bu t I mortgaged my house a tot al of seven tim es during the fir st years of this business. In order to finance its g rowth, I didn't t ake a salary f rom this company for fiv e year s after its growth because paying my employees is always more im portant than what I wa s putting into my pocket a t t he time. And then along came Covid, and onc e again my team rose to the occ asion. How a re we going to keep our company run ning? Our company here was con sid ered essential when we were a ble to stay o pen. Our plant in Vermont was co nsidered not esse nti al and they had t o close do wn, but the team got together and uh, they stagger ed the shifts o f our employees t hat we didn't h ave too many peop le in the plan t at any give n time. Um they also , t hey made sneeze seals to put up between the emp loyees to help protect them. But whenever we were trying to put hand sanitize r around the pla nt, we were unable to find hand sanitizer for sale because there was such a demand for it. So I realized the domain ingredient s he re to make hand saniti zer. So I tas ked or te ch team nick and George t o f ormulate i t. And w ithin one week we formu lated, we got FD A registered and we got in productio n producing bottle s of hand sa nitizer . In the 1st 400 0 bottle s that came off of our line were do nated to the first resp onders in the So uth ern alleghenies o f pennsylvan ia. You can see t he pride in the faces of our employees, t hat they knew t hat they were cont ribu ting to th e effort t o fight cor onavirus. Now, what we ne ed to open up the e conomy. If you take a look around here, you see green mountains an d filled, We are not like new y ork city or philadelph ia. We do n ot like to be un de r the same restricti ons as a city. And w e feel that w e are able to uh to run ou r company where we ca n protect our employe es and wh at we need are common sense policies, the the common sense policies that we 've se en that has bene fite d this company fr om the trump administration have be en th e job or the tax cuts and jobs act. On the other side of this wal l, we have a lab, w e have three mixers. W e ha ve additional packaging equip ment that was al l purchased with the a ssistance of the tax cuts and jobs act. At this time I'd like to thank President trump. I'd like to than k V ice President mike pence . I'd like to tha nk their administration for contin uing to fight for american manufacturing and for the workers who keep our plant running at this time. I'd like to introduce department Good afternoon and Guy, tha nk you very m uch for hos ting us here today and s haring with us your very i mpressive man ufacturin g facility. It is great for me to be in Western pennsylvania . My family and I have made this our home for the last 30 ye ars. Our tour t oda y of Guy Chemical wa s yet another reminder to me of what I have obs erved f or many years. And that is the in credible hard w ork resilience and in g enuity of Wester n pennsylvania. I had the pleasu re on the tour of not o nly getting a great educati on but also the enjoyment of working and meeting so me of your tea m, which was jus t absol utely a pleasure. Um F ar too long a go, Western penn sylvania's workers a nd produ cers were fi ghting an u phill batt le against lopsided tr ade deal s, unnece ssary regulation and mi sguid ed policies. In 2017, President t and Vice President Pence en ter office committed to reversing these ha rmful polici es of the past a nd in 3.5 shor t years, t he administra tion has already d one enormous strides on th at front. Whethe r it be the new U. S. Trade Agreement, the historic der egulatio n or the landmark tax cu tting job act for wor kers and bus inesses. T his presi dent's policies will boost t he prosperity o f West ern pennsylv ania for years to come. And I a nd as we were on th e tour, I actuall y got the abili ty to s ee three mixe rs that guy talked abou t before that were bought because of those policies and t he growth. And that has been he re just because of that in one s hort tour a round the plant. So that was very exciting. Th at said, these pas t months h ave not been easy for an yone s ince the coronav irus fir st reache d the sho res. This administration h as been las er focused on fi nding wa ys to protect ameri cans heal th and to acce lerate e conomic recovery. Pre sident trump worked with Congre ss two deli ver an unpre cedented stimulus package through the Cares Act to our economy an d hard wor king america ns.

Moreover, our depart ments experts in internat io nal trade, minori ty busine ss development and economic de velopment have b een assistin g american business es navigate th is critical time and that is wh y i t is my t rue honor this afternoon to introduce a great supporter of the work that the Department of Commerce does for american businesses.

This is a place that believ es in hard work in sacrific e, in loving your neighbor and you can f ind it all r ight here in Somerset county at this great company N ow, it's amazing to t hink of all we accomplished over t he last 3.5 year s after, af ter three years of le adership under P resident donald trump this eco nomy was b ooming. President trump. As I s aid, literally k ept every promise t hat he made to the peop le of penns ylvania. And then some in th e results were extraordi nary. We cut taxes a cross the boa rd for workin g families, busine sses and family farms. This president ro lled back more fe deral regulation s alread y than any president in american history. We fought for fr ee and fair trade, we just signed t he new U. S. M. C. A d eal into law and we fought for american energy a nd we're a net exporter of american energy n ow for the f irst tim e in 70 year s and none of that wo uld have been possib le without th e strong s upport in our first two years of Re publican ma jorities in the H ouse of Represent atives and I would be remi ss today i f I didn't take a moment, not just to ackn owledge, but to than k a strong con servative leader in the Congress of the United S tates who was there every step of the way as we brou ght this economy all the way back in our first three yea rs, joi n me in thanking congre ssman john Joyce for a ll the great wor k th at he does f or this s tate in this nation. Thank y ou john, what a great guy with Congr essman. Joyce's suppo rt and president trump' s leadership. Res ults were am azing. In ou r first thre e yea rs alone, businesse s large and s mall Created more th an eight million jobs, wages were rising at their fastest pace In near ly 10 years and they w ere ri sing most rapidly f or hard wor king blue collar americans. The first three years of this administrati on, the forgotten me n and women o f America were forgotte n no mor e. Tha t's what we ca ll promises m ade and promi ses kept. t wo million Ame ricans were lifted o ut of pove rty. seven million Americans wer e lift ed off food stamps and w e reached the hig hest median income in the his tory of this co untry. And as I mention ed, America made enor mous strides toward energy independence. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And I'll ma ke you pr omise this president is goin g to continue to support policies that allow us to develop all o f the reso urces in this land. And that includes . We're going to su pport frack ing in pennsylvania and the th ousands o f jobs that it supports. Now. The people of penns ylvania des erve to know that if the other side ge ts their way, future is go ing to look very differ ent. True joe bid en And the Democratic Party , instead of cut ting taxes, joe biden and the Democratic Party wa nt to raise taxes By $4 tr illion. They want to bury our eco nomy under an av alanche of regulatio n. And J oe Biden and th e Democra ts have a $ 2 trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fue ls including natural gas. They want to end frack ing, d estroy t hose jobs al l across this state and all acr oss th is nation. You know ? Whereas joe biden and the demo crats propos e policies th at will stifl e jobs and wages a nd energy, Pr esident Donal d tru mp and I are going to fight for a growing America, less government, less taxes, less regulation and more america n energy. It real ly is amazing , really is amazing. When you think abo ut those first three years, pennsylvania employed a record numb er of work, set a record in history An d gained back nearly 20,000 manufacturin g jobs . Remember the las t administration , The sum mer of 2016, the l ast president said he was aske d about bringin g back manuf act uring jobs. The y've los t hundreds of thousand s of jobs in th e last admini stration . He said, h e said, what are you gonna w hat are you going to have a magic wand? How are you going to bri ng tho se jobs ? But we didn't need a magic wand . We just needed Pres ident Donald Trum p in the Whi te House. 500 ,000 manufact uring jobs cam e roaring back in those fi rst three y ears, media n income rose in this state by $1400 . And And we e stablished mor e than 300 oppor tunity zones in Penns ylvania alone. In 28 9 low income community fighti ng for the opportunities. Every american, extraor dinary hundred s of thousands of pennsylvan ians were lifted out of powe r in all these areas, j obs, wages , opportunity zones, m edian income America and pennsylvania we re outperf orming The last eight ye ars. I mean, the truth is Presid ent Donald trump. Achiev ed mo re in the last 3.5 year s than some pol iticians achieved in the last 30 And then 2020 came and the coronavirus pa ndemi c struck our nation . I'm proud to rep ort. Even before the firs t instance of comm unity transmiss ion of the coronavirus in this co untry, President trum p took unprecede nted action. Put the Health and Safety of America 1st. The truth is, our nation is goin g through a time o f t esting And let me say from my heart that our prayers a nd our sympathies a re With all of the more than 100 50,0 00 families that have lost loved ones in the mids t of this pen as we co ntinue to contend wit h the coro navirus in va rious p laces acros s our country. Preside nt trump And our team and the tas k force continue t o marshal the full resources o f the federal govern men t and the full p ower of the american economy to m eet this m oment and p ut the health of Am erica first. I promi se you. I mean, even be fore the month of ja nuary was out, pre sident tr ump took the un preced ented step of susp ending all trav el from china, the second largest econ omy in the w orld. He asked me to lead the coro navirus t ask fo rce that he als o set up before the first m onth of the year was over. We've rei nvented testing from a stan ding start. As of today, we've don e 55 million coronavir us tests, many, ma ny times more than any country in th e worl d. We've m anufactured and di rected hund reds of millions of medical supplies, the hosp itals acros s the country. And we're c ontinuing to do that in ho tspots across America today and working wi th our great me dical companies, I 'm proud to r eport. We're d istributing m edi cines and we are well o n our way to deve loping a vaccine for the american people by the e nd of this year, it's amazing Only in America could yo u have seen the whole o f the nation r esponse been led by President Donal d trump the c ooperation of all of y ou and peopl e ac ross this country. We' re going to make our way through t his challeng ing time. T he truth is we're act ually beginning to see encouraging trends even across the Sun Belt where coron avirus cases have rise n dramatically over t he last th ree weeks. So we all shou ld rem ain vigilant. We a ll should do our part. Practice good hygi ene where a mass w henever it's indicated, check the vuln erable and I promi se you we're going to work every day to make su re that every americ an impacted in this pandemic has t he same level of healthcare. An yone of us wou ld want for a member of our fami ly. We're going to work aro und the clock to hasten t he day that we have a v accine and we will put this coronavirus in the past o nce and for a ll. B ut f rom the outse t of t his pandemic, president trump didn 't just marshall response to the h ealth challenges our n ation face. The president also mad e i t clear that w e were goin g to do whatever it took to get am erican families and american businesses thro ugh these challenging ti mes. We work ed with the Congr ess leaders in both politic al p arties to secure resources to make direct payments t o every ame rican. We launched what's called the p ayc heck protection pr ogram that allow busi nesses just lik e this one to be able to keep people on the payr oll during tho se early, difficult days where bu sinesses were requi red to shut down . Thanks to the hero ic efforts of o ur healthcare workers, this pr esident's leader ship, the american people and great comp anies lik e Guy C hemical. Eve ry d ay, we are one da y closer putting the coronavirus in the past and we're already o pening up Americ a again , amazing to think at th e lowest poin t in this pandemic. Our economy lost 22 million jobs. Tha nks to that solid foundation th at president trump laid in our first three years. We've already gain ed back eight mill ion jobs just In May and June alone incl uding 44 0,0 00 jobs right here in Pennsylvania. The great american comeback is underway beca use of that f ounda tion that was po or but mostly it's bec ause of hard worki ng people like all of you labour thro ugh this challenging time, look ed after yo ur neighbors and loved ones and fr iends an d gone right back to work. President Li ncoln once said I' m always f or the man who wish es to work and I prom ise you President d onald trump feels the same way we are f or working americans an d going back to work this pres ident. I know and believe that har d work is at the very hear t of the american dream and the american people . The american people lo ve to w ork ha rd. Tha t's why we're alw ays going to choose the p ath of greater freedom an d greater opportunit y. We're going to conti nue to adv ance policies that wi ll mak e it possi ble for more business es around Ameri ca to do just w hat guy coming ha s done and tha t is show resilience and generosity and open the doors of bu sinesses and put A merica back to work, which brings me to guy and guy camera, you k now guy, I no t only want to thank you for your hospita lity today but I want to thank you for your leadership.

I learned al l about Guy on my w ay here. His s tory shows u s a t the end of t he day. Th is is a this is a company tha t's not just about facts a nd figure s this com pany. First and forem ost, it's about people , fa mily dignity an d the importance that comes from hard wo rk. You kno w, I'm told that in guys first fe w years th e com pany lost money. Guy didn't earn a salary for five y ears. Guy always made sur e he paid his employees before he paid himself mortgage his h ouse seven times a nd he an d his wonderful wife and their family made huge s acrifices during tho se years whe n t hey were young. Guys. Kids, I'm told would bring their sl eeping bags in video game to stay ov ernight at the plant because som ebody had to watch him and mo m had to wor k. You hinge your fam ily's future to the s uccess of this compa ny every single day. A nd it a ll pai d off your faith, you r determination, your vis ion, your hard work, and yo ur l ove for this commun ity. And these people By Chem ical became inc and inc 500 c ompa ny.

And since president trump to ok office and we go t those tax cuts done, This company ha s gr own by 33%. That's how America gr ows.

CSPANMP582020157	Mike Pence	2020-08-05	Vice President Pence Campaign Stop in Clearwater, Florida	"THE PERJURY CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN WILL BE REHEARD BY THE FULL U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT ON TUESDAY. THE PANEL OF 10 JUDGES WILL DECIDE WHETHER A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WILL DISMISS THE CHARGES AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN. HEAR THE CASE LIVE TUESDAY AT 9:30 EASTERN ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN.ORG OR LISTEN LIVE WITH THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. AND NOW VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SPEAKS IN CLEARWATER, FLORIDA. A CAMPAIGN RALLY. BEFORE DEPARTING, HE MEETS WITH SOME OF THE ATTENDEES. THIS IS ABOUT 40 MINUTES. HELLO, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WELL, I HAVE THE HONOR AND JOY OF INTRODUCING A VERY SPECIAL PERSON TO ME, YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, MY DAD, MIKE PENCE, TODAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I'M TRAVELING WITH HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY. BUT FOUR YEARS AGO, I DID TRAVEL QUITE A LOT. I TRAVELED ALMOST EVERY DAY MY PARENTS WERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FROM WHEN WE WERE PICKED IN JULY UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY. AND I SAW THE COUNTRY, SAW PLACES I'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE, AND I WAS INSPIRED BY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS MESSAGE AND STILL ARE TODAY. BUT A LOT HAPPENS IN FOUR YEARS. AND I KIND OF , I REALIZED EVEN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST. EVEN THOUGH I'VE GROWN UP AROUND POLITICS. THAT CAMPAIGNS END AND THE DAY AFTER ELECTION DAY IS WHEN THE WORK REALLY STARTS. AND THAT'S I THINK WHEN TRUE CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP IS REALLY PROVEN. I'VE BEEN SO IMPRESSED BUT NOT SURPRISED THAT THE COUNTRY HAS GOTTEN TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MY DAD REALLY LEAD IN A WAY THAT'S SHOWN THAT CHARACTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IMPROVE SO MANY LIVES. BUT 2020 HAS BEEN AN ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING YEAR. YEAH. FOR EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. EVERYONE'S BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BY THIS. AND I THINK I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY PROUD TO AND JUST REALLY BLESSED TO SEE MY DAD LEAD DURING THIS TIME, ESPECIALLY, WITH THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE. PROBABLY THE MOST PROUD I'VE REALLY BEEN OF HIM IN HIS CAREER IN POLITICS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH FIRSTHAND THAT REALLY CALMING AND THAT STEADY NATURE THAT I KNOW HE'S HAD AS MY DAD MY WHOLE LIFE BUT I THINK THE COUNTRY REALLY GOT TO SEE THAT AS WELL. AND THROUGHOUT THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC , I MEAN, I HAD FRIENDS REACHING OUT TO ME FROM ALL SIDES OF THE AISLE, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT EITHER ONE, TEXTING ME AND TELLING ME THAT WATCHING MY DAD EVERY DAY JUST REASSURED THEM. JUST GAVE THEM SOME EASE. [APPLAUSE] YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S TRUE. AND THAT ABILITY TO BE CALM IN THE MIDST OF THE STORM I THINK IS REALLY IRREPLACEABLE TRAIT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT , OTHER THAN A POLITICAL MESSAGE THAT MY DAD HAS TAUGHT ME, OTHER THAN THE ABILITY TO BE CALM IN A STORM IS THE LESSON FROM WHOM THAT PEACE REALLY COMES. IT DOESN'T COME, ACTUALLY, FROM US. IT DOESN'T COME FROM INSIDE OF HIM. THAT COMES FROM OUR FAITH IN GOD. [APPLAUSE] AND WE'LL ALL GO THROUGH MORE STORMS IN OUR LIVES, AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE STORMS BEFORE, BUT THE ABILITY TO REALLY FIND THAT PEACE AND TO KNOW WHO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEEK IN THE MIDST OF A STORM I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON MY DAD HAS TAUGHT ME AND I THINK SHOWN THE COUNTRY DURING THIS TIME. SO WITH THAT, I'LL INTRODUCE TO YOU MY DAD, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: WELL, HELLO, FLORIDA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER , I'VE EVER BEEN MORE MOVED THAN AN INTRODUCTION. I TELL YOU WHAT, MY DAUGHTER IS THE WIFE OF A NAVY PILOT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE IS AN AUTHOR AND A SPEAKER AND A GREAT CHAMPION FOR CONSERVATIVE VALUES. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING CHARLOTTE PENCE BOND ONE MORE TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE'S A VOICE OF THE GENERATION. PROUD OF YOU. SO PROUD OF YOU. AND ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY. TO MY FRIEND, CONGRESSMAN GUS BILIRAKIS IS HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, CONGRESSMAN. MY FRIEND OF MANY YEARS. CHAIRMAN JOE. EVERYONE THAT'S COME OUT TODAY. I TELL YOU IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE SUNSHINE STATE FOR A TRUMP VICTORY RALLY CELEBRATING FAITH IN AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN AMERICA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S SO GOOD TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS FOR SO MANY YEARS. CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS AND I SERVED TOGETHER ON CAPITOL HILL. I WAS IN CONGRESS FOR 12 YEARS, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED LONGER. [LAUGHTER] CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVE VALUES EVERY DAY YOU SERVE FLORIDA IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I'M PROUD. I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU A FRIEND. AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. MAN WHO LOVES THE SUNSHINE STATE. AND WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADED DOWN TO FLORIDA, I THINK HE SOUNDED JUST A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. SO ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS AND GRATITUDE AT THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY FROM THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""FOUR MORE YEARS""] WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT, EVERYBODY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU BUT I'M HERE AND HERE FOR ONE REASON ONLY. THAT'S BECAUSE FLORIDA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LAST 3 1/2 YEARS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF ACTION. 3 1/2 YEARS OF RESULTS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. I MEAN, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT THE PROMISES THAT HE'S MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. AND ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE'VE STOOD FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE WITHOUT APOLOGY. WE HAVE STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH. AND BEYOND THAT, WE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR COURTS OF APPEALS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THREE SHORT YEARS. TRUE. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP KEPT PROMS HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AN BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SIGN MASTER'S DEGREE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. THE USMCA IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND. WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST , ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS HERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. BUT EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PRESIDENT SHINE FORTH. PRESIDENT TRUMP MARSHALED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE. WE REINVENTED TESTING. WE STARTED DELIVERING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO THE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING MEDICINES KNOWN AS THERAPEUTICS AT A RECORD PACE AND WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO HAVING THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, I BELIEVE BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. NOW , WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO ON ALL FRONTS. YOU ALL KNOW THAT. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY, TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO SAVE LIVES. YOU KNOW OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THE MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THIS PANDEMIC. AND OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH ALL OF THE AMAZING FIRST RESPONDERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE DOCTORS AN NURSES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN HEROIC EVERY DAY OF THIS PANDEMIC. THEY HAVE OUR THANKS. BUT WE'RE ENCOURAGED, WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING. IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND ALL ACROSS THE SUN BELT. BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR ON FWOING EFFORT, BECAUSE OF THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME. I GOT A REPORT FROM THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE YESTERDAY THAT CASES ARE COMING DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. POSITIVE TESTS ARE COMING DOWN. AND OUR ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, BECAUSE OF THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT OUR PRESIDENT POURED OF LESS TAXES, LESS REGULATION, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, FREE AND FAIR TRADE IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, THE AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN AND WE'VE ALREADY ADDED EIGHT MILLION JOBS BACK TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN AND WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICAN SCHOOLS AGAIN. BUT I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. I'LL MAKE YOU A PROM HERE IN THE A PROM HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO I THINK IN THIS COMING ELECTION THE CHOICE WILL NOT BE WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR MORE DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR MORE BLUE. THE CHASE WE FACE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. IT'S WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY. OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIE TWO PATHS. ONE BASE ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. , I KNOW THE MERP PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE FREEDOM AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS WOULD SEND AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE. BETWEEN A SOCIETY GROUNDED IN FREEDOM AND ONE GROUNDED IN SOCIALISM. ONE GROUNDED IN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. OR DECLINE. IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. I MEAN, IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN WOULD RAISE TAXES BY $1 TRILLION. TO CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CUT TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR TAX RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. JOE BIDEN , JOE BIDEN WOULD BURY THIS ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE. MORE REGULATION. MORE BUREAUCRACY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. JOE BIDEN HAS A $2 TRILLION PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE'D REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. AND IMPLEMENT A.O.C.'S GREEN NEW DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE'S PROCEEDED ON AN ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY AND MADE OUR NATION ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. WE'RE A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD. IT'S NOT JUST THE CHOICE AT HOME. IT'S ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN. AND THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SOLEIMANI IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] AND WE'RE , AND WHERE FOUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS MADE PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE. WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR LAW AND ORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES THAT AMERICA IS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, YES. ABSOLUTELY. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE, WE WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DESPITE WHAT JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT THINK, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. MEN AND WOMEN, WE DON'T NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORTING OUR MEN , OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE BOTH EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER. WE WILL SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE WILL SUPPORT OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE OF FAITH IN AMERICA, WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY, AMERICANS WHO CHERISH LIFE AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT ARE DEEPLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT SUPPORT ABORTION ON DEMAND. THEY SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. EVEN THOUGH THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE HYDE AMENDMENT, WHICH PREVENTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM GOING TO FUND ABORTION, THE PRESSURE FROM THE RADICAL LEFT, JOE BIDEN ABANDONED THAT POSITION. AND NOW PLEDGES TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION AT HOME AND ABROAD AND JOE BIDEN IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES IN FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF AMERICA. JOE BIDEN HAS ALSO PROMISED TO REIMPOSE OBAMACARE MANDATES ON RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. FORTUNATELY THIS PRESIDENT ENDED THE ASSAULT ON THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND THE SUPREME COURT BY 7-2 ENDED IT FOREVER. WHILE JOE BIDEN IS ADVANCING A SOCIAL AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH, EVERY DAY THAT WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE. THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT NOW WE HAVE MORE THAN 200 NEW JUDGES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LINE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FROM DAY ONE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR LIFE. LITERALLY, WE WERE IN OFFICE LESS THAN A WEEK WHEN THE PRESIDENT REINSTATED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MEXICO CITY POLICY WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD EVER BE USED TO PROVIDE OR PROMOTE ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS PRESIDENT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE KNOW THAT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR OF YOUR CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE OF WORSHIP. HE STOPPED ENFORCING THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT AND FREED UP THE PULPITS OF THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] AND I MUST TELL YOU, ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT WAS SITTING IN THE CHAIR IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE TO ALLOW STATES ACROSS THE NATION TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNED THE BILL. JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUPPORT LATE-TERM ABORTION. DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE EVEN BLOCKED A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR CHILDREN THAT SURVIVED ABORTION. BY CONTRAST, THIS PRESIDENT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEFENDED THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO OUTLAW LATE-TERM ABORTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. IN FACT THIS PAST JANUARY, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER TO ADDRESS THE ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE ON THE NATIONAL MALL IN PERSON. WITH THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP , CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, NURSES, TEACHERS AND REALS YOU CHARITIES HAVE BEEN PRESERVED. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR LIFE AND REAL JUS LIBERTY. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH, OF EVERY FAITH, ACROSS AMERICA. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""FOUR MORE YEARS BRTS] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: IT IS GAD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU FOR THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY. I LOVE MY DAUGHTER'S INTRODUCTION TODAY BUT SHE KNOWS THE ONE I PREFER IS A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. I'M A CHRISTIAN, A CONSERVATIVE AND A REPUBLICAN, IN THAT ORDER. [APPLAUSE] BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HUMBLING FOR ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A STEADFAST DEFENDER OF LIFE AND FAITH AND FREEDOM. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH MY FAMILY PRESENT, SHE TALKED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, CAN I JUST SAY THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA FOR GIVING OUR FAMILY THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING YOU AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICA IS FREEDOM. BUT THE FOUNDATION OF FREEDOM IS FAITH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW AS PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS SAID SO LONG AGO, AND I QUOTE, OUR CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED ONLY FOR A MORAL AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ANY OTHER. I HAVE TRAVELED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SOMETIMES WITH MY WIFE AT MY SIDE. AND AS CHARLOTTE SAID, SOMETIMES WITH OUR DAUGHTER ALONG. FOUR YEARS ON I'M MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER OF TWO THINGS. AMERICA IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. AND THIS IS A NATION OF FAITH. PEOPLE ACROSS THIS , PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY KNOW HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM IS. I SEE THE PASSION IN THIS ROOM, I SEE IT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON STREET CORNERS AND CONVERSATIONS. FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA. BUT MEN AND WOMEN, WE'VE GOT A TOUGH FIGHT AHEAD OF US. BUT IT ONLY MEANS THE PRIZE IS GOING TO BE MORE GLORIOUS. I HOPE YOU'LL ALL SEE YOURSELVES AS PART OF A GREAT STORY. THE STORY OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. IT'S A STORY OF RENEWING AMERICAN STRENGTH. STORY OF REATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN. IT'S A STORY OF RESILIENCE. THROUGH THE TRIAL OF THIS PAST YEAR, STORY OF LAW AND ORDER AND PROTECTING ALL THAT'S MADE THIS COUNTRY STRONG AND PROSPEROUS AND GOOD. BUT LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES, THE ENDING IS UP TO US. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, WHAT REMAINS OF THIS ELECTION, ROUGHLY 90 DAYS, WE'VE ALL GOT TO DO OUR PART. WE'VE GOT TO GO TELL THE STORY. AND WE'VE GOT TO WRITE THE END OF THE STORY BY RE-ELECTING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I HAVE FAITH. I KNOW THAT YOU WILL DO. BECAUSE THIS IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. THE LOVE OF FREEDOM BEATS IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE CHOICE FOR FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THEY'RE GOING TO REJECT SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. A STUDY OF THE LONG AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY TEACHES THAT EVERY TIME, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN MORE FREEDOM AND LESS FREEDOM, THEY STAND FOR FREEDOM, THEY FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, AND THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND I KNOW YOU WILL AGAIN. I KNOW WE'LL RISE TO THE OCCASION. WE'LL RETURN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. I REALLY DO. THIS IS , I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE YOU ALL. AND TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS. THAT GREETED US. [APPLAUSE] WE GOT A GREAT FLORIDA WELCOME. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR DETERMINATION. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR VOICE. I WANT YOU TO REACH OUT TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AN FRIENDS. AT WOFFER SHIP AND AT WORK. SEND OUT AN EMAIL. TWEET, INSTAGRAM. LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. AND LASTLY, IF YOU'RE INCLINED FROM TIME TO TIME TO BOW THE HEAD AND BEND THE KNEE I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. YOU KNOW , YOU KNOW, THE SWEETEST WORDS THAT WE EVER HEAR AS WE TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE WHEN PEOPLE WILL REACH OUT AND SAY I'M PRAYING FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE MEAN IT. YOU CAN FEEL IT. EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE A BRIEFING BOOK AND MY STAFF ALL THE WAY BACK FROM MY DAYS IN CONGRESS, I'M SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN READ YOUR MAIL. SO MY STAFF ALWAYS SCOOPS OUT SOME MAIL AND PUTS IT IN MY BRIEFING BOOK EVERY DAY. ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL, LETTERS END WITH PEOPLE TELLING ME, PRAYING FOR YOU, PRAYING FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU'RE AMONG THEM, I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE FEEL THOSE PRAYERS. KEEP IT UP. IT MATTERS. BUT ON THIS ONE, IN THESE DIVIDED TIME, WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE THAT DIVIDES US IN THIS COUNTRY THAN UNITES US, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU, NOT SO MUCH TO PRAY FOR A CANDIDATE OR CAUSE, PRAY FOR AMERICA. PRAY FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD. WITH LIBERTY AN JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. FROM THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS DRAWN. FROM FAITH IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE'S FREEDOM. THAT MEANS WHEN WE STAND FOR FREE DOM, WHEN WE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, WE MAKE HIS CAUSE ON THIS EARTH OUR VERY OWN. AND IT ALSO MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINS. SO THAT'S THE CHOICE WE FACE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, EVEN IN THESE CHALLENGING DAYS, WE'LL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH. WE'LL HELP OUR NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO HEAL OUR LAND. AND COME NOVEMBER 3, WE'RE GOING TO WIN A GREAT VICTORY. FOR FREEDOM AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. WE'RE GOING TO ELECT AND RE-ELECT PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVES AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE CONGRESS TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

CSPANMP582020158	Mike Pence	2020-08-05	Vice President Pence Remarks on Religious Freedom	THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT WONDERFUL WELCOME. MY FRIEND MARILYN MUSGRAVES, DEPUTY SECRETARY ERIC HARDEN, TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND FUTURE SPEAKER OF THE FLORIDA STATE HOUSE, CHRIS SPRAWLS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND THE PASTOR STIFF ANY PARKER HERE AT STARKEY BAPTIST CHURCH. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN CHURCH AND GREAT TO BE AMONG SO MANY CHAMPIONS FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT'S A JOY TO BE HERE WITH THE SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST, FOUNDED IN 1993. NOW A NETWORK OF MORE THAN 800,000 AMERICANS, SBA IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRO-LIFE GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT TO ALL THE GREAT FRIENDS WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY, WHO HAVE LABORED IN THE CAUSE OF LIFE ALL ACROSS THE SUNSHINE STATE, I JUST FIRST AND FOREMOST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR LIFE. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE GREAT MOVEMENT, THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE UNBORN. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE AMONG FRIENDS. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND A MAN WHO IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REALLY, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY AS WE APPROACH A TIME FOR CHOOSING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT AS WE GATHER TODAY, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE HERE IN FLORIDA THAT WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN A TIME OF TESTING. HERE IN FLORIDA AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES IN THE MIDST OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC LIKE MANY OF US HAVE NEVER SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME. AND I MUST TELL YOU, I'M PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE OF A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PUT THE HEALTH OF AMERICA FIRST FROM DAY ONE AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AS I HEARD YESTERDAY, AS THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEETING, BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE, LIVE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. THE POLICY MAKING SURE NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD GO TO PROMOTE OR PROVIDE EYE BORINGS AROUND THE WORLD AND THEN HE EXPANDED IT A YEAR LATER. [APPLAUSE]. PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO ADDRESS THE MARCH FOR LIFE IN PERSON ON THE NATIONAL MALL. IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT TOOK ACTION TO END THE ASSAULT ON THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF A GROUP OF NUNS, KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND WE APPOINTED JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WERE A PART OF A 7-2 MAJORITY THAT ENDED THE ASSAULT ON THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE PARENTHOOD AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNED IT INTO LAW. BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABORTIONS. AND JOE BIDEN WOULD APPOINT COURTS WHO WOULD LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND TRAMPLE OUR LIBERTY. NOW MORE THAN EVER PRO-LIFE AMERICANS NEED TO LET OUR VOICE BE HEARD AND STAND FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] IN CITIES AND STATES, YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT AND BECOME INVOLVED. THE SBA IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE AREA. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE RADICAL LEFT WANTS TO SILENCE, A STUDENT FOR LIFE, A GROUP OF STUDENTS WERE WRITING BLACK PRE-BORN LIVES MATTER OUTSIDE OF A PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE RADICAL LEFT SUPPORTS ABORTION, BUT WOULD PROSECUTE THOSE WHO STAND FOR LIFE. WE'VE EVEN SEEN DEMOCRAT-LED LEGISLATORS IN THIS COUNTRY STAND UP AND CHEER WITH THE PASSAGE OF BILLS THAT PROVIDE FOR LATE TERM ABORTION. ONE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ACTUALLY OPENLY SUPPORTED INFANTICIDE. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR AND I WANT TO MAKE YOU A PROMISE. THIS PRESIDENT, THIS VICE-PRESIDENT, AND THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF EVERY AMERICAN AND WE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE ADMONISHES US, AND I QUOTE SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. SO THE PEOPLE IN THIS MOVEMENT HAVE DONE EVERY DAY SINCE THAT DAY 47 YEARS AGO, BECAUSE YOU'VE SPOKEN UP. BECAUSE YOU STOOD UP. BECAUSE YOU'VE STOOD FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE COURTHOUSES, U.S. SENATE AND CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE WORK OF SBA, IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT LIFE IS WINNING BECAUSE OF THE ACTTIVISKM AND BECAUSE FRTOF THE PASSION AND LIFE AND WOMEN INCRISIS FOR DECADES. THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT IS DEFINED BY GENEROSITY, COMPASSION AND LOVE FOR WOMEN AND UNBORN CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN MINISTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS AND CARE CENTERS, MINISTERING TO NEEDS OF WOMEN IN CRISIS. IT'S TRULY INSPIRING. I STOPPED BY ONE ON MY WAY HERE IN FLORIDA, A CLINIC CALLED THE WOMEN'S PLACE. THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT DOESN'T JUST TALK THE TALK, YOU WALK THE WALK AND I SAW A WONDERFUL CLINIC. HEARD ABOUT ALL THE VOLUNTEERS THAT WERE WITH REGISTERED NURSES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, BUSTLING EVERY DAY WITH PEOPLE NOT JUST STAND FOR LIFE, BUT STAND WITH WOMEN FACING THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR LIVES. A WOMAN'S PLACE, I LEARNED, IS PART OF NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS. THE MINISTRY THAT'S BEEN HERE IN PINELLAS AND HILLSBORO COUNTIES FOR YEARS, AND THEIR COMPASSIONATE WORK HAS SAVED 10,000 BABY'S LIVES. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND I LIKE GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. WOULD YOU ALL MIND JOINING ME IN THANKING BOARD CHAIRMAN, KATHY ARRINGTON AND THE NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS TEAM THAT ARE HERE? WOULD YOU STAND, KATHY, AND THE NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS TEAM? LET'S SHOW THEM HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE WAY THEY PUT THIS ON EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] WHAT A GREAT GROUP. THANKS TO YOUR COMMITMENT FOR 35 YEARS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IN CITIES AND TOWNS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT THERE ARE FAR MORE PREGNANCY CARE CENTERS IN AMERICA THAN ABORTION CLINICS. THAT IS PROGRESS. [APPLAUSE] AND LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. IN FACT, I SAW THAT WORK FIRSTHAND TODAY. WE HAD A FEW MINUTES TO MEET A WOMAN WHOSE LIFE WAS CHANGED WHEN SHE VISITED. WHEN SHE VISITED A WOMAN'S PLACE. KIA TOLD ME SHE WAS 40 YEARS OLD, PREGNANT AND SINGLE TO BECOME A MOTHER AGAIN. SHE PICKED UP THE PHONE, SHE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. BEFORE SHE WENT, SHE SAID SHE HEARD ABOUT A CLINIC THAT OFFERED FREE SONOGRAMS. SO SHE WENT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THAT LITTLE ROOM WHERE I WAS JUST STANDING, SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER LITTLE BOY. AND KIA CHOSE LIFE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE]. SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, FROM THE MOMENT THAT I SAW HIM, I INTO YOU I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. SHE SAID, IF I HADN'T FOUND A WOMAN'S PLACE AND THE WONDERFUL WOMEN THERE, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. AND I MET LITTLE OLLIE TODAY. HE WAS A HEALTHY AND EXUBERANT LITTLE BOY WHO WILL TURN ONE YEAR OLD NEXT WEEK. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS MOVEMENT HAS MADE. ONE LIFE AT A TIME. ONE FAMILY AT A TIME. AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THE SBA LIST MAKES. THE DIFFERENCE EVERYONE WORKING IN THIS MOVEMENT HAS MADE IN THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND I JUST REALLY WANTED TO COME BY TO SAY THANK YOU AND TO URGE YOU ON. LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. I TRULY DO BELIEVE, BECAUSE OF THAT COMPASSION, THAT CARE AND THAT LOVE. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN THOSE IN 1973 THAT THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVEMENT WOULD SOME DAY FADE OUT. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHERISH ALL OF OUR GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHERISH THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND WE WILL STAND IN THIS MOVEMENT UNTIL WE RESTORE THE RIGHT TO LIFE, TO THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LAW. I BELIEVE IT. [APPLAUSE] SO FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE COURTHOUSE, CARE CENTERS, LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA, BUT I, IT'S WINNING IN ONE OTHER WAY THAT IS WORTH REMEMBERING. I THINK LIFE IS WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS IN THE RISING GENERATION GENERATION. YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ARE RIGHTLY SEEN BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS ON OUR NATIONAL MALL AS A NEW PRO-LIFE GENERATION AND SO THEY ARE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THE RISING GENERATION MORE PRO-LIFE THAN BEFORE. MORE AMERICANS ARE EMBRACING THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IN RECORD NUMBERS MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD THE MESSAGE, THEY'VE HEARD FROM LEADERS IN PULPITS AND IN PUBLIC OFFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY. I THINK THEY'VE ALSO BEEN MOVED. THEY'VE BEEN MOVED BY THE COMPASSION THAT THEY'VE SEEN IN PLACES LIKE A WOMAN'S PLACE. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS WINNING IN THE RISING GENERATION BECAUSE OF THE QUIET COUNSELS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE BETWEEN MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS. BETWEEN GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS. I THINK THE TRUTH ABOUT ABORTION IS BEING TOLD. AND THIS NEW GENERATION IS CHOOSING LIFE. AS ONE PRO-LIFE ADVOCATE RECENTLY WROTE IN HER COLUMNS IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES AND I QUOTE, IF OUR GENERATION IS TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE DISENFRANCHISED, THE MARGINALIZED, WITH THE OPPRESSED AND THE OUTSIDER, THE UNBORN CHILD FITS ALL OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A VOICE IN THE RISING GENERATION AND ALSO THE VOICE OF MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE. CHARLOTTE PENCE BOND, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF YOUR STAND FOR LIFE IN THIS RISING GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK AS A NATION TO EMERGE FROM THE HEARTBREAKING DAYS FROM WHICH WE HAVE PASSED, DAYS THAT HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES SUFFER LOSS, AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK EVERY DAY, BRING OUR NATION THROUGH THIS TIME OF TESTING TESTING, WE ARE COMING TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. AND IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR LIFE. TO KEEP CARING, TO KEEP REACHING OUT WITH COMPASSION AND TO KEEP STANDING WITH ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAND FOR LIFE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID NOT LONG AGO, QUOTE, EVERY PERSON IS WORTH PROTECTING, EVERY HUMAN SOUL IS DIVINE AND EVERY HUMAN LIFE BORN AND UNBORN IS MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND I PROMISE YOU THIS PRESIDENT AND I WILL STAND FOR LIFE. STAND WITH WOMEN IN CRISIS PREGNANCY AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE. NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE OF A MOVEMENT OR A CAUSE, BUT TO THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF OUR NATION, INCLUDING THE UNALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE. AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD, AS YOU LABOR IN THIS MOVEMENT, REMEMBER, I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT DO NOT FIGHT ALONE. HE WHO SAID BEFORE, I FORMED YOU IN THE WOMB, I KNEW YOU, FIGHTS WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN WE MAKE THE CAUSE OF THE AUTHOR OF LIFE OUR CAUSE, WE MAKE HIS WORK ON THIS EARTH OUR OWN AND THAT MEANS LIFE WINS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. MEN AND WOMEN OF SBA AND OF THIS MOVEMENT, BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE YET. ALEX IS ATTRIBUTED TO HAVE SAID, AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOOD. AMERICA CEASES TO BE GOOD, AMERICA CEASES TO BE GREAT. I BELIEVE WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT, WITH YOUR DEDICATION, THE CAUSE OF LIFE WILL BUILD ON THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE'VE MADE THESE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE PRO-LIFE MEN AND WOMEN OF PRINCIPLE ELECTED AND REELECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WE RESTORE THE RIGHT OF LIFE TO THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LAW AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS YOU FOR ALL YOU DO AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA.

CSPANMP1182020159	Mike Pence	2020-08-11	"""Cops for Trump"" Event in Arizona"	"WHILE. , WOW. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. ARE YOU ALL FIRED UP TO HAVE THE VICE PRESIDENT HERE TODAY? IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL AND TO BE ABLE TO HOST VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HERE. IT IS GREAT TO SEE MANY OF YOU OUT THERE. THE LIGHTS ARE LITTLE BRIGHT. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE TO DEFEND THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE. [APPLAUSE] I DID A RIDE ALONG WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS TEAM A FEW WEEKS AGO TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH. THEY NEED MORE FUNDING, NOT TO BE DEFENDED , DEFUNDED. AMEN? [APPLAUSE] THEY NEED MORE SUPPORT AND WE ARE LESS THAN 60 DAYS VOTING IN THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION EARLY IN ARIZONA IN OUR LIFETIME. THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE. ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS IS GOING TO BE, WHO DO YOU TRUST TO KEEP US SAFE? WHO DO YOU TRUST TO KEEP US SAFE? THAT WILL BE DONALD TRUMP, MARTHA MCSALLY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR, RUMPLED IN-HOUSE , REPUBLICAN HOUSE, BECAUSE WE HAVE YOUR BACK. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A TIPPING POINT. YOU KNOW ARIZONA IS GROUND ZERO TO DECIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REELECTION, GROUND ZERO TO DECIDE THE SENATE MAJORITY. I AM WHAT IS STANDING IN THE WAY OF CHUCK SCHUMER BEING IN CHARGE. I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER, DO YOU? [APPLAUSE] I KNOW JOE BIDEN AND MARKEL HE CAN HIDE IN A BASEMENT AND BUNKER ALL THEY WANT, BUT THEY ARE A TROJAN HORSE. IF THEY GET IN POWER, THE RADICAL LEFT AGENDA WILL BE JAMMED THROUGH IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE NEVER IMAGINED IN AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. TODAY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EVEN FAMILIES SAFE, KEEPING COMMUNITIES SAFE, AND SUPPORTING THOSE WHO EVERYTHING WILL THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM AND GO OUT THERE TO AFFECT US. THAT'S PROTECT US. I SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND I'M GREAT ALL FOR THOSE WHO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR I WANT TO BRING UP AND INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, OUR GOVERNOR. HOW ARE YOU? I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU TO SENATOR MCSALLY FOR HER UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WHAT A PACKED HOUSE. THIS IS THE MOST CROWDED ROOM I'VE BEEN IN IN SOME TIME. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND TO WELCOME BACK THE ONE AND ONLY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU BACK IN ARIZONA AGAIN. ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE STATE, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU ARE HEROES. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO AND ARIZONA WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. MY DAD IT A COP. AS A KID GROWING UP, WE KNEW PERSONALLY WHAT IT MEANT EVERY TIME HE SAYS GOODBYE TO HIS FAMILY. YOU SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR FAMILIES EVERY DAY. YOU CAN PROTECT OUR FAMILIES. YOU RISK YOUR LIVES SO YOU CAN SAVE OUR LIVES. THIS IS SELFLESS AND HONORABLE WORK. THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ARE GOING TO STOP JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT FROM DEFUNDING AND DE-FAME MEAN OUR POLICE. IT'S TIME SOMEONE STARTED DEFENDING OUR POLICE. YOU HAVE OUR BACK, WE HAVE YOURS. ARIZONA WILL BACK THE BLUE IN 2020 GOING FORWARD. THE CHOICE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PRESIDENTIAL TICKET ON THE BALLOT THAT BELIEVES IN LAW AND ORDER IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT. WITH THAT, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY YOU ALL ALREADY KNOW VERY WELL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MEN AND WOMEN OUT HERE. THE SECRET SERVICE AS WELL. LET ME GET MY SPEECH OUT HERE. BEGINNING WITH THIS, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE ARIZONA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE POLICE ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT 12,000 LOCAL COUNTY AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION HAS 27 ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING 50 DISTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ON BEHALF OF THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR HOST MEMBER GROUPS, WE WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE TO ARIZONA. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS PRESENT, MARTHA MCSALLY, GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY, THE REPRESENTATIVES AND SHERIFFS WHO ARE HERE. PLEASE STAND TO BE RECOGNIZED. WITHOUT YOU, WE COULDN'T DO THIS JOB. LAW ENFORCEMENT TODAY IS THE MOST COMPLEX OCCUPATION ON EARTH. IT IS AN HONORABLE PROFESSION. THOSE WHO STEPPED IN THE GAP BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES DO SO KNOWING THE RISK. OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SPLIT-SECOND CONDITIONS UNDER THE MOST STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. OFTEN TIMES AT GREAT RISK. GIVEN THE MILLIONS OF CONTACTS BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITY ANNUALLY, OFFICERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS CORRECTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. HIGH PROFILE NOT MEAN HIGH-FREQUENCY. IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF INSTANT INFORMATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA, THERE IS AN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION OF ABSOLUTE PERFECTION, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE PERFECT EVERY TIME. WE HIRE FROM THE HUMAN RACE. PEOPLE ARE NOT PERFECT. GOOD PEOPLE DO MAKE MISTAKES. THE CONSTANT AND ORCHESTRATED HAS ERODED THE PUBLIC TRUST. IT HAS ENCOURAGED AN AIR OF OBSTINATE'S AND ASSAULTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS POLICE OFFICERS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN EVERYTHING FROM OFFICERS IN YORK CITY HAVING ITS OF WATER DUMPED ON THEIR HEADS TO BEING SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD IN LAS VEGAS, FOR DOING THEIR JOBS. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THERE HAS BEEN A DROP IN POLICE APPLICANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN RECENT YEARS. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN PLACES LIKE SEATTLE, NEW YORK, CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES, PORTLAND. A PROPOSED 50% CUT IN THE SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET, A $1 BILLION CUT TO THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT, YOU WILL SEE THAT THESE ARE SERIOUS CUTS. THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE ESSENTIALLY TOLD THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT LAW AND ORDER IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY. THEY ARE LETTING THE INMATES RUN THE ASYLUM. COME TO ARIZONA. WE LOVE OUR POLICE OFFICERS. WE ARE HIRING. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR, LEADING THE CHARGE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER WONDERFUL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO SUPPORT LAW AND ORDER. THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FUNDED AND SAFE. WE ALL KNOW THIS NOTION OF DEFUND THE POLICE IS NOT JUST UNREALISTIC, IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS. IT'S NOT ONLY DANGEROUS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS, IT IS MORE IMPORTANTLY DANGEROUS TO THE NUMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES. THEY TRUST US. THEY NEED US. WE NEED THEM. LOOK AT THE HER AND A IN VIOLENT CRIME SINCE THIS STARTED. IT IS CLEAR WHO THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IS. THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FOUGHT OFF THE LIBERAL MEDIA, AND HE'S HAD AN UNWAVERING SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PLACE THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE EVERY DAY TO KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE. WE KNOW HE HAS OUR BACK. WE HAVE HIS BACK. THAT IS WHY THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION IS PROUD TO EXTEND OUR ENDORSEMENT TO DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HIS VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE FOR COMING TO THE GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA TO ACCEPT THIS ENDORSEMENT. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, COULD YOU PLEASE COME OUT? [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, ARIZONA! [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: OFFICER JUSTIN HARRIS, TO ALL THE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR SUPPORTERS, AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILIES, GOVERNOR, SENATOR MCSALLY, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GRAND CANYON STATE WITH COPS FOR TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT TODAY. I AM VERY, VERY GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO RECEIVE THAT ENDORSEMENT. I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I AM HERE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY. THAT IS THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY GREAT FRIENDS AND SOME ANY FRIENDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS ALSO A REAL PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE. WITH A MAN I ACTUALLY KNEW BEFORE HE HAD THE JOB HE CURRENTLY HOLDS HERE IN ARIZONA. HE HAS LITERALLY EMERGED AS ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. HE HAS SEEN THIS ECONOMY GROW. HE HAS SEEN SCHOOLS IMPROVE. HE HAS LET THIS GREAT STATE THROUGH TRYING TIMES OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THINKING GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADING TO THE GRAND CANYON STATE I THOUGHT HE SOUNDED A LITTLE JEALOUS. LET ME BRING GRATITUDE FOR TODAY'S ENDORSEMENT FROM A MAN HE WAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR LAW & ORDER EVERY DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: ON THE PRESIDENT'S BEHALF I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO ACCEPT THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION ENDORSEMENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CAP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA TO REBUILD THE MILITARY, RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, AND HAS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE STATIONED RIGHT HERE IN ARIZONA, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THIS PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG AND PRINCIPLED SUPPORT OF AN AMERICAN WHO SERVED THIS COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY IN UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. SHE MADE HISTORY THERE IS THE FIRST FEMALE FIGHTER PILOT EVER TO FLY IN COMBAT. FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE NEED TO SEND SENATOR MARTHA MCSALLY BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I AM HONORED SHE IS WITH US TODAY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, MARTHA. WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY. BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC STRUCK UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL TREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. WE LITERALLY POURED THE FOUNDATION IN THIS ECONOMY ON WHICH THE ECONOMY OF ARIZONA AND AMERICA ARE ALREADY COMING BACK. WE ALSO SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS THEN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT SENATOR AND THAT GOVERNOR, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT IS OUR LOUD LIES IN ARIZONA THAT IS HELPED MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. , OUR ALLIES IN ARIZONA THAT HELPED US MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WE NEED ARIZONA DESCENT TIFFANY SHED AND BRANDON MARTIN TO A NEW MAJORITY AND UNITES HIS CONGRESS. TIFFANY AND BRANDON, STEP UP AND TAKE ABOUT. , ABOUT HOW , ABOUT BOW. VICE PRES. PENCE: FOR ALL HE HAS DONE AND ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN NOT LONG AGO AND HE SAID, ""THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SELFLESS AND COURAGEOUS PUBLIC SERVANTS."" AND SO YOU ARE. I HEARD A STORY ON AIR FORCE 2 ON THE WAY HERE ABOUT ONE SUCH OFFICER. THERE WAS A STABBING THAT HAPPENED IN TUCSON. THE OFFICER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND THE VICTIM POINTED OUT THE SUSPECT. I HEARD THE OFFICER CHASED AFTER THE SUSPECT, CAUGHT HIM AS HE WAS CLIMBING A FENCE. THE SUSPECT TURNED, SHOT HIM AND ESCAPED. HERE AND ESCAPED. THE OFFICER WAS WOUNDED IN THE LEG BUT HE KEPT HIS COMPOSURE. HE RADIOED A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT. IN TWO DAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN TUCSON TRACKED THAT SUSPECT DOWN AND BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE. THE OFFICER WENT BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS HE COULD, WHERE HE SERVED THE PEOPLE OF TUCSON FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING OFFICER JOBIE DICKINSON FOR HIS SERVICE OF THAT DAY AND EVERY DAY BEFORE AND SINCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, JOBIE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: GREAT JOB. I ALSO HEARD WE ARE JOINED BY ANOTHER OFFICER WHO NOT LONG AGO WAS DISPATCHED TO REPORT A HOME INVASION. THE VICTIM WAS LITERALLY TIED UP AND HELPLESS. THE OFFICER SPOTTED THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE, DROVE AFTER THEM. THE SUSPECTS FIRED MORE THAN 100 ROUNDS OVER MORE THAN 10 MILES OF A CHASE. AT ONE POINT THE OFFICER'S VEHICLE WAS DISABLED FROM THE GUNFIRE. ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER PICKED HIM UP AND THEY KEPT AFTER IT. THEY KEPT GOING UNTIL THEY CAUGHT THE SUSPECTS, REST OF THEM , ARRESTED THEM, AND BROUGHT THEM TO JUSTICE. JOIN ME IN THINKING OFFICER TROY WALLEN. WHERE ARE YOU, TROY? TAKE A BOW. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: NEVER QUIT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: GREAT JOB. HEROES LIKE THESE OFFICERS ARE WHY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS BACK THE BLUE. WE BACK YOU EVERYDAY. WHEN OTHERS RUN AWAY FROM DANGER, POLICE OFFICERS RUN STRAIGHT INTO HARM'S WAY. YOU COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. PUT YOUR LIVES IN THE LINE TO PROTECT SOMEONE THAT IN MOST CASES YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET. NOWHERE HAS THAT BEEN TRUE OR OR MORE POIGNANT , TRUER OR MORE POIGNANT THAN OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA. OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THE MIDST THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. AS WE CONTINUE TO MARSHALL A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE, AS THE GOVERNOR OFTEN SAYS, WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY TO DO OUR PART AND SLOW THE SPREAD AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SAVE LIVES. THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ARE DOING JUST THAT. LAST WEEK, THE GOVERNOR WAS IN WASHINGTON TO BRIEF THE PRESIDENT ON THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE. WE ARE PLEASED TO LEND THE POSITIVITY RATES HAVE DROPPED 21%, DOWN TO 12%. NEW CASES HAVE BEEN STEADILY DROPPING FOR A MONTH. THAT IS TRIBUTE TO YOUR GOVERNOR, PAY TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE AND SAVE LIVES. AS I SAID, IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES NOT HAVE DONE MORE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES THAT ARE HEROIC HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT'S TRUE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: YOU STEPPED INTO HARM'S WAY. OFTEN WITHOUT REGARD TO YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY. THE RENDERED ASSISTANCE. YOU GOT PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO THE CARE ANYONE OF US WOULD WANT A FAMILY NUMBER TO HAVE. YOU STOOD IN THE GAP IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. YOU HAVE THE THANKS AND ADMIRATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT IS AMAZING TO THINK THAT IN THE WAKE OF ALL THAT HEROISM, EVEN THE HEROISM OF THESE RECENT DAYS, SOME OF THE LEADING POLITICIANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TODAY LIKE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO STORMTROOPERS. JOE BIDEN SAID NOT LONG AGO THAT WELL ARMED POLICE BECOME IN HIS WORDS ""THE ENEMY."" I WANT TO ASSURE YOU YOU'RE PRESIDENT, YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: MUCH LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION BACK THE BLUE, LIKE EVERYONE GATHERED HERE TODAY. WE WILL STAND WITH A MINUTE WOMEN WHO SERVE ON THE THIN BLUE LINE EVERY DAY. YOU ARE LITERALLY WHAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. [APPLAUSE] SECURITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PROSPERITY. SO, IT HAS BEEN YOU, YOU AND THE UNIFORM, WHO HAVE STRAPPED ON A SIDEARM, WHO HAVE KISSED YOUR FAMILIES GOODBYE IN THE MORNING AND WALKED OUT INTO THAT SQUAD CAR OR WALK TO THE BEAT, IT IS YOU WHO MADE THE FREEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD POSSIBLE. YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS NATION TO THRIVE AND PROSPER. AND IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, TO RECOVER. AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN, TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY, THAT EVERY CITIZEN SO RICHLY DESERVES. SO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING. BUT I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WILL SOON COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. IT REALLY IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT OFFER A PATH STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WHERE WE HAVE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, RANCHES AND FAMILY FARMS. JOE BIDEN WOULD ACTUALLY RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RATE TAPE THAN ANY , RED TAPE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN PLANS TO BURY OUR ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE, STIFLING JOBS. JOE BIDEN EVEN HAS A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] AND IS NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS, IT IS ABOUT VALUES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW, BUT FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. AND JOE BIDEN WHERE JOE BIDEN ABANDON HIS HISTORIC OPPOSITION TO TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION, HE NOW SUPPORTS USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND MAYBE WORST OF ALL, AS WE GATHER TODAY FOR COPS FOR TRUMP IN ARIZONA, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, QUOTE, ""SYSTEMICALLY RACIST."" AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS, AGAIN, ""AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES."" WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE RADICAL LEFT SAYS WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING OUR POLICE OR SUPPORTING ALL THE FAMILIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA KNOW DIFFERENT, THE MAKE AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IS SUPPORTING OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS. WE CAN DO BOTH. WE HAVE DONE BOTH. AND WE WILL KEEP DOING BOTH FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, AS JUSTIN SAID, CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. AND ARE MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN THOSE CITIES YOU HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BELIEVING THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY, AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. I JUST HEARD MINNEAPOLIS HAS ALREADY BEGUN DISMANTLING THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN NEW YORK CITY, MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO ACTUALLY CUT THE NYPD BUDGET BY $1 BILLION. AND ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK, THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY APPROVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUDGET CUTS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AFTER WATCHING ANARCHISTS AND RIOTERS TAKE OVER PART OF THEIR CITY FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. AND WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD SUPPORT CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE REPLIED, YES, ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, AMID EFFORTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE. AND AS WE SEE MAJOR CITIES STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUYING INTO THE AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, WE ARE ALSO SEEING CRIME RISE IN THOSE VERY SAME CITIES ACROSS THE NATION. JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND ALONE, WE HAD 40 PEOPLE SHOT IN CHICAGO. NEW YORK CITY REACHED ITS 1000TH VICTIM,AND HAS HAD MORE SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR THAN IN ALL OF THE LAST YEAR ALREADY. IN FACT, IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, 21 PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT A BLOCK PARTY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. IN CITY AFTER CITY, WE SEE THE CRIME RATE RISING, THE MURDER RATE RISING. IN CITIES THAT ARE STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE FAMILIES, IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THIS LAND, MEN AND WOMEN OF ARIZONA, THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. HONESTLY, THOSE HEARTBREAKING NUMBERS ARE JUST A PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA. THE TRUTH IS, YOU WILL NOT BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN DEMOCRATS CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT IN THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. AS THEY MAKE THEIR CASE, ON THE AIRWAVES OF THE NATION NEXT WEEK, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS DIRECTLY FROM ME, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE. WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE WITH MORE RESOURCES AND WITH MORE SUPPORT. WE ARE GOING TO BACK OF THE BLUEBIRD MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY, ENHANCED TRAINING AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND FUNDING LIKE THE FUNDING WE PROVIDED FOR 4000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS THROUGH THE COPS PROGRAM. AND AS THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A MONTH AGO, BY MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM GET BETTER TRAINED TO DO THEIR JOB IN THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE KNOW, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WEARING THE UNIFORM, NO ONE HATES BAD COPS, ONLY BAD COPS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOYD, AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR RIOTING AND LOOTING AND THE ARSON THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYS OF THAT FOLLOWED. [APPLAUSE] BURNING CHURCHES IS NOT PROTEST, TAKING DOWN STATUES IS NOT FREE SPEECH. THROWING ROCKS AT OFFICERS IN TUCSON IS NOT PEACEFUL PROTEST. AND THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS ARE NOT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS, THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. [APPLAUSE] WHILE JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONTINUE TO CODDLE THE RADICAL LEFT, FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL TO CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. JUST LAST MONTH AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE ANNOUNCED WHAT WE CALL OPERATION LEGEND, A SURGE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INTO OUR HARDEST HIT CITIES. CITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING ENORMOUS SURGES IN VIOLENCE AND CRIME. DUE TO MISS GOVERNANCE , MISGOVERNANCE IN THE DRIVE FOR DEFUNDING , AND THE DRIVER DEFUNDING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT. THE OPERATION IS NAMED AFTER A FOUR YEAR OLD AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOY, NAMED LEGEND. LAST MONTH, LITTLE LEGEND WAS GUNNED DOWN WHILE SLEEPING IN HIS HOME IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. THAT FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT BEFORE BUILDING A PILLOW FORCE WITH HIS DAD. , FORT WITH HIS DAD. AND WHEN HE WAS SHOT, HE WAS SLEEPING IN THE FORT HE AND HIS DAD HAD MADE. WHEN POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, THEY RUSHED HIM TO THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. LITTLE LEGEND DIED OF HIS INJURIES. WITH THE LAUNCH OF OPERATION LEGEND, I PROMISE YOU THAT LITTLE LEGEND WILL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN. [APPLAUSE] THE OPERATION IN HIS NAME IS, AS WE SPEAK MY BRINGING PEACE AND SECURITY TO CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHEN HIS MOTHER HEARD ABOUT THE OPERATION, EVEN HEARD SOME OF THE CRITICISM, HIS MOM SAID, ""IF YOU ARE AGAINST THAT, MAYBE YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE."" SHE WAS RIGHT. BUT IT'S STORIES LIKE LEGEND, THAT BREAK THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IS, IT'S LITTLE ONES LIKE LEGEND, AND LIKE HIS FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HE LIVED, THAT DREW THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM INTO SERVICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T AN OCCUPATION SO MUCH IT IS A CALLING. AND I NEVER TALK TO A POLICE OFFICER THAT DIDN'T SPEAK OF IT JUST THAT WAY. IT'S A SELFLESS CALLING. TO COUNT OTHERS AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELF. IT'S A CALLING TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO STAND THE WATCH. AND IT IS A CALLING THAT IS BORN MORE OF THE HEART THAN OF THE MIND. AND EVERY POLICE OFFICER I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO ABOUT WHY THEY SERVE HAS MADE IT CLEAR, YOU SERVE BECAUSE YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. YOU LOVE YOUR CITY. YOU LOVE THIS STATE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA OLIVIA RIGHT BACK. , LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE MAY COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BUT WE ARE UNITED IN OUR DESIRE TO SHARE PEACE. YOU ARE THE INSTRUMENT OF SECURING THAT FOR EVERY AMERICAN, OF EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. SO FOR ALL YOU DO ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL NATION, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. THIS PRESIDENT, THIS VICE PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES I REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF MY HEROES WEAR UNIFORMS. NOT ON THE GRIDIRON, NOT ON THE HARDCOURT, BUT WEAR THE UNIFORMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WEAR THE UNIFORM OF OUR ARMED FORCES. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, WE WOULD DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE, AND I GOT TO SEE MY UNCLE. HE WOULD DRESS OUT EVERY DAY THAT WE WERE THERE. WHEN HE WOULD COME WALKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM WEARING THAT CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT UNIFORM, THAT SHINY LEATHER BELT, THE SIDEARM, BADGE ON HIS CHEST, IT MADE ME PROUD. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU THAT WEARS THE UNIFORM, BUT TELL YOUR FAMILIES WE ARE JUST AS GRATEFUL TO THEM, BECAUSE I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A MEMBER OF A FAMILY THAT DOES. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FAMILIES, FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY GIVE YOU AS YOU SERVE. [APPLAUSE] ON BEHALF OF YOUR PRESIDENT AND ALL OF THE GRATEFUL AMERICAN PEOPLE, I'M HERE TO SAY THANKS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THIS NATION. YOU SEE IT WHEN YOU ARE WALKING THE BEAT, WHEN YOU STOP TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE, WHEN YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE, THE CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR YOUR PLACE OF WORSHIP. PEOPLE SHOW YOU THAT RESPECT. I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL IT EVERY DAY. DESPITE WHAT HAPPENS IN PUBLIC DEBATE OR ON THE AIRWAVES OF TELEVISION, I KNOW HER ON THE STREETS OF TUCSON AND ALL ACROSS ARIZONA, YOU FEEL THE GRATITUDE. I ALSO HOPE YOU FEEL ONE OTHER THING. I HOPE AS YOU GO OUT THE DOOR IN THE MORNING, I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT YOU ARE CARRIED INTO SERVICE EVERY DAY BY THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO PRAY FOR YOU, PRAY FOR YOUR SAFETY IN PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY , AND PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE NATION OF FAITH. I HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE I GO, AND I NEVER WANT YOU TO DOUBT IT. WHEN YOU PUT ON THE UNIFORM YOU DO NOT GO ALONE, YOU GO WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUR PRESIDENT, THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVE. I BELIEVE YOU ALSO GO WITH THE GRACE OF GOD. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEAR GREAT RESPONSE ABILITY, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE , RESPONSIBILITY, HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE. THE BIBLE REMINDS US THERE IS NO AUTHORITY BUT WHICH GOD HAS ESTABLISHED, AND EACH ONE OF YOU THAT PROTECTS AND DESERVES, OR AS THE GOOD BOOK SAYS, SERVICE FOR GOOD, DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT TRUTH, THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THAT YOU TAKE AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. ON THEIR BEHALF, AND ON OUR BEHALF, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN ARIZONA. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT SENATOR MCSALLY. AND I KNOW, JUST SEEING THE ENTHUSIASM IN THIS ROOM, IF WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA, WE WILL WIN A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO REELECT THAT SENATOR TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, AND WE WILL ELECT A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH TIFFANY AND BRANDON. [APPLAUSE] V.P. PENCE: AND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE WILL MAKE ARIZONA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE WILL MAKE ARIZONA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND TO BORROW A PHRASE, ""WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN."" THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. (music) WE ARE TAKING YOUR CALLS LIVE ON THE AIR. WE WILL DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT YOU. THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT.

CSPANMP1382020160	Mike Pence	2020-08-13	Vice President Pence Meets with Farmers in Des Moines, Iowa	"THE CONTENDERS, ABOUT THE MEN WHO RAN FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND LOST BUT CHANGED POLITICAL HISTORY. ALL WEEK ON C-SPAN. FRIDAY, THE 1916 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT, CHARLES EVANS HUGHES. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE TRAVELED TO THE IOWA STATE FAIRGROUNDS IN DES MOINES TO FUND THE PRESIDENT'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN. THE EVENT INCLUDED GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS AND JONI ERNST RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN NOVEMBER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME THE GOVERNOR OF IOWA, KIM REYNOLDS. [APPLAUSE] GOV. REYNOLDS: LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN A VERY TRYING WEEK ON TOP OF SOME VERY TRYING YEARS. I APPRECIATE THE VICE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM BEING HERE, TAKING TIME TO MEET WITH OUR IOWA FARMERS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SEVERE WEATHER WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. I SPENT THE LAST TWO DAYS SURVEYING, AND IT IS DEVASTATING AND WIDESPREAD. FROM FLATTENED CORNFIELDS TO DESTROYED GRAIN BINS AND STRUCTURES, IT IS ANOTHER HUGE BLOW TO IOWA FARMERS. EARLY AND I WILL STRESS EARLY ESTIMATES SHOW AT LEAST 10 MILLION CROP ACRES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED, HALF OF OUR CROPLAND. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE STRUCTURES AND STORAGE ISSUES WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE WITHOUT POWER. AT ITS PEAK WE HAD 550,000 HOUSEHOLDS THAT DID NOT HAVE POWER, INCLUDING 97% OF WHEN COUNTY. BUT, THROUGHOUT THE DEVASTATION, THE RESILIENCE AND THE DETERMINATION OF IOWANS CONTINUES TO SHOW THROUGH. FIRST RESPONDERS, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT , MANAGERS SPRING TO ACTION. UTILITY WORKERS FROM AROUND IOWA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE WORKING 24/7 TO RESTORE POWER. MID AM HAD 500 RESOURCES ON THE SITE. ALLIANCE HAS TEAMS AS WELL. PEOPLE ARE OPENING THEIR HOMES TO THOSE WITHOUT POWER AND FOOD. I WAS TOURING A FARM YESTERDAY. WE HAD NOT EATEN ALL DAY. I SAID WHERE IS THE NEAREST GAS STATION? HE SAID, HEY, I CAN FIRE UP THE GRILL AND WE WILL FIX YOU SUPPER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. I SAID, THAT IS IOWA. [APPLAUSE] FARMERS ARE BUSY ASSESSING THEIR FIELDS AND WORKING TO SALVAGE THEIR CROPS. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE A STRONG PARTNER IN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT ON TUESDAY. HE CALLED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DEVASTATION WAS, TO LET US KNOW WE HAVE HIS FULL SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. I AM PRESCIENT , I APPRECIATE THEIR UNENDING COMMITMENT TO IOWA. I AM ALSO EXTREMELY THANKFUL TO HAVE OUR SENATORS, SENATOR JONI ERNST, IN WASHINGTON. SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EMBODIES THE STRENGTH AND THE DETERMINATION OF IOWA. WHETHER SHE IS HELPING IOWANS WITH COVID-19, TRADE, PROTECTING THE BIOFUEL INDUSTRY, OR HER RESPONSE TO DISASTER RECOVERY, WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A FIGHTER LIKE JONI. IOWA'S FARMERS IN SMALL TOWNS COULD NOT HAVE A MORE FAITHFUL FRIEND THAN HER AND A STRONGER ADVOCATE ON YOUR BEHALF. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR AND PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE IOWA'S AMAZING JUNIOR SENDER , SENATOR AND MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR ERNST. [APPLAUSE] I APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH. JUST AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, PRAYERS GO OUT TO EVERYONE THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THESE LATEST STORMS IN IOWA. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND SEE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. I WAS OUT EARLIER TODAY. I WILL BE OUT AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING. GOD BLESS THEM. WE WANT THEM TO STAY SAFE AND MAKE IT THROUGH THIS, AND THEY WILL. WE ARE IOWA STRONG AND WE ARE IOWA RESILIENT. AGAIN, LET US FOCUS ON RIGHT HERE AND NOW THOUGH. WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. I SEE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN THE CROWD, AND I AM SO THANKFUL FOR YOU. AND I AM THANKFUL TO BE HERE WITH MY FRIEND MIKE PENCE. WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN JUST A SECOND. [APPLAUSE] THE VICE PRESIDENT IS FROM ANOTHER I STATE, INDIANA, BUT WE WILL FORGIVE HIM. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, HE LOVES FARMERS. BEING THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, HE LOVES FARMERS AND HE REALLY GETS IT. I AM JONI ERNST. I DON'T WANT YOUR FORGIVENESS. NOVEMBER 3 IS COMING QUICKLY. [APPLAUSE] BUT I WAS RAISED ON A SMALL FARM IN SOUTHWEST IOWA AND I AM SO PROUD OF THAT. I STILL CALL MONTGOMERY COUNTY HOME. THE FOLKS BACK HOME, REALLY A COMMUNITY THAT RAISED ME. MY FOLKS INSTILLED VALUES, HARD WORK, YOU NAME IT, IN ME, THAT ALL OF US FARM KIDS HAVE. I DID WORK MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, IOWA STATE GRADUATE. [APPLAUSE] AND I HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO SERVING IOWANS AND OUR GREAT COUNTRY. I HAVE SERVED AS COUNTY AUDITOR FOR MICAH MURRAY COUNTY. I HAVE SERVED , FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY. I HAVE SERVED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I HAVE SERVED AS A STATE SENATOR REPRESENTING SOUTHWEST IOWA. AND NOW THE GREAT HONOR AS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS DESCRIBE WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE TWO ROADS. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT CHOOSING A DIRECTION FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND AHEAD OF US, WE HAVE THOSE ROADS. ON ONE HAND WE HAVE THE ROAD OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND JOINT. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD ROAD TO ME. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE A ROAD OF THE RADICAL LEFT. ON THAT ROAD IS PAVED BY THOSE RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST POLICIES THAT ARE SO DETRIMENTAL TO IOWA AGRICULTURE. THEY ARE PAVED WITH ABORTION ON DEMAND, WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT ROLLBACKS THAT NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN PROPOSING. AND OF COURSE THE HOPES AND DREAMS OF EVERY COASTAL ELITE. THAT IS THE OTHER ROAD. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THAT FIRST ROAD AND THAT IS THE ROAD OF PROSPERITY, OF FREEDOM, AND OF CHOICE. I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THAT ROAD WITH ME. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE ROAD I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR. I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THAT. THIS IS THE ROAD THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE ARE FIGHTING FOR AS WELL. ARE WE GOING TO SUPPORT THEM? [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, OUR AMERICAN DREAM IS STILL ALIVE AND STILL DOING WELL BECAUSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE HEARTLAND. FOR ALL OF OUR FARMERS OUT THERE, ANYBODY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE? [APPLAUSE] THAT'S MOST OF YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON THAT SMALL FARM I WAS RAISED ON AND I THINK SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE SOME OF THIS , WILL HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE, TOO, I GREW UP AROUND HOGS. YOU SAW MY ADS. WE WERE TAUGHT TO WORK WITH OUR HANDS, TO CLEAN THE STALLS, SHOVELING WITH A NOW CALL ORGANIC FERTILIZER, WHATEVER THE LEFT WANT TO CALL IT TODAY. WE WORKED REALLY HARD. THAT REALLY DID SHAPE WHO I AM TODAY. IN VERY PROFOUND WAYS, UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY JOB IS WORTH DOING AREA WE ARE FEEDING AND FUELING A NATION. RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF IOWA. KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. [APPLAUSE] IT IS EASY TO GIVE CHEAP TALK ABOUT AGRICULTURE. THERE ARE SOME ENGAGED IN THIS RACE LIKE MY OPPONENT, THERESA GREENFIELD, THAT IS OFFERING UP A LOT OF CHEAP TALK. ABOUT AGRICULTURE. THOSE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN IT KNOW THAT IT IS 24/7. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GET A LITTLE DIRTY AND GET IN THE MUD, RIGHT? THAT'S A LOT LIKE POLITICS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THIS. AND I KNOW OUR FARMERS WILL NEVER FORGET HOW BAD BARACK OBAMA WAS FOR FARMERS. THINK BACK. THINK BACK. WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT AN OVERREACHING, OVERBURDENED SOME REGULATION THAT WAS ON AGRICULTURE. ON FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AND OF COURSE, JOE BIDEN AND THERESA GREENFIELD ARE HIDING. THE CATCH PHRASE FOR THERESA GREENFIELD RIGHT NOW IS HIDING WITH BIDEN. SHE IS HIDING WITH BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] I'M WONDERING IF JOE BIDEN AND THERESA GREENFIELD ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THEIR BASEMENTS LONG ENOUGH TO SAY WHETHER THEY SUPPORT A PLAN LIKE BARACK OBAMA DID THAT WOULD REGULATE MOST OF IOWA'S CROPLAND. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR AN ANSWER. AT LEAST ONE ANSWER FROM THERESA GREENFIELD. THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOTTEN IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE PLAN CALLED THE GREEN NEW. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THAT? [BOOING] NO GREEN NEW DEAL. IT IS A ROTTEN DEAL FOR FARMERS. TOGETHER ALONGSIDE OUR FARMERS AND OUR PRODUCERS, WE HAVE FOUGHT DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR IOWA'S FARMERS, OUR AGGIE INDUSTRY, OUR FUELS INDUSTRY. WE HAVE KEPT OUR FARMING ECONOMY STRONG AND EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMERS TO MAKE A LIVING AROUND THE GLOBE. EVEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS, AGAIN, LET'S GO BACK TO THOSE TWO ROADS. THE ONE IS THE ROAD OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND CHOICE. THE OTHER ONE, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO OVER IT AGAIN. WE DON'T NEED THAT. WE DON'T NEED FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE TO OUR GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE, FOLKS, WE KEEP GETTING IT RIGHT. FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND CHOICE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE SAID IT ONCE, I HAVE SET IT TWICE, I HAVE SAID IT A DOZEN TIMES. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH ELECTION CYCLE AND WE NEED EVERYONE OUT THERE PARTICIPATING. I AM A FIGHTER. I AM A FIGHTER. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PRESSING ON THROUGH THE VERY LAST MINUTES AND HOURS OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE. WE HAVE TO HOLD THIS STATE AND WE HAVE TO HOLD THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS WHY IT IS SUCH AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE ON THIS STAGE TODAY INTRODUCING A MAN I HAVE KNOWN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. I AM A GREAT ADMIRER OF THIS GENTLEMAN. HE SERVED IN SOME ANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES FROM CONGRESS TO GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA. HE IS NONE OTHER THAN OUR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. HE WILL JOIN ME ON THIS STAGE. GIVE A WARM IOWA WELCOME TO OUR VICE PRESIDENT. (music) [APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, IOWA. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE HAWKEYE STATE. TO GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS, SENATOR JONI ERNST, TO ALL OF THE GREAT AMERICANS GATHERED HERE TODAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING AND BEING PART OF A NATIONAL MOVEMENT. FARMERS AND RANCHERS FOR TRUMP. I WANT TO THANK JONI ERNST FOR THOSE GREAT WORDS AND THANK YOU GOVERNOR. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE STATE OF IOWA IS TRULY BLESSED. THAT A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE WHO HAS SERVED THIS NATION IN UNIFORM AND WHO FIGHTS FOR THE HAWKEYE STATE EVERY SINGLE DAY, SENATOR JONI ERNST. IS A NATIONAL TREASURE. [APPLAUSE] PENCE: I KNOW WE ARE GATHERING AT A TIME OF GREAT PROGRESS, GREAT HOPE. A TIME OF CHOOSING RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. BEFORE I GET STARTED, LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS EVERY IOAN AND FRANKLY PEOPLE ACROSS THE HEARTLAND OF THIS COUNTRY. THE DERECHO THAT DESTROYED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF CROPS, LEFT IOWANS WITHOUT POWER, AND TRAGICALLY TOOK THE LIVES OF TWO IOWANS. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS STORM, AS A LIFELONG HOOSIER, I WAS TAKEN ABACK. TO HEAR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. I JUST MET WITH FAMILIES WHO LITERALLY HAVE SEEN VIRTUALLY THEIR ENTIRE CROP WIPED OUT. BUT THEY WERE STANDING STRONG, STANDING TOGETHER. I ASSURED THEM THEY AND ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS DERECHO ARE ON THE HEARTS AND IN THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. LET ME SAY, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND OUR ADMINISTRATION, I WANT IOWANS TO KNOW WE ARE WITH YOU, WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH YOU, AND WE WILL WORK WITH YOUR GOVERNOR AND YOUR SENATORS TO MAKE SURE WE BRING IOWA ALL THE WAY BACK. BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. I PROMISE. BUT IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE IN IOWA. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT SINCE , STOOD STRONG FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. A PROMISE HE ALWAYS WILL. AS A SON OF THE HEARTLAND, I FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. THAT'S WHY I AM HERE TODAY. I AM HERE BECAUSE IOWA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WHILE YOU ARE AT IT, WE NEED SIX MORE YEARS OF SENATOR JONI ERNST AREA IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. LET ME ALSO SAY, THE PRESIDENT AND I AND SENATOR ERNST AND YOUR GREAT GOVERNOR NEED THE GREAT STATE OF IOWA TO SEND MORE TO WASHINGTON, D.C.. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TODAY. I KNOW IN THE SUMMERTIME THE IOWA STATE FAIRGROUNDS IS USUALLY A LITTLE BUSIER. BUT THESE ARE NO ORDINARY TIMES. IT IS STILL A JOY TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR BUSINESS AND FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN FLAG, I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP TO THE RADICAL LEFT AND THEIR SOCIALIST AGENDA, WE STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND WHEN THIS PRESIDENT FIGHTS FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND THOSE WITH THE STRENGTH OF THIS NATION BEGINS WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK THE LAND, WE STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. FOUR YEARS AGO A MOVEMENT WAS BORN. A MOVEMENT OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE. HERE IN IOWA YOU KNEW WE COULD BE STRONG AGAIN. YOU KNEW WE COULD BE PROSPEROUS AGAIN. YOU SAID YES TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 AND I KNOW IOWA IS GOING TO SAY YES TO FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] . VICE PRES. PENCE: THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION COULD NOT BE CLEARER. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. IN THIS PRESIDENT YOU HAVE A LEADER WHO HAS DONE MORE FOR THIS COUNTRY'S ECONOMY, MORE TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY, MORE TO EXTEND THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES AND STRIDENT IN , ENSHRINED IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT OF THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME AREA THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT. THREE YEARS OF ACTION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF RESULTS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. BUT WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, IOWA. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND THEN SOME. AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. I MUST TELL YOU, IT IS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, THE HIGHEST TITLE I WILL EVER HOLD. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE AND THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF A UNITED STATES NAVY PILOT, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO HAS REBUILT THE MILITARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE MADE OUR STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD STRONGER. THIS PRESIDENT CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND FAMILY FARM, AND HE HAS CUT MORE REDTAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION JOBS ACROSS THIS NATION. 2 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY. 7 MILLION AMERICANS WERE ABLE TO LEAVE FOOD STAMPS BEHIND AND PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. THIS PRESIDENT AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF IT ALWAYS PUT FAMILY, FARMERS, AND RANCHERS FIRST. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE DID. AND THOSE TAX CUTS, WE ELIMINATED THE ESTATE TAX FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY FAMILY FARM. DEATH IS NO LONGER A TAXABLE OFFENSE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: BEING FROM THE HEARTLAND, THIS PRESIDENT ALLOWED FOR IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF EQUIPMENT. WE MADE GREAT PROGRESS. OUR ECONOMY WAS GROWING AS NEVER BEFORE. IN THREE SHORT LEADERS , SHORT YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ALLIES LIKE JONI ERNST, WORKED TOGETHER TO CREATE THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK OUR NATION FROM CHINA. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH A CHALLENGING TIME. EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SHINE FORTH. THIS PRESIDENT MARSHALL DID NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE, BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE. AMERICA HAS DONE MORE TESTING THE CORONAVIRUS THAN ANY NATION ON EARTH BY FAR. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, OUR TASK FORCE ARRANGED FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND DELIVERY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND HOSPITALS ACROSS THIS NATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND-THE-CLOCK SINCE FEBRUARY THIS YEAR DEVELOPING NEW THERAPEUTIC, MEDICINES THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'M PROUD TO SAY I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. ONLY IN AMERICA. ONLY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS FIRST. TO SAVE LIVES. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF IOWA WILL DO AS YOU HAVE DONE ALL ALONG. PUT THE HEALTH OF OTHERS FIRST. NOT A DAY HAS GONE BY SINCE THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO LEAVE THE TASK FORCE WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED LOSS. TODAY I ENCOURAGE YOUR PRAYERS FOR THE MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES INCLUDING HERE IN IOWA. OUR HEARTS ARE ALSO FULL OF GRATITUDE FOR THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED BY THE INCREDIBLE FIRST RESPONDERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THIS NATION. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF HEROIC. AND YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: LET ME ALSO SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I COULD NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP AND CHARACTER OF GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. SHE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB LEADING THIS STATE THROUGH CHALLENGING TIMES AND GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. BRINGING IOWA ALL THE WAY BACK. AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY HAD LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THAT SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, OF LESS TAXES, MORE FREE AND FAIR TRADE, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, AN AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN. FROM THAT HEIGHT OF 22 MILLION JOBS LOST, AS OF A SHORT TIME AGO, THIS ECONOMY IS ALREADY ADDING BACK 9.3 MILLION JOBS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. [NO AUDIO] , [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE AND THE GOVERNOR KNOWS WE MEAN IT. AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CONTEND WITH THIS PANDEMIC, WE WILL NOT REST, WE WILL NOT RELENT, WE WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE AND NO EFFORT UNTIL IOWA AND AMERICA PUT THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST AND WE BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK. WE OPEN UP AMERICA AND OPEN UP AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: TO DO THAT WE WILL DO OUR PART, BUT TO BRING AMERICA BACK, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 2[APPLAUSE] WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION BEGINS WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS. TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THIS PRESIDENT, I MENTIONED BEFORE, HAS ALREADY NOT JUST CUT TAXES FOR FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES, BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BUSY ROLLING BACK RED TAPE AT A RECORD LEVEL. PRESIDENT TRUMP AT SIGN MORE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL REDTAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. AS SENATOR ERNST REFLECTED , AND I WAS THERE WHEN HE SIGNED IT , HE SIGNED A MEASURE TO ENSURE FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY. WE REPEALED THE WATERS OF THE USA ROLE AND RESTORED PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] WHERE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS TURNED THEIR BACK ON FARMERS AND ETHANOL PRODUCERS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE PEOPLE OF IOWA THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXPAND INTO ALL MARKETS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE. LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT TRAVELED TO COUNCIL BLUFFS AND ANNOUNCED E15 IS AVAILABLE YEAR-ROUND. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS AFTER DECADES OF BEING HELD BACK, AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS, AND WE WILL FIGHT TO EXPAND ETHANOL AS A PART OF AMERICA'S VITAL ENERGY INDUSTRY. OUR FUTURE OF INDEPENDENT AND DOMINANCE, WE ARE SETTING RECORDS EVERY DAY. WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR JONI ERNST, AND STRONG SENSE OF OLD AND UNWAVERING CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, THIS PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT ON RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS THAT ENSURES A 15 BILLION GALLON ETHANOL BLENDED INTO THE FUEL SUPPLY IN 2020. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU IN IOWA THE IMPACT NASA HAD ON COMMUNITIES AND MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. IN 2016 WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND I WERE COMING TO THE STATE, HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO NAFTA, WE COULD DO BETTER. HE SAID WE WOULD RENEW OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. SOME PEOPLE SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE. I WATCHED HIM DO IT. HE ROLLED HIS SLEEVES UP, AND A MAN WHO WROTE ""PART OF THE DEAL"" GOT A GREAT DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE USMCA IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. [APPLAUSE] FOR IOWA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS, IN 2018 FARMERS AND RANCHERS EXPORTED $6 BILLION WORTH OF GOODS TO CANADA AND MEXICO. CANADA HAS AGREED TO EXPAND MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN DAIRY, EGGS, POULTRY. WE THINK WE WILL SELL $2.2 BILLION MORE IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CANADA AND MEXICO ALONE. THAT INCLUDES $3 MILLION IN DAIRY EXPORTS IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. USMCA IS A WIN FOR IOWA, A WIN FOR THE HEARTLAND AND AMERICA'S FARMERS. [APPLAUSE] WE THINK EXPERTS TELL US IT WILL CREATE 600,000 JOBS AND ADD $250 BILLION TO THE ECONOMY OUT OF THE GATE. IT IS INCREDIBLE. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, BEFORE THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE, HE MADE IT CLEAR THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER TO CHINA WAS OVER. WE WERE GOING TO FIGHT FOR AMERICAN JOBS, AMERICAN FARMERS, AMERICAN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] FOR YEARS, ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER IN BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES STOOD IDLY BY WHILE WE SAW CHINA A MASS AND EXTRAORDINARY TRADE SURPLUS. HALF OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WHEN WE TOOK OFFICE WAS WITH CHINA ALONE. AT A TIME WHEN CHINA WAS GIVING US LIMITED ACCESS TO WHAT WE MAKE AND GROW IN THIS COUNTRY. $500 BILLION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WAS WITH CHINA. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE CLEAR, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WE STOOD STRONG, AND FARMERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY STOOD STRONG . YOU STOOD WITH US AS THE PRESIDENT PUT TARIFFS IN PLACE TO LEVEL A PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINA. THE WAY FARMERS AND RANCHERS STOOD IN THE POCKET FOR THIS PRESIDENT AND FREE AND FAIR TRADE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO THE NATION. YOU HAVE ARTIFACTS. , YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. FARMERS AND RANCHERS UNDERSTAND TO GET THINGS DONE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A FIRM STAND. BECAUSE OF THE STAND YOU TOOK, THE STAN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK, IT SEEMS LIKE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL, AND WE SECURED $50 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CHINA FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS PROGRESS. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO, AND MOST OF THE TARIFFS ARE STILL THERE, BUT IT IS A BEGINNING. I JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING THAT CORN SALES TO CHINA JUST BROKE ALL RECORDS LAST MONTH. ON JULY 30, THE USDA REPORTED CORN SALES OF 1.9 4 MILLION METRIC TONS TO CHINA, THE LARGEST DAILY SALES TOTAL EVER. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WORKING. THEY ARE BUYING. WE ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. IN JULY, SOYBEANS TO CHINA REACHED 3 MILLION METRIC TONS, THE PERCENT OF U.S. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS GOING TO CHINA ARE COMPARED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. TWICE THE SHARE WENT TO CHINA IN 2017. MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED AT THIS FARMERS AND RANCHERS FOR TRUMP RALLY IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND FIRM WITH CHINA UNTIL WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, NOT JUST FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL BUT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND AMERICAN WORKERS. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION, WE ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY OPPOSITION FROM THE LEFT AND THE DEMOCRATS. AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF A CHALLENGING PANDEMIC. INCREDIBLE AND HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WILLING TO FIGHT EACH AND EVERY DAY. I PROMISE YOU THE GUY I SERVE WITH WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. [APPLAUSE] YOU DESERVE TO KNOW ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IS AT RISK . MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING, BUT SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. THAT IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW WELL. THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, THE STAKES NEVER HAVE BEEN HIGHER. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE. ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. FAMILIES IN IOWA, OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT. THERE ARE THINGS ON THE BALLOT MORE FUNDAMENTAL. AND MORE FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. I THINK THIS COMING ELECTION, THE CHOICE IS NOT WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL, WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, I THINK THE CHOICE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION IS WHETHER WE LEAVE A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE BELIEVE TORTURING GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIVE TWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. THE OTHER LEADS INEXORABLY TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL SET AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE, AND WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, BUT IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION. THAT IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE TAX INCREASE THAT HILLARY CLINTON NEVER PROPOSED. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND WE WILL KEEP DELIVERING TAX RELIEF TO WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL BURY THE ECONOMY UNDER MORE REGULATION AND BUREAUCRACY. THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR HE NAMED AS HIS RUNNING MATE THIS WEEK SAID DURING HER SHORT CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT THAT AMERICANS NEEDED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OUR EATING HABITS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. SENATOR HARRIS SAID SHE WOULD CHANGE THE DIETARY GUIDELINES OF THIS COUNTRY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RED MEAT AMERICANS CAN EAT. I HAVE RED MEAT FOR YOU. WE WILL NOT LET JOE BIDEN AND, LET HARRIS CUT AMERICA'S MEAT. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE WANTS TO REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND IMPLEMENT HIS OWN VERSION OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THESE RADICAL LEFT POLICIES WOULD DEVASTATE AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PUT AN ENERGY STRATEGY ON THE TABLE THAT IS DRIVING IN AMERICAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE, AND WE ARE EXPORTING ENERGY TO THE WORLD, AND WE WILL KEEP EXPANDING. [APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IS NOT JUST CLEAR AT HOME ON ISSUES THAT THERE DIRECTLY ON OUR LIVELIHOOD. IT IS A CONTRAST OF LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO REMEMBER JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN AND IN SUPPORT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. GENERAL SOLEMANI IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] FOUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS MADE PROMISES, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, THIS MORNING IN THE OVAL OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 25 YEARS A LEADING ARAB NATION HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL. THE UAE IS RECOGNIZING ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS HISTORY, AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP. THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND UP YOUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME HE HAS STOOD WITH THE MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY, AND WE ALWAYS WILL. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW, MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES AMERICA IS IN HIS WORDS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID YES, ABSOLUTELY. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. ON BEHALF OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD, ABOUT PROSPERITY, BUT ULTIMATELY THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, WE KNOW JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL APPOINT ACTIVIST JUDGES TO OUR COURTS WHO WILL LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY APPOINTED MORE THAN 200 FEDERAL JUDGES TO OUR COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL, AND THEY ARE ALL CONSERVATIVES WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF STATES, AND THE SECOND AMENDED RIGHT TO KEEP AND THEIR ARMS. , BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STALWART SUPPORT OF IOWA'S TWO GREAT SENATORS. JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR JONI ERNST AND SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY FOR STANDING STRONG. [APPLAUSE] THROUGHOUT IT ALL, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] WITH AN ELECTION 80 DAYS AWAY, WE HAVE WORKED TO DO TO CARRY OUR MESSAGE FORWARD. DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, INCLUDING TWO JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, A FEW RECENT DECISIONS REMIND US WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. LIKE THAT 5-4 DECISION THAT STRUCK DOWN A LOUISIANA LAW THAT SIMPLY REQUIRE DOCTORS THAT WORK IN ABORTION CLINICS TO HAVE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL, OR LIKE THE 5-4 DECISION THAT SAID THE STATE OF NEVADA CAN IMPOSE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON A CHAPEL THAN CAESAR'S PALACE. ONE THING IS CLEAR WITH THOSE DECISIONS, WE NEED MORE CONSERVATIVES ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] IRANFOR AMERICAN STRENGTH AND AMERICAN JOBS AND LAW AND ORDER AND LIBERTY AND LIFE, WE HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO REELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] IOWA, GET READY. BUCKLE UP. IT IS ON. YOU ALL KNOW MORE THAN MOST, WE WILL CARRY THE MESSAGE YOU JUST HEARD ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS NATION. WE NEED ALL OF YOU TO GET READY TO BRING IT LIKE YOU DID FOUR YEARS AGO. BRING THIS ENTHUSIASM, BRING YOUR VOICE AND SUPPORT, TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. AND ALL THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS NATION STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND CONTINUE TO BUILD AN AMERICAN FUTURE ON ALL THE IDEALS AND VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THE NATION GREAT IN THE PAST. AS WE OPEN UP AMERICA AGAIN, AS WE BRING OUR NATION BACK, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO REFLECT THOSE VALUES THAT ARE SO UNIQUE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT IS SUMMED UP IN ONE WORD, AND THAT IS FAITH. [APPLAUSE] I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT I WILL BE WITH SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. GROWING UP IN THE HEARTLAND AS I DID, WE HAD A CORNFIELD IN MY BACKYARD, 100 HEAD OF CATTLE THAT MY DAD HAD WITH A FEW PARTNERS. I HAVE MUCKED MY SHARE OF STALLS FOR HORSES, BUT I AM INSPIRED BY THE CHARACTER AND FAITH OF MANY WOMEN WHO WORK THE LAND. WHO RAISE THE LIVESTOCK. WHO FEED THE NATION. YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO COME FROM GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIP LIKE IOWA JUST PASSED THROUGH. YOU CAME THROUGH IT WITH A RESILIENCE AND STRENGTH THAT I THINK HAS BEEN A WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH FOR THE NATION. I HAVE ALWAYS MARVELED AT HOW MAY TIMES THE BIBLE TELLS US TO CONSIDER THE FARMER. TO LEARN FROM THE PATIENCE OF A FARMER, AND APPLY THAT TO HER PERSONAL LIVES. AS I GOT UP TODAY, I COULD NOT HELP BUT REMEMBER WHAT ONE GREAT RADIO HOST SAID SO MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN PAUL HARVEY TALKED ABOUT WHY GOD MADE A FARMER. HE SAID ON THE EIGHTH DAY GOD LOOKED DOWN ON HIS PARADISE AND SAID I NEEDED CARETAKER, SO I MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOMEBODY WILLING TO GET UP AND WORK ALL DAY IN THE FIELDS, MILK COWS, EAT SUPPER, THEN GO TO TOWN AND STATE PAST MIDNIGHT AT A MEETING OF THE SCHOOL BOARD, SO GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO GO DOUBLE SPEED TO GET THE HATE IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , HAY IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , RAIN CLOUDS. GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOME STRONG ENOUGH TO CLEAR TREES AND GENTLE ENOUGH TO TAME THE LANDS. WHO WILL STOP HIS MOWER AND SPLINT THE BROKEN LEG OF A MEADOWLARK. SO GOD MADE A FARMER. SOMEBODY TO SEED, WEED, FEED, PLOW, PLANT, AND REPLENISH AND FINISH A HARD WEEKS WORK WITH A DRIVE TO CHURCH. SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BAIL A FAMILY TOGETHER. THE SOFT STRONG BONDS OF SHARING, WHO WOULD LAUGH AND REPLY WITH SMILING EYES. WHEN A SON SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEND HIS LIFE DOING WHAT DAD DOES. GOD MADE A FARMER. I THINK GOD MADE A FARMER AND IN SO DOING MADE AMERICA STRONGER. THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN SO MUCH IS ON THE LINE, WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, I ASK YOU TO DRAW ON THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH. UNDERSTAND LEADERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY, PEOPLE RESPECT YOU NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO BUT BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO UNVEIL YOURSELF OF THAT STRENGTH. IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO ABOUT AHEAD AND BEND THE KNEE, WHICH NO FARMER I EVER MET WAS NOT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. REMEMBER, IF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY, HE WILL DO AS HE HAS DONE THROUGH MUCH MORE CHALLENGING HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HEAL THIS LAND. [APPLAUSE] THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I AM CONVINCED IF ALL OF US DO WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 3, YOUR SUPPORT WITH YOUR EXAMPLE, WITH YOUR VOICE AND YOUR PRAYERS, WE WILL REELECT THIS PRESIDENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, AND ELECT TWO NEW GREAT MEMBERS AND A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS AMERICA.

He was introduced by Governor Kim Reynolds and Senator Joni Ernst, both Iowa Republicans. During his remarks, the vice president encouraged those in attendance to vote for President Trump&rsquo;s reelection as well as that of Senator Ernst. He also talked about the president&rsquo;s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), who had been named as his running mate earlier in the week. Vice President Pence said the former vice president and Senator Harris were too progressive and would change the course of the nation.	474638-1	Speech

And that is that Michiga n and Ame rica need f orem or y ears of Pr esident Donald Trump in the W hite Ho use. Out it's on Michigan , and the road to victory goes right t hroug h the Great Lakes State. We need the people of this freedom loving state to do just what you di d in 2016. By tomor row night, we need Michigan to show America that this is Tru mp Country, but it really is great t o be with yo u all. It really is great. Als o, it's great to be here wi th some good friends of mine and other presidents, in fact, one of whom i s the highest rankin g combat veteran ever to serve in the Congre ss of the United States. Now he's one of th e strongest voices for our national events. J oin me in thanking Congressm an Jack Bergman, Will yo u? Thank you, Jack. It's also great to be here with a man wh o has served the people of Michigan in the State House, and I've served alon gside him, and I could tell y ou he is one of the s trongest allies of our p resident and our agenda in the Uni ted States Congress Congressman John Molinar an d let me sa y what a privil ege it is to be here wit h a man that I got to know over the las t co uple o f yea rs. He's a man of integ rity. He's a family man , a West P oint graduat e, a combat vetera n, a businessman and t he next senator from th e Great state of Michigan. John Jam es. Well, thank you all f o r being here. I know you'r e out today. Toe here and see o ur president. Show your support. But I al so kn ow you're here because of all th at we accomplished toge ther over the l ast four ye ars. I me an, think about it. Four years ago, we in herited a military tha t was hollowed out by d ev astating budget cuts , an economy struggli ng to brea k out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terr orism was on the ris e, and we witnessed a steady assau lt on our values. But in th ree short y ears we rebui ld our milita ry way, revive our economy. We secur ed our bo rder, supported law enforcement and stoo d for life, liberty a nd the Cons titution of the Un i ted State s. You know, after Joe Biden spe nt the previous eight years trying to tax and s pend and bail o ur way back to a gr owing eco nomy. President D onald T crea ted the greatest econom y in American histo ry on we're doing it Again, Michigan e me an, how ab out those new GDP nu mbers? Last wee k's You check that out 33% growth in the third quar ter shattered any previ ous record. The great American comeb ack is on on with four mor e years of Presi den t Donald Trump in the White House . We're gonna bring this economy back b igger and bette r than eve r before, you know, the president sai d. It was t he biggest quarter i n the history of our cou ntry, not even close. An d he and I both know this American comeb ack is a testam ent, all of yo u to the resi lie nce and the strength of the character of the American people. But it's also a tribute to a presid ent and our allies i n Congres s who crea ted the gre atest economy t he world has ever seen. T hat's wh y it's remarkable to think in the midst of a globa l pandemic, Jo e Biden wa nts to ra ise taxes by $4 trilli on. His running mate , Kamala Ha rris, said on Fr iday that their quo te first order of business would b e to get rid of President Trump's tax c uts. They got a $2 trillion green n ew deal. They wanna put socia lized medicine in th e heart of Obama c are, risk the heal th insurance of 180 million A mericans. But unde r Preside nt D onald Trump in three short ye ars, we cut taxes a cross t he board for working families and busin esses. We ro lled back more federal re d tape than any ad ministration in history . We fought for free and f air trade unleash ed American energy and bus inesses, larg e and small , creat ed seven mil lion good paying jobs , including 112,000 jobs right here in M ichigan. It's true . You know, when Joe B iden was vice pre sident, Am erica actually lo st 20 0,000 manufacturing jo bs. It's amazing, You know, I come from south of here in Indiana a nd just like Mich igan, you know, we do two t hings well around here. We make things a nd we grow thing s right. We'r e proud of him. But the last president wh o I h ear d is out campa ign ing today. Four years ag o, he sai d those jobs were never coming bac k. He actually said , What ma gic wand do you have? Well , we didn't n eed a mag ic wand. We just neede d President Dona ld Trump in the Wh ite House 500,000 manufacturing jobs created i n just three yea rs. And when it come s to tr ade, so importan t, what we make and what we grow. Joe Bid en Zeman, a c heerleader for Communist C hina all along the way , an d he never lifted a fin ger to re form a tr ade deal with Mexi co and Canada th at literally cost thousands of factories to close across this countr y. But under Presiden t Trump, w e put Ch ina on notice. Way im posed tariffs have made it clear the era of economic surrender is ov er and NAFTA is gone, a nd the U. S N. C. A is h ere t o stay. You know Jo e Biden's runn ing ma te. Actua lly, I had a deba te with her in Salt Lake City a couple of w eeks ago. Some people th ink we did all righ t, s o thank y ou. But I brought this up in t he debate because yo u deserve to know. Kamala H arris was one of on ly 10 senator s to vote against the U. S. M. C A. She said it didn 't go far eno ugh on climate change. I mean common. Harris put her radical environmental agenda a head of Michig an jobs in Michi gan. Workers don't make you a promise. We're four more years. Preside nt Trump will al ways put American jo bs and American work er s first. I'll tell yo u, it's just it 's clear on energy. Mean Jo e Biden and Kamala Harr is want to crush the America n economy und er a $2 trillion versio n of the green New Deal . Remember that fi rst debate? T he preside nt h ad to remind Joe B iden that he supported the green New De al. He does. I mean, the green New D eal. I'm telli ng you, it would actu ally raise the co st of electrici ty in your home and rais e the cost of ele ctricity in every business in M ichigan. President T He's been a champion for Am erican energy. We ended the war on coal . We've opened up our natur al resource is, and we're now a net exporter of energy for the first t ime in 70 years. It's true, but we're still Joe Biden and Kamala Harr is over the la st year said over and over aga in th at th ey wanna abolish fossil fuel s and banned frack ing. I me an, that would cos t hundreds of t housands o f direct job s across the Heart land. They said it over and over a gain, and then Joe Biden shows up in Pit tsburgh. I wouldn' t fa r from t here Today, c ouple of we eks back and He's trying to convince peopl e in Pennsylvan ia that he's not f or Bannon Frack, and he actually said our pre sident was lying about h is record. Remember, even in that pres idential debate? And how good did President Trump doing that? Presid ential debate? Um, I right out of the pa rk. Still going right? What? Well, in that presidential debate, you sa w the moment whe re Joe Biden said that we needed to quote tr ansition from the o il indu stry. President Trump said. Tha t's a big statement, righ t? An d then when the p reside nt called him on i t, he said, Show the tape. So we'v e been sho wing the tape and I bet with the p resident gets here, he's gon na show you the tape again. Many wome n of Michigan , no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris saying right n ow, you can take it to t he bank , Joe Biden and De mocratic Party. We're go nna try and abo lish fossil fu els closed down the oil industry banne d fracking, but we're not going to let it happen. We'r e gonna have mo re frack ing mawr, American en ergy, mawr, energy, in dependence for th is gener ation and for gener ations to co me when we r eelect Presiden t Donald Tr ump for four mo re years, Yeah, I mean, h onestly, her e's the choice America faces. It's a choice between a trump boom and a Bide n depression. I m ean, the stu dy just ca me out nonp artisan stud y That said Joe Bid en 's economic policies wo uld cost five milli on American jobs, and it w ould reduce the av erage income of Americ an fa milies by $6500 a year. So when yo u go home tonig ht, if you run into anybod y tonight or any time on Election D ay, who h asn't made a decision ye t in Michigan? Her e's what you gotta ask him. Seriously, just lo ok at him and say, Wh o do you r eally think K enbrell, This eco nomy all the way b ack? E. I mean a career po litician who spent 47 years raisi ng taxes, stifling the economy with regul ation and economic s urrender, or a pro ven job cre ator who's overseeing the faste st economic recovery in history to bring America al l the way back. We nee d four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, so it's about our economy. But we a ll know the security is the foundation o f our prosperity, and I couldn't be more prou d to serve alongsi de of president who c ares so deeply a bout the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might no t know. We've got some service members in our immedi ate family. My so ns, the U nited States Marine and my u nworthy son in law is the United States Navy pilo t currently deployed with the United St ates Navy. They couldn't be with us tonight , but I couldn' t be more proud that that Navy spouse, my wonderful d aughter Charlotte Pen ce Bond, is traveling with her mom a nd dad today. Would you sa y hi, so proud of? But she deserv ed to know when Joe Bide n was vice president. We went through years of rec kless budge t cuts, didn't we, John mean that hollowed out our milit ary readiness? And over the last f ew days, I read where Democrats i n Washington are already saying that th ey're planning. The y're planning massive cut s to our national def ense to pay for their bi g government prog rams. President Trump , we rebuild our m ilitary. This preside nt signed the large st investment in our national defense since the d ays of Ronald Reagan. And with four more years w e're going to k eep giving our s oldiers, sailo rs, ai rman, Marines and Coast Guard. The resource is and the sup port they need to defen d our nation. A nd it's not jus t been about those who serve in uniform . It's been about thos e of you who d id serve when Jo e Biden was vice president. We remembe r the scanda ls of the VA that shocked the c onscience of the nat ion. Don't wait. I mean , we had veterans that w ere literally d ying, w aiting for care of th e V A on waitin g lists. But when Presiden t Trump came i nto the Oval Office, those days are over. Our president has signed the mo st sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 y ears. We fired 3000 V A employees who weren't given our veterans the c are they des erve. The VA now has a 91% appr oval rating and veterans cho ices now ava ilable for eve ry veteran in America. A nd for a nation al defense to suppo rt our veteran s for Peace through streng th is just one mawr reason why we nee d a combat vete ran in the United Sta tes Senate. We need Joh n James in the Senat e from the grea t state of Michiga n. And when i t com es to law and order, P resident Donald Trump h as stood with the men and women who served on the th in blue line of law enfor cement every single day. I mean , you all know w hat the president I know. Men and women who put on the unifo rm of law enfo rcement in this country o r some of the best p eople in America, and they dese rve the respect of every American every day. After the s ummer of violence that we' ve seen after the rioti ng and looting that we saw in Philadelphi a this week, the tru th is Joe Biden would double down on the policie s t hat are le ading the viol ence in our cities. N ow Joe Bide n says that America is, i n his words, syst emically racist. He says that law enforcement h as an im plicit bias ag ainst mino rities. Wh en J oe Biden was asked whet her he'd cut funding for law enforcement, h e r eplied, Yes, absolutely. And his running mate, Kamala Ha rris, recently praised the L A mayor for cutting 1 50 million ou t of the LAPD's budget unde r President Donald Trump . I' ll make your pro mise. We'r e not going to defund t he police. N ot now, not ever. We 're gonna back the blu e, and we're gonna back the blue for four m ore years. You know the president. I know we don't have to cho ose between suppo rting law enforc ement and suppo rting ou r African Am eri can n eighbors and families and other minoriti es in our cities. We've don e both for the last 3.5 yea rs and we're gonna ke ep doing bot h. We'r e go nna support law enforc ement with more reso urce is and more trai ning. And w e're gonna keep cr eating jobs and opportunity and educational choice options for African Americans and all the families that li ve in o ur major cities. And we're gonna have law a nd order for every Amer ican of every rac e and creed and col or. So help us God. All along the way. Under th is president's leadership, we've stood for all the liberties and freedoms ens hrined in our founding documen ts like the freedom of religion, the fr eedom of speec h an d President Donald Trump h as stood strong for the Second A mendment right to keep and be ar arms. We've a ppointed more than 22 0 conservative judges to our f ederal courts at every level. An d I promise you, they 're a ll conservati ves wi ll uphold the Go d given liberties enshrined in our Constitu tion like Just ice Neil Gorsuch, Jus tice Brett Kavan augh and, jus t like Justice Amy Coney Barret t. T hen she gre at, didn't you got How much di d you like that when th ey asked her what sh e ha d on that piece of pape r a nd program? Nothin g. She 's goi ng to be an amaz ing jurors for g enerations to come and she's gonna she's gonna make America proud. But you all deserv ed to k now when Joe Biden was vice president. We saw a steady ault on our religious free dom. We di d. They use the power o f the bureaucratic st ate to erode the c onscience rights of do ctors and nurses. Th ey even hauled a grou p of Catholi c nuns into fed eral court to force the m to comprom ise their faith to live under th e mandates of ob amacare. It's true. Wh en Judge Amy Coney Barre tt was up for, ah , a different court two years ag o, that same r eligious intoleran ce among th e Democrats in Washington came out. The l eading Democrat on the Judiciary Com mittee said she was con cerned about jud ge barrettes Catho lic fait h becau se, she said, and I quote, th e dogma lives loudly withi n you and Hollywood elit es started a tt acking Judge Barrett, a nd they've never sto pped. Well, I got a message fo r the Democrats in Washingto n and their friend s in Ho llywood. Yeah, false al arm. I got a me ssage for the D emocrats in Washington and their frie nds in Holly wood that dogma lives lou dly in me t hat dog ma lives loudly in you an d the right to live and work an d worship according the d ictates of our faith. live s lo udly in the Constituti on of the United States of America and under President Do nald Trump. We've sto od for that first freedom, religious fr eedom s tr ong. We restored the conscience rights of doctor s and nurses, a nd it was Pre sident Donald Trump w ho ended the assault on the little sisters of the p oor, and the Su preme Court made it permanent. And fi nally, where Joe Biden and Kamal a Harris support t axpayer fundi ng of abortion all the w ay up to the mo ment o f birth, I couldn' t be more prou d to b e v ice president to a president w ho stands witho ut apolog y for the sanctity of human life . So in our fir st three years, w e rebuild our mil itary, we revived our eco nomy. We stoo d for law and order liber ties in life . None of th at would have been possible witho ut the strong support of Michigan's Republica ns in Congress. So right after y ou re elect Presiden t Donald Trump righ t aft er you send John Jam es to the United Sta tes Senate, we all need Michigan to send Congre ssman Jack B ergman and Congress man John Mullen are to a new Re publican majority and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all . Along out. I'm tel ling you out, you kn ow, whe n you look at what we w ere able to acc omplish al l of us for th e support of the people of Michigan, t hat historic el ection four years ago. I th ink ther e's only one way you co uld describe. I n th ree short years, we ma de America g reat again and then 202 0 arrived as Presi dent Trump lead our nation through the worst global pandemic in a century, and all alo ng the way, President Donald Trump put the health of Ame rica first. It's true. Before the first do cumented case of com munity spread, Pres ident Trump did what no American president has ever done in histo ry. He closed off all travel fr om China, the second l arges t economy in the worl d. Now Joe Biden at the time sa id th at was xenophobic , which is, I gu ess, a fancy word for racist. He sa id closing off travel durin g a globa l pande mic would actua lly quote mak e thing s worse. But Joe Bid en got it wrong, and Pres ident Donald Trump got it right . E can t ell you, as the head of th e White House coronaviru s task force the se last eight months, President Tr ump's action shutti ng off travel to China saved untold A merican lives because it bought us invaluable t ime to stand up the greate st national mobilization sinc e World War two. It's true. We re invented testi ng. We saw the m anufact uring production, i ncluding here in Michigan , a billions of su pplies of me dical equipment and PPE . We develop therapeu tics that air saving lives, and we are l iterally a s hort time away from having the f irst safe coronavirus vaccine and t ens of millions of dose s for the American people. Then, I promise you, people i n Michigan can be con fident we'r e gonna keep making sure thos e supp lies air available over the great d octors an d nurses were g onna keep p rotecting the vulne rable. We' re gonna keep saving liv es and distributi ve vaccine, a nd we're ope ning up America again. It's amazing t o think i n the last five months on th at foundation we p oured. And with the unpre ced ented relief for fam ilie s and busine sses, the president's secured from Congress. Af ter losing 22 million job s at the he ight of this pandemic, we'v e already seen 1 1.5 million people go back to work, inc luding 600, 000 people right here in Michi gan. We're o pening up A merica and Michigan is roaring ba ck, but you all deserve to know. Joe Bide n is talking about shutting down our economy again. It's true, i f you sa w the newspa pers, the last couple of da ys. Several Europe an countries, th ey're alread y talking about shutting down . So you can bet tha t Joe Biden lock down the American economy. If he mak es it to the W hite House, all the schools will be closed . All your churches, synagogues , places of worship businesses will all be shutte red again. I mean , right at t he moment that th e American economy is getti ng back on its feet, Jo e Biden said this s ummer, he would shut it down. Well, Joe Biden s ays, we're in for a long, dark winter, but under President Don ald Tru mp, we're go ing to defeat the v irus, and the best is yet to c ome. You know , the choice in this elect ion has never been cl ear. The stakes have never b een higher wh en you look at their agenda. H igher taxes, ope n borders , sociali zed me dicin e green New Deal de funding, the police, abortion on demand. It's clear Joe Biden would be nothing mawr than a Trojan hors e f or the radical left. I don't k now if you've se en it in the news, but Bernie Sanders an d Elizabeth Warren are alrea dy angli ng for Cabinet posts. You k now, Joe Biden said that democracy i s on the ballot tom orrow. Well, I th ink our eco nomic recovery i s on the ballot. I thi nk law and order ar e on the bal lot. But I also think t here are things farm or foundati onal to our country that ar e on the ballot as well. Me n and wo men of Michigan in t his election. I think it's not going to be so much whethe r America ends up more Republican o r more Democr at, more liberal or m ore conservat ive, more red or more blue . The choice in this election is whet her America remains Amer ica. Yeah, wheth er we're going to chart a fut ure with Pr esident Donald Trump, build on our American her itage of faith a nd fa mily and patrioti sm and freedom, or whether we' re gonna let Joe Biden and th e Democratic Party's s urrend er our country to t he radical left, shut down our economy , top ple our heritage and our val ues and our freedom i n an avalanche of socialism and decline. So let me sa y, from my h eart, the all of m y friends h ere in Michigan, fo r all th e ideals and v alues that have always made t his country unique, a n excepti on for our very freedo m bequeathed to u s by generations of Americans. We need to decide right here a nd right n ow that Jo e Biden will never be president of t he United States. W e're going to re elect Presi dent Donald Tru mp for f our more years. Yeah. L adies and gentlemen, I've go tten to know this presid ent of the last fou r years. Some people thi nk we're a little bit different, but actually, we've got to be very close frie nds. We spend time together eve ry day or we speak every day. And I can tell you President Donald Trump is a real d eal. He's a man who s ays wha t he means and me ans w hat he sa ys. He never qu its. He never backs down. And he has never stopped f ighting to keep the promises that he ma de to the Am erican people. Now it's ou r turn t o fight for him. It's our turn to fight for forem or years of Pre sident Donald Trump in the White House. Four more years me ans more jobs . Four more years means more judges. F our more years means, um, or support for our troops. And it's going to take it least four more yea rs to train that swamp. So before h e gets here, I got a couple th ings to ask you to dio number one before the polls closed Tomor row. We need you to v ote Michigan vot e to reelect Presi dent Don ald Trump for fou r more years. Yeah, time f or speeches is almost over. Time for voting is co ming up tomorrow morning. I'm told the poll s open 7 a.m. Open til l eight. PM he re in Mi chigan. And remember, friend s don't let friends v ote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a c oworker an d v ote to reelect P resident Donald Tru mp to the Wh ite House. I excuse me. And secon dly, after you vote with a friend, I need y ou to go find somebody toe talk to about this electi on. I mean, Michigan always pla ys an outsized role in presidenti al politics, and t hat will be especi ally true this yea r. The choice that M ichigan makes is literally gonna be a ch oice t hat sets our nation on o ne path or ano ther for generat ions to come. So yo u just need to te ll them about the st akes in th is election. Tell hi m about th e pr ogress we made the way this president's lead us th rough this challenging y ear, th e way we rebuild our mili tary revived our economy t he way America is coming back and tell them abou t the choi ce and tell the m why. You know t he president. I were on a n ews show, a wee k ago Sunday. 60 m inutes it was, Yeah , right, so But ther e was a g reat moment. So the presid ent got asked a question. I just h is answer. I'l l just never forg et . The reporter look s at him and sh e s ays, Thinking ab out a ll of you, she said , So how w ould you describe your s upporte rs? And without hesitation, the pres ident answered the que stion . She said, How would you desc ribe your s upporters ? And h e s aid, They are people who l ove our coun try. So go fi nd a neighbor . Tel l t hem you love A mer ica and te ll them w e need four more y ears of President Donald Trump in the White House. Yeah, then finally, I just encourage you and all that remains between now and when the polls close. Just have faith, have faith in America. When you speak to your neighbors and friends, you know, I think you study American history every time. The American people have given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom. They choose freedom every time, have faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to overcome any challenge, and finally have faith that he who planted this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores we'll see us through these challenging times to bring us through stronger and better than ever before verse that's been over the mantle of our home for 20 years, since we first step forward to serve in public life, their ancient words that Americans have long clung to and our little family does simply say, for I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you, not to harm you plans to give you Ah, hope and a future. Have faith and pray for America. And I just know if all of us do all we need to do between now and when the polls close at eight o'clock here in Michigan tomorrow, with your continued support and your prayers, we're gonna have a great victory all across Michigan and all across America. On with Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Malone are in that new Republican majority in the House with John James in a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate. With President Donald Trump back in the White House for four more years and with God's help, we're gonna make Michigan in America more prosperous than ever before. We're gonna make Michigan and America safer than ever before. We're gonna make Michigan in America more united than ever before. And with your support together we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Now let's go get it done. Michigan Su n coming up New York City The stoop mu st driver in a tr affic.

You k now, we have a ctually more oil to do with the larg est in th e world is not a nice feeling, Sleepy Jo e, and that wo uld not have happened. Exc ept for what we've done over the last 3.5 years . There's never been an a dministration or president. T here's neve r been an administration t hat has done in the 1st 3.5 years what we've done, neve r and not even twice wi th things we've done an d the fake news, never even questions that I've been saying it for a long time. Th ey don't even q uestion be cause they can. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening y our borders and sacrificing A merican blood and treas ure in endless, ridi cu lous foreign wars co untries you neve r even heard off . A vote for Bi den i s a vote to extinguish an d eradicate your state's auto industry. You don 't like that, do you? I don 't think so. Yo u know, he was gonna do the TPP. He was goi ng to do different things that wou ld have be en so b ad for you. I ended it . I ended it all. He was a che erleader for NAFTA, w hich was the worst trade d eal ever made, probably by any country that sent all you r auto jobs. You know, they ha ve 32% of our auto jobs, rig ht? And that 's probably the num ber one reason I r an for p resident. In fact, I was in Michiga n. I don't know if anybody remembers this. 12 y ears ago, they gave me the man of the y ear, you remember? And I had a bi g I made a speech and I sai d, Why are yo u letting you know s omething? My business. But I said, Why you letting them steal your auto jobs? They're all going down to Mexico. An d by the way, plenty go to Canada to r ight. People don 't know that, and it was a terrible thing that took place . But we've stopped that. And now the U . S. M. C. A makes it v ery, very fina ncially difficu lt for th em to do that. It was ver y im porta nt to me on Everybody said We'll neve r be able to do it will neve r be able Thio and NAFT A and you know why? Becaus e it was so go od for Can ada a nd so good for Mexico, a nd th ey have a lot of power, but we ended it a nd they're not that happy. But the y're happy enough an d we hav e a great deal on. Do we have peopl e? I 'll tell you, Mexico, we've had a great relationship with Mexico. Canada is a little difficult to d eal with, to be honest with you, you know, Oh, Canada wa y, all of o Canad a, right? I love th at they stand for their na tio nal anth em and we have to st and, too, beca use, you know, you know, you saw th e ratings on the N BA do wn 7 1% for their championsh ip. You know why? Because people don 't w ant to hear it. They don' t want to hear i t. They want to see a basketball game, obvious ly not t oo much. But I didn' t watch it and a lot of peo ple didn't watch it, and the NFL has to be very c arefu l. Th ey tr ied that game two years ag o and I thought we taught him a lesson, and they have to b e very careful. We have to respect o ur flag way, have to re spect our anthe m, and we have to respect our country, Righ t? Sl eepy Joe supported Ch ina's entry into the W. T O. M ichigan lost half of all auto manufactur ing jobs After those Biden betr ayals, he also support ed the trans Pacif ic p artnership, w hich would have b een the death se ntence for the U. S auto industry . I canceled TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster and I took the toughest action ev er taken against Chi na. We never took in 10 cents on China. I've taken in billions and billions of do llars over the last year . Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. They do n't want to write about it. They don't wan t to write about it. They're not allow ed to write about it. T heir bo sses, whoev er their boss es. Maybe they're not allow ed to write about it. Who sold ou t Michigan to Ch ina? He sold you out. That's one of the reasons w hen they send over a car, th ey charg e ju st 35% tax. We charge the m nothing, but that is, they c hanged. We chang ed that. We change i t and it's gonna ch ange a lot Maw r. If y ou give us anoth er four years, that I c ould tell wa y were just beginning. And not only with China, with everyone else t hat takes ad vantage of our country. Yeah . Yeah. Thank you very much. No, Bu t with ever ybody else that takes its not only child , it's everybody. We re n egotiated the South Korea deal. You know that. Tha t was a deal. C rooked Hillary made that de al was gonna give 2 50,000 j obs. She was t a lk ing. T hi s will produce 250, 000 jobs. They signe d it and she ende d up bein g correct. But the 250, 000 jobs all went to Sout h Korea. Not to us. Tha t wa s s tandard. That was stan dard. Biden is the living e mbodimen t of the decr epit and to pray po litical cras h that got ric h bleeding America dry on. You kno w what happ ened? Loo k, there haven't been too many states th at have be en affecte d. Like you've been affected . You got ser iously affected. That' s what wind ow we're doin g it we're doing it. But when I ran, you never told me it was gonna b e that deep. That vicious, t hat rough. I t's a deep sucker I thought would kn ock it out fast. w e went through 3 .5 years of hell. And here we are and they're not too hap py. A nd t hey' re They'r e ree ling. The y're reeli n g. They're goi ng to be kno cked off very soon. They're gonna be all knocked off. Well, we'v e done a good job, but i t was it wasn't easy. You get impeached over a tel ephone call. Tha t was perfect. Per fect. Per fect. All congratula tions on your vi ctory. Ukraine Presid ent. Ukraine. Ni ce man. Never met him before. Co ngr atulatio ns, sir. Could you call up and congratulate the pres ident of Ukra ine? Sure. Wh at happened? So h e just one Okay, g ood. S o I give you a ca ll. I avoided it for a long time because it was a lot. Yo u know, I'm bus y. Go up a nd they say, Let's im peach him, I'll tell you. And we had great suppo rt from the Rep ublican Party. I have to say that 197 to nothing and a 52 a h alf to one half . You know, the h alf Waa s. Tha t's all right. We had 52 a half to one half Mit t Romney. He sti ll doesn't know why. Let's see. What did I do that Hey Wished he didn't do it I'll tell you that. And 2016 Michigan voted to fire this co rrupt political e stablish ment and you elected an out sider is presid ent to f inally put A merica first on. If I don't so und like a typical W ashington po litician is because I'm not a politician pro bably wouldn't be on if I don't alw ays play by the rules of Was hington. And t he Washington establishment i s because I was elect ed to fight for you. And I fight har der and harder and harder on b etter than anyone's ev er fought f or way were br ought he re. We were put her e to fight for you. I ha d a very ea sy life befor e this. I ha ve Thio. Tha nk you. T hank yo u. Ye ah. Thank you. Tha nk you. I had a very easy life. I had a different kind of a life. And you know what? I would n't have change d that decision when I said First lady, Let's do it. You'r e gonna be first lady . She was act uall y one of the people. She sa id, Are you sure you want t o do this f irst lady? People love the fir st lady. They How ever, she's gorgeous, elegant, and she puts u p with a lot from these peop le. You know, it's like, unbelievable, But she said, Uh, but are yo u sure you wa nt to do this? I say, I think I do. Yeah, I think I do. She said, You know, you will win. If you do it, you must be sure. And I said, Yo u think so? I said, You thin k so? Really? She said, No, you will win. Definitely. B ut the quest ion Do you want to do it? I said, Yeah, we do. We have to set this nation b ack on the right co urse. Oh, she said that I'll never forget. That was s ort of cool. You kno w, you're just li ke second natu re, yo u know, you win, you know, we're running ag ainst a lot of ver y talented people, and then we had to run against a very talented, croo ked machine. Joe Biden i s bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerf ul special interests. You saw that over the last couple of wee ks, all the corruptio n, and they refused to even tal k a bout it. Could you imagi ne if I got 3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's way or one of my kids took 3.5 m illion f rom? C an you im agine that? And they refused t o even discuss it. They don't want to d iscuss it. There is n o proof. They now sa y the laptop from hell was produced by Ru ssia. Th is was shift wate rmelon head rig ht. The laptop her was p roduced by Russia, Way said. Oh, no, not again, No, John Ratcliffe came out immediately. He' s great. He's doing a gr eat job, he said. It was not produced by R ussia, but that's what they try and do. They do disinformation. They're the biggest di sinformation group. I'll tell you they own him. They control Bide n, and they know he wi ll always do whatever they want. They know tha t that's why they w ant him. I d efinitely don't do what they want. Definit ely E do one thin g. I get them good ratings. Can y ou imagine? If the y don't ha ve me? Let's say the head by their ratin gs will collapse . Ev ery one of them wil l be out of business. T hey'l l be out of business so fast, every c orrupt fo r it, as it won't be. It will be. They will be out of busine ss so fast. In fact, I think they're going to get tog ether. The New York Times will die. The failing New Y ork Times Washington Post, which is basica lly a lobbyist for Bezos. Yo u know th at. But they'll a ll get together an d t hey'll say, Listen, we m ade a b ig mistake here. We got a d raft Tru mp. We got to get hi m to run ag ain. This is no good were d ying. Nobody cares. Can you ima gine that? Having Bide n, we're go nna put something up. Can you imagine havi ng Biden is your president ? The biggest lo ser wi ll be the fake news media. They will. That will b e so boring. You know, th eir ratings are thro ugh the roof. Everythi ng is through the roof . The NFL is doing ver y badly. You k now why every one's watching politics ? Because they find po liti cs to be much r ougher than the o ther. It's much dirtier and more disgusting and and the y don't change. You know, the NFL, they change the rules. T hey make eve rything lik e coming back. You c an't touch anybody. Somebody t ackles too hard. They say 15 ya rd penalty a nd you're out of the ga me and you're ou t for the season. You know, in the old days, r ight? It was a little differe nt, but it's still t ough, but this is much tou gher and people see it, but you have to see the ratings. That's that's why the ratings are bad for a lot of the sports. Nobody ever thought of this, but I thought of it. A couple of people wrote it. The ratings, they're bad because so many people are watching this. It's tougher, that's true. But they're gonna be calling for us. Please, Please run again. We think we're going to endorse. I got endorsed by the Pittsburgh right. Pittsburgh Post is that I gotta endorse first time since 1972 that they endorsed a big, big newspaper. Very good, very liberal newspaper, but that's OK, but first time since 1972 that they endorsed a Republican. So it's an honor. And if you don't read the first two or three paragraphs, that was one of the best endorsement. Yes, we don't like him. Yes, he has a horrible personality. But listen to this. It's not that I do, but I have been under siege illegally for 3.5 years. I've been fighting for 3.5 years, and I said to somebody today, I wonder what it would be like if the fake Russia hoax and all this with the impeachment over nothing over a phone call that was perfect. That was perfect. I wonder what it would be like if we didn't have all of this horrible stuff. And and if it didn't, you know, we have a very calm, a calm situation, and maybe I'd be less popular. I don't know. Maybe I'd be less popular because you know what the fact is, People see that we fight. We're fighting for you, but it's just a really it's a really dirty, horrible business. But I said today because they were very. They were saying he's they don't like the personality and he's always fighting. I'm fighting to survive. You have to survive. Very few people would have said that they would have been in the corner. They would have said, Mommy, Mommy, put their finger in the mouth, put their thumb in the mouth and say, Mommy, Mommy, take me home. I'm outta here and get me the hell out of your mom. Let's say forget about out of here right now. No w we can't do that, b ut you have to fight h ard and then you fight hard and you hit them back. An d then they say th is chaos in the White House. They cause d the chaos. We have a great group of people. We hav e a lot of them here tonig ht. Great people in the Wh ite House. But it's true. I wonder what I wonder if it would have been different. You know, if they did n't. Beca use these world, we caught t hem spying on our campaig n. We caught them trying to t ake out a duly ele cted president of the United States. That's tre ason. That's t reason. We caught them. And so meday, maybe som ething's gonn a be done ab out it to, you know, maybe i t. Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. E can't We don't wa nna do anything prior to the elec tion. Well, what about May? Th ey did it. They did it to me bef ore they spied on my campaign b efo re the election. We shouldn't do any thing prior to the election. And you know who w e caught Ba rack Hussein Obam a and sleepy Joe Biden. They were a part of it. We ou ght to get these reports and t hey should get him out before the electi on. As far as I'm concern ed. Should get him o ut right bef ore the election. Should ha ve gotten him out a long time ago. We have We have infor mation. You wou ldn't even believe it. I do n't even get involved . I always said I'm going to stay uninvo lved very hard for me, todo I'll tell you . No, it is because y ou know I didn't I didn't have to do th at. I thou ght would be the right th ing. And yet they did. The Muel ler repo rt The p hony Muell er report. 18 angry Democrats. Smart , 18. Angr y, vicious. M any o f them worked f or Hillary Clinton. 18 angry Democrats. They spe nt 48 million on at the end of 2. 5 years. No collusi on, Okay? A fr iend of mine said, You ha ve to be the most innoce nts man of the wor ld. And t hey checked everythin g. They checked tax es. They check for 48 million. You check t axes, right? And by t he way, we announced, you know, I prepaid mi llions and millions of dollars in t axes. They didn't sa y that. They refused to s ay. They say, We ll, pre paying isn't paying. I said, No, it's prepaid. Tha t's even worse . Millions of doll ars, many millions of do llars, and that will all c ome out eve ry correct. And you know, whe n you look at it, wh en you look at what's going on , seriously , think of that just think a bout that tonight whe n you're with your f amily, I wo nder if it would hav e been diffic ult. You know, different. I wonder if it would have be en a different kin d of a field. And you know what? Honestly, maybe it wouldn't have been good. Maybe we wo uldn't have these ma ssive pass. Because you s ee what s omebody is where we' re under siege and you peopl e get it. You're sma rter than the m. Yo u're smarter than these p eople. You get it and you've always on and you've always got that. It's a beaut iful thing and I'll never forget it. I want to tell you I'm never gonn a forge t it. B ut we were unde r siege and we caught him. And it' s treason or what ever you wanna ca ll it. But we're s leepy. Joe Biden. The y don't want to write anyt hing . We caught the whole thing. T he sun. Wher e's Hunter? Where's Hunter ? The sun was like a human v acuum cl eaner. He'd go in and foll ow his father. Let's go to China today. Son g. They fly in on Air Force Two, ri ght? I guaran tee you one thing. Mike Penc e. I know his kids do tha t. They don't do that. They're unbelievable kids, military. But, you know, let's go to China today. Dad, I'd lik e to follow yo u. It's like a walks o ut with $1.5 billion fees on. Oh, he must be a great investor. You k now, the greatest inve stors don't ma ke that deal with China . China doesn't do t hat. Th ey don't give money out for other peopl e that are less smart than the m to invest. Let's giv e our money to someb ody that's not very sma rt to invest. O kay, that's a great idea. H e walked out. It onl y took him 10 min utes to get it t o $1.5 billion. That's mil li ons of dollars in tree s. The big one was t he 10 million you saw tha t one. The letter . He wan ts 10 year for int roducto ry purposes. Okay, 1 0 minut es. But it all blew up. By th at time, the laptop from hell w as found. The one that shift s said was developin g Russia. It's unbelievable . And then you have Ukraine . He goes into Ukraine. His father was in charge of Ukr aine, right? H e was a judge of Russia, U kraine, China. Specifically he goes into Ukra ine $183,000 a month. Do you have energy experience? I t's an energy right very small. Do you have energy expe rience? No, I don't. I do n't know anyt hing ab out energy. We'll we'll pa y you 183,000 month and we'll giv e you an up front fee of a pproxi mately three million. W ould that be s atisfactory? Now th ink of it now. Think o f it and that' s and there are o ther thin gs to other kind. Then he's got the brother and he's got a whole. This is a corrupt enter prise. And then they had. The big man get s 10%. The big man w ho's the big. He's not a big man to me. To me, it' s a very meek, fragile. He 's a fragile person and he's v ery agita ted. I watc hed him. Tod ay. He gets more. H e gets more time on Fox. I've n ever seen anybody on Fox so much him. They have everybody on Fox. They have all enemi es on Fox. I t hink it 's crazy, but he gets a lot of time on Fox, but he's he' s so agitated , and now he com es out with t he aviator gl But they're a little too small. They should b e. He wants to loo k like Tom Cruise from a lon g time ago. No , but he's frag ile he's not gonna be there. That's not what they're counti ng on. They're countin g on somebody else. They're counting on, by far the mos t liberal person and th e Senate. Kamala. T hey like her. They l ike every corrup t force in Ame rican life that betrayed y ou and hurt you is supporti ng Joe Bi den, the failed establishmen t that start ed the disastrous fo re ign wars.

For many , m any years they hav en't been able to do it and we're gonna We're re ally I'd like to finish t hat up to need a little more time. You kn ow, we need a littl e bit more time, but way have countri es way. Have count ries lined up No m oney and no blood in the sand. No bl ood in the said. Remember what I said four years a go? I am y our voice and I will m ake America gre at again, a nd that's what we're doing w ay together. W e will d efeat the corrupt establ ishment. We will dethrone the failed political class. W e wi ll drain the Washingto n Swamp and we wil l save the American dream fo r your Children, for your grandchildren. Thistle E lection is also a choice betw een a deadly Biden locked down or a safe vaccine . The vacci ne is coming along great couple o f weeks. A couple of weeks, it's gonna b e out soon. Tha t ends the pandemic and i t will end anyway. The y hate it when I say we' re rounding the corner, it 's gonna end anyway. But the v accine will make it go a lot quicker. And w hat we 've done with T her apeutics is incred ible. Excuse me. Here I am. But I like to say no. I li ke to say it had no impa ct of me. I didn't really need it. They just happen to give it to me because I'm a perfect p hysical specimen that's v ery young . I'm very young a nd in perfect physical shape now, bu t it's a mazing. What we've been able to do i s incredible. Really incredible. We will mass di stribute the vac cine in just a few week s, and it will quick ly eradicate this viru s. We're going t o start off very much with, yo u know, we've learned about it with our senior citizen, especially if they have a conditi on of heart condi tion. They have some proble m, any kind of a probl em. Boy, Iet's vicious. That's the ones that rea lly goes after. But we're g onna protect our great senior citizen s first. And then it will go very qui ckly throughout for anybody that wants i t won't be enforce d. So I'm gonna be in for for people t hat want it o n, we'll get it done, and it'll it'll all t ake place very quic kly. And by the wa y, nobody else would have b een able to do what we did. You kn ow, nobody else would have b een able to do what we did. You know Jo e Biden. He hand led the swine. Flu is one of t he great catastrophes . He was a mess, his ow n, his own chief of staff said. We had no idea what t he hell we were doing. I don't know why this guy admitte d that. Still, I can't figure out why. He ad mitted I pro bably before Joe thought he could ever r un. You know, Joe t hought his career w as over because he wasn't thinking str aight. Then he ran. Then h e ran a nd Elizabeth Warren said, I want to stay until the end and take out Bernie. You know, she took out Bernie and we're running a gainst Joe instead of Ber nie, and Bernie's gonna run again in anot her four years. H e's going to run again. One thing a bout that g uy, he never gives up, does he? Bu t he's a hell of a loser. I mean, he loses the first time and h e goes back . He's like no hard feelings. He l oses the second time horribl y. The way they took. Th e De mocrats took advan tage of Bernie Sanders and everybody that h e represents, and bu t they they' re looki ng to t ake over Joe. They signed they, You know. They agreed to the manifest o. I call it y ou have to see what's i n that one. Joe Bide n is promi sing to delay the vacc ine and turn Ameri ca into a pris on sta te. Tha t's what he wants l ocking you in y our home while letti ng the fa r left rioters they coul d. So the writers o f the looters, the anarch ist Antifa, they c ould g o knock th e hell out of your Rome your streets. Set your stores on fire. No problem. That 's called protesters . We must p rotect our protester s. But you' re not allowed to go to church. Yo u're not allowed to ha ve dinner, r ight? The only one allowed to have dinner in th is state is the husba nd of your go vernor. He's the only o ne that's got sp ecial priv ileges. T hat was not a go od day when he got caugh t voti ng or whatever the hell are we do ing. Who are you ? I'm the husban d of the governo r. The police didn't go for t hat one too well tod ay. Now, that wasn 't a gr eat day. Now you gotta open u p yo ur state gover nor. Open it up, Gove rnor. Let t he kids go back to school. Le t the kids go back t o school. It's like B aro n Baron Trump, right? They said, yo u know, First L ady had it. I had it. They sai d, Sir, you tested po sitive. F irst lady didn't come to see us. A li ttle word s they said, sir. Uh, Bar on, he just White House doctor. Great. Dr Sean. Sir Barry just tes ted pos itive. I said. Tested positi ve. For what? For Coron a, it sounds like. See, I like t he child A vir us or I lik e the p lague from China, but a lot of pe ople use it like it sounds like an i sland and Italy. I sai d, It's that Corona, but just d positive for Cor ona. I said, Well, I don't lik e that. That's not good, Baron. He 's, you know, he's strong. He's very tall. He's only 14 years old. He's very tall. I could tell by Baron and he 's a good boy, but he just t ested positiv e. And I said, Wow, Then about 12 min utes later, I see th e doctor, doctor h usband don't know. It's OK. He's fun now. He took him about 12 sec onds to get rid of it b ecause they're young and they have a strong immune system. No, he was I mean, he got better like kid s so fast. And, you know, wh at I say. Let the kids go to school on. You'r e not going to hear that from the other side. Th ey wanna lock it up. The B iden lock down wi ll m ean no school, n o graduations, no we ddings. Know Than ksgiving's no Easter. No Christmas, no Fourth of J uly. No future for the youth. Other th an that, it's gonna b e a great life. You g otta let the kids go to school. Get going. Open up your sta te. It's time on. Y ou know, we got to take care of our seniors. We have to take care of people. We und erstand i t. We have to do things, but let the k ids go back. This is a l ock down. This i s a shutdown, Of course. Proba bly on a date li ke November 4th will ann ounce. Well , we're g oing to deci de to open up, right ? D id you see the one head of th e union said? Yea h. We want the teachers to go back to work on Novembe r 4th. That was not a good mov e. She announc ed. We want the teachers to go back in November 4th. Ye ah. I wonder why that day. Despite t hat we have the best numbers. Look, we have sta tes that are lo cked down clos ed down. New York is having a hard time. I 'll tell you, they a re. They don't know what the hell they're doing a great plac e. I left it 3.5 yea rs ago. I l oved it. And it's very sad What's h appening to New York? Very, ver y sad thing in Chicago. Look at Chica go. Get seri ous. That all run by Dem ocrats, By the way, I wanna just emphasize How about Portland with the anarch ists, right? With Anti fa and their antif a anarchists. But how about Portlan d? We could solve that pro blem in 25 mi nutes, like we did. Yo u know, we w ent into S eattle, we wer e ready to g o in. We're all set to go in. And we told him we're going in tomorro w morning and the night befor e they said Ok ay, well, we'r e leaving now. That cou ld have bee n done a long time ago if they asked us . We have to be a sked, but and we d id a g reat job in M innesota. We're gonn a win Minnesota for two reasons. We're gonna win Minnesota fir st time since 197 2. We're go nna win Minn esota. You kno w why Number one is I lhan Omar? The fact tha t she is th e no, but She loves our country very much, right? She has a gre at deep and abiding love f or our country. On t he other one point, the hatr ed is just crazy. How do we put up wi th this stuf f, right? I mean, the hatred. But she's number one reason. And maybe number two is the fact that the National Guard did one hell of a job in Minneapolis. Now they should have called us. They should have called the week and a half earlier. It would have been nice. You wouldn't have had the fires raging behind Thea Acres. That said, this is a friendly protester behind the anchor. The whole looked like the world was burning down. This is a friendly protests because they don't report the truth. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs and misery. You gotta just get out of this. We have to weigh, can't play games. Our country has such incredible potential. We can't let this happen. This country will never be a socialist nation. Okay? And that's what they wanna dio. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live the great great life that you've always wanna have. Then go cast your ballot tomorrow for your all time favorite president. I hope, but on Remember that Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, a respected guy, he worked with Biden. He said Biden has been wrong or nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. Other than that, he spoke very well of him. But you don't have to believe me. You don't have to even listen to me because it happens to be Michigan. We spend a hell of a lot of money on that right there. So roll th e tape. Nob ody .

WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THANK YOU, KELLY. SO I KNOW YOU'RE OUT HERE TODAY SAME REASON I AM BECAUSE OF THE TWO EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE. BUT WE'RE ALSO HERE BECAUSE OF ALL WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER WITH THEIR SUPPORT AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAVE BEEN HALLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS AND A ECONOMY THAT WAS STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE AROUND WORLD AND WE WITNESSED A STEADY ASSAULT ON MOST CHERISHED VALUE. BUT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WITH THESE STRONG ALLIES IN THE SENATE, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING, SO YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT ACTUALLY WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OF A MILITARY FAMILY AT THE PENCE HOUSEHOLD. I'M THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE. [APPLAUSE] AND ONE OF MY UNWORTHY SON-IN-LAWS IS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY. AND WE'RE PROUD OF THEM BOTH. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO SIGNED LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE OF DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE, AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER, WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIER SAILOR AIRMEN COAST GUARD AND SPACE FORCE THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT JUST BEEN ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM IT'S BEEN ABOUT THOSE OF YOU WHO DID SERVE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR OUR FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] LOVE YOU TOO. YOU KNOW UNDER LAST ADMINISTRATION I DON'T HAVE TOLE IT OUR VETERANS WE SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A. THAT SHOCKED CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION. PRESIDENT TRUMP, STRONG ALLIES LIKE YOUR TWO SENATORS, HE SIGNED MOST SWEEPING REFORMS OF THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS FIRED EMPLOYEES THAT WERE NOT GIVING OUR VETERANS THE CARE THEY EARNED NOW VETERAN'S CHOICE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE HAVE THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE ONLY ON SENATE ARM SERVICE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER ON THE VETERAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH THOSE WHO SERVED. [APPLAUSE] WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES AND STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AS NEVER BEFORE. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK DOWN LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND CAPTURE AND KILLED THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. [APPLAUSE] WE STOOD UP TO IRAN GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL , AND IN IRANIAN GENERAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN SERVICEMEN SOLEIMANI IS GONE. SO WE'VE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE'VE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES. AND IT WAS THIS PRESIDENT WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF YOUR SENATOR WHO WEPT THE WORD THAT FOUR OF HIS PREDECESSORS HAVE MADE TO AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR MOST CHERISH ALLY. WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] CLOSER TO HOME OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, STRONG ALLIES LIKE YOUR SENATORS, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WE ROLLED BACK MORE REGULATION THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE FOUGHT FOR PREAND FAIR TRADE WE UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY, AND OUR FIRST THREE YEARS WE SAW 7 MILLION JOBS CREATED AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT A 50-YEAR LOW. [APPLAUSE] AND THROUGH THIS YEAR, THIS CHALLENGING YEAR, THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED, WITH THAT STRONG FOUNDATION , AND WITH THE RELIEF EFFORTS THAT SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER SUPPORTED, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN 13 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK IS UNDERWAY. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, WE'VE HAD THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THESE SENATORS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WHEN IT CAMING TO OUR SECURITY, WHEN IT CAME TO OUR PROSPERITY, BUT ALSO THAT IS TRUE WHEN IT CAME TO THE RULE OF LAW. AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR SENATOR, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND I HAVE STOOD STRONG WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP DAVID PERDUE, AND KELLY LOEFFLER WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE OF GREATEST CONSEQUENCE OF ALL, LONGEST TERM IMPACT ON THE LIFE OF THE NATION. THAT WITH THE UNWAIVERRING SUPPORT OF GEORGIA TWO SENATORS, WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES APPOINTED TO OUR COURSE AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD GOD GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BARE ARMS. IT'S AN AMAZING GROUP OF JUDGES PRINCIPLED MEN AND WOMEN AND THAT INCLUDES JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICEBRED KAVANAUGH AND JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER, IN FACT, LET ME JUST SAY, I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY THANK SENATOR LOEFFLER SHE WAS THE FIRST SENATOR IN THE UNITED STATES TO CALL FOR THE CONFIRMATION VOTE OF JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT AND THEY BOTH STOOD STRONG WITH THIS AMAZING JURIST. YOU KNOW THESE APPOINTMENTS TO OUR COURTS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE COURTS ARE OUR LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. THE LAST VANGUARD OF OUR LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT. WHEN WE CAME INTO OFFICE YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT WE'VE SEEN A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR LIBERTIES AND OUR CHERISH VALUES. THE CONSCIENCE WRITES OF DOCTORS AND NURSES HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED, THROUGH BUREAUCRATIC FIAT IN LAST ADMINISTRATION. A GROUP OF NUNS KNOWN AS LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR HAULED INTO FEDERAL COURT BY THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. FORCED THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. AND YOU ALL REMEMBER WHEN JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT WENT THROUGH A CONFIRMATION TWO YEARS AGO, AND THE LEADING DEMOCRAT ON THE ?ATS JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT JUDGE BARRETT'S CATHOLIC FAITH. SHE SAID AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND THEIR ALLIES IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE BARRETT'S FAITH EVER SINCE WELL I'VE GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. AND TWO DEMOCRATS THAT WANT TO JOIN THEM , THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY FOR OUR LIBERTIES, FOR OUR FUTURE, FOR ALL OF THE FOUNDATION OF VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT, WE NEED SENATOR DADE PERDUE AN SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW LET ME ALSO SAY WE ARE JUST TALKING ON THE BUS A MINUTE AGO. BEYOND ALL OF THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, GROWING ECONOMY IS STRONG DEFENSE STANDING UP FOR OUR LIBERTIES. I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO BE STANDING WITH TWO SENATORS AND SERVING ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] SO FAR SECURITY FOR OUR PROSPERITY, FOR OUR LIBERTIES AND FOR LIFE. WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE NEED GEORGIA TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY ON JANUARY 5TH, 2021. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, THE STAKES IN ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. AND HERE IN GEORGIA, I GOT TO TELL YOU , THE CHOICE IS NEVER BEEN CLEARER. FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE RAFAEL AND JOHN ASA , WILL JOIN DEMOCRATS IN CUTTING OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. YOU KNOW DEMOCRATS COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT DEEP CUTS IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. TO FUND THEIR LIBERAL AGENDA AND RAFAEL IS ACTUALLY DEMEANED OUR MILITARY. AND REPEATEDLY DEFENDED ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT AND CRITICIZED OUR MOST CHERISH ALLY ISRAEL AND WHAT DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER CUT TAXES AND RAFAEL AND WANT TO RAISE ON LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK THE BLUE , AND WILL SUPPORT CONSERVATIVE JUDGES AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE JOHN AND RAFAEL SUPPORT DEFUNDING THE POLICE ACTIVIST JUDGES AND TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. [BOOING] NOW I HEARD THAT , SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER SAID , FIRST WE TAKE GEORGIA. THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. WELL I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER. AND ALL OF THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU WITH ME? I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA GET IT OUR AGENDA IS AMERICA GREAT. THEIR AGENDA IS AMERICAN DECLINE. WHERE WE'RE OPENING UP, I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL BE LOCKING DOWN AGAIN. REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A VACCINE BY THE END OF THE YEAR? I GOT TO TELL YOU FOLKS BUCKLE UP , BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING DISTRIBUTE ABOUT 40 MILLION VACCINES ALL ACROSS AMERICA. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WE'RE MAKING MIRACLES HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] YOU ALL GET IT WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE YOUR NEIGHBORS GET IT. EVERY DAY BETWEEN NEW AND JANUARY 5TH. THEIR AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZE MEDICINE A GREEN NEW DEAL, ABORTION ON DEMAND DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND PACKING THE COURT.

CSPANMP20112020171	Mike Pence	2020-11-20	Vice President Pence Remarks at Defend the Majority Rally	WHAT WE FOCUSED ON IN THIS FILM IS A STORY NOBODY HAS HEARD ABOUT WHICH HAS BEEN LOST AND UNDOCUMENTED WHICH IS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FALL IN 1979. THINGS SPIRAL TO EPIC PROPORTIONS AND MY FATHER AMONG MANY OTHER REFUGEES AND THEMSELVES IN A HUGE HORRIFYING DYSTOPIA. IT REALLY IS A STORY THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AN INTERVIEW , AND EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR. SUNDAY NIGHT AT 8:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN'S Q&A. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS IN GEORGIA CAMPAIGNING FOR SENATORS DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER, NEITHER ONE , WON 50% IN THE ELECTION, SO BY STATE LAW THEY FACE RUNOFF ELECTIONS, ONLY ONE OF THE NEEDS TO WIN FOR REPUBLICANS TO MAINTAIN THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. HELLO, GEORGIA, HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING? IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE AND GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL HERE, YOU KNOW THE STATE SONG GEORGIA ON MY MIND, GEORGIA IS ON EVERYBODY'S MIND BECAUSE GEORGIA IS GOING TO KEEP THE SENATE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE GOT A BIG JOB AHEAD, WE ARE GOING TO REELECT SENATOR PURDUE AND SENATE , SENATOR LOEFFLER SO THAT SCHUMER AND PELOSI AND BIDEN CAN'T HAVE A BLANK CHECK ON AMERICA'S VALUES. YOU ARE THE ONES. AMERICA IS COUNTING ON YOU AND WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. IT IS A GREAT DAY, A BEAUTIFUL NORTH GEORGIA DAY AND I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE. IN SOME OF THE DARKEST DAYS OF WORLD WAR II, A BUSINESS LEADER SAID WE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE IT UP, WILL YOU GIVE IT UP? WE ARE NEVER GIVING UP. AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE, WE ARE NEVER GIVING UP ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WE ARE DEFTLY NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON DAVID PURDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER. SO FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE? VOTES. YOU KNOW, DON'T LET THEM TAKE IT THIS TIME, LET'S GO AND SAVE AMERICA BY SAVING GEORGIA AND REELECTING OUR TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS. FOLKS, WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO GO VOTE EARLY, ABSENTEE.

YOU FOR COMING TODAY, BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE, IT IS GOING TO BE DUTIFUL DAY ON JANUARY 5 WHEN RATE REELECT SENATOR DAVID PURDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER IS IT NOT? SO HELP ME WELCOME THE SENATORS TO THE STAGE. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN MY COUSIN INTRODUCES ME, I NEVER KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY. NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS, BUT WE ARE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR AMERICA, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? [APPLAUSE] I JUST TOLD THE VICE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THIS FIGHT BY GEORGIA, LET'S HAVE IT IN GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. WE ALL KNOW WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER HAS SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE GEORGIA AND CHANGE AMERICA, WELL WE ARE GOING TO WIN GEORGIA AND SAVE AMERICA. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT, WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT FOR THE LAST X MONTHS, THEY WANT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS, WHAT , THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY WANT TO DEFUND SOON WE SHOULD BE DEFENDING THE POLICE. BUT MOST OF ALL, WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS GO TO A ONE PARTY SYSTEM. LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF AOC, SHE SAYS WE HAVE TO WIN THOSE SEATS IN GEORGIA BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO NEGOTIATE, WE WANT THE GREEN NEW DEAL WITHOUT COMPROMISE. THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM HAVE IT, THEY ARE SENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOWN HERE TO GEORGIA TO TRY AND CHANGE OUR MINDS, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THEM THE TRUTH, 52.5% OF GEORGIANS REJECTED THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, YOU HEARD SONNY DO THIS, WE HAVE TO GET OUR VOTE OUT, EARLY, DO NOT WAIT FOR JANUARY THE FIFTH. THERE IS SOMETHING IN NORTH GEORGIA CALLED ICE STORMS, RIGHT? I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT, WE NEED TO GET OUT, EARLY VOTING STARTS DECEMBER 14. WE NEED YOU TO VOTE, TAKE YOUR FRIENDS, KELLY ARE , KELLY AND I ARE ASKING YOU TO STAND WITH US AND MAKE SURE WE SEND THIS TO AMERICA, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROAD TO SOCIALISM NEVER RUNS THROUGH THE STATE OF GEORGIA. [APPLAUSE] SO WITH YOUR HELP, BY GETTING OUR VOTE OUT AGAIN , AND I SAY AGAIN, BY GETTING THE VOTE OUT AGAIN WE WILL TELL AMERICA IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE WORLD THAT THE WORK WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN FOR NOT , NAUGHT, WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE WORK OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] IT IS MY HONOR TO BE RUNNING FOR THE SEAT ALONG WITH KELLY LEFFLER. THEY HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF STEPPING UP AFTER THEIR RACE AND GETTING BEHIND KELLY LOEFFLER AND ME AND I WANT TO CALL DOUG OUT AND THANK HIM FOR THAT PERSONALLY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SO INVOLVED IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT, WE ARE THIS CLOSE, ALL WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS FINISH IT. WE BURNED THE SHIPS, WE CANNOT GO BACK, WE HAVE GOT TO GO FORWARD TO JANUARY 5 AND MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATS LEAVE WITH THEIR TAILS WAGGING BEHIND THEM AND NEVER COME BACK. KELLY LEFFLER IS A FARM GIRL, SHE GREW UP, SHE KNOWS WHAT WORK IS ALL ABOUT. SHE IS AN OUTSIDER LIKE I AM, SHE HAS WORKED HARD TO GET HERE, PLEASE WELCOME THE NEXT SENATOR FROM GEORGIA, KELLY LEFFLER. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH, OH MY GOSH, GAINESVILLE ARE WE READY TO SHOW AMERICA THAT GEORGIA IS A RED STATE? [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE BECAUSE LOOK, WE HAVE GOT A BATTLE ON OUR HANDS. WE ARE THE FIREWALLS TO SOCIALISM IN AMERICA AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE LINE RIGHT HERE IN GEORGIA. LOOK AT WHAT IS AT STAKE, CHUCK SCHUMER SAID TAKE GEORGIA, CHANGE AMERICA, THAT CANNOT HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT HIGHER TAXES, NO. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, OPEN BORDERS, THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURT WITH LIBERAL JUDGES WHO WILL TAKE AWAY OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, WE HAVE GOT TO HOLD THE LINE. THAT IS WHY THIS BATTLE IS STILL IN OUR HANDS AND IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH YEAR, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A BATTLE BUT WE ARE NOT DONE FIGHTING AND I HAVE TO THANK CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS FOR HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE AS CONSERVATIVES, WE ARE UNITING ACROSS THE STATE TO GET THE JOB DONE TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT GEORGIA IS A RED STATE, THAT IS RIGHT. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT IS AT STAKE, IT IS NOT JUST RADICAL IDEAS, IT IS RADICAL CANDIDATES LIKE RAPHAEL WARNOCK. NO THANKS. THAT IS RIGHT, RAFAEL WARNOCK HAS CALLED OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT GANGSTERS, THUGS, BULLIES, AND A THREAT TO OUR CHILDREN. WHEN I ASKED HIM , THAT'S RIGHT. WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT IN THE U.S. SENATE, WE CERTAINLY WON'T HAVE IT IN GEORGIA. WHEN I ASKED HIM TO APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE COMMENTS, HE REFUSED. HE ALSO SAID YOU CANNOT SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND SERVE GOD. HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE COMMENTS, THAT IS AN INSULT ON THE DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF VETERANS, I SERVED ON THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. GEORGIA IS A GREAT MILITARY STATE , LET'S HEAR IT. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW HE CELEBRATED JEREMIAH WRIGHT WHO WANTED TO CONDEMN AMERICA, HE CALLED IT , HIM A PROPHET. WE TAKE NOTE IN THE SENATE TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION, HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO DO THAT. WE ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE, WE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR RESULTS, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LACK OF RESULTS. WE HAVE TRIED TO PASS PANDEMIC RELIEF IN THE SENATE TIME AFTER TIME THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID NO, THEY HAVE SAID NO TO SMALL BUSINESSES, TO FARMERS, TO OUR TEACHERS TRYING TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE SAID NO FOR POLITICAL POWER, THAT IS WHAT ONE PARTY RULE LOOKS LIKE, IT IS WRONG FOR AMERICA, IT IS DEFTLY WRONG FOR GEORGIA. WE HAVE ALSO SAID WE NEED SCHOOL CHOICE, BUT DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT SCHOOL CHOICE, THEY DO NOT WANT RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, THEY DON'T WANT HOMESCHOOLING, THEY DON'T WANT CHARTER SCHOOLS. THEY WANT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ONLY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS GET THE BEST EDUCATION AND THAT IT IS STUDENT CENTERED. AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR CONSERVATIVE VALUES BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND , THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS OUR JOB TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT, KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS PRESIDENT, KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY LOVE AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO, I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR YOUR CONSERVATIVE VALUES, WE ARE GOING TO STOP TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTION , THAT'S RIGHT. WE WILL BE YOUR CONSERVATIVE VOICE IN THE SENATE FOR YEARS TO COME IF YOU WILL BE OUR VOICE ON JANUARY 5. THANK YOU. WE NEED YOU RIGHT NOW TO CALL YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS, EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. GEORGIA IS ON THE FRONT LINES FOR AMERICA, STOPPING SOCIALISM AND SAVING OUR COUNTRY. IT IS IN OUR HANDS, WE CAN MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND VOTE EARLY, MOTIVATE OUR NEIGHBORS, PUT UP YARD SIGNS. GEORGIA HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GO IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS DONE SO , COULD NOT BE MORE HONORED TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, SOMEONE WHO IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT. (music) HELLO GEORGIA. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE PEACH STATE. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT, THIS LOOKS LIKE COME JANUARY 5 HERE IN GEORGIA WE ARE GOING TO HAVE US A RODEO. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK , WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING FORMER GOVERNOR SENATE , PURDUE, ONE OF THE GREATEST I HAVE EVER KNOWN. AND COMMISSIONER MCDONALD, GOP CHAIRMAN DAVID SCHAEFER, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE IN THE HOME DISTRICT OF ONE OF THE GREATEST ALLIES THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD ON CAPITOL HILL, HE IS A COURAGEOUS AND FEARLESS MAN, A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE AND A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND FAITH, JOIN ME IN THANKING CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS FOR ALL HE HAS DONE FOR GEORGIA AND AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS TODAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. I TOLD HIM I WAS HEADED TO GEORGIA TODAY AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THOUGHT HE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. LET ME BRING GREETINGS FROM A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA EVERY SINGLE DAY, I BRING GREETINGS IN THE , FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] LIKE ALL OF YOU I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. BUT I'M ALSO HERE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I STAND WITH SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. I REALLY APPRECIATE Y'ALL COMING OUT, I TRULY DO. THE PRESIDENT AND I CANNOT BE MORE GRATEFUL OF THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS GEORGIA OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. AND OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK SO FAR IN THIS ELECTION PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RECEIVED MORE THAN 73 MILLION VOTES, MORE THAN ANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, MORE THAN ANY INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IN HISTORY AND THE GREATEST SHARE OF MINORITY VOTES OF ANY REPUBLICAN IN 60 YEARS. I WILL TELL YOU, AS OUR ELECTION CONTEST CONTINUES HERE IN GEORGIA AND IN COURTS ACROSS AMERICA, I PROMISE YOU WE ARE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY LEGAL VOTE IS COUNTED. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY ILLEGAL VOTE IS THROWN OUT. GOOD WITH OVER THE FUTURE HOLDS, , AND WHATEVER THE FUTURE HOLDS, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT IS WHY IN ADDITION TO ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IS WHY GEORGIA AND AMERICA NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE NEED THE PEACH STATE TO DEFEND THE SUMMIT AND THE ROAD TO REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH GEORGIA. ARE YOU WITH ME? [APPLAUSE] WE NEED GEORGIA TO SEND THESE SENATORS BACK TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE , BECAUSE OF ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, AND BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY COULD BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE IN PRESERVING ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE TO DEFEND THIS NATION, REVIVE OUR ECONOMY, AND PRESERVE THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES THAT WE ALL HOLD DEAR. I AM HERE FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. LIKE A SON OF MACON WHO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLED IN GEORGIA TECH, PAID HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE BY WORKING WAREHOUSE AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS, HE EVENTUALLY WOULD PUT TOGETHER AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN BUSINESS, REACH THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS WORLD. A FORTY-YEAR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS CAREER, BUT HE IS A MAN OF FAITH, HE FELT A CALLING TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND HE STEPPED FORWARD SIX YEARS AGO AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST ALLIES OF OUR AGENDA AND A PRESENT , OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR DAVID PERDUE? 2 , [APPLAUSE] INCREDIBLE MAN, A CHAMPION FOR GEORGE AND GEORGE'S VALUES. JUST LIKE ANOTHER LEADER, FOURTH JANUARY , GENERATION ON HER FAMILY'S FARM. SHE BUILT HER OWN COMPANY FROM THE GROUND APPEAR IN GEORGIA, SHE MADE HISTORY BREAKING THEIR YEARS BUSINESS AND IN SPORTS FOR WOMEN TO BECOME ONE OF GEORGE'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN EVER. AND SHE, TOO WAS WILLING TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE THIS STATE AND I CAN TELL YOU EVERY DAY SHE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, SHE HAS BEEN AN UNAPOLOGETIC CHAMPION OF OUR AGENDA AND THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES THAT MAKE GEORGIA STRAIGHT, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] SO IT IS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE, BUT ALSO ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALLIES LIKE THESE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE, FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT, AND ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND WE WITNESS TO STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THESE ALLIES, AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE USA. [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING STARTS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE DEFENSE FAMILY , THE PENCE FAMILY IS A BIT OF A MILITARY FAMILY. I AM PROUD TO SAY MY SON IS A CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. AND ONE OF MY TWO UNWORTHY SON IN LAWS AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN SERVING OUR NATION. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH A STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN, WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. AND LET ME SAY AS WE RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, FROM THE SEAT ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, SENATOR DAVID PERDUE HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE, BUT ALSO ABOUT ALL OF YOU WHO DID SERVE IN THE UNIFORM IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FACT, STANDING IN THIS PATRIOTIC CROWD I'M CONFIDENT THERE IS A LOT OF WOMEN AND MEN THAT SERVED IN OUR ARMED FORCES, SO IF YOU WOULD NOT MIND IF YOU ARE A VETERAN, WOULD YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN THE AIR AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR OUR FREEDOM. WE ALL REMEMBER ESPECIALLY THESE VETERANS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, WE SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL WITH THE V.A. THAT SHOCKED THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION, BUT WITH A STRONG SUPPORT FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPLEMENTED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN YEARS, WE FIRED 10,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE NOT GIVING OUR VETERANS THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA, THANK YOU SENATOR. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES AND STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES ALL THESE LAST FOUR YEARS. WITH THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCHES OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND ELIMINATED THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT STOOD STRONG AGAINST IRAN, WE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AND THE IRANIAN GENERAL IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] SO WE STOOD STRONG AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD THREATEN OUR FREEDOM AND OUR PEACE, BUT WE HAVE ALSO STOOD WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AFTER FOR PRESIDENT IN A ROW PROMISED AND DID NOT DO IT, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS WORD AND MOVED TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO IT HAS BEEN ABOUT OUR SECURITY, BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREATEST , GREAT DEPRESSION, WORKING WITH THE SENATORS, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, WE ROLLED BACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE, WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASED AMERICAN ENERGY AND IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND EVEN IN THIS CHALLENGING YEAR AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC, ON THAT STRONG FOUNDATION WITH OUR ALLIES INTO CONGRESS AND THE UNPRECEDENTED RECOVERY AND RELIEF EFFORTS FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAT THE SENATORS PROVIDED, WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK INCLUDING 350,000 PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WHERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, BEYOND OUR PROSPERITY AND BEYOND OUR SECURITY, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND WITH TWO LEADERS AND SERVE WITH THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD EVERY DAY WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE, AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. BEYOND THAT, WE HAVE SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AS NEVER BEFORE AND THIS IS WHERE THE SENATE LOOMS SO LARGE. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVE IN OUR FEDERAL COURTS, BUT IT IS THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS. WORKING WITH GEORGIAN SENATORS, WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] 220 JUDGES INCLUDING JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. ISN'T SHE GREAT? I MEAN, IN HER CONFIRMATION HEARING HOW MUCH DID YOU LOVE IT WHEN THEY SAID, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU? NOTHING. AN AMAZING PERSON, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THE SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FULFILLED HIS DUTY TO FILL THAT SEAT, IN FACT, LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK SENATOR LOEFFLER, SHE WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE SENATE TO CALL FOR A CONFIRMATION VOTE OF JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. THANK YOU, SENATOR. [APPLAUSE] IN A STRONG JUDICIARY, VANGUARD AND THE SENATE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. YOU ALL REMEMBER IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, THE STEADY ASSAULT OF OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY COMPROMISED TO THE CONSCIOUS RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY ACTUALLY HAULED THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATE OF OBAMA CARE. YOU ALL MIGHT REMEMBER WHEN JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS BEING CONFIRMED A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE DEMOCRAT LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE OF JUDGE BARRETT'S SINCERE CATHOLIC FAITH. SHE SAID AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT ENTER VALUES EVER SENT , SINCE. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD AND THE TWO DEMOCRATS THAT ARE TRYING TO JOIN THEM FROM HERE IN GEORGIA. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. IN THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVE LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHY , ONE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED THESE TWO GREAT SENATORS BACK IN THE SENATE. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH, PROSPERITY, SECURITY, STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION UNDER OUR LIBERTIES. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MAYBE MOST OF ALL, I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE STANDING TODAY WITH TWO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND WITH A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA FOR WHO THEY ARE, FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, WE NEED GEORGIA TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY ON JANUARY 5, 2021. ARE YOU WITH ME? [APPLAUSE] I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OTHERS WILL CUT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND A BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION, DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT DEEP CUTS IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR NEW BIG GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY, HE REPEATEDLY HAS DEFENDED ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC AND EVEN RIDICULED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES ISRAEL. AND WHERE THE SENATORS CUT TAXES, THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO KEEP MORE OF WHAT YOU EARN, JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK ARE TALKING ABOUT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] AND WERE JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANTS TO SUPPORT ACTIVIST JUDGES WHO WILL LITERALLY LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID AND KELLY WILL STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLES IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU ALL NOTE THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA , KNOW THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THE OTHER DATE NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. OUR AGENDA IS AMERICAN GREATNESS , THEIR AGENDA IS AMERICAN DECLINE. WHERE WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA, I FROM US YOU THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOCKING DOWN AMERICA IF THEY GET HALF A CHANCE. IN FACT, REMEMBER WHEN THE DEMOCRATS SAID IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VACCINE BY THE END OF THE YEAR? I HAVE GOT A NEWSFLASH FOR YOU FOLKS, PFIZER TURNED THEIR VACCINE OVER TO THE FDA TODAY. BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE 40 MILLION VACCINES ALL ACROSS AMERICA, THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE ARE IN THE MIRACLE BUSINESS. YOU ALL KNOW JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK'S AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, GREEN NEW DEAL, ABORTION ON DEMAND, DEFUNDING THE POLICE, AND PACKING THE COURTS. JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK ARE WRONG FOR GEORGIA AND WRONG FOR AMERICA, THAT IS RIGHT , WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO THEM AND YES TO SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER ON JANUARY 5. SO GEORGIA, I CAME HERE TODAY TO SAY STAY IN THE FIGHT. STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY IN THE SELECTION. STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND STAY IN THE FIGHT UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE ON JANUARY 5 AND WE SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THAT IS WHY I GOT ON THE BUS TODAY, THAT IS WHY HEADED YOUR WAY TO STAND WITH THESE TWO GREAT LEADERS, TO STAND WITH ALL OF YOU. I HAVE GOT A COUPLE THINGS TO ASK YOU TO DO IN THE WEEK AHEAD , WEEKS AHEAD, FIRST THING I NEED YOU TO DO IS VOTE, GEORGIA. VOTE TO REELECT DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO THE UNITED STATES SENATOR , SENATE. IN PERSON VOTING STARTS DECEMBER 14, MY LAST STOP , THEY SAY THE LOCAL OFFICE OPENS AT 8:30, SO LET ME ASK OF YOU THAT CAME TO THIS RODEO TODAY, GRAB A NEIGHBOR, FAMILY MEMBER, REMEMBER, FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS VOTE ALONE. GET OUT AND VOTE TO REELECT DAVID AND KELLY, THE MOMENT THEY OPEN EARLY VOTING. AND SECONDLY, I WANT YOU TO TELL SOMEONE WHY YOU CAME OUT TODAY AND WHY YOU FEEL SO PASSIONATE. THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA DESERVE TO KNOW JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, GEORGIA WILL LOOM LARGE IN THE FUTURE OF THIS SENATE, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. I KNOW GEORGE IS UP TO THE TASK, I KNOW GEORGIA IS GOING TO HOLD THE LINE. [APPLAUSE] SO VOTE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. TELL A FRIEND, THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. FINALLY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. [APPLAUSE] HAVE FAITH IN OUR PRESIDENT. WHO MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREATER STILL. HAVE FAITH IN LEADERS LIKE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER. MEN AND WOMEN OF INTEGRITY WHO WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE OFF THEY STAND FOR PRINCIPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY DEFEND GEORGE'S VALUES , GEORGE'S VALUES , GERO HAVE FAITH IN THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. I BELIEVE THE CAREFUL STUDY OF HISTORY SHOWS THAT EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN A SEIZURE OF MORE FREEDOM , FUTURE OF MORE FREEDOM AND A FUTURE OF LESS FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME, SO GO TELL THEM FREEDOM IS ON THE BALLOT. AND FINALLY, FINALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE THAT OTHER KIND OF FAITH AS WELL. SOMEBODY SENT ME A QUOTE THE OTHER DAY, IT SAID YOU CAN TRUST AN UNKNOWN FUTURE TO A KNOWN GOD . WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, BUT WE KNOW WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO AVAIL YOURSELVES IN THESE DAYS OF THAT WELLSPRING OF FAITH THAT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA AND AMERICA HAVE ALWAYS DRAWN IN MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TIMES AND WE LIVE IN TODAY.

MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA, WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE FREEDOM FOR THIS GENERATION AND THE NEXT AND WITH ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS, IN THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT SENATE RACE, COME JANUARY 5 AND WITH YOUR PRAYERS.

That's wha t' s at st ake here guys. History tells us that the price o f soci alism is freedom and that's what this election is really all a bout. If you look at what they're talk ing about perpe trating on America, just go r ead the S enate Democratic plat form, it's out there. It's been ou t there all year. What they want to do a nd chuck, Schumer says it bes t. What he wan ts to do is to c hange the rules of the Senate. So he could rea lly be in charge with 50 votes. If he gets these two seats, he will have the effective majority, the United States Senate . And here's what's comi ng. He's going to pa ck the cou rt, he's gonna add democrat ic seats to the Senate. He's going to get rid of the Electoral College. Now, then, what do, what d o you do with that? T hey want to defund t he police at a time w hen we should be defendi ng the police ?

Freedom is ne ver more than o ne generation away fro m extinction. We don't pass it down in the bloodstream.

Senator Leffler is on her wa y back to Atlant a to support that y oung man's f amily and her st aff in this difficult hou r and she goes wit h our prayers an d our deepest sym pathies for hi s family, her staff and all of t hose impacted by to day's trag ic loss of a truly w onderful young man. God bless them a ll. Thank you. But it i s great to be with so many friends here in Georgia. And speaki ng of fri ends of mine, allow me to bring gre etings from another friend of mine. Y eah. Mhm. A man w ho has been fight ing every day to keep the pr omises that h e made to t he people of Geo rgia. I brin g g reetings fro m the 4 5th president of the Unite d S tates of America . Presid ent Donald Trump. Righ t, I'm here because I sta nd with President Donald trum p and I'm here because we stand with Senato r David Pe rdue and Se nator kelly Leffler. But I hav e to tell you, I told the president this morning that I wa s headed to Georgia and he tol d me I'm gonna be th ere tomorrow. And we'r e here to we're here to s tand with two e xtraordinary lead ers. And w e're here also to express our gratitude for the support of the people o f Georgia ov er the past f our years And o ver the past four we eks. It's amazing to think about i t with your suppo rt. Presiden t Trump re ceived more th an 74 million vote s across America. More th an 10 million than 2016. W e received the grea test sh are of m inority votes of any Republican in the last 60 years and we added mo re than a dozen sea ts to the Unit ed States C ongress And as our election conte st continue he re in Georgia and in courts acr oss t he country, I'll make you a p romise we're go ing t o keep fighting until every leg al vote is counted. We 're going to keep fig ht ing until ever y illegal v ote is thrown out . Yeah . A nd we will nev er stop fightin g to make Am erica great again. T hat's why president tr ump and I need Dav id Perdue and kelly Leffler back in t he Republican maj ority in th e Unite d States Senate. For all we've done for all we have ye t to do. We need the peach state to defend the majority be cau se the road to the Sena te, Re publican m ajority runs right t hrough the state of Geo rgia. Are you with me? You know, the re's ne ver a dull moment at a tr ump rally, is th er e? Yeah, Yeah. Men and wome n of the peach state. I'm h ere on t he president's behalf becaus e we ne ed Georgia to send two great senat ors back to Repu blican maj ority in Washi ngton. We need to send them back because o f who they are. We need to send it back becaus e of all that we accomplished togeth er and we nee d to send them b ack because t he Rep ublican Senate majori ty could be the las t line of defense preserving all that we 've done to de fend this n ation, revive our economy and preserve the God given liberties w e hold dear. Bu t I 'm here because of who th ey a re. David Perdue is a son of m aking worked his w ay to the top of the busine ss world. But h e answered the call to pu blic service After sp ending 40 year s is one of the most succe ssful b usine ss leaders i n America. He decided to serve G eorgi a and I can tell you firsthand, he' s a pri ncipled conservati ve, a man o f deep convic tion and faith. And Sen ator. David Perdue has b een on e of the great est allies of our a dministratio n in Washington, D. C. A nd another incredi ble leader, Kelly Le ffler, 4th Gener ation , on her famil y's grain far m. She built her own com pa ny up from the ground. S he broke barriers i n business and sports to become one of Georgia's m ost successful busi ness women. And I can tell you again, i n a very short perio d of time, she has e merged as one of t he most impo rtant cons ervative voices on capitol Hill. We ne ed senator kelly Leffler back in Washingto n, D. C. So we s upport your senators bec ause of who they a re, but also beca use of everything that we' ve done with their suppor t. I me an, think about it four years ago , we inherite d a milit ary that ha d been hollowe d out by deva stating budget cuts, an economy that w as struggling to break out of th e slowest recovery sin ce the G reat Dep ression. Terrorism was on the rise around t he world and we witness ed a steady a ssault on our most cherished v a lues . Bu t wit h your two senators and under President Do nald t p, we rebuilt our m ilitary, we revive our eco nomy. We secu re d our border, s tood with law enforce ment and fought for life and libert y and the constit ution of the Un ited State s of Americ a. Yeah. And ever ything starts wi th our nationa l defense. You k now , I'm your vice pre sident but highest title I'll ever hold i s D A. D wow. Okay. And I'm the proud fa ther of a United S tates Marine an d the father in law of a navy pi lot. And I co uldn't be more proud to serve al ongside a president who ca res s o deeply abo ut the men a nd women of our armed for ces. Presi dent trump has si gned the larges t inves tments in our nation al defense since the days of Ronald Re agan. Mhm I m ean the truth is w e're finally given our so ldiers, sailors, airmen, mar ines and Coast Guard the support they need to d efend this nati on. And Senat or David Pe rdue from h is seat on the Senate Arme d Services Committ ee has been there ever y step of the way. Thank you senat or. So it' s been ab out stand ing with tho se who served but also st anding with a ll of you who did serve in the unifo rm of the Un ited States. You kn ow, the last admin istration saw years of s candal at the V. A. That sho cked the co nscience of the n ation. Do you remembe r I mean, we liter ally had vet erans in this country pass ing away, waiting for c are at via hosp itals in this country. B ut when Pre sident trum p came into office With t he help of your two senators, those da ys are over. Pre side nt Trump signed th e most sweep ing reforms of the via in 50 years. We fired 10, 000 via employees th at we ren't giving our v eterans the care that they earned and veteran s choices now avail able for e very ve teran in America. And from he r seat on the Ve terans Affairs C ommittee, Senator ke lly Leffler was there e very step of the way And with our renewed american st rength the last four yea rs, we' ve stood up to our e nemies and stoo d with our al lies at the direction of Commander in chief. Our armed fo rces took down the la st inch of terri tory under the bl ack flag of ISIS el iminat ed their leader and Qa sem Soleimani is gone . Yeah, we stood with those who thre aten us. But w e've stood wit h our most cherish ed ally. L ike never befo re. After four d iffer ent presidents ma de the promis e an d brok e it. It was President donald tr ump who kept his promise and moved the am erican embassy to Jerusalem, the capital o f the state of Isra el. Oh, so it's been about s ecurity, standi ng st rong in the world. It's also b een about our p rosperity. And again your senator s hav e been ther e every step of the way. After the slowest r ecovery. In some 75 years, Presi dent trump rev ived the a merican e conomy. We cut taxes, we rol l back reg ulatio n . We fought for f ree and fair trad e unleashed American energy and i n three short y ears busine sses large and small created s even million good paying jobs, including 350,000 jobs right here in th e Peach stat e. And your se nato rs were there every step of the way, esp ecially in this challenging year throug h which we passed. It's amaz ing to think in the mi dst of the coronavir us pandemic. It was a moment in whic h we lost 2 2 million jobs. But because of the strong foun dation that both of Georgia senators supported, W e've al re ady seen more than 12 million American s go back to work . We're o pening up Am erica again. I mean th e r esponse to this pandemic, I must tell you, se rving alongside this president, been deeply insp iring to me as an american. With the support of your two senato rs, we launched the g reatest natio nal mobiliza tion since World War Two. We secured fi nancial support for families and businesses. And while the ot her side s aid it would take a mir acle to get a vaccine. Before the end of the year, we just he ard the CDC in Atlanta, we're about a week and a ha lf away from st ar ting to distribute t ens of millions of doses o f a safe and effective vaccine. America is in the mira cle business and David Perdu e and kelly L effler were th ere every day of th is challenging year. But when it co mes to the r ule of law, I couldn 't be mor e proud to r eport to you with the strong su pport of these se nators. We've confirmed more than 220 C onservative j udges t o our federal cour ts at ev ery level and they are al l men and wom en wh o will uphold the God gi ven libertie s enshrined in our constitution, like the freedo m of speech, the freedom o f religi on and the Secon d Amendment right to kee p and bear arms. And n one of that would hav e been possibl e without the con sistent suppor t and vote of Senator D avid Perdue and Sena tor kelly Leffle r. It was Georgia, s enato rs who w ere there when we confirmed j ustice Neil Gorsu ch, Just ice Brett Ka vanaugh and Justice. Amy coney Barrett. Yeah. In fact , Se nator kelly Leff ler was the first member of the United State s Se nate to cal l for the immed iate conf irmation of Justice Amy coney Barrett . And it cou ldn't be more im portant than it is right now. I think you all under stand a strong j udiciary is the vangua rd of our liberti es under the last administration . You remember how o ur values and our freedoms were under assault i n the last administr ation actual ly was tra mpling on t he religi ous li berty of american s o n a regular basis . They comprom ise the cons cienc e rights of doctors and n urses and of relig ious charities. They even called the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. In fact, we saw that religious intolerance two years ago when Amy coney Barrett went before the Judiciary Committee the first time the leading democrat on the committee actually said she was concerned because of Amy coney Barrett, sincere christian faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been ridicule and Amy coney barrett ever since. Well, I got news for the democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America. So for ou r liberties, f or our freedo ms , we need Senator David Perdue and kelly Le ffler back in a Republi ca n majority in the United Stat es Se nate. Yeah, yeah. Near the stakes in t his election has never been hig her. The cho ice has never been clearer where D avid Perdue and kelly Le ffler stand for a stro ng nati onal defense, Jon O ssoff and Raphael Warn oc k are gonna cut in our national defense to fund thei r big government progra ms. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffl er cut taxes, J on Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to rais e taxes on working families and bus inesses large and sma ll. Mh m. Where D avid Perdue and kel ly Leffler support ou r military. Rap hael Warnock has dem eaned our milita ry and repeatedly de fended the anti Se mitic rhetoric o f rever end Jeremiah wrig ht, and w here Jon Oss off a nd Raphael Warn ock s uppo rt taxp ayer funding of abortion. Da vid Perdue and kell y Lef fler stand for the right to life. Mhm. I mean, you all know what the stakes are here in Georgia, chuck , schumer said it couldn't have said it more clearly. He said , quote now we take Georgia then we change Am erica. I got a message for chu ck s chumer and the Washington democrats. We're goin g to keep G eorgia, We're going to save the senate an d then we're go nna save America . You know, o ur agenda is american greatness. Th eir agend a is ameri can decline, Jon Ossof f and Raphael Warnoc k's age nda of hig her taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. A green n ew dea l defunding the po lice and packing t he courts. It's wrong for Ge orgia and J on Ossoff a nd Raphael W arnock are wron g for Georgia an d wrong for Ameri ca. That's why we need Georgia to say no to us of f and Warnock and yes to Senator David Perdue and Senator Kell y Leffl er on January five. So George, I came here today to say stay i n th e fight, Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections. M hm, and s tay in the fight to de fend the republi can majority in the Senat e. Stay in the fight until the pol ls c lose on Ja nuary five and we sent David Perdue and kell y Leffl er back to a Republican m ajority . I m ean to kee p America gre at ever ybody, that's what' s on the l ine to preser ve t he prog ress that we've made to protect our va lues and our liberties. We need you to vote G eorgi a. We need you to vote to s end Senator Davi d Perdue and Senator kelly Leffle r back to W ashington, D. C. Yeah, it all s tarts now.

And I need Dav id Perdue and kelly Leff ler back in a Republican m ajority in the Uni ted States Senate. Yeah. You know, for all we' ve done for all we have yet to do. We need the peac h sta te to defend the majority be cause the road to a Sena te majority runs right th rough the sta te of G eorgia. Are you with me? You know, I 'm here on t he presi dent's beha lf because we nee d Georg ia to send these two g reat sen ators back to Washingto n, D. C. We need to send them bac k for three reason s. We need to send the m back because of who they are. We n ee d to send h im back because of al l we 've accom plished together and we need to send them bac k becaus e the republican majority co uld be t he last lin e of defense to preser ve all we've done to defend thi s nation, revive our economy and preserve t he God . Given liberties we hold de ar. We need to hold the li ne Georgia. Yeah. Mhm. But first off, I'm here, just like governor produced that. I'm h ere and he didn't ev en my cousin. I'm here because of, of who these pe op le are. David Per due is a son o f making. He worked his way to the top of the business worl d. Could have spent the res t o f his lif e in leisure. But as you heard hi s cousin say , he and h is family we nt to their kn ees and they felt a callin g to serve After 4 0 years is one of the m ost successful bu siness lea ders in America. He answered the call to serv e Georgia in the United States Senate. And I can te ll you having serve d alongside of this g ood man every day I kno w of no more princip led conservati ve man of integrity or champ ion of president tru mp's agenda in the Un ited States Senate, t hen Senator David Perdue. We nee d him back. And I'm also here because of his col league in the S enate. Fourth generation fam ily farmer gr ew up in the Heart land of Ameri ca, but got h ere to Georgia just has ev er been as quick as sh e cou ld buil d our own company from the ground up. You kno w her story, she broke barr iers in business and sports, beco me one of the most suc cessful business women in Georgia his tory and in a very short pe riod of t ime, I can tel l you she ha s emerged as one of the most courageous and prin cipled conse rvative voices in the Un ited States Senate. We need senator kelly Leffler back in Washingto n, D. C. Okay. Really? So presiden t trump A nd I need you to sport these se nators to get yo ur family and your neighbors and your friends to do t he same because of w ho they are. But it's also because of all that we've b een able to do with t heir supp ort. Let me think abou t it. Four years ago, we inherited a mi litary. They've be en hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an econom y that w as struggling t o break out of the slowest reco very since the Great Depres sion. Terrorism was on t he rise. And we witnessed a s te ady assault on our most che ri shed values with the unwavering su pport of both o f Geor gia's senator under the leadersh ip of Pr esident Donald trump, we rebuilt our military, we revive our eco nomy. We secured our border, stoo d with law enforc ement and fought for l ife and li berty and t he constitut ion of the United st ates of Americ a. Mhm That's t rue. You know I h ave to tell you a l ot of you know m e as your vice pr esident by the hi ghest title I'll ev er hold his D. A. D. And I c ouldn't be more proud to be the father an d the fath er in l aw of two m ilitary fighter p ilots and I couldn't b e more proud to s erve alongsi de a president wh o cares so deepl y about the men and women of our a rmed forces. With th e support of your senators. President D onald trump has signe d the largest i nc reases in our nation al defense since the days of Ronald R eagan. Yeah. Were finally given our soldiers, sailors, air men, marines and Coast Guard the support they ne ed to defend t his nation. And I can tell you from h is seat on the Se nate Armed Serv ices Committee. Sen ator David Perdue has been there for ou r military ever y step of th e way. Thank you sena tor. And it's not just been about those who s erve today but it's also about those o f you w ho did serve in the un iform of the United States. You remember th e las t adm inistration? We saw y ears of scandal at the viva tha t shocked the consc ience of the nation. B ut when Pre sident Donald trump came into of fice With th e help of your two senators tho se days were ov er, President trump sign ed the most sweepin g reforms of the V. A. In 50 years . We fired 5000 V. A. Employees that weren't given our ve terans t he care that you earned and veteran s choices now available for every veteran in Am erica. Yeah. And from her seat o n the Veterans Affair s Committee, senato r kelly Leffler was there for Ame rica's vete rans every st ep of the way. Yeah. Y eah. And with that renewed american strength, rebuildin g ou r military, restoring t he arsenal democ rac y. We took the fight to our enemies on our terms on their soil and we've st ood with our allies as never before at the direction of this commander in chief, The armed fo rces, the U ni ted States took down the last inch o f territory under the black f lag of ISIS and to ok out their leader w ithout one American casualt ies. And when the m ost dangerou s terror ists in the world, a man responsible fo r the death of hundre ds of american se rvice members was in our sig hts. President Donald trump too k him out. Qa sem Soleiman i is gone. Mhm. So we've s tood up to our enemi es but we've also stood with our most cherished ally as never befo re. You know, four pres idents in a row had made the pro mise to th e american people. But it was President Don ald t who kep t his promis e when we m oved the american embass y to Jerus alem, the capital of the state of Israel. Yeah. And Sena tor David Perdue and Sen ator kelly Leffle r were there every step of the way. So it's been about America' s place in the world, o ur national security, but it's al so been about our pro sperity. These l ast four years After the slowest recovery in 75 years, president t worked with your s enators and we revi ved our economy . We cut taxes across the board for working famili es and bus inesses large and small. We rolled back m ore feder al regula tion th an any a dministration in hist ory. We fough t f or free and fair trade unl eashed amer ican energy. And in thre e sh ort years We saw seven million good paying jobs crea ted including 350,000 righ t here in the stat e of Georg ia. And your senators were t here every step of th e way. Yea h. And as w e made our way this y ear through one of th e most chal lenging years in ou r lifetime on that solid foundation tha t we poured of less ta xes, les s regulation of growing american economy A t t he height of th e coronavirus pandemic. We 've lost 22 million jobs W ith the strong support o f you r two sena tors. Wit h the relief effo rts that pre sident trump secure d f rom Congress. We've been opening up Amer ica again. We've already seen 12 million Americ ans go back t o wor k. The American comebac k is happening. And speaking o f that pande mic, I I have t o tell you how gratef ul we are. Senator produced s enator Le ffler for their supp ort all along the way. At president trump's direction. Ear ly this year we launched the greatest national mobilizat ion since worl d war two. We reinvented test ing. We saw that the d elivery of billions of medical su pplies to our doc tors and nurses and hos pitals. We man aged to distribute h undreds of thousands of medicines an d therapeutics. A nd as I stand here today, while the oth er side said it would never h appen, it would take a miracle. We're just a few days awa y from the app roval of the fir st coronavirus vaccine for the americ an people and millions of doses Amer ica is in the m iracle business und er President Don ald trump. Yeah. And again, your senators were th ere every step of the w ay a nd frankly, when it come s to the foundation of o ur prosperity and the rule of law, I could n't be more grateful wit h the su pport of Senat or Per due and Senator left Presi dent Trump a nd I have seen mo re than 220 C onservative j udges confi rmed to our federal courts at every lev el, including justice , Neil, Gorsuch , Justice Brett Kav anaugh and Justice Amy Coney Ba rrett. And I'll tel l you those three justices and all those judges are all men and w omen who will uphold all the God given libertie s enshrin ed in our c onstit ution, like the freedo m of religion, the freedom of spee ch and the Second Amendme nt right t o keep and bear arms . You wan t the la st administrat ion, you'll remember it. We we saw a steady as sault on our va lues and our freedom especiall y tra mpled on the rel igious libert y of americans. Yo u remembe r, I mean , literally the la st administration used the p ower of the fede ral government to compromise t he conscience rights of doctors an d nu rses and religious chari ties. They even hauled a group of n uns known as the little Sisters of the p oor, into feder al court to o rder them to compromise their f aith t o live under the mandate s of O bamacare. And they're promisin g to do it again, aren 't they send Mhm. But we saw religious intoleranc e among the democr ats al ike to whic h we wou ld see again if they got c ontrol of the Senat e. I mean, you all rem ember a couple y ears ago when Amy coney Barrett was was up for another judgesh ip. She was before the Sen ate Judiciary Committe e and the leading democrat on the Senate Judici ary committee actually told Amy coney Ba rrett that she was conc erned about her sincere catholi c faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma live s loudly within you and Hollywood liber als have been atta cking Amy coney Bar rett ever since f or her faith and f or values. Well, I got ne ws for th e democrats in Washington and th eir friends in Ho lly wood. No, that dogma lives lou dly in me. That dogma lives loudly in ye ar. Yeah. In the right to live a nd worship accor ding to the dic tates of our fai th. Lives loudly in the cons titutio n of the United Stat es of Americ a. So fo r our liberties for our freedoms, f or the ability to live and to work and to worship according to the dictates of our conscience. We nee d a Republican m ajority i n the United States Senate, we need David Perdue and kel ly Leffl er ba ck in Washingto n, D. C. I d on't have to tell all of you have come out on this sunny day. The stak es in this election has never be en higher. The choice in this electio n has never been clear. I mean, I 'm here bec ause of who the y are. I'm here because of all we've done, but I'm here bec ause this choice is so st ark. Where David Perdue and kell y Leffler stand f or a str ong national defen se, Jon Osso ff an d Raphael Warn ock are gonna cut ou r national defe nse to fund their big gover nme nt program s. You just wat ch where David Per due an d kelly Leffle r cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and th e radical liber al Raphael Warn ock want to raise taxes on working fam ili es and businesses large a nd sma ll, and wh ere David Perdue a nd kelly Leffler s upport ou r military. Raphael W arnock has deme aned our milit ary and he 's repeat edly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of r everend Je remi ah wright and maybe most close to my hear t where Jon Oss off and Raphael Warnoc k support abortio n on demand and taxpayer funding of abortion a ll the way up to the moment of birth . David Pe rdue and kelly Leffle r will always stan d fo r the right to life. Thank you. You all kn ow what the stake s are her e in Georgia. I mean, c huck schum er could n't have sai d it bett er, right, chuck, sch ume r said, quo te, now we take Georgia, then we c hange America. W el l, I got another message for chuck sch umer in the Washington d emoc rat, we're gonna keep Georgia, we 're g oing to sav e the senate and then we' re going t o save America. Yeah, yeah. I mean fo r real our agenda i s ameri can greatne ss. Their agen da is american de cline. Jon O ssoff and Rap hael Warno ck advance a so cialist agen da of higher taxes, open borders gover nment, takeover of health care . A green new dea l defundin g the police packing the courts . And tha t's just for starters, right, Jon Ossoff and Raphae l Warnock are wrong for Georgia and wrong for America. That's why we n eed Georgia to say no to sf and Warnock a nd yes t o Senator Davi d Per due and Senator kel ly Leffler on ja nuary 5th.

If from time to time you bow the head and bend the knee, I'd encourage you to do that too. Be a good time to pray for Georgia and pray for America. And in these divided times, I'd encourage you to pray with confidence, claim that ancient promise that americans have clung to and much more challenging times than we could even imagine that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn, he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this state and nation. He'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America and pray for all of those standing in the gap for everything we hold dear. Yeah, but I want to thank you for coming out today and I just know, I just know if all of us do all that we need to do Between now and January five, I know if Georgia vote your values and your convictions. If you vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority in the United States Senate. If you keep standing with this president until every legal vote is counting that with the support of people all across the state and with God's help right? We're going to keep on winning.

It's good to have you he re on a blustery day and good to be here with so many very special peo ple. But as I b egin, allow me to bring greeti ngs be ca use you all have been very ki nd t o me today . Let me bring greeting s from a m an who from early on in this ad ministra tion and as a cand idate made it clear that he would stand up for the sanctity of human life and all ow me to give you the oppor tunity to thank the mos t pro life pre sident in ame rican histo ry. I bring greeting s from President Donald tru mp in uh even before our inauguration, four years ago, president trump wrote to th e speaker of the House of Represe ntati ves in words that I believe well to reflect on the day, he said, I believe it is the most basic dut y of government to gua rd the innocent with that in min d. He made it clear and he said, I w ill veto a ny l egislation that w eakens cu rrent p er life federal policies or encourag es the destructi on of innocent h uman life at any stage. And Preside nt Do nald trump has kept his wor d every singl e day. Yeah, but I wanted to thank all of you on the president's behalf a nd on my own behalf f or all that. Each o ne of you have done in the cause of life o ver the last f our years. Y ou'll hear from this pod ium today the milesto nes that that we've marked t ogether. It's all b een because of all o f you and b ecause o f the literally ten s of millions o f americans who h ave labor ed in the cause For l ife since tha t dark day in 19 and 73. There are specifi c heroes in the ro om that I want to ackno wledge you are wit h us today to be able to serve in the role of vice president. Yo u also get to be presi dent of the Senate. You get an up close loo k, members o f t he Uni ted States Senat e, you see t heir values w hen the cameras are off, you see their pr inciples and they' re proba bly No two more stal wart conservatives in the United States Senate, No two greater champi ons for the right to life than Senator Ja mes Lankford an d Senator steve Daines . Would you join me in th anking the both of them fo r their great lea dership for life? An d there's a woman in the room w ho I g ot to know when she was a staff director for the Pro Life ca ucus in Congress. She is has e merged as maybe one of the most effective p ro life leaders in the United States of America. Join me in thanking marjorie Dannenfelser and he did some time in the House of R epresentat ives and i n the United States Sena te. And n ow he's emerge d as one of the leading voices for life an d liberty ar ound the country. Uh an d he's never c hanged. Senator jim de mint, thank y ou so much for your strong stand for this movement all these many ye ars. And let me also let me also acknowledge some one who worked back in the Reagan adminis tration uh was Brooke you'll be glad to k now as the chie f domestic poli cy advisor . He would go on and organi zations like the Fa mily Re search Council focus on the family. Now President of American va lues and a stalwart and eloquent champion for life Gary Bauer. We thank yo u for your leadership and y our support, but we're joined toda y by more than membe rs of more t han 20 pro lif e organization s who sup ported President trum p and our admin istration the cause for l ife all along th e way. And so a gain our thanks to the Susan b Anth ony list t o students for life to M arch. For life act ion to focus on the fa mily. Two c oncerned wome n for America Family Re search Council a nd all of you who hav e organized and mobilized a round America for the sanctity of li fe. Give yo urselves a round of applause would yo u please? Well lik e all of you gathered he re today, I've long belie ved that a society ca n be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn President trump said early in our a dministration and I quote eve ry person i s worth pr otecting every human life born and un born is made in the holy image of Al mighty God and this administration has always been about life and that's been ev ident in the last yea r as our natio n has passed t hrough this challengi ng time of a global pandemic. When the president asked me to leave the Whit e House coronavirus ta sk force, I'll nev er forget the day he said, mike, I w ant you to step do wn, I wan t you to work with our out standing Health lea dership al l across this admi nistra tion across the count ry with one mission and tha t was to save lives. We launche d th e greatest nat ional mobilization s ince World War II . We reinvented testing s ome 200 million Tests have been performed a cross America some two milli on a da y we saw to the production and the dist ribution of lit erally billions of s upplies of per sonal pro tective equipment and all along the way. This pr esident an d this team, we're i n a relentless dr ive to save lives. We created medicines in r ecord speed and as the world learned last w eek we have come to th e beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic and people are already receivin g the first safe and effective coronavirus vacci ne all across Amer ica. Q Secr etary a czar a nd I were in indiana yest erday at a distr ibution facility and manufacturin g plant t hat that will with the approval of FDA. We hope this week liter ally be d istributing millions more of a new vac cine that could w ell be approved for the amer ican people. I mentioned a ll of that today beca use it is just emblematic of an admini stration that has counted the lives of everyone of our citizens preci ous and important and that' s animated our re spons e to this pandemic. But it's animated the progress that we' ve made in thi s administration eve ry step of the way and the cause for li fe as Brooke just mentioned when the pr eside nt took office, one of the v ery first things he did was re instate the Mexico city policy ending governmen t funding for p romoting abortions around the world. And before lo ng we expanded it to more countries and more policies on the planet and he gave me the great pr ivil ege i n our very first month i n office to be the first vice president in history to ever address the march for li fe on the national m all and this la st january he did it himself . Preside nt trump spoke to the March for life before we took office. Y ou all kno w that the larges t abortion provi der in America was a lso the large st rec ip ient of federal funding u nder titl e 10. The year befor e we to ok office. We actually witn essed alo ng with the americ an people, the the underc over videos that showed h orrif ic conversations about t he sale and transfer of of parts of aborted babies. It's just unco nscionable. But thanks to President Trump's leadership in Mar ch of 2017, I had th e honor of casting the tiebreaking vote in th e United Stat es Senate to allow every state in America to defund p lanned parenthood and president trump sign ed it into law. Yeah. And p utting that p riority on the u nborn. Just last summer with the strong support o f leaders in this room and the and th e full support of our Secreta ry of Health and Human Servi ce. President trump ended f etal tissue research at the Nation al Institutes for Heal th. We will always s tand for the right to life and the digni ty of the unborn right. So we've made g reat progress all alo ng the way. But perh aps uh it's it's altogeth er fitting with two these t wo great senators in th e room and one form er senat or of the room to talk a bou t the really extraordi nary progr ess that we've made in the courts acr oss this land as a c andidate. Presid ent trump promis ed the american peopl e, he said, quote, I will p rotect life. And the biggest way you can p rot ect it is through the Supreme Court and putti ng people in th e court he said an d he pro mised I will appoint judges that will be pro l ife. And that's ju st what he's done as Brooke said with yesterday's confirmation of the judge th at will fill the seat of the n ewest justi ce on the Sup reme Court. President T has appointed more than 220 conservati ves to our federal courts at every level i ncluding Justice N eil Gorsuch, Justi ce Brett Kav anaugh and Ju st ice Amy coney Barrett. Ye ah. And I promi se you ha ving had the opportunity to meet so many of these, not jus t the justices bu t the judg es, every one of these men and w omen are principle d conservative s who will uphold all the God give n liberties enshrine in ou r found ing documents an d in our bill of rights. It 's truly a legacy tha t will reach generations. And and it's a te stament to what ea ch one of yo u have done your suppor t for t his administration, y our counci l a lo ng the wa y. As those deci sions were made via presiden t, whether it be in policies in health, whether it be in uh whether it be in decisions that we re made about appointments to the court. I hope you all know believe with all my heart th at everyone in this room righ t along with our p residen t has made a diff erence for life. So today we really gather to reflect on the great progress we've made for life under Presiden t donal d trump. and with all of your collective support , but also to to thank all of you an d urge you as we promis e to never stop fig hting for the c ause for life. I believe w hat we hav e demo nstrated over these pas t four years is that wh en m en and women who cheri sh the s anctity o f life come tog et her, Let their voic es b e heard. When we rally behind gr eat leaders at every level who will stand without apology for life. We can make e xtraordinary progress. A nd I truly do believe if a ll of us continue to do all that we can in the months and the years ahead , we will see th e sanctity of life restored to the cen ter o f american law in our time, truly believe it. So all the cha mpio ns for life. Than k yo u for all you've done on beh alf of the Preside nt, on behalf of our entire admini stration. We're gra teful to each and e very one of you and it's been our great hon or to serve alongside you and w ill continue to fight alon gside with you all the t ime that we have in a ll m y days that rema in on this earth. I will a lways stand for life and I'll alway s stand with each and every one of yo u. That's my solemn promise. And it 's n ot just about n ot just about each one of you. I kn ow what all of yo u know a s well that he who said before I formed you in t he womb. I knew you i s about life and we d o w ell in this movement a lways remind our selves that when we make the c ause for life our cause w e make his work on this ea rth our very own. S o do not grow w ea ry in doing well be cause in the last four years we've shown when men and women of fait h and conviction come toget her to stand up for the unborn to speak out f or the voiceless life can win in America. And with your help and God's h elp, life will kee p on winning i n the Uni ted States of America. Than k you all very muc h. God bless yo u an honor to be with y ou today. It's ladies and gents. We'd like to ta ke this opportunity to remind everyo ne that mask are encouraged . Especial ly when soc ial dist ance cannot be maintaine d in accordance with health and safety guideli nes. We tha nk you for your as sistance and for b raving the elements to be here with us today an d to celebrate life mm V ice President P ence. I kno w I speak for everyon e here. I know I speak f or those behi nd me on this stage. I know I speak f or the tho usands watching on the livestream that your lead ership and your conviction and your heart and your love for our Lord and everything that you have lived your life believing in and standing for has truly changed America and your servant leadership to this country, to the president to all of us is really inspiring. So thank you again. And please help me thank our amazing Vice President. Uh Mr. Vice President, we know you have a task force in some vaccines, you might have to step away, but we know hopefully you'll come back because there's a presentation for you towards the end of our our together. So just feel free to do that at this time, it's my great honor to introduce and by the way, I will tell you she was a last minute edition. Uh and so Kayleigh Mcenany joined this administration. It seems like years ago, but it was just this year, wow, what a star. What an amazing defender of freedom and liberty and life and everything that this President and Vice President have stood for and led for. So when we called her literally about 30 minutes ago and said, Kayleigh, we would love to have you join this group, You have become such a face for what is righteous and good in this country and God bless her without hesitation she said I would love to So with that please help me welcome our amazing Press Secretary, Kayleigh Mcenany to the stage, that's what you w ant. Mhm. Tha nk yo u, thank you all so much for being h ere. Thank you f or the work yo u do because the work that you do enable s the work tha t we do and to me when I'm often asked you know what is the most i mp ortant accompl ishment of this Pres ident? It is ha nds down what he has done for the judiciar y. It is hands down the fact t hat we have free dom loving justi ces and judges across this c ountry for man y purposes, to protect our liberties. O ne among them that is ce ntral to the elem ent of our founding docume nts and that is life . And we can thank President d onald trump for tha t And I can tell you, you know, as a new mom, I have a one year old, she jus t turned one on November 2 2 of this year. Uh this iss ue which I've be en passionate about fr om a youn g age pro life has become real to me an d I will neve r forget the day I found out I was pregnant. I did a c spa n interview and I walked away an d I w ent home to my apartment . I was working at th e trump campa ign at the time and I fo und out I was pregnan t and I told my husb and over facetime be cause that's how we'v e had to do things over the last fo ur years. And it was an exciting mome nt. He was pretty shocke d and excited nevert heless. And I spent my time at the trump c ampaign, you k now, being pregnant while also traveli ng the country and I'l l never forget havi ng that first ultrasound which my h usband got to be a part o f. We don't always get to go togethe r to things, but he w as there for that and to se e that beautiful i mage of what would soo n become baby b lake as she's become known on soc ial media, a tear rolled down my eye . And I was not ex pecting that because that was a real baby just weeks in to my pregnancy a nd an issue that I have been so passionate about from a young age becam e materia lly real in my life . And each ultrasoun d as you approache d and you got the gender and yo u learne d that this beautif ul baby was on her way to do the thr ee D. Ultrasound where you could just see every el ement. I sa w her hand . I'll never forget Her ha nd. Amazin g m oment in my life. I saw h er leg. I saw i n three D. It was just a b eautiful exper ience th at we know today that babie s are babies at the mom ent of con ception. No e xcus es and it is not about a woman's right to choose. It is ab out a human bein g's right to live. And I'll tell you my daughter, she's so beauti ful. I'll never f orget how accommoda ting this president h as been from the ve ry beginning. Baby blake afte r s he w as born, went to Iowa w ith me. This is whe n I was on the c ampaign in new Hampshire and s outh Carolina and n orth Carolina, she has mor e immunity than anyon e becaus e she's been o n so many planes. But when I got th is job as press secretary, I knew it would be a tough one b ecause I was a ne w mom and wanting to not mi ss a single moment of her life and I'll never forget. Um aft er I g ot the title of press s ecretary holdi ng blake and I sta rted to cry because I w as like, I'm gonna miss my little baby and my tears started to fall on her fac e and all of a sud den she let out, I swear it wa s her firs t smile and it was God's way of saying you go do what yo u need to d o and I'll tell you what this president did when he first offered me t he job, he said thi s is your daughter go ing to be okay bec ause he is a p resident that supports mo ms, he's a presid ent that suppo rts life and t here's bee n no greater p artner for him in that endeavor than Vice p resident. Pence h as been an unmist akable voice for l ife from the v ery beginning. So I want to thank you for being here and thank you for a ll that you do because it's your work that enables this to happen and uh appreciate, I mean just the other day I went to go find pro life bible verses, I google it, focus on the family pops up has like 23 so you guys make our task very easy. So thank you so much for all that you do. Thank you. I am so gla d Kaylee mentioned that beca use I'm a mom of fou r and of course Ivanka ha s three Children, Kellyanne before she l eft has her fo ur Children. Uh the am ount of working m oms and our kids running through the west wi ng, If only America c ould see that r ight. If only America co uld no that the supp ort of this Presid ent and the Vice President for life, which i s why we're a ll here gathered to celebra te. But for Chi ldren of all ages to be a part of this extr aordinary time we 've had in the White House. Um kaylee, you are amazing. Thank you so much an d thank you for your sacr ifice. Next I'd li ke to intr oduce another fighter for the dignity of th e unborn Secretary of Health a nd Human Servic es, Ale x Azar w ho has led h is department in implementing so many pro life wins on both the domestic an d the intern ational fronts . I have worked closely with S ecretary Azar on many issues over the last few years and know his heart for the pro l ife c ause plea se help me welcome Se cretar y Alex Azar to t he podium. Okay, okay , okay, tha nk you very much. Thank you uh Brooke that's very kind and thank you al l. It's overwhelmin g to get that greetin g fr om you all and thank you Mr Vice Presiden t for bringing us toget her for this im portant event today. It's great t o be w ith so many people who are so committed to protecting the fundament al rights that hav e made our country great. It 's great to just look out in this audie nce and se e so many friends. So many su pporters hav e been with us throu ghout this journey over the la st several years and fought with us to protect t he dignity of human life at ever y step of the way. I especially want to thank the V ice President for his unwav ering commitment to th e causes of l ife and religious liber ty, which has helped ad vance them in unprecedented ways in t his administration. It woul d take a rather lengthy speech t o highli ght everything that HHS has accomp lished in this r ealm over the past few years. So I just want to highlig ht a few areas that I'm particularly proud of under Pres ident trump HHS has led the way on prom oting a culture of life. A s you heard ea rlier, we finalized a new titl e 10 regulation t o ensure that taxpay er dollars aren't s upporting abor tion as a method of family planning requiring ti tle 10 services to be de livered at a sep arate location from abor tions. W e rescinded a guidance that had prohibited state Medicaid progr ams from taking steps to ensure federal f unds were not going t o support abortion providers and we approved a waiver for texas to en sure that abo rtion providers w eren't receiving M edicaid funds. These efforts re quire a partnership between th e federal government a nd state and loc al leaders. So I want to than k es pecially a ll of the state and local pro li fe leaders that w e have here today and who are w atching thi s today . This administration v alues your efforts an d recogniz es that w e couldn't be w here we are today wit hout you . We've also been prote cting conscience rights more aggressively th an any previous admi nistrat ion in history. T he HHS office for Civil ri ghts led by Roger S everino established its first ever conscience and relig ious freedom divis ion tasked wi th making s ure our nati on's conscie nce and rel igious freedom laws are ne ver ag ain treated l ike second class rights. Today, we're pleased t o be announcing two a ctions out of tha t office th at demonstrate our commitmen t to the enforce ment of these laws to ensu ring they are not merely words on paper as they have been for deca des. First , we are taking enforc ement action against the state of Californi a for imposing universal a bortion coverage man dates on hea lth insurance in the sta te. We have informed we have inf ormed California that this p olicy clearly violates f ederal conscience l aws, but the state ref uses to fix t he issue and comply accordingly. We pla n to withho ld $200 mil lion 2021. An d unless California a mends its po licies, we will seek to withhold an a dditional $200 million dollars every q uarter until it compli es. Yeah . Second, t he Department of Justice is f iling a lawsuit on behal f on our behalf in a separate consci ence viola tion issue, which Claire wil l discuss sho rtly this commit ment to protecti ng the di gnity of human life and americans, consci ence and religious f reedom r ights has also contin ued during during our response to COVID- 19, we've taken ac tion to ensure that states and health care providers do n ot discrimina te on the basis of age or disability in the allocation of lif esaving medic al care. And we'v e helped resolve n umerous religious discrim inatio n complaints ens uring hospital patients hav e access to clergy during this pand emic. As many of you know, we also collabora ted with th e Department of Labor an d Treasury to protec t american employers, including organiz ations like the little sisters of the poor that have religious or mo ral objections to pro viding coverage fo r contracep tives in their health ins urance plans. Thi s past summ er by 7-2 majority. T he Supreme Court u pheld our statutory authority to issue th ose important exe mptions to prot ec t conscience. The succ ess that we've had wouldn't be po ssible without t he tremendous support that we've ha d from the Departm ent of Justice . And I want to t hank Claire for bein g here to r epresen t the goo d people a t Doj who've been tire less in their efforts to upho ld the law and protect the conscience rights o f every am erican. Finally, this ad ministration's e fforts h ave not been confined to ou r borders. In l ate october Secretar y Pompeo and I co ho sted the virtual sig ning cere mony of t he geneva co nsensus Declara tion, a historic docu ment and commitment to lif e co spo nsored by the United Sta tes, brazil E gypt Hu ngary Indonesi a i n Uganda. The declara tion come s out of an inter na tional coali tion t hat we've bui lt und er the trump administ ration to ac hieve better h ealth for women . The preservation of human life , support for the family is foundat ional to a healthy society and the protecti on of n ational so vereignty in globa l po liti cs. As of today, the decla ration ha s been signed by 3 5 countries repr esenting more than 1.6 billion peop le, nearly 20% of the United Nations member States. This historic achievement, which was the fruit of years of labor in t he fields was the result of the ef fort and commitment by t wo great lead ers at HHS Garrett Grigsby and Valerie huber who have pulled this int ernational coalition tog ether and I think for ever changed the int ernational profile of support for life. So t hank you. This coalition is unfortu nately nec essar y because of effort s by other wealthy cou ntries to bully smaller count ries on these issues and we' ve been proud to help them fi ght back under Pres ident trump. This d eclaration will live on as a commitment to th ese countrie s of these countries to those important goals. I t is without contest, t he most significa nt international commitment made in the h istory o f the pro life movement and the pa rticipating cou ntries remain bound t o working together to protect lif e and family to cl ose. I just want to a cknowledge all of the hard, dedicated work that each of you he re today has done to protect life and to protect t he freedoms that are p romised by our const ituti on. One of the proudest parts of my time at HHS has been support ing our efforts to pr otect life at every stage fro m the momen t of conception t hrough natural de ath to help ensur e that our d epartment is in every se nse of the word, the De partment of Life. I'm proud to have pla yed a r ole and you c an be too, I 'm proud to have b een the fi rst secretary of HHS to have actually marched in the M arch fo r life as part of Orthodox christians for life on th e mall, but we couldn't have done any of this without your help and without the consta nt unwavering suppo rt of President trump and Vic e President Pence over the past few years . I've n ever tired of stating t his fact. There has never be en a more pro life or pro rel igious freedom adm inistration in american history . Thank you all for helping to mak e that happen because it could not have h appened withou t your unwave ring support over the past sev eral years. Thank you so much. Thank you . Thank you. Secretary Azar. What a what a gift to continue wo rking wi th you. And I'm rem inded when you were talking one of my favorite scri ptures, I kno w most of y ou probably know it is the one that says let us run with endura nce. The ra ce th at is set before us an d yo u have had a lot of endurance. Secretary Azar. Uh we ha ve worked on a lot of different issue s together uh and certainly you have bee n such an incredible leader for this administration. So tha nk you with that. I wou ld like t o next intro duce Bill steiger, who is the Chief of Sta ff at the United States Agency for Internat ional Develop ment otherwis e known as U. S. Ai d. Bill has been a stalw art at US aid in i mplementing the President's expande d Mexico city policy and also holding the Un ited Nations and other internatio nal org anization s accountable for their a bortion advocacy. Pleas e help me welcome Bill steiger to the podiu m. Thank you. Thank you so m uch. Thank you Mr Vice Preside nt What an hon or it is to share the stage with y ou. I've gotten a chance to work with this wit h you on this agenda but al so a broader part of our defense o f human life and dignity ar ound the world, whic h is our defense of religious and et hnic minorities incl uding in Northern Ira q. And it's an inspira tion to have been able to carry forwa rd your prog rams for chri stians disease and oth ers that suffered the brutal repression and genoc ide of the so call ed Islamic state in that part of the w orld. So thank y ou for your leadership on that issue as well. Secret ary Azar, always a p leasure to see you again. I worked for this man for a number of year s previously more th an a decade ago at HHS and we started on th ese issues. But I will te ll you that we have made more progress in the last four years under this administ ration with the l eadership o f this president and this Vice Pre sident on the international defensive lif e than at any ti me in american hi st ory. And the Se cretary deserves most of the credit for that along with his te am. So tha nk you for your leader ship and it's great to see friends a nd colleagues from around the c ountry who have been tire less in your support of life here at home and abroad and we couldn't have done it with out all of yo u. So thank you also fo r everythi ng that you've done in supporting us at the U. S. Agency for international Development and the State Department as we've carried this agenda with our colleagues from H. H. S. To the United Nations and on a bilateral basis. And what I'm here to tell you is a little bit more about the success that we've had internationally on two fronts. The first is our bilateral programs, those programs that you fund that we deliver around the world on global health. As you've heard on his third day in office, the president signed a memorandum which reinstated the Mexico City policy, which extended to our family planning programs that side and then Asked the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take it further to extend those protections to all of our global health programs. And in May of 2017 we did just that. the protectin g life in global hea lth policy as it's ca lled. R. P. L. G . H. A. Has meant that we are now protecting life in n ot just the small slice of about $300 mill ion $9 billion dollars or more th at we spend every yea r on other health progra ms around the worl d. This has never been done in by any administ ration. It's the largest expansion of a pro life policy i nternationally tha t's ever occurred. And it's meant th at we have prohibited n ow any of our gl obal health a ssistance money fro m subsidi zing abortion f rom promoting abortio n. No forei gn non go vernmental orga nization may take our money and promote or perfo rm abortion as a m ethod of family p lanning or for th at matter, take anyone else's mon ey and conduct those activities. T hat has meant, am ong other things th at the m ajor organizatio ns behind the international a bortion i ndustrial complex, t he International planned parentho od Federation and M arie Stop es Internat ional have been un able to receive any US federal fu nds since 2017. I t's interesting to no te that just a couple of weeks ago, y ou might have seen Marie S top es Int ernational dec ided that it had to change its name be cause it finally h as to rec oncile the racist and eugen icist background of its founder and is trying to hide its agenda no w under just its in itials. But we've stop ped that organiz ation and others from being able to take you r money and promote a perf orm abortion overseas , which is a great legacy for this present pe ople have said. And I think I know you've heard some of the fearm ongering that somehow maybe this policy was g oing to destroy our health progra ms that are helping women an d Children and fam ilies around the world. And nothing could be furt her from the tr uth. The facts bear this out. The disrupt ions if th ere were any have been mini mal. On ly eight of more t han 1300 organizations that were pri me recipients o f our global hea lth Assistance since 2017 ha ve refused th e terms of the policy. Most o rganizati ons recogniz ed that the policy is the righ t thing to do and they themselves, many of which are faith-ba sed organizat ions have recognize d that our policy fits with their values. It's proof th at we can have two policy ob jectives a nd impleme nt them at the same time protec ting life and human dignity and provid ing life saving and life changing assistan ce to women, Children and thei r families all around the w orld. The se cond place where we've h ad successes in the multilater al arena at th e United Nations and at other organizations. We fought hard w ith our colleagues a t HHS and at the State Departme nt to eliminate language in int ernatio nal documents, negot iated resolu tions at th e General Assembly of the United Na tions that the W orld Health Assembl y that is code for abo rtion ter ms like sexual and rep roductive health or sexual and re productive rights. Things that had been i ngrained in many of the routine resolut ions of the U. N. Fo r many y ears. We've s tood up and fou ght ag ainst t hat language. You mig ht have seen t hat my boss john Bar sa who's the acti ng deputy adm inistrator of U. S. A. I. D. In t he last few months has written to the sec retary general of the U. N. Tw ice to complain about the obvious and cr aven cyn ical attempt by the Uni ted Nations to use the pandem ic of 2019 as a justi fication for promoti ng abortion rights around the world. It's reprehensible that a small gro up of nations with a ra dical agenda supported by a few non go vernme ntal advocacy groups con tinue to pursue what can only be call ed abort ion imperialism and use the U. N . As a way to bully. As th e secret ary said, sove reign gover nments into changing their laws that r eflect their country's values. The y' re aided and abetted in t his quest by the Commu nist Party of China which as w e all know, has used coerced abortio n and forced steriliz ation as a tool of terror and stat e control for more t han 40 years. We' ve said no th e U. N. Should not be in the aborti on busines s. And the president was clear in his speech to the General embly two years ago w hen he was the first american president to stand up and defend life at the United Nations that we wi ll not let this con tinue. And we're not alone. W hat the secretary has done with h is team is amazing diplomatic wor k. We' ve come In the last four y ears, as I say longer farther than we've come in the 20 years that I'v e been doing this work in bu ilding an internation al coalit ion of nations the president, the vice president have i nspired ot her leaders just lo ok at Brazil and Hungar y and Egypt tho se who joined the Geneva Consensu s Declaration. They're willi ng to find the courage to say what we kn ow needs to be said internationally because our Preside nt and Vice P resident have been wi lling t o do so too. So la dies and gentleme n, life is w inning even at the Un ited Nations around th e world. But our wo rk is not yet done. As yo u know, we haven't do ne everything that w e need to do. There are still international docume nts that are aggressi vely promoting abortion. There are s till resolution s that will pass over our objections that will do the same. We need you to help us keep the pressure up on the U. N. To join together and stand with the other members of the coalition to keep them firm in fighting for the right to life around the world and we need you to help us preserve the gains that we've achieved domestically internationally in the years to come. Thanks so much. Okay, thank you. Bill, thank you fo r your great leadershi p. Next I'd l ike to introduce Princ ipal Deputy Asso ciate At torney General at the Dep artment of Justice. Claire Murray. The Office Claire leads has responsibility at the Depar tment of Justice for ci vil litigation and regulatory matters. And she will tell us about some of those matters of particular interest t o this commun ity. Claire who will soon deliver her fif th child. Uh If you will j oin me at the podium and let us all give yo u a big round of a ppl ause for many reasons . Thank you. Mhm Thank you so much and thank you Brooke for that kind introdu ction. Thank you Mr Vice Pr esident for your leadership and for convening us. Y ou sort of knew that w e had to have at least one u nborn baby at this , a t this gathe ring. So I thought I could serve that the but I'm also her e on behalf of Attorney Gener al Barr to tell you a l ittle bit about wh at the De partment of J ustice has done over the past few years to defen d the civil and constitutiona l rights of all americans , including the m ill ions of americans for whom the sanctity of life is a core ethical an d religious convictio n. You heard a little bit from Secretary Azar about our defensive mission a nd the department has bee n extre mely active in defending th e administr ation's pro life initiatives. Whe ther that i s defending the titl e 10 rule o r standing, you kno w, wi th the littl e s isters of the poor at the Supreme Court or defending healt h restrictions on on Mifeprex , Ru 46. Um that has been a big part of our docke t and something that we hav e done very successfu lly. But today, I would ju st sort of like to highlight two things th at are going on in the lowe r courts that you may or may not be aware o f, One of whi ch you were not aware of because as Secretary Azar suggested, we have a hot o ff the press es anno uncement um this morning, t he Department of Justice' s civil rights division led by Assistant Attorney ge neral eric dry band um sued to stop a ho spital in Vermont from violating the rig hts of heal th care provid ers who f ollow thei r consciences an d ref use to assist in performing abort ions. So this su it is based on an investiga tion conducted by Roger Severino. U m and the HHS office o f Civil right s. Um HHS as you know, unde r the leadership of Secre tary Azar h as been a stau nch defender o f the vulnerable and th e marginalized and in this case, their inves tigation uncovered that the University of Vermont Medica l center had forced a catholic nurse to participate in an elective abortion, e ven though the doctor performing the aborti on knew that t he nurse had placed her name o n the hospital's list of conscientious obj ectors. And even though ot her nurses without conscientious o bjections were available to as sist instead, what's mor e our suit alleges tha t the hospital actually misled the nurse into believing that sh e was schedu le d to ist in another, yo u know, unobjectionable proce dure. It was only when she arrived in th e operating room that the physician perform ing the aborti on turned to her and said, please don 't hate me for this. Um Finally , our stewed alleges that the hospital has a dopted discriminatory polici es that autho rize it to schedule con scientious objectors to assist with abortions even after they have submitted writte n objections an d that it repeatedly scheduled nu rses whose names were on the objector list for abortion procedures di scriminating against a consc ientious objector for refusing t o assist in an abortion v iolates fed eral laws that were enacted by a bi parti san Congress to prote ct the consci entious rights, the conscience rights of those with moral or religious objecti ons to abortion. Congre ss enacted those laws shortly after row , and it was because it foresa w the risk of row leading to a nak ed public s quare where health car e providers with moral or religious obj ections to abortion were dri ven from the medical pro fessio n. Congress recognized tha t America is a richer place w hen those with sincere religious and moral objection s to abortion can partic ipate fully in civic life. And it sought to prot ect the ability of pro life doctors, nurs es, and other health care w orkers to pursue their callings and to bring th eir talents to bear in serving their communities. O ur suit seeks to adv anc e that same purpos e by seeking a court order t o require the hospital t o honor its obligations under th e law. That's the only an nouncement I have today, but I w ould like to highlight one other ongoing action th at the depart ment has taken in this area that you th at is going a lit tle bit more un der the radar. Um, earli er this year, t he department filed a brief in support of an Ohio law th at prohibits abortion p roviders from c arrying out abortions when they know that the ab ortion is being sought because of a Down syndrome diagnosis. The department argued that Oh io's law serves a number o f important purp oses. First, avoiding th e pernici ous inference that our fell ow citizens with down sy ndrome are any less worthy of dignity and respect than any of the rest of us. Second warning against th e slippery slope towards e ugenic race or based abo rtions. And third pr otecting women from pote ntially coercive abortion pro viders who may pressure them t o obtain an abortion b ecause of Down syndr ome. Not hing in the Constitution or Supreme Court precede nt, our brief ar gues, requires the 6th cir cuit to invalidate Ohio's law. Tha t case was argued a number of months ago. It is still pending and we y early await a ruling, thanks in great part to the strong le adership of the presiden t an d the vice president. This admini stration has remained steadfast in its commitment to ensurin g that the fundamental rights o f pro life indivi duals and organ izations are respected. I am so proud of the work the department has done i n safeguarding the imparti al administration of justic e for all americans . Thank you for everyth ing that you have done to enable us to do what we were ab le to do. Ye ah, thank you C laire, that was amazing. U m, and thank you for all your incredible work and t he team to before I move to the next part of the program , I d o want to say that t ake a point o f personal privil ege leading the Domest ic Policy Council has be en one of the great ho nors of my life, but truly st anding on the shoulders of our team have done su ch extraordinar y work and jen ny Lichter, who many of you k now, is really the the force behind t he Domestic Poli cy Council jenn y. thank you, thank y ou for everything you've done. It's been an honor to honor to work with you on these issues. Um at this time I want to say that it's now my great pleasure to call on two leaders and allies we have relied on these past few years and for whom we are so grateful. The president of the Susan b Anthony list who needs no introduction marjorie Dennis Fell sir. And also the President also not needing introduction of March for Life action. Tom McClusky. If I could ask you guys to uh go ahead. No, it' s it's really a privilege to sp eak for this fa mily and this fami ly, we really know each other. We've been through a lot togethe r and this fami ly includes you. Vice Pre si dent Pence . Um so tom and I ha ve a pr esentation to make b ut I just wanted to um I just wanted to s ay a c ouple of thing s to yo u Mr Vice President. Lif e is winning in America be cause you an d th is president kept your promises f rom the very b eginning ev ery single da y. You kept ever y promise. In fact some say that you'v e kept more promis es than you even made, rig ht? I think M ark shor t says that' s a mathematical impossibility. And yet I s ay it's tr ue because we'v e been there every single da y w ith pau l teller with this team, with thi s Great Sec retary. Um and because of of that commitment and y our follow th rough, we are loo king at a sp ringtime for th e pro li fe movement a mo ment that I consider the third wave the part where we really win. And so the launch pad, of course, is what you ha ve managed t o do with this federal judi ciary. But four ye ars ago, um just l eading up to t he Ma rch for Life and righ t around the time of the inauguration, d ays after you invited um some of us an d righ t before the March, u m a lot of us here, a l ot o f us here couldn't get t here, but some of us were ther e and um and that's about t he time i n other ad ministrations that that we w ould get together and start to sort of handica p. Okay , these are the promises made. What percentag e do you think we ca n actu ally ge t done? And that' s a real conversation that has h ad more than once. Now, I'm not that old, but at l east a couple of time s. Um Now we b ecause of the because of who you are and this Pre sident is we didn't really neces sarily have th at convers ation. But I'l l be perfectly honest, we did okay, what can possibly get d one? Well, again , more than we even realized because wi th God's Grace an d the tim ing of the Supreme Court t his last nomination and the third Supr eme Court Justice, the conversati ons that we'r e having in this r oom right no w are quali tatively different th an any other s that we've eve r had in the pro life movement since the ve ry beginning. We are talking about a c ourt that will pos sibly allo w States to pass laws that reflect the will of the people of the S tates in which they live. And that means actual little boy s and girls inten ded for this world. Lives will be saved very soon. A nd and th at is because of your promises and the thing and what you've done. And we j ust thank you. It i s really po ignant to come full circle. Now, after al l those four yea rs where we didn't have to handicap, we didn't even really know um how beautifu l it would be. And to thank you from the bottom o f our hear ts, from this family to you and this beautiful administration um for the beginning that you have established and we'll look forward to marching on further with you. And with that we'll hand this over to the inimitable and s table uh tom McCluskey at the march for life. Thank you, Mar k, did I turn it o ff? T hank you marjori e. And one of these days I'l l learn never to follow marjorie when she' s sp eaking. It's kind of like when Jimi Hendrix opened up for the monkeys, nobody wants t o listen to the monkey, no matter how many there are. Af ter hearing Jimi Hen drix um bei ng in the p ro life movement. Uh It wo uldn't be appropriate if I didn't have a complaint to ma ke um in the list o f accomplishme nts that you handed out. And we do have it in this lett er for y ou is you left off the bi ggest one. Um policy mean s nothing if you don't have the pe rsonnel behind it. If you don' t have the personnel pushi ng for it and implementing it from, from ro ger Severino to paul teller, to Mark short, to jenny Lichte r to so many that I don't want to n ame them all becaus e they might hav e a hard ti me finding jobs afterward s. If I do. Um the biggest, the b iggest sign of a leade r Is the peopl e he surrounds hims elf with and the pow er he gives them to g et thin gs done and that's how Presi dent Tru mp has proven t o be a leader because in the summ er of 201 6 he picked one o f u s as Marjorie said one o f th e family to be his vice president and we cannot thank the two o f you enough for all you've done for life. This is truly your legacy go in g forward. That is now our job to carry on Um along, I'm sur e alongside with you still, h owever, we have a letter here um from so far, about 70 organizations fro m around the country, both on the federal and state level. An d we're accepting names still and and we'd like to give y ou a more polished copy when that is do ne. Just thanking that y ou and presi dent trump for all you've done for life. All you continue to do for life and to just embrace you in this time of Covid as one of our own. And just thank you so much. Thank you sir. Okay , thank you. Well, what a gift th at is . As we come to close out today, I 'll pass it back to the Vi ce President fo r his closing thoughts. But but I'm reminded of the beginning of this great country when a businessman, a teacher and a couple of students, also kno wn as George Wash ington thomas, jef ferson Jam es Madison. And john A dams got tog ether and decided uh to declare um what's most thought was impossible. And that was a n ew country and freedom in a countr y that is gu ided by sel f governance and by our God. And uh ordinary peo ple can do extrao rdinary thi ngs. And I'm not sure that that is more tru e or apt of a description than this g roup here today. So with that, I thank you all and I turn it over t o ou r extraordinary Vice President to close this out. Thank you. Okay. Mhm. What a special afternoon let me sa y thank you to marjo rie into tom thank you f or this . Uh this gener ous letter, I'll be wa lking it over to t he oval office right after we finish u p. I also want to I want to exp res s appreciation for all the incredible speake rs that y ou've heard from here. Tom I 'm probably mos t moved by y our well, you r las t comment that this is really about this is rea lly about a pr esi dent who bui lt a t eam of men and wom en wh o were committed to see his agenda throug h a t the heart of that agenda wa s the cause of lif e. And y ou heard from some of our our great leade rs here and join m e in thanking th e secretary and Bill and and this extraordinary prosecutor who's with us here today. Thank you Claire. Thank y ou for your great wo rk. And to all o f you have made time fo r this. Thank you f or giving us the o pportu nity simply to pay a debt of gratitude to e ach and ev ery one of y ou. But but I want to assure you and while we ha ve made great progre ss in th e cause of life a nd that the fight goes on and I promise yo u on behalf of the pres ident, first family, On behalf of my family, we're g oin g to stand with yo u every single day until the sa nctity of l ife is re stored to the center of american law. Thank you very much. God bless you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?507368-1/vice-president-pence-hosts-life-winning-event	Vice President Pence hosts a &ldquo;Life is Winning&rdquo; event in the South Court Auditorium.	507368-1	Speech		
CSPANMP17122020177	Mike Pence	2020-12-17	Vice President Pence Campaigns for U.S. Senate Candidates in Macon, Georgia	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage . Your former Gover nor of Geor gia, sonny P erdue. Ev eryone's watching everyone. Hello mi ddle Georgia . I was hoping for a warm er we lcome home. Thank yo u all you patriots for coming ou t here this morning. You're here fo r all the right reasons. And uh I just wa nna thank you for what you'r e doing to hold the lin e right. That's what we're gonna do. Yo u ready to win in dopa in january. That's what we're gon na do. We'v e got our senators here with us today and w e're honored to have our vice president back in Georgia. Once a gain I've b een traveling w ith our Ad commission er Gary black. He's quite a trip but he t ells h is s tory t hat I think we ought t o think a bout today. He said t hat in the history o f the country there was an occasion where Ben Fr anklin was meeting in D. C. A nd philadelph ia rather. And some one asked him mr fran klin hav e we formed a government ? He said yes we h ave. They s aid well is it a monarchy or republic? He said it is a republic. If we ca n keep it, are we gonna keep it? That's what this election is all abo ut keepin g the republi c and keeping the firewall that comes right here f rom Georgia will Georgia keep hel p save America. That's wh at you're here for today and that' s what we need to hear for. We've got two great senator s will do t hat. And uh my privilege today is introduc ed our first senat or from G eorgia here. Sen ator kelly Leffler . Let me tell you some pe ople talk about kelly being from a life of privilege. I me t her fath er, I met her brother in Illinois at a farm meeting up there and le t me just say the kin d of privilege that k elly Le ffler came from, She cam e from th e privilege of get ting u p before dark, like many farmers and f eeding the ca lves and feeding the hogs. She cam e from a life o f privilege of having to unconditional ly loving parents. T hat's what american privilege is a ll about. That's what we're fighting for next generation here fol ks, we 've got to do it. Yo u've got t o hold t he line. We've got to save America by winning Georgia and that's wha t's at stake. Thank y ou all for b eing out he re today. I know yo u're gonna do it now. Let's giv e a big warm mid dle Georgia. Welcome to S ena tor kelly Lefler. E veryone's wondered w hat giv ing up for k illi ng Macon. It is grea t to be with you all t oday. Thank you so much for com ing out. Thank you. T hank you for al l you're doing. You are great pa triots. We can not do thi s without you. You know, we ar e the, what do w e call, were the fi rewall to socialism because t his is th e battleground for the f uture of the country. T hat's what's at stake. I talked to folks across Americ a eve ry day. They say kelly is Georgia going to get thi s done and I say absolutely Georgia is gonna hold the line. We know we know y ou're gonna do that because you heard chuck schumer say, we're go nna take Georgi a and change America. Well , that's not gonna happen. Bu t you know what? T hey' ve got radical id eas and they ha ve radical agents of change. And you might hav e seen I did a debate la st week with radical liberal Raphael Warnock, That's right. You know, h e's anti police, he's anti milit ary, he's anti Israel and he ref uses to answer questi ons tha t the media r efuses to ask, what was his involve ment in a chi ld abuse inv estigation? Obs truction. What was his views on socialism and Marxism when he renounce d it? He refused to renounce s ocial ism and Mar xism. If we don't hold t he line in Georgia, we will see t h e first Marxist senator elec ted righ t here in this state . That's not right for us. We're gonn a that's r ight. But what I need y'all to do is to get out and vote . It's so importan t. If we vote, we wi ll win, we will save America . If we d on't vo te, we will lose the coun try. Amer ica is cou nting on us Georgi a. I kno w you 're gon na ge t the job done and I am so honored to be your U. S. Senator. If you're my voice on january 5th and hopefully before I will be your conservative voice in Washington for years to come. Now, I am so honored to introduce my great colleague Senator David. Perdue the original outsider. Everyone's watching everyone's smoking. Okay. Every get hello Macon, This is about the future directio n of our countr y. If you look at what his tory has to ld us soci alism, the price of so cialism is freedom. And what's at stake here right now is that demo crats want to perpetra te a socialist agenda in our coun try? We know t hat and what we're doing r ight now i n Georgia with these two seats i s holding the l ine. If we win G eorgia , we sav e America, right? You only h ave to listen, don't li sten to me. Listen to chuck, schumer chuck, schumer says, we change Americ a and then listen to wh at AOC says, Oh, we love AOC. Ri g ht? I offered to buy a train ticket to come down to Georgia. Come on down her e and talk to us about what she wants to d o. She said, we gotta have these two sea ts because we do not want to negotiate. the green new deal without compromise . We're not gonna let that ha ppen in Ge orgia and we're gonna save it for the rest of the country. Guys. The eyes of Americ a are on us. The y're expecting us t o hold the line right here in Georgia a nd we're go nna do that. rig ht. I have to remind you of what a great a merican told us t hree or fou r decades ago. He reminded us wh at's at stake at this m oment in ti me. He was speaking t o us right now when Ronald Reagan said that pass it down into the bloodstream. I t's got to be foug ht for protected and passe d on. Or one day in our s unset years we'll be s itting around tellin g our Children and our Children's Chil dren what it was once like in Am erica when wom en and men were fre e. I'm n ot overstating this. We lose these two seats button aoc a nd the rest of them will ch ange our co untry forever and we won't get it back. We're not gonna let it ha ppen because we know wh at's at stake here in Georgia, kelly an d I are fighti ng hard. The Vice presid ent's fighting hard President trum p is fighting hard to make su re that we maintain the majority in the Senat e, we're gonna win Georgia a nd save America . God bless you guys thank you. Now it's my high honor. I don' t. S he's in the it's my I s aid what i s baby maybe mayb e. What's your nam e, bab y no w, do n't you? Oka y now baby, let me tell you.

President Trump received m ore than 74 millio n votes across Am erica. 10 milli on. More than 2016. T he greatest share of minority vot es Of a Republi can president in 60 years.

I'm he re because I stand wit h President Donald trump and I' m here bec ause we stan d wit h Senator David Perd ue and Sena tor kelly Leffler To gether, we're fight ing for free an d fair ele ctions. And to gether we're fight ing t o hold th e line in th e Un ited States Senate. We're fi ghti ng to win Georg ia and save Ame rica for all we've d one for all we have yet to do president trump. And I need David Pe rdue and kelly Leffler bac k in a Republi can major ity in the United States Senate. Are you wit h me? We need Georgia to send these t wo great senators back to a majo rity in Washing ton becaus e of who they are, because o f all we've accomplished together . And because the Republica n Senate majority could b e the last line o f def ense to preserve all we'v e done to defend th is nation, revive ou r economy , pres erve the God given liberti es that we hol d dear. Tha t's wh y we need a A 4th Gene ration family farme r build our ow n company from the ground up broke barri ers in business in sp orts be come one of the most s uccessful business women in Georgia. And i n a short period of time, I ca n tell you, she's already emerged as on e of the most co urageous conserva tive voices on capi tol hill. We need senator kelly Loeffler back in Washingt on, D . C. That's also why we need a s on of making who worked his way to the top of t he busin ess world. He s pent 40 years as one of t he most success ful bus iness leaders in America thro ugh pray er and reflection . He and his famil y felt the c all to serve. They steppe d up to serve th e great state of Georgia. And I can tell you ha ving seen him wh en the cameras are o ff, President trump and o ur administration have no grea ter champion of the mega agenda in Washi ngton D. C . Than Se nator Davi d Perdue. So pr esident trump and I need you to support your se nator's ree lection because of wh o they are, but also sup port them beca use of everything tha t we've been abl e to do together for the state of Georgia and for America. Let me thi nk about it. Four years ago we inherite d a military that had been hollowed out by r ec kless budget cuts, an economy stru ggling to b reak out of the worst re covery since the gre at Depress ion. Terrorism was o n the rise and we wi tnesse d a steady assault on our most cherished values. But with the strong and stead y support of your t wo s enators und er preside nt donald trump, we rebuild our mi litary. We revived ou r economy. We secure d our border, stood with law enforceme nt and fought for life and li berty and the const itution of the United States of America. You know, I'm yo ur vice pres ident. But the highes t title I' ll ever hold is D. A. D. Couldn't be I couldn't be more grateful as vi ce president, bu t also as the father of the Uni ted States Mari ne and f ather in law of a navy pilot to serv e alongside a president who care s so deeply about our armed forc es a nd with the strong s upport. Senator David Perdue on the Armed s ervices Commi ttee . We've signed the largest increases in our national defense si nce the days of Ron ald Reagan were given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, mari nes and Coast Gua rd the sup port they need to defend our nati on. Thank you Senator. Yea h. You know the las t admini stra tion also saw years of scandal at the V. A. Remember shocked th e conscience of the nation when pre sident trump came into offic e with the help o f your two senat ors. Those days are over from h er seat o n the Veterans Af fairs C ommittee, Senato r kelly Leffler was there Supporting ou r veterans every step of the way we signed the most sweeping reforms. In 50 years we fired 50 00 via employ ees that weren't giv en our veterans the care they de serve and ve terans choice is now av ailable for every veteran in America. Tha nk you senator Laffer. and after the slowest reco very i n 75 years, presid ent trump re vived o ur economy with the support of G eorgia, Senators, we cut taxes across t he board. We rolled back regulations at a record level. We fought for free a nd fair trade unleashe d american energy And in three short years We saw American bus inesse s create seven million good paying jobs inc luding 350 ,000 jobs right here in the Pe ach state. A nd your senat ors were there every step of the way It was a bl ue collar boom in those 1st 3 years in Georgia and all a cros s America. A nd then the coronaviru s pandemic struck fr om china with t he support of these leaders and the le adership of our presiden t, we launched the largest national mobili zatio n since World w ar two. We reinve nted testi ng. We saw the deliver y of billions of medical suppl ies. We secure d trilli ons o f dollars in suppor t for families and busine sses to make the ir way thr ough this difficult time. An d we've deve loped new me dicines t hat are saving lives every day. It' s amazing to t hink at the height of this p andemic, we lost 22 mi llion American jobs. But be cause of the s trong f oun dation that we p oured with this preside nt and G eorgia's senators, We've a lready seen 12 mi llion Americans go back to wo rk, we're o pening up Americ a again, maybe most of all in this season of hop e. While the other side said it couldn 't be done by the end o f the year. This week, the amer ican people witnessed p romises made and prom ises kept under operation warp speed. We mad e history th is week with the first coronavirus vaccine for the amer ican people and it's being a dmin istered all across the c ountry and David Per due and kelly Lefler were there eve ry step of th e way throughout this chal lenging year. And we couldn't be more great. And finally, whe n it comes to the rule of law and our most cherished li berties. I couldn't be more proud to r eport to you that with their suppor t in t his president's lea ders hip. We've a lready seen mo re than 220 co nserv atives appointed to our federa l court s at every level an d they are all principl ed men and women who will uphold the God given li berties in our constitution lik e the freedom of rel igion, t he freedom of speech an d the Second Ame ndment right to keep and bear arms and remember the president n ominates to the federal courts but it's the se nators that con firm so none of that would have been possi ble without the strong and c onsistent sup port of Senator Dav id Pe rdue and senator kelly left . In fact G eorgia senators were ther e when we c onfir med three justice s to the Supreme Court i ncluding justice Neil Gorsuch, justice Brett Ka vanaugh and Justice. Am y coney Barr ett get onto the last administratio n. You all rememb er our values and our fre edoms were unde r steady assault . The last adm inistration trampled o n the religious libert y of americans on a regular basis c ompromise t he c onscience rights of doc tors and nurses and r eligious charit y. They even haule d a group of nuns know n as t he little sisters of the poo r into federal c ourt to order th em to compro mise their faith to live under the standards of Obamacar e. And we saw that religious i ntolerance among demo cra ts. Just a c ouple of years ago when Amy coney Ba rrett was go ing before the Judiciary Commit tee. You remembe r the democr at leader of that co mmittee actual ly said she was concerned about Amy coney Barrett's christia n fa ith because she said quote the dogma l ives loudly within you a nd Hollywood liber als have been att ack ing Amy coney Barr ett eve r s ince.

And t heir frien ds in Hollywood that d ogma lives l oud ly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the rig ht to live and wors hip according to the dictates of our faith. L ives loudly in the constit ution of the U nited States of America. So for our liberties, for our freedoms, we need Senator David Pe rdue and Senat or kelly Lefler back in the United State s Senate, you know, I thin k you all know especia lly the ha rdy bunch gather ed out here today.

ARE YOU WITH ME? WE NEED GEORGIA TO SEND THESE TWO IS GREAT SENATORS BACK TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE, BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER. AND BECAUSE A REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY COULD BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE TO PRESERVE ALL THAT WE'VE DONE FOR THIS COUNTRY, TO REVIVE OUR ECONOMY AND PRESERVE ALL THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES WE HOLD DEAR. JUST GOING TO TAKE TWO OF THEM. STARTING WITH THE FOURTH GENERATION, A GAL THAT GREW UP ON A FAMILY FARM TO THE HEARTLAND, SHE GOT HERE TO GEORGIA AS SOON AS SHE HEARD ABOUT IT. BUILT UP HER OWN COMPANY. BROKE BARRIERS TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMEN IN GEORGIA AND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, SHE HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONSERVATIVE VOICES ON CAPITOL HILL. WE NEED SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK. IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND THEN THERE'S SENATOR MACON WHO LITERALLY WORKED HIS WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS WORLD. HE COULD HAVE RETIRED AND RELAXED BUT HE FELT A CALLING TO SERVE GEORGIA. LITERALLY HE SPENT 40 YEARS AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADERS, NOT JUST IN THIS STATE, BUT IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT HE STEPPED FORWARD. AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, IN HIS SHORT TERM IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, HE'S EMERGED AS A MAN OF INTEGRITY, MAN WHO'S FOUGHT EVERY DAY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES THAT MAKE GEORGIA GREAT. WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE BACK IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DAVID! DAVID! DAVID! VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: SO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I SUPPORT YOUR TWO SENATORS BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. BUT WE ALSO ARE HERE JUST LIKE YOU ARE, BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE DID TOGETHER. SERVING TOGETHER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS. AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE. AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, JUST INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. BEING HERE, HOME TO FORT BENNING , I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU, WITH THESE SENATORS' STRONG SUPPORT, WE'VE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES AND COAST GUARDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. IT'S TRUE. AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, SENATOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A. YOU REMEMBER. SCANDAL THAT SHOCKED THE COP SHENS OF THE NATION , CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS. WE FIRED 5,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WEREN'T GIVING OUR VETERANS THE CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN SOME 75 YEARS, WITH THE SUPPORT OF GEORGIA SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE CUT TAXES. WE ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS, INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEA STATE. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, WE HAD A BLUE COLLAR BOOM GOING. THEN THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED AND WITH THEIR SUPPORT EVERY DAY, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE REINVENTED TESTING, WE SAW TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO HOSPITALS AND NURSES. WE PROVIDED SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IMPACTED. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK, AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, WITH THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND WHILE THE OTHER SIDE SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THIS WEEK AMERICA WITNESSED THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. WE MADE HISTORY AND THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IS BEING ADMINISTERED IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WERE THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY PUTTING THE HEALTH OF GEORGIA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE WITH A PRESIDENT AND TO STAND WITH TWO SENATORS WHO HAVE HELPED US APPOINT MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS. [APPLAUSE] AND THEY'RE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CONSIST SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. IT WAS GEORGIA'S SENATORS WHO WERE THERE. ALL ALONG THE WAY. WHEN WE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 200 JUDGES, AND WHEN WE CONFIRMED THREE JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU REMEMBER UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, OUR VALUES AND OUR FREEDOMS WERE UNDER REGULAR ASSAULT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES OF AMERICANS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THEY COMPROMISED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF NUNS KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH, TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR HER FIRST SEAT ON THE COURT OF APPEALS. YOU REMEMBER IT? THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE BARRETT EVER SINCE. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO FOR OUR LIBERTIES, FOR OUR FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO CUT OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. YOU JUST WATCH. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER CUT TAXES, THE OTHERS WANT TO RAISE TAXES. ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HERE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, WARNOCK IS ON TAPE CALLING MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE GANGSTERS JUST FOR VOTING TO CUT TAXES ON FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES IN THE PEACH STATE. AND WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, I MEAN, RADICAL LIBERAL WARNOCK ALONE HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY. HE'S REPEATEDLY DEFENDED THE ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC OF REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT. IN FACT, RAFAEL WARNOCK CALLED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, THE STRONG DEMOCRATIC JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL, AN APARTHEID STATE. AND HE COMPARED THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EAST GERMAN STORM TROOPERS. WELL, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE TO SERVE ALONGSIDE OF A PRESIDENT WHO MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. AND HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHERE JOHN AND WARNOCK SUPPORT ABORTION ON-DEMAND, AND TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID PURDUE , PERDUE, KELLY LOEFFLER, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID IT THE OTHER DAY. COULDN'T BE CLEARER. HE SAID, NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. WELL, LET'S SEND A MESSAGE TO CHUCK SCHUMER AND THOSE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA, WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THE SENATE, THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I SAW JOE BIDEN WAS IN ATLANTA JUST THE OTHER DAY. HE SAID THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO SEND KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE BACK TO WASHINGTON. BECAUSE HE SAID WE DON'T NEED TWO SENATORS THAT ARE, QUOTE, JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY OF HIGHER TAXES!

The two senators both faced runoffs against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Reverend Rafael Warnock after none of the candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote in the 2020 election. Senators Perdue and Loeffler talked about the importance of the election, which could decide which party controls the Senate in the 117th Congress. While Vice President Pence expressed support for President Trump&rsquo;s continued legal battle to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, the vice president spoke of the Georgia Senate races as a chance for Republicans to &ldquo;hold the line&rdquo; against President-elect Joe Biden.	507397-1	Speech		
CSPANMP18122020180	Mike Pence	2020-12-18	Vice President Pence Remarks on Space Force Anniversary	Yeah . Since the da wn of the space a ge, the United S tates has long unde rstood that access to space and freedom to maneuv er in space underwrite s our economy, our passion for science and explorati on. Inte rnational s ecurity, recognizing that this vital national interest could no lo nger be ta ken for granted . The United States elevated space i nside the Department of De fense to A level commensurate with its impor tance to our natio n. Just a y ear ago on 20 December 20 19 at a hangar at A ndrews A ir Force Base, the president signe d in to law the Nationa l Defense a uthorization Act, wh ich is the birth certificate of the United States Space Force. And what wha t a first ye ar it has be en. The men and women of the Space Forc e have written an imp ressive, Very impre ssive 1st chapter of o ur history and I couldn't be more pr oud o f them. So o n behalf of all of the spa ce profession als in the United S tates Space For ce, I want to thank Preside nt tr ump Vice Pre sid ent Pence and Congress f or establish ing this force i n every se ctor of space. Amer ica is leading and because of t hat our nation is mor e secure. Yeah . Special thank s to Vice President P ence for hosting the tod ay's c eremony sir. We can't thank you enough. I also want t o thank Secretary Mille r. Secretary Barrett. Gener al Milley, General h eighten for your trust and confidence and for the pr ivilege. The absolute priv ilege of ser ving alongside the men and women of the Unite d States Space Fo rce. Each american Armed service traces it s origin to a critical moment in our nation's history. O ur Army, Navy and Marine Corps were e stablished in the cruc ible of America's Revolutionary War. The Air force became an independent servic e after the allied victory in World War two. As Am erica steeled i tself for a new Cold War and with the reemergence of gr eat power competition in all domains, the nat ion establishe d the United States space force. Whi le each services cultur e and mi ssion are distinct. W hat is c ommon between us is the war fighting spirit and c ommitment to victory embraced by America's t reasure. It's all voluntee r for ce. The members of t he space f orce are no dif feren t. We come to work every day focused on the gre at responsi bility we've been giv en to c ustom build this force to compete deter and to win. That r equires the boldness of kernels , Casey beard and Chr istopher Nang le who led a team th at built the firs t space force doctrin e. The in first indepen dent space power doctrine. It require s the agility and innovation d emonstrated by senior airman bailey bork who wro te a new piece of sof tware at Vandenberg Air Force Base and embedded that s oftware o n the ops fl oor, improving o ur ability to have space d omain awareness. And it's th e commitment to victory displayed by Cap tain Tasia Re ad and Lieute nant Christiana Cas taneda whos e mission plannin g ensured the successful detection of Iranian missiles and prese rve the li ves of US personne l and our partner force s in Iraq. I have complete trust a nd conf idence in the for ce that we 've built. I know they will deliver on th e solemn promise w e've made to pr otect and defend t his nation against all enemies forei gn and domes tic with a war f ighting spirit an d our Touch stone traits of agil ity, i nnovation and boldnes s. On the occasion of ou r first birthd ay, I thank you all for your visionary lea dership and yo ur endur ing support. W e have m ade history to ge ther. And looking back, I'm confident we will stand in awe of our efforts to en sure the Un ited States Space F orce and the United States is always above. Happy first bir thday in s emper supra mm Lad ies and gentlemen, it is m y distinct honor to introduce our Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, you know, this has been a pretty easy job when you have a Secretary of the Air Force that cares so much about what you do and has made the number one priority of the Department of the Air Force, the establishment of the Space Force, ma'am. Thank you for your passion and for your leadership. Thank you. General Raymond , What a pleasu re it is to be a part of a team h ea ded by the leadership of General jay Raymond call him Hap Raymond, bu t it's a it's an Air Force thing, you kno w, for m illennia, humanity has tu rned its gaze to the stars for inspira tion. Today we cele brate t he nation 's newest ser vice dedicate d to prot ecting free and o pen access to the ultima te high ground for all ben evolent actors, wi th the leadership of Preside nt trump the coordination , cooperation with Co ngr ess on bipar tisan and b ipartisan effor t. The cle ar vision of a serv ice was established to protect the american way of life and it was lau nched under the name of the United States Spa ce Force. No one has be en a better champion of tha t e ffort that our Vice preside nt mike pence, you know all but two of the Uni ted States mi lita ry service s were est ablished whe n George Washington was president. Then technology opened two new d omains. Yesterday we celebrated t he first f light, By e Wilbur and Orville Wright, a fligh t that laid the cornersto ne for the US Ai r Force. And today we celeb rate the protection o f space assets by the new U. S. Space Force. In its first year, you might ha ve ex pected a Space F orce to bui ld a new headquarters leadership team Ma ybe to publish planning guidance m aybe to transfer 2500 airmen from t he United States A ir Forc e into the sp ace force and ma ybe y ou mig ht have thought that they woul d be abl e to establish a force multiplier program to generate a d igi tally fluent spa ce force. The Spa ce force in fac t did all of that. But because of the bold lea dership of J Raymo nd and his tea m, the Space Force also detected incomin g missiles in I raq five days after the eli minat ion of Soleimani a nd and ultimate ly saved a gre at number of americ an lives. The Unite d States Space Force compl eted its firs t national Se curity space l aunch. It conducted sp ace war games with five e yes partners as well as Fr ance and G ermany. The Space Force antici pated in ternati onal space station colli sion ris k with space spa ce debris and the I. S. S. m aneuver. To avoid that risk ensurin g th e safety of ou r astronauts a nd the space station . And for the first time in nearly a decade the United S tates Spac e For ce supp orted the l aunch of american astronauts from american soil on an a merican space capsule. And so wh y does this matte r what matters? Because every da y almost ev ery american uses s pace often without knowing it . Space control s our wate r, ou r po wer and our banking. Space p owers are inform ation , navigat ion and commu nication systems. Wheth er you're a n ea stern urbanit e or a midwestern farm er or a hiker in the high Si erras, you'r e probably using s pace s pace must the refore be pro tected for al l benevol ent actors. To day we salute the vision of the Un ited States Spac e Force because that vision and the l eadersh ip of the United States Space Force is d efending the ul timate h igh ground for our na tion semper supra. An d now let me introduce and um invite you to welcome the secretary, the acting Secretary of Defense chris miller who draws on myriad experiences both in counterterrorism and in special operations to offer unique insights into the space domain. Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Miller, don't tell anybody m y only dre am when I was grow ing up was to joi n the Air Force and become an as tro naut and clearly m y parents cur sed me wi th bad genes and I had to get these thing s disqualify ing m e but today I'm I had to end up going i nto the army and bein g a ground pounder. But today you'll notice I'm wearin g my Air Fo rce socks do not tell any one in the arm y . They'll think I' m a heretic. I h ope ther e's not an ethics violat ion here, bu t I'm ready for so me Space force soc ks. Whenever they come out, we'll make sure they get routed. just just sayin g wh at an incredi ble da y I'm humbled and beyo nd words t o be able to be par t of this. Secretar y. Barrett. Vice Cha irman, Heighten Gener al Raymond family w elcome. What a d ay. What an historic day. Many ot her leader s her e tod ay. All ar ound here. Thank you . Tha nk you for you r vision, vital role he playe d in s tanding up. The Space Force sounds cliche at this point . Follow ing these great le aders. Very special. Thanks to President trump Vic e President Pence as well. T hey spe arheaded thi s effort truly an h istoric effo rt. Sixth Branch of the United States Armed Fo r ces one year ago. Today. You kn ow, when I was a kid, I told you whe n somebody would go, w hat do you w ant to be w hen you grow up? I was, I grew up in t he 70s, what did you say? I want to b e an astronaut. My so n's 19. He grew up in the two thousands. And when I'd a sk him, you kn ow, hey, what do you want to be when you gr ow up? I get all sorts of wacky stuff about. I want to be a b aseball pla yer lacrosse pla yer, you k now, broke my hea rt, you know , because that's where our co untry had come t o with our, our s pace in the Spac e domain. And you k now, because o f you all our sons and o ur daughte rs now when they're asked, what d o you want to be when you gr ow up? Gue ss what they're go nna say again, astronaut. This administration's bold decision To create the first news service in over 70 years. I love that. Happy, heck Tha t what a grea t, what a great descripti on. And you know, to talk about the historic legacy goi ng back the half Ra ymond, you know, I know you're just not in your head. That's no t, but that's rea lly so telling An d s o rema rkable. And first, y ou know, service in 70 year s, you know, it really m arked a n important step forward in deterring the thr eats posed b y our strategic competitors, one s that extend beyond traditional war fighting d omains. I t was necessary to step in this area. It was it was a n ecessary step in this area of great power competition tha t we're in. Now mar ked by revisionist po wers fielding new weapo ns th at put our satellite s in space based systems at risk. It was a rec ognition o f the import ance of securing freed om of operation in what is now a highly contested environment. Space the motto of semper supr a. Our men and women in un iform have alread y taken the Spa ce force to ne w hei ghts in an incre dibly short time. General Raymond noted publishing the serv ices first space Power doctrine earlier this yea r and establishing Spac e Operations Com mand To comm ission 86 graduates, 86 graduates came out of the Air Force Aca demy this ye ar and launch ing t heir careers int o the Space Fo rce Secretary talked about watchi ng the servic e's first satellite int o orbit as well. And j ust last week, the first gr oup of di rectly enlisted space professionals celebrat ed their graduation from basic m ilitary tra ining. One of the absolu te joys I've ha d in t his job is si gning commissioning recomme ndations, mo ving officers fr om the United States A ir Force Space Force . You know, again, th at was just humbling , humbling eve nt as our strategic competito rs weapo nized the space domain through the deve lopment antisatell ite missiles, dire cted energy weapons and o ther counter sp ace tech nologies. Our personnel will l ead the way in preserving free dom of use, co mmerce and navi gation into and through sp ace for all , much like space, much like Na sa pion eered a new genera tion of technologies i n the 20th centur y. Our space professional s will be the ones fosteri ng cutting ed ge innovation that wi ll protect our advantages ac ross every do main in the de cades ah ead and they w ill be the on es to ensure that th e U nited States is ready to defend our assets in space, to stand up for freedom of navigation in the shared domain and ultim ately to win any fut ure conflict. The great strides made b y the Space force have been made possible thanks to the bipartisan support of Congr ess, the hard work of our serv ice member s that was highlig hted earlier civili ans. And let's n ot forget our contra cted workforce, which is trul y one of ou r competitive advantages and t he leadership of General Raymond, both as commander of U. S. Sp ace Command and as the fir st Chief of Space ope rations. Kin d of a great title jus t saying additionally, we are incre dibly grateful to t he Vice President for his lea dership of the Nat ional Space Council. That's game, that's game changing. Get ting that thin g g oing aga in. Vice Preside nt and your lea dership of that was transforma tive and n one of t his would h ave happened without you. Uh just leaning in on this and jus t pushing s o hard his a dvocacy on behalf of our a rm ed forces. And I see most p eople don't see this regularly. I see it all the time. Th e leadership of the Vic e President, his car e and his compassion for our men a nd women in uniform and th eir families is remarkable. Uh your advocacy on behalf of our armed forces and a new generation of space professionals continues to make us stronger, safer and more secure as we maintain american superiority in the ultimate high ground.

It w ill be one year s ince Preside nt Donald trump Sign ed into law th e first new branch of our armed forces in more than 70 years. That historic moment was the culmination of an effort that began from the early days of this administration. From almost the first moment that the president, I spoke about space when we were campaigning for these jobs. He had a dual focus of renewing american leadership in human space exploration but also ensuring that America remained as dominant in space as we are in land and air and sea. And from the first day of this administratio n. President tr ump called forth Steps to renew A merican leadership i n space. It would be i n Jun e of 2018. The Pre sident first laid out a visi on that called for the c reation of a ne w military ser vice focused solely on thre ats in and from space. The idea th ough, and its con cep tion was not a new one. For m ore than 50 years, presidents and military leaders had di scussed the branch of our mi litary dedicated to ensuring american national secur ity in and fr om space. Bu t time and again thos e effor ts faltered, but I would submit to you that it is a tri bute to the leadership of our commander in chief . A tribute to th e extraordinar y military lead ership gathere d h ere to day. That this time with bip artisan s upport in just 1.5 years, the Unit ed States Space For ce was born. And sin ce that historic mo ment, th e United States Space Force has only grown stronger by the day and tha t means that America has gr own more secur e. By the day afte r the Space Force beca me law, the president's first decisio n was who woul d lead it and the President, I get the sense i n the room ther e is broad agreement th at he got that decision right too. He cho se a man, he chose a man w ho you've heard from thes e podiums alr eady is considere d to be the half Arnold of our time, He would become the Chief of Spa ce Operat ions of the United Stat es Space F orce. And I can tell you h aving witne ssed his le adership firsthand th at when Genera l jay Ray mo nd step forward. Uh i t brought the leadership, the energy, the v ision, the professiona lism and the patriotis m necessar y to have thi s historic y ear for the United Stat es Space Fo rce. So joi n me in thanking General J ay Raymond, his wond erfu l wife moll y and his proud son Ga ry for all of thei r commitment to America. Ye ah, fine , thank you. Gene ral Good job. It's amazing t o think that t his sprin g, General Raymo nd actually welc omed the f irst enlisted member to the Space Force. So how about a r ound of applause fo r Chie f M aster Sergeant Rog er Doberman, you can stand up. Come on stand up, thank you. Th ank you. Chie f in april those tw o men were literally the entire Uni ted Stat es Space Force, but in just eight mont hs We already have more t han 2000 mi litary members. Spa ce pr ofessio nals In the U nited States Space Fo rce. And I'm told that a n additional 36 00 officers and enlis ted airmen have a lready star ted to fill out the pap erwork to transfe r int o the Space for ce fact, Gener al Raym ond tells us that we anticipate on ou r current trajectory. The spa ce force will h ave nearly 6000 spa ce professionals serving all across the globe in j ust a s hort period of t ime. In fac t, today, the Spa ce Force got its ne west and perhaps most f amous m embe r, a man who is actually in space right now a t the int ernational space stati on. General Raymond took care of the paperwork uh, and I th ink it m ight actually be the first in orbit tran sfer in military history. C olonel Michael Hop kins Nasa ast ronaut a nd memb er of the United St ates Space Force, Y ou know, here is like him and like all of you are gonna inspir e generations of american s. In fact, S ecretary Bar bara Barrett and I witnesse d some of those young americ ans st eppin g forw ard at a in colorado s prings. We both had the opportu nity to address th e 62nd graduatio n of the United States Air Force Academy. Wh en I was there, they told me in a typical ye ar about 20 cadets choose to go int o space operations. This year. I was there when 86 cadets stoo d up and took the oath a s officers in the United States S pace Force. Okay. Mhm. Okay. And j ust to continue to b uild on the mo mentum I'm proud to re port to the s enator and these members of Co ngress and all thos e looking on that. It was my honor w as Secr etary Barrett at my side and Ge neral Raymond a s wel l that we m ade it of ficial. We travel ed to f lorida to announce the first t wo Space force install ations in americ an history, Cape Canaveral Space F orce station and Patri ck Spac e Force B ase. And the Space force is growing st rong er every day and jus t in the nick of time, I think eve ryone of the milit ary leader s here knows that space is a vacuum but we're n ot operating in a vac uum. The space race began in the 1950s and it continues today and in Pres ident donald trump we have a commander in chi ef who's unde rstood clearly th at s pace is a war figh ting domain. It 's impera tive that we in vest the resources and the personnel and the technology to defen d our nation and defend ou r values in the outer reache s of space. In fact, the United States, as you've heard alre ad y faces emerging threats i n spa ce for countries like china and Russia and those threats are o nly growing. We're reminded of that just t his week when Russia c onducted yet another anti satel lite mis sile launc h. We're leading in space. But ou r determ ination under this presiden t and with his extraordinary military leadership is to s tay in the lead t o defend America and defen d our freedom from space. We see k peace through strengt h and I w ant to say to the men and women of the United Sta tes Space Force when it comes to the outer reaches of sp ace, you are that streng th. So today we cel ebrate lead ership from our President, the great bipartisan sup port in the Congress and t he militar y lea dership t hat is seen t o both the birth and the pou ring of the first y ear's foundatio n of the United Stat es Space Force. And I jus t came here today to thank each and e very one of you but al so to make another ann ouncement . As I mentioned, we just retur ned from the oval office. A nd s o it is m y honor on behalf of the President of t he United State s t o a nnounce that henceforth the men and women of the United States Spa ce Force will be known as guardians, right soldier s, sailors, airmen, marines and guardians. We'll be defending our nation for ge neration s to come. So with that a nnouncement, l et me just say th ank you again. I want to t hank the the membe rs of Congress who are with us today. Thank you for the honor of you r presence. But more important ly, thank you, thank you for your leadershi p in bringing us to this moment one year ago and the suppo rt that you've cont inued to provide, I s ucceeded the l aunch of this n ew branch of our armed forces. But on behalf of your commande r in chief, let me urge eac h and every one of you guardi ans to keep pushin g, keep pushing, keep pu shing the vis ion and the missi on of the United Stat es Space Force, whi ch is to ensu re t hat America rema ins as dominant in sp ace and from space as we are on land and sea and ai r and e ach one o f you guardi ans, let m e just s ay each and ev ery day from this day forward, I wa nt t o assure you that you w ill serve with c onfidence of your com mander chief. You will s erve wit h confid ence and gratitude o f the americ an people And I'm also convinced tha t those of you tha t will serve in the United State s space Force in this gener ation and gener ation s to come. We'l l also g o with the prayers, millions of americans who will claim that ancient verse that promises that if you rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea, even if you go up to the heavens that there his hand will guide you and his right hand will hold you fast. That then will be our prayer for our guardians in this generation and for generations to come. So happy birthday to the United States Space Force. God bless our guardians. God bless all the members of our armed forces and God bless America semper. Super. Mhm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Huh? So much. Yeah.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?507424-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-space-force-anniversary	Vice President Mike Pence hosted a one-year anniversary celebration for the U.S. Space Force.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND ALL WE'VE DONE, AND STAY IN THE FIGHT FROM THIS STUDENT ACTION SUMMIT AND EVERY DAY FORWARD TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [APPLAUSE] IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP. AGAINST UNRELENTING RESISTANCE AND ATTACKS FROM THE DEMOCRATS, THE RADICAL LEFT, AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE MEDIA. [CROWD BOOING] WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS, AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE WORST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE, AND WE WITNESSED A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH YOUR SUPPORT, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE REVIVED THIS ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S AN HONOR TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, BUT THE HIGHEST TITLE I'LL EVER HOLD IS D-A-D. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND SPACE FORCE THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVE TO DEFEND THIS NATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUE. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE'VE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND WE'VE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE TOOK THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND TOOK OUT THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, AN IRANIAN GENERAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS WAS IN OUR SITES, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK ACTION, AND QASEM SOLEIMANI IS GONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! SO WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND STAY STRONG ON THE WORLD. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WE ROLLBACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE. FAIR TRADE AND UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY. IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO TO THE DAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN HISTORY. THE RESULT, IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. WAGES ROSE AT THEIR FASTEST PACE IN 10 YEARS. AND THEY ROSE MOST RAPIDLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC AMERICANS, THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. AFTER OUR FIRST THREE YEARS IN OFFICE, MOST AMERICANS , MORE AMERICANS WERE WORKING THAN EVER BEFORE. THEN 2020 ARRIVED. AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK FROM CHINA. AND UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, AMERICA RESPONDED. WE LOST THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION. WE REINVENTED TESTING FROM A START. WE SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT HOSPITALS ALL ACROSS THE LAND SECURED DIRECT SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKING FAMILIES THAT HAVE SAVED . , THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, 22 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION THIS PRESIDENT PUT FORTH. BECAUSE OF UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES, WE HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND HEARTBREAK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE. AND TODAY, WE HAVE NOT ONE, BUT TWO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES BEING ADMINISTERED ALL ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] SOME SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, BUT IN THIS SEASON OF HOPE, HOPE IS ON THE WAY. AND THANKS TO YOUR PRESIDENT AND INCREDIBLE AMERICAN INGENUITY UNDER OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE HAVE COME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. IT'S A MEDICAL MIRACLE, AND A PROMISE MADE, AND A PROMISE KEPT. SO WE'RE HEALING AMERICA, AND ALL ALONG THE WAY, LIKE ALL OF YOU, WE'VE BEEN DEFENDING FREEDOM. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO TELL YOU, AS OF TODAY, THIS PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SEEN APPOINTED MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD ALL THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND THAT INCLUDES JUSTICE, NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE, AMY CONEY BARRETT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. VICE PRES. PENCE: ISN'T SHE GREAT? ISN'T SHE GREAT? DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT IN THAT HEARING, THEY SAID TO HER, THEY SAID, ""WHAT DO YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU THERE?"" AND SHE SAID, ""NOTHING."" RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] AND THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE, BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS BEFORE WE TOOK OFFICE, UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, YOU REMEMBER IT, WE SAW A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR VALUES AND ON OUR FREEDOMS. [CROWD BOOING] THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF AMERICANS, VIOLATED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, AND NURSES, AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO ORDER THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE STANDARDS OF OBAMACARE. [CROWD BOOING] IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WRIT LARGE WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR A COURT OF APPEALS POST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. YOU REMEMBER? THE NUMBER ONE DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. IN FACT, SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, BECAUSE, ""THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU."" [CROWD BOOING] AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING AMY CONEY BARRETT FOR HER CHRISTIAN FAITH EVER SINCE EVERYTHING. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY THESE COURT APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. IT'S ALSO WHY THAT GEORGIA RACE, LOEFFLER AND PERDUE, ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU, WE'VE DEFENDED OUR FIRST FREEDOM, THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, BUT WE'VE ALSO STOOD STRONG FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JUSTICE ALITO GAVE A SPEECH A LITTLE WHILE BACK TO THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. YOU OUGHT TO CHECK IT OUT. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, ""WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO PREVENT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH FROM BECOMING A SECOND-TIER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT."" [APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE'VE DONE. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, WE'VE GONE INTO FEDERAL COURT TO DEFEND THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES IN AMERICA. AND THIS PRESIDENT SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO TIE RESEARCH GRANTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. T.P., USA, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. GOT TO STAND UP. [APPLAUSE] SO THE PRESIDENT HAS STOOD STRONG OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS, AND THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND MAYBE MOST OF ALL, TO ME. WE LOVE YOU, MIKE. VICE PRES. PENCE: I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUE. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. VICE PRES. PENCE: SO I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. SO FOR ALL WE'VE DONE, FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, STAY IN THE FIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STAY IN THE FIGHT IN OUR ELECTION. STAY IN THE FIGHT IN GEORGIA'S ELECTION, AND STAY IN THE FIGHT EVERY DAY THAT FOLLOWS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. VICE PRES. PENCE: WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, TO BE A CHECK ON WHAT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WANT TO DO, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO UNDO. ALL THAT WE'VE DONE. OUR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN GREATNESS. THEIR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN DECLINE. [CROWD BOOING] WHERE WE CUT TAXES, ROLL BACK REGULATION AND ADVANCED FREEDOM, THEIR AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, A GREEN NEW DEAL, AND ABORTION ON DEMAND. [CROWD BOOING] THEY WANT TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR, AND POOR PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE. WE HAVE FOUGHT TO MAKE EVERY AMERICAN RICHER, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN AMERICA ROSE BY THE LARGEST AMOUNT EVER RECORDED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. SO MEN AND WOMEN OF T.P., USA, YOU STAY IN THE FIGHT. TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED. THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE COUNTING ON ALL OF YOU. WE NEED YOUR VOICES. WE GOT YOUR BACK. VICE PRES. PENCE: WE NEED THIS ENERGY. AND WE NEED YOUR VISION. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. BECAUSE THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM NEVER ENDS. MY SECOND FAVORITE PRESIDENT USED TO SAY, ""FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTINCTION."" [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT LOOKING OUT AT THE ENTHUSIASM REPRESENTED HERE, IN THIS GENERATION, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS GENERATION FOR FREEDOM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TODAY, DEMOCRATS OPENLY ADVOCATE AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT HAS IMPOVERISHED MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. [CROWD BOOING] UNDER THE GUISE OF MEDICARE FOR ALL AND A GREEN NEW DEAL, DEMOCRATS ARE EMBRACING THE SAME TIRED ECONOMIC THEORIES THAT HAVE IMPOVERISHED NATIONS AND STIFLED THE LIBERTIES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE PAST CENTURY. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE MOST PROSPEROUS ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT ENDED SLAVERY, WON TWO WORLD WARS, AND STANDS TODAY AS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR ALL THE WORLD. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT'S MOVING US BEYOND THE PREJUDICES OF THE PAST TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, AND EXTEND THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO EVERY AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. IT'S FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU HERE AT TPUS UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE, THE CLEANEST ENVIRONMENT ON EARTH, HAS IMPROVED THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. AND SO, I CHALLENGE YOU, IN THIS GENERATION, ON THIS DAY AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE. THAT AMERICA WILL BE A LAND OF FREEDOM, AND AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY WITH THIS RISING GENERATION OF CONSERVATIVE LEADERS. YOU ARE AN IMPRESSIVE SITE. , SIGHT. AND I CAME HERE TODAY TO THANK YOU AND TO CHALLENGE YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. THREE YEARS AGO, IN POLAND, PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED, AND I QUOTE, ""THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WESTQUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WEST HAS THE WILL TO SURVIVE. AND AS WE GATHER HERE TODAY, WE ASK OURSELVES THE VERY SAME QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR IDEALS AND VALUES TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST OPPOSITION AND RESISTANCE AND CRITICISM AND RIDICULE? DO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM? I KNOW YOU DO. IT IS CLEAR TO ME I'M NOT JUST LOOKING AT LEADERS OF A GENERATION OR THE FUTURE LEADERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT. I'M LOOKING AT THE FUTURE LEADERS OF AMERICA. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY, YOUR STATE. IT IS THE FIRST TEST OF SOMEONE THAT WOULD STEP INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE. BE WILLING TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE, SAY I HAVE A HEART TO SERVE, STEP FORWARD, AND LEAD AMERICA. AND HAVE FAITH IN THIS PRESIDENT THAT WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING. WHO BUILT THE BIGGEST AND BROADEST COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND IS GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT A CAREFUL STUDY OF AMERICAN HISTORY SHOWS, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PRESENTED WITH A VISION AND WITH LEADERSHIP FOUNDED IN FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME. SO AS YOU RETURN TO YOUR HOMES AND STAY IN THE FIGHT AND YOU SPEAK UP, BE CONFIDENT. BE CONFIDENT IN YOURSELVES, BE CONFIDENT IN THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IN THIS PRESIDENT AND ALL OF US WHO SERVE AROUND THEM, AND BE CONFIDENT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. INSCRIBED ON THE SIDE OF THE LIBERTY BELL IS AN ANCIENT VERSE. IT SAYS, ""PROCLAIM LIBERTY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND AND UNTO ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF."" WHEN WE PROCLAIM LIBERTY IN THESE UNITED STATES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RALLY TO OUR CAUSE. YOU GO DO IT. AND FINALLY, AFTER THIS CHALLENGING YEAR, IF YOU WERE OF A MIND ON THIS CHRISTMAS WEEK, I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME , ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME TO BE STILL. REFLECT ON THE BLESSINGS IN YOUR LIFE. THE BLESSINGS OF YOUR FAMILIES, THE BLESSINGS OF HAVING BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO BE STILL, AND IF YOU'RE INCLINED, THIS IS WHAT WE DO AT MY HOUSE COME CHRISTMAS MORNING, TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE GRACE THAT CAME TO MANKIND, WRAPPED IN CLOTHES AND LYING IN A MANGER SO MANY YEARS AGO. MIKE PENCE: (27:55) FOR ALL THE , FOR ALL THE BATTLES BEHIND US, FOR ALL THE BATTLES WE'RE IN TODAY, BATTLES THAT LIE AHEAD, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER, HERE AT THIS STUDENT ACTION SUMMIT, THAT EVEN YOUTHS GROW TIRED AND WEARY, AND THE YOUNG STUMBLE AND FALL. BUT AS THE BIBLE TELLS US, THOSE WHO WAIT ON THE LORD WILL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH, WILL SOAR ON WINGS LIKE EAGLES. YOU WILL RUN AND NOT GROW WEARY, YOU WILL WALK AND NOT BE FAINT. PROCLAIM THAT GRACE AND RUN THE RACE. I BELIEVE IF YOU DO THAT, YOU BELIEVE IN THAT DREAM THAT'S IN YOUR HEART TO SERVE AND TO LEAD, AND YOU TRUST THE LEADERS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED UP THIS TIME IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION, BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND PUT YOUR FAITH IN HIM WHO HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS GREAT LAND, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR FREEDOM FOR THIS GENERATION AND THE NEXT, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ARE YET TO COME. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS AND NEED TO SEND THEM BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. IT WOULD BE ENOUGH AND SEND THEM BACK BECAUSE OF ALL WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WE NEED TO SEND THEM BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C.

FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT WAS HALL OOD OUT, AN ECONOMY TO STRUGGLE OUT. TRIM WAS ON THE RISE AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUM AND GEORGIA'S TWO SENATORS, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY AND SECURED OUR BORDER AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS] AMAZING TO THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND BEGINS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. I'M YOUR VICE PRESIDENT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TITLE I WILL HOLD IS SPELLED D A.D.

[APPLAUSE] YOU ALL REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A., REMEMBER? WE HAD AMERICA'S HEROES AND MANY CASES THAT WERE PASSES AWAY ON WAITING LISTS. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, THOSE DAYS WERE OVER. WE PASSED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORM OF THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER POSITION ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIR COMMITTEE, SENATOR LOEFFLER HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, WE CUT TAXES, WE ROLLED BACK REGULAR LIKES AND UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND BUSINESSES PROVIDED JOBS INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. [APPLAUSE] WAGES WERE RISING ACROSS THE BOARD. WAGES WERE RAISING. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. TRUE. SO WE WERE MAKING EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS, THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION AND THEN 2020 ARRIVED AND THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR I 12 AND SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL OF SUPPLIES AND CREATION OF MEDICINES AND SECURED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES AND AMAZING TO THINK IN LESS THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT ONE BUT TWO EFFECTTIVE VACCINES THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND GEORGIA SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND HELPED US AND AFTER WE LOST 22 MILLION JOBS AFTER THE HEIGHT OF THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP GEORGIA AGAIN. WE HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED 220 FEDERAL JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL PRINCIPLED MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL ENSIDELINE OUR GOD-GIVEN CONSTITUTION. THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS BUT IT'S THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT CONFIRMS. ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE, NOT HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF OUR SENATORS. THEY STOOD STRONG AND APOINTED THOSE IF I HAD JUDGES AND THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE CONFIRMED JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE KAVANAUG HMP AND JUSTICE AMY COMB YES BARRETT. THE LAST FOUR YEARS, OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD STRONG WITH THE VALUES WE CHERISH MOST. WE REPEALED THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT, FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR. STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN AND MADE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM A POLICY, GOALS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION ON THE WORLD STAGE. NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS DIFFERENT. LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. THE COMPROMISED OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE FEDERAL MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. INCREDIBLE. IN FACT. WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE A FEW SHOFERT YEARS AGO WHEN JUSTICE BARRETT WENT BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT. DO YOU REMEMBER. THE LEADING DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID SHE WAS , [INDISCERNIBLE] [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING U.S.A.] FOR OUR LIBERTIES AND FOR OUR SENATE MAJORITY THAT WILL RESPECT OUR MOST CHERISHED FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BACK IN THE U.S. SENATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN MISHE AND THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. WHEN THEY STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, JON OSOFF AND REMPED WARN OFF ARE GOING TO CUT. WHEN OSOFF AND WARNOCK ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT CALLING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES GANGSTERS AND THUGS BECAUSE THEY CUT TAXES. AND REVEREND WARNOCK HAS CALLED ON OUR MOST ALLY AND WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOFFLER AND PERDUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JUREM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER, THE WORLD WILL KNOW THIS, AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WITH JON OSOFF AND RAFAEL WARN OFF, LIKE THE PARTY THEY REPUBLIC, TAXPAYER ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, I COULDN'T BE BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONG SIDE THE MOST PRO-PRESIDENT. AND I AND KELLY LEFF LORE STANDS FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND DAVID PERDUE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA.

WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES' SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED THE SENATORS TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL LEFT OF WASHINGTON D.C. WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY AND GEORGIA NEEDS TWO SENATORS THAT WILL GET IN THE WAY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FIGHT FOR GEORGIA'S VALUES EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO OSOFF AND WARNOCK AND SEE TO DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TOMORROW, JANUARY 5. TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. TO PRESERVE ALL THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO PROTECT OUR VALUES AND PROTECT OUR CHERISHED LIBERTIES. I NEED YOU TO DO A FEW THINGS. IN THE KNICKS 24 HOURS AND MORE.

AND LASTLY, I HAVE THAT OTHER KIND OF FAITH, TOO. THE CHALLENGING TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE. I BELIEVE MORE THAN EVER THAT WE STAND IN THE NEED OF PRAYER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE JOINING WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF PRAYER IN THE OURS HOURS AND I WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE PRACTICE OF PRAYER IN A RENEWED PRAYER. AS WE WORK TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRAY FOR THE STATE OF THIS STATE AND NATION AND PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE AND IN THOSE AINCHEPT WORDS THAT AMERICA CAPS HAVE CLUNG TO, THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE HIS NAME AND PRAY AND WILL DO LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE LONG AND STORIED. HE WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND WILL HEAL THIS LAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO PRAY, PRAY FOR AMERICANS. PRAY FOR ALL THE AMERICANS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME AT ROCKS SPRINGS CHURCH AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE. [CHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS] I LEAVE YOU TODAY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ENTHUSIASM THAT I SEE AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE THAT TODAY. BUT I CAN TELL ALL OF YOU THAT I WAS REMINDED RESENTLY EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY THAT GOOD GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO TELL YOU BENNY MAY APPRECIATE THIS STORY, I SHARED IT A LITTLE WHILE BACK. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PASTOR WHO IS FROM JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE WERE ATTENDING A CEREMONY. AS I READ THE LETTER, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE THERE. AND IT WOULD HOST A CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL AND INVITE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE MIDWEST TO COME. THEY WOULD HAVE BANDS THAT WOULD TAKE THE STAGE OF WHAT WAS EARLY CONTEMPORARY MUSICIC. AND DECIDED THAT THE SEE HIMARY IN 1977 TO CANCEL THE EVENT. BUT HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE SAID THEY FELT A CALLING TO VOLUNTEER TO LEAD IT AND WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT QUOTE, FRIENDS TOLD US IT WOULD BE HARD ON OUR NEW MARRIAGE AND SHOULDN'T DO A YEAR-LONG PROJECT OF SETTING UP THIS FESTIVAL AND HE SAID WE ANSWERED THE CALL. WE GATHERED OTHERS TO ARRANGE THE EVENT IN 1978. HE TOLD ME THAT THE NIGHT CAME, THE CULMINATING EVENING OF SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP AREA AND IT WAS RAINING, THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED AND THOUGHT IT WAS ALL FOR NAUTH. AND HE WROTE TO ME AND HE SAID THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT NIGHT, A FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE GIVING HIS LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE SAID, QUOTE, I CANNOT WRITE THIS WITHOUT TEARS AND I COULDN'T READ IT WITHOUT TEARS, BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT. SITTING ON A HILLSIDE, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS LIKE I HEARD THE WORDS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GOD FILL UP THE WORLD THAT HE SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON MIGHT VERY ETERNAL LIFE. AND I STOOD UP, 18 YEARS YOUNG AND I WALKED DOWN THAT NIGHT, NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF NEWLY SENSE BUT MY HEART WAS WAS DONE ON THE CROSS FOR ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I TOOK A WHILE TO WRITE THAT PASTOR BACK AND WE WERE IN JACKSONVILLE A FEW MONTHS LATER. I WASN'T ABLE TO WRITE THAT LETTER WITHOUT TEARS. BUT I SAID TO HIM AT THE END, NOW I KNOW WHO ELSE TO THANK FOR THAT NIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO. BUT THE LESSON OF HIS LETTER WAS THIS AND REASON I SHARE IT. HE SAID TO ME, MIKE, WHEN I HEARD OF THE DECISION YOU MADE THAT NIGHT, I REALIZED THAT EVEN WHEN THINGS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING THE WAY THINGS EXPECTED THEY ARE GOING THE WAY HE EXPECTED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I TRULY BELIEVE ON THE EVE OF THIS GEORGIA ELECTION AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, THAT IF WE WILL HOLD FAST TO HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RENEW OUR FREEDOM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS LAND WITH OUR WITNESS WITH THE LOVE AND COMPASSION AND STRENGTH THAT COMES IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLETS BUT WHAT HOLDS THE FUTURE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES, WINSTON CHURCHILL, IN AN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN 1941 AND HE SAID, QUOTE, WE MUST INDEED HAVE A BLIND SOUL WHO CANNOT SEE THE GREAT PURPOSE AND DESIGN THAT IS BEING WORKED OUT BELOW WHICH WE HAVE THE HONOR TO BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS. SO LET'S BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND DO OUR PART, DO OUR PART TO DO WHAT IS ALL GREAT OF THIS LAST BEST HOPE OF MANKIND. I LEAVE US TO DO ALL WHAT WE NEED TO DO ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHEN GEORGIA STEPS UP AND HOLDS THE LINE AND DEFENDS THE MAJORITY. AND YOUR CONVICTIONS TOMORROW. WHEN YOU SEND PERDUE AND LOEFFLER TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT AND KEEP AMERICA GREAT THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU VCH GEORGIA. GOD PLEAS YOU AND DEMROD PLEAS AMERICA. NOW LET'S GET IT DONE!

Both candidates were facing runoff elections with Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock on January 5, 2021. The runoff would determine majority control of the U.S. Senate. Vice President Pence talked about the importance of Georgians voting and said he shares the concerns of some Americans about voting irregularities. The vice president told the crowd that ""come this Wednesday, we&rsquo;ll have our day in Congress. We&rsquo;ll hear the objections.

OFFICIALS WITH HOMELAND SECURITY, THE F.B.I., U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASK THE NATIONAL GUARD OUTLINED SOME OF THEIR PLANS TO KEEP THINGS SECURE AND SAFE. WE ALL LIVED THROUGH THAT DAY OF JANUARY 6TH. AND AT , AS THE PERSPECTIVE MADE CLEAR YESTERDAY, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO AN ORDERLY TRANSITION. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE NOTHING LESS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE EFFORTS DEPLOYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT BOTH THOSE OCCUR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DETAILS OF THOSE EFFORTS AND LET ME JUST SAY TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, IT'S BEEN MY GREAT HONOR TO SERVE AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT AND SHOULD THIS BE THE LAST TIME THAT WE'RE TOGETHER, LET ME EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO EACH ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE INAUGURATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT KAMALA HARRIS, PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN ARE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A WAY BE FITTING OUR HERITAGE AND GIVES HONOR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE UNITED STATES. WITH THAT, ACTING SECRETARY, YOUR PREPARATIONS? I KNOW WE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFETY OF THE UPCOMING INAUGURATION. HOWEVER, I HAVE THE US MOST CONFIDENCE IN THE AGENCIES AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS WHO ARE DEVELOPING IS , AND IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY PLAN. IN MY SHORT TIME HERE I'VE REACHED OUT TO MOST PEOPLE AND CONFIDENCE SHOULD BE HIGH. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL PARTIES. THIS IS THE INAUGURATION BUT ALSO THE 57TH OVERALL EVENT. THEY'VE COME TOGETHER FOR THE SAFETY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE FACILITIES. THE D.H.S. WITH DESIGN PLANNING WITH SECURITY OPERATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH OUR PARTNERS FOR THE 2021 INAUGURATION HAS DESIGNATED THIS EVENT AS A NATIONAL SECURITY SPECIAL EVENT AND FINALLY, THE SECRET SERVICE SEES A MANDATED ROLE AS THE AGENCY FOR THE DESIGN AND THE F.B.I. HAS THE LEAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE, COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS OF CRIME AND FEMA HAS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT. I'M GOING TO PASS ITS TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DEPTHS OF OUR PLAN. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MONTHS. THESE THINGS ARE BORNE OUT OF EXPERIENCES WE ALL ENDURED IN 199 IN ATLANTA, THE BOMBING THERE. IT WAS REALIZEDS THAT THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN FEDERAL, STATES, AND LOCAL WHEN IT CAME TO SECURITIES PLANNING AND CRISIS RESPONSE. IN AN EFFORT TO REMEDY THAT, THERE WAS A BIT OF LEGISLATION AND WE'VE ENDED UP WITH THIS FOR ABOUT 22 YEARS NOW. THE THREE AGENCIES THAT TAKE THE LEAD HERE, FEMA, F.B.I. AND SECRET SERVICE AND AS HE MENTIONED, THE SECRET SERVICE IS MAN DATED TO SERVE AS THE LEAD FOR EXECUTION, PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. I THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS FAMILIAR WITH OUR POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICIES BUT WITH THE N.S.E., WEAR TALKING ABOUT ENSURING THE SECURITY OF EVERYONE. JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THAT. THE THREE LEAD AGENCIES GET TOGETHER WELL BEFORE THE EVENT TAKES PLACE. WE BEGIN PREPARING FOR THE NEXT ONE ONCE ONE ENDS. THAT INCLUDES GETTING READY FOR THE NEXT INAUGURAL. IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE'VE BEEN TALKING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS INAUGURAL FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS NOW. LAST MAY, THE COMMITTEES GOT TOGETHER AND FORMED A UNIFIED COMMAND AND WE ARE , WERE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF KEY AGENCIES. HERE IN D.C., THE METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT, U.S. CAPITOL POLICE. A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE LIST GOES ON. THAT IDENTIFIES CRITICAL AREAS FOR THE EVENT AND ESTABLISH SUBCOMMITTEES THAT FOCUS ON DIFFERENT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO DOZEN. I WON'T LIST THEM ALL BUT WE HAVE SUBCOMMITTEES REGARDING CIVIL DISTURBANCE, ANOTHER REGARDING CROWD MANAGEMENT. SEVERAL CONCERNING AIR SPACE SECURITY AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THOSE 28 SUBCOMMITTEES REPORT TO THE COMMECK EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. THOSE ARE YOUR COMMITTEES. WHAT IS REPRESENTED IS 100 AGENCIES AND MANY HUNDREDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE FIELD. THIS IS THE 67TH SINCE 199. HALF OF THOSE TOOFPLGS RIGHT HERE AT THE NATIONAL CAPITOL REGION AND THAT SERVES TO YOURNLED SCORE THE LONG-STANDING PARTNERSHIPS AND DEEP EXPERIENCE ALL THESE AGENCIES HAVE IN SECURING THESE CRITICAL EVENTS HERE IN THE REGION. I IMAGINE THE QUESTION IN EVERYBODY'S MINDS IS WHY DO WE THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN NEXT WEEK? I'LL POINT KEENLY TO THE LEVEL OF PLANNING AND COORDINATION WE'VE BEEN CARRYING OUT FOR MORE THAN NINE MONTHS. WE ARE HIGHLY CONFIDENT IN OUR SECURITY PLAN BUT ALWAYS WIDE EYED AND SOBER AND LOOKING TO CAPITALIZE ON LESSONS LEARNED. I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS WHAT PROGRAMS AND MEASURES DO WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENTSED , PREVENTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE HAPPENING? OUR PERIMETER BASICALLY COVERS MOST OF DOWNTOWN WASHED. MANY MANY MILES OF HARD FENCE AND SUPPORTED BY MANY, MANY THOUSANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NATIONAL GUARD PERSONEL. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE IN THIS REGARD. THEY HAVE A MISSION BEYOND THE THAT WILL CAPITOL REGION AND WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T DEPLETE ALL THE VARIOUS STAGES THEY'RE INVOLVED IN. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COVER WHAT OUR NATIONAL TROOPS ARE DOING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN ON THE GROUND IN SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL LEAD AGENCY. 21,000 FOR THE UPCOMING INAUGURATION. THEY'RE PROTECTING, PROVIDING SECURITY, COMMUNICATIONS, LOGISTICS AND COORDINATION WITH ALL SUPPORTED AGENCIES. FOR THE SAFETY AND IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE AGENCIES WE'RE SUPPORTING, OUR GUARD MESHES ARE ARMED AND EQUIPPED COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO. AS ALWAYS, OUR FIRST IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND PROPERTY AND THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES. I VISITS WITH THESE MEN AND WOMEN EVERY NIGHT AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MISSION AND THEY'RE ALSO PRUNCHE, PREPARED AND PROUD TO DO THEIR PART TO ENSURE THE SAFE INAUGURATION OF OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN INCLUDES RESPONSE TO COVID-19, SUPPORT OF OPERATION WARP SPEED AND ANY NEW REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. THE FOREFATHERS OF TODAY'S NATIONAL GUARD WERE PRESENT FOR THE INAUGURATION OF GEORGE WASHINGTON AND WE'VE BEEN PART OF EVERY INAUGURATION SINCE. THE SUPPORT IS MADE POSSIBLE BY OUR GOVERNORS AND GENERALS. LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND SERVICE MEMBERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS WHO MAKE THEIR SERVICE POSSIBLE. WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO EVERY MISSION BOTH HERE AT HOME AND OVERSEAS, LIVING TRUE TO OUR MOTTO, ALWAYS READY, ALWAYS THERE. THANK YOU. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, JUST AS WE'RE DEALING INTO LAST WEEK'S VIOLENCE ACTIVITIES AT THE CAPITOL WE'RE BRINGING OUR AGGRESSIVE CAPABILITIES AND INTELLIGENCE EXPERTISE TO NEXT WEEK'S INAUGURATION. WHILE THE SERVICE TYKES TAKES THE LEAD IN INAUGURAL SECURITY. THE F.B.I. FEDERAL AGENCY FOR CRISIS RESPONSE FOR COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS AND IN THAT VEIN WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ON THIS. PART OF WHAT GIVES US THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE. THE F.B.I. WILL SET UP A NATIONAL COMMAND POST AT F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS AS WELL AS IN OUR WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE WHICH I KNOW YOU'VE VISITED BEFORE AND WOULD RECOGNIZE, AS WELL AS WE'RE HAVING COMMAND POSTS IN ALL 56 OF OUR FIELD OFFICES. THOSE COMMAND POSTS BRING TOGETHER PERSONNEL NOT JUST FROM THE F.B.I. BUT FROM ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE, TO ASSESS POTENTIAL THREATS, TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIONS AND TO SEARCH RESOURCES WHERE NEEDED AND THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE INFORMATION IN REAL TIME AND ALLOW OUR PERSONNEL TO CONTINUALLY UPDATE THOSE THREAT ASSESSMENTS AND THOSE COMMAND POSTS WILL BE RUNNING 24/7 THROUGH THE INAUGURATION AND IN SOME CASES IN THE DAYS TO FOLLOW. WE'RE MONETARYING ALL LEADS, WHETHER THEY ARE CALLS FROM PROTECTIONS OR OTHER KINDS OF POTENTIAL ATHLETES LEADING UP TO INAUGURAL ETC. EVENT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL THREATS, WE ARE SEEING AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF CONCERNING ONLINE CHATTER ABOUT A NUMBER OF EVENTS SURROUNDING THE INAUGURATION AND TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS WE EVALWAIT THOSE THREATS AND WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES TO EMPLOY AGAINST THEM. RIGHT NOW WE'RE PREPARING FOR POTENTIAL ARMED PROTESTS. THE REASON I USE THE WORD POTENTIAL IS ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES IN THIS SPACE IS TRYING TO DISTINGUISH WHAT'S ASPIRATIONAL VERSUS WHAT'S INTENTIONAL. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT INTENTIONAL PROTESTS PLANNED HERE AND IN STATE CAPITOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE DAYS THAT COME THAT COULD BRING ARMED INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE FAVEMENTS GOVERNMENT FACILITIES. WE'VE BEEN PUSHING THAT INFORMATION AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO ALL OF OUR RELEVANT LAW ENFORCEMENTS AND INTELLIGENT PARTNERS. IF WE FIND THAT AN INDIVIDUAL POSES A THREAT, WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TO STOP IT. IN THAT VEIN, WE AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE ALREADY ARRESTED MORE THAN 100 INDIVIDUALS FOR THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES IN LAST WEEK'S SIEGE OF THE COME AND CONTINUES TO PURSUE COUNTLESS OTHER RELATED INVESTIGATIONS AND THOSE NOT ONLY HELP PREVENT THOSE INDIVIDUALS FROM ANY EFFORTS TO REPEAT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY BUT ALSO SHOULD SERVE AS A VERY STERN WARNING TO ANYBODY ELSE WHO MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TRY TO ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY. WE'RE ALSO TAKING OTHER STEPS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAY NOT HEAR ABOUT EVERY DISRUPTION IN THE IMMEDIATEA AND MAY NOT SEE THE F.B.I.'S HAND IN EVERYTHING WE DO BUT THEY SHOULD BE CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES WHERE WE'RE FEEDING RELEVANT INFORMATION TO ALL OF OUR PARTNERS SO THEY CAN EYE TARGETS AS APPROPRIATE AND ASICS, WE'RE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUALS. FROM JANUARY 6 ALONE WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED OVER 200 SUSPECTS. WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND F.B.I. AGENTS ARE COMING TO FIND YOU. MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INCLINED TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOD FOOT STEPS WHO ENGAGED IN THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY WE SAW LAST WEEK IS STAY HOME, LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW TO THE PEOPLE WHOM INVOLVED IN THE CAPITOL SIEGE, WHEREVER THEY SCATTERED TO, WHETHER IT'S PHOENIX, DALLAS, HONOLULU. WHEREVER THEY ARE, WE HAVE F.B.I. AGENTS TRACKING THEM DOWN. SO ANYBODY WHO ATTEMPTS VIOLENCE IN THE COMING WEEK SHOULD COUNT ON A VISIT. SO TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERLES HERE IN THE DISTRICTS AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION OF POWER IN THE DAYS TO COME. THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE TEAM THAT YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED HERE.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?507986-1/inauguration-security-briefing	Vice President Mike Pence participated in a security briefing for Inauguration Day.

CSPANMP1612021186	Mike Pence	2021-01-16	Vice President Pence Remarks on Trump Administration Foreign Policy Achievements	I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSION. THE ONE THING I HOPE WE DO NOT DO IS WE SEE THIS AS A MONOLITHIC ISSUE OR EVENT OR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE THERE ARE DEEP STRAINS OF DIFFERENT THINGS, WHETHER IT IS WHITE SUPREMACY, ANTI-IMMIGRATION, TAKING OVER THE GOVERNMENT, BUT I THINK WE'VE MADE THIS MISTAKE WHEN WE DEALT WITH ISLAMIC TERRORISM ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ORGANIZED GROUPS THAT YOU CAN LABEL UNDER THAT VERY BROAD CATEGORY, BUT ALL OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS HAD VERY DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES. AS PAULA HAD A VERY , HEZBOLLAH HAD A VERY DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THAN AL QAEDA OR THE TALIBAN. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FROM AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT KILLING PEOPLE, BUT WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, OR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COUNTER THE NARRATIVE OR FRAME THIS SO THAT THE MOVEMENTS AND THAT EXPAND. IF WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE GROUPS THEMSELVES AND THEIR PARTICULAR UNITS OR GROUP AND WE JUST TRY TO WRAP IT ALL AND RUN , IN ONE WE FAIL IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN LEMOORE. WE WERE HERE IN JULY OF 2019. WE ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE TO SEE YOU ALL TODAY. WE LOVE SEEING THESE PLANES, TOO. OUR SON FLIES THE F-35. OUR SON-IN-LAW FLIES THE SUPER HORNETS. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY. IT IS EXCITING FOR US. THIS IS REALLY OUR LAST OFFICIAL TRIP AS VICE PRESIDENT AND SECOND LADY. THERE IS NO WHERE WE WOULD RATHER BE THAN RIGHT HERE AT LEMOORE. TODAY, I GET TO INTRODUCE THE VICE PRESIDENT. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT HE AND I ARE SO PROUD OF YOUR SERVICE. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HANDING OVER , HEADING OVER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE SPOUSES AND TELLING THEM HOW PROUD WE ARE OF THEM. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SACRIFICE. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SPOUSES AND SACRIFICES OF YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR FAMILY. WE KNOW THAT YOU SERVE TOGETHER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT OUR HOUSE. WE HAVE THAT GOING ON, AS WELL. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. PLEASE TELL YOUR SPOUSES AND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR CHILDREN, HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO MAKE THE MILITARY ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE CARE ABOUT YOU. [APPLAUSE] SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. NOW IT IS TIME TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. HELLO, LEMOORE.

[APPLAUSE] AS MY WONDERFUL WIFE SAID, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN STRIKE FIGHTER COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THANKING SOMEONE WHO HAS LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. PENCE: THAT'S GREAT. SHE IS A MARINE CORPS MOM. SHE HAS TRAVELED THE NATION AND TRAVELED THE WORLD, COMING ALONGSIDE MILITARY SPOUSES. SHE SUPPORTED REFORMS AND LAWS CONCERNING AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT. SHE WILL BE SPEAKING TO SPOUSES RIGHT HERE. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF MY INCREDIBLE WIFE, WHO I THINK IS THE BEST SECOND LADY THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD. JOIN ME IN THANKING KAREN PENCE WHAT SHE HAS DONE FOR OUR TROOPS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. VICE PRES. PENCE: I'M HERE TO DELIVER A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE. TO EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, FROM YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND BEHALF OF EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AFTER TRAVELING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I PROMISE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US, BUT WE KNOW, YOU ARE THE BEST OF US. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT AS WE HAVE MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS ALREADY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO STAND BESIDE YOU. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERYDAY AS A FAMILY. WHILE YOU TRAIN AND DEPLOY, YOUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, THE PARENTS WHO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING, ISN'T IT? WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OUR DAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AND OUR SON-IN-LAW ARE STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE. WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. OUR SON IS A MARINE CORPS F-35 PILOT. HE AND HIS WIFE ARE STATIONED IN ARIZONA. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, THEY SERVE AS A FAMILY. AS WE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED BEFORE ME, AND ALL YOU REPRESENT, HOW ABOUT A BIGGER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN UNIFORM? LET'S HEAR IT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT IS INSPIRING TO LOOK OUT AND SEE ALL OF YOU TODAY. REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO HAVE STOOD WHERE WE ARE ALL STANDING. OVER 60 YEARS, WARRIORS HAVE COME HERE, TRAINED HERE, GONE OUT FROM HERE AND DEPLOYED TO EVERY PLACE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. THIS INSTALLATION IS THE ONLY MASTER JET BASE OF THE NAVY, AND ALL OPERATIONAL, SPECIFICALLY STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS. 16 OPERATIONAL STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS, TWO FLEET REPLACEMENT SQUADRONS, ONE WEST COAST CARRIER AIR WING, COMMANDERS, AND STAFF. ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 210,000 FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE FROM NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE EVERY YEAR. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY AND TRADITION OF SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: TWO AIR WINGS ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, 11 ON THE USS TEDDY, NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING THE BLACK DIAMOND AND THE KNIGHTS STATIONED HERE. CARRIER AIR WING 17 IS DEPLOYED FOR THE NIMITZ. IT INCLUDES NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING F-18 SUPER HORNETS FROM HERE AT LEMOORE, FLOWN BY THE RED CROSS, THE CASTRO'S, AND THE MIGHTY STRIKES. HOW ABOUT A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE NAS LEMOORE SQUADRONS DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD? WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE SOAR ACROSS THE SKY IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION AND FREEDOM. IT INSPIRES EVERY DAY. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE EVER MADE A DIFFERENCE. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. YOU STEP FORWARD, JOIN THE ARMED FORCES, YOU BECAME PART OF THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN YOUR TIME TO DEFEND THE FLAME OF FREEDOM AND HAND IT ON TO GENERATIONS YET TO COME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GRATEFUL. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE OUR DEEPEST RESPECTS FOR THE SELFLESSNESS AND COURAGE YOU PERSONIFY EVERY DAY. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS. . OUR TROOPS HADN'T SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS. ALMIRA TERRI , OUR MILITARY LACKED READINESS. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MEETING THEIR COMMITMENTS TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE. IRAN WAS RESURGENT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED A LANDMASS THE SIZE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS OF THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT YOU DESERVE. WE PROVIDED FOR ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL, THE LARGEST PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS, AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: OUR MILITARY IS NOW MORE EQUIPPED THAN EVER BEFORE. UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE SECURED NEARLY 500 F-35 FIGHTERS, 21 MORE DEPLOYABLE SHIPS, WITH ANOTHER 59 ON THE WAY. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS, BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND BROADER FIGHTER PLANES, AS WELL. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY, OUR ALLIES HAVE ALSO STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONCH TRIBUTE , CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY MORE THAN $130 BILLION. HISTORY TEACHES WEAKNESS COMES OUT OF PEOPLE, AND OUR HISTORY HAS PROVEN A STRONG AMERICA DETERS IT. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR. WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE DEFENDED THIS NATION AND AMERICA'S VITAL INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND AROUND THE WORLD. WITH A FEW DAYS LEFT, I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES NOT TO GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE INSURED PEACE AND STABILITY. IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS, STRONG AMERICAN MILITARY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE DONE JUST THAT. WE TOOK HISTORIC STEPS, FIRST TO STAND WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES. WE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE RECOGNIZE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OVER GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND AFTER 26 YEARS, FOUR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. AND UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAM IT TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. DURING THESE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE U.S. CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS, AND A STRIKE FIGHTERS STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE WERE IN THE FIGHT EARLY ON, HITTING ISIS, GIVING TERRORISTS NO QUARTER, DRIVING THEM FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS. WITH THE COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, I'M PROUD TO REPORT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO, WE CRUSHED THEIR CALIPHATE, CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS, AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND WE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR. DRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD THREATENED AMERICAN FORCES IN THE REGION, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK ACTION AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, BECAUSE SOME SOLEIMANI, IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. AND WITH RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE EMBRACE OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, OR THE ASIA-PACIFIC, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. NAVY HAVE BEEN THAT GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. A STRONG AND READY NAVY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. AS A NEW AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION PREPARES TO TAKE OFFICE, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER AS AMERICANS THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE, AND A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC IS IMPORTANT TO OUR PROSPERITY, SECURITY, AND VITALITY OF FREEDOM OF US THE WORLD. AFTER GENERATIONS WHERE AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES DEFENDED THE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND THE INTERESTS OF FREE NATIONS ACROSS THE ASIA-PACIFIC, TODAY, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS DETERMINED TO EXPAND BEIJING'S INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MILITARY PROVOCATIONS AND DEAD DIPLOMACY. SO I URGE THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION TO STAY THE COURSE. DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE. STAND UP TO CHINESE AGGRESSION, AND TRADE ABUSES. STAND STRONG FOR A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC AND PUT AMERICA AND OUR FREEDOM LOVING ALLIES FIRST. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND I KNOW THE U.S. NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THE YEARS AHEAD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE FREE WORLD WILL RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. NAVY MORE THAN EVER TO SAFEGUARD THE FREE AND OPEN FLOW OF COMMERCE AND OUR IDEALS ON THE SEVEN SEAS. SO ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND. TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE, MATTERS TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN. AS YOU STAND AT POST, I CAN ASSURE YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE BEHIND YOU 100%. SO AS I CLOSE, LET ME SAY AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND A GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, YOU DID SO KNOWING THE SAILOR AND THE SOLDIER DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU TAKE EVERY DAY. BUT KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION, AND THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THERE WILL PRAY IN THE ANCIENT WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS THAT NO HARM WILL BEFORE YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, THAT AS YOU SERVE HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, THAT HIS FAITHFULNESS WILL BE YOUR SHIELD. YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE TO OUR FAMILY. AND WHETHER YOU SERVE ON LAND, AT SEA, OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE, JUST KNOW THAT EVERY DAY, IN HOMES LARGE AND SMALL AROUND DINNER TABLES AND GATHERINGS, AND IN QUIET MOMENTS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRAY FOR EACH AND EVERYONE. GIVE THANKS FOR YOUR SELFLESS COURAGE, AND WISH YOU FARIR WINDS AND FOLLOWING SEAS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AS MY TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT THESE PAST FOUR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. I TRULY BELIEVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WITH THE COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE HEROES WILLING TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE PATRIOTS WILLING TO DEFEND OUR NATION, I KNOW OUR COUNTRY WILL BE SAFE. OUR FREEDOM WILL BE SECURE, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. SO MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE HERE AND DEPLOYED. GOD BLESS YOU AND HIS PROTECTION, AND WITH THAT FIGHTER SPIRIT. MAY GOD BLESS ALL THOSE SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AT THE BACKBONE OF U.S. ARMY READINESS, THE HOME OF MOUNTAIN TOUGH. THE SOLDIERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS, THE NORTH COUNTRY HAS BEEN A TRAINING GROUND FOR AMERICA SOLDIERS. TODAY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION TRAIN HERE AND DEPLOY HERE AND CLIMBED TO GLORY. SO GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AMERICA'S PROUD OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN. [APPLAUSE] WHILE YOU ARE AT IT, WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SO DEDICATED THESE LAST FOUR YEARS TO MILITARY FAMILIES AND SPOUSES, LITERALLY TRAVELED THE WORLD, ENCOURAGING THOSE WHO STAND ALONGSIDE ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE.

[APPLAUSE] AFTER TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I CAN ASSURE ALL OF YOU IN UNIFORM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. I HEAR ABOUT AT ALL THE TIME. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US. THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY KNOW, YOU'RE THE BEST OF US. WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO SERVE ALONGSIDE. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERY DAY AS A FAMILY WHILE YOU TRAIN, WHY YOU DEPLOY. IT IS OUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, AND THE PARENT TO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING. AS YOU JUST HEARD, FROM MY WIFE, KAREN, WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE TWO MARRIED ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL IN OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY, AND WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. SO WHY DON'T WE GIVE A ROUSING ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THE 10TH, WHY DON'T YOU GET ON YOUR FEET TO SHOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STAND BY YOU TO SERVE. [APPLAUSE] LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE HOUSES, AND KIDS, AND PARENTS, WHO MAKE IT ALL WORK. [APPLAUSE] AS I LOOK OUT AT ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE, IT IS REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO STOOD WHERE WE ARE HAS STANDING TODAY. WARRIORS WHO HAVE COME HERE AND TRAIN HERE, DEPLOYED FROM HERE TO VIRTUALLY EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. SINCE 9/11, THE 10TH MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN THE MOST POLITE DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY , THE MOST DEPLOYED DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY, WITH THOUSANDS DEPLOYED EVERY DAY. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION HAS SERVED A COMBINED 46 DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, THE FIRST CONVENTIONAL UNITS TO DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11 CAME HERE , CAME FROM HERE AT FORT DRUM. OTHERS ARE DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN AS WE SPEAK. AT THEY ARE LOOKING ON FROM AFAR, WE SAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. [APPLAUSE] IT MAY BE TRUE IN THE DAYS AHEAD MEMBERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION COULD BE AMONG THE LAST CONVENTIONAL UNITS. SHOULD THE DAY COMES THAT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN FINALLY COMES TO AN END. YOUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN VITAL, TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS YEAR WILL MARK 20 YEARS SINCE THE FORCES OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR PLOTTED AND PERPETRATED THE DEADLIEST ATTACK ON THE AMERICAN HOMELAND IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FROM THE SAFE HAVEN OF AFGHANISTAN, TERRORIST OF AL QAEDA STRUCK UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. I WAS A NEW MEMBER OF CONGRESS THEN, HAD JUST ARRIVED THAT YEAR, REPRESENTING INDIANA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHERE I WAS, JUST OFF CAPITOL HILL, WHEN I HEARD THAT THAT THE TOWERS WERE STRUCK IN YORK CITY. FOR THE MOMENT WHEN I WALKED OUT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING, ACROSS FROM THE U.S. CAPITOL, AND SAW A CLEAR BLUE SKY OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. FILLED WITH BILLOWS OF MUD BROWN AND BLACK SMOKE, BILLOWING OUT OF THE PENTAGON. IT IS A SITE I WILL NEVER FORGET. , SIGHT THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. LATER THAT DAY I WAS ABLE TO SLIP BACK ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER TO GO TO A LITTLE HOUSE KAREN AND I HAD RENTED WITHOUT CHILDREN, AS MICE , WITH OUR CHILDREN AS MY SERVICE BEGAN AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WHILE THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE ON CAPITOL HILL, WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE GATHER WITH OUR KIDS, YOUNG CHILDREN AT THE TIME. WE SAT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED, AND TO REASSURE THEM. AND TO PRAY. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE KITCHEN. MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, FOLLOW ME OUT THE DOOR. SHE SAID, DAD, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID AUDREY, I HAVE TO GO AND I HAVE THINGS THAT I NEED TO DO. SHE SAID NO, DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I SAID I REALLY HAVE TO GO. SHE STAMPED HER FEET. AND SAID DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID, LIKE A SENSITIVE FATHER I WAS. WHAT? AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ME WITH THESE BIG BROWN EYES, SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, AND SHE SAID, DADDY, IF WE HAVE TO MAKE WAR, DO YOU HAVE TO GO? I DROPPED DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND THREW MY ARMS AROUND HER BECAUSE I SUDDENLY KNEW WHERE HER LITTLE HEART AND MIND WAS AT. I HUGGED HER AND TOLD HER DADDY IS TOO OLD. BUT I TELL THAT STORY BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A DATE GONE BY IN 20 YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF ALL OF YOU. WHO ANSWERED THAT QUESTION DIFFERENTLY. TO HER FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES , TO YOUR LOVED ONES. A GENERATION OF HEROES, YOU ALL ARE, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AND TOOK THE FIGHT TO OUR ENEMIES ON THEIR SOIL. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DAY GONE BY THAT I AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS NOT BEEN GRATEFUL, TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION AND EVERY AMERICAN HERO IN UNIFORM. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ALL. FROM THIS VERY FORT, SELFLESS PATRIOTS LIKE THOSE OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AFTER THAT DAY, HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE WAR ON TERROR. IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU THAT WE REACHED THE 19TH ANNIVERSARY , ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY JUST LAST YEAR, HAVING HAD NO MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE. YOU TOOK THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY IN THE FIELD, AND YOU HAVE GIVEN THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, A CHANCE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY, TO CHART A BETTER FUTURE. TODAY, AFGHANS ARE IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. I AM PROUD TO REPORT WITH GRATITUDE TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN COMBAT CASUALTY HAS OCCURRED IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. [APPLAUSE] OUR TROOPS HAVE BEEN COMING HOME. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION DID ITS JOB AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO JUST THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. UNTIL THE LAST AMERICAN SOLDIER COMES HOME. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. THE TRUTH IS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES ARE THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU CHOSE TO BE A PART OF THAT FORCE. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN OUR TIME, TO DEFEND FREEDOM, AND ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF LIBERTY, IN THIS GENERATION AND IN THE NEXT. YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE SAYS, OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING, AND FOR THAT YOU HAVE THE RESPECT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS EVIDENCE, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, TO MAKE THE STRONGEST FIGHTING FORCE IN HISTORY STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT. S. OUR TROOPS HAD NOT SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RATE RAISE IN NEARLY A DECADE. AND A LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MAKING , MEETING THE BASIC MINUTES THEY HAD MADE TO, DEFENSE. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IRAN WAS RESURGENT. AND THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ISIS CONTROL IN MS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER , A LAND MASS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS, WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS, THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED, TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION AND DEFEND THIS NATION. WE ALSO PROVIDED THE LARGEST PAY INCREASE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME SAY NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF LEADERS IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. HERE AT FORT DRUM IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TELL YOU NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STAFEANIK ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WHEN YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING HER FOR HER STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ARMED FORCES. [APPLAUSE] PARAMILITARY , OUR MILITARY IS NOW BETTER EQUIPPED, BETTER SUPPLIED, BETTER TRAINED THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS. WE BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND FIGHTER PLANES. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND A WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER, TO ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS, AND OUR ALLIES HAVE STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY $130 BILLION. [APPLAUSE] HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, YOU PREPARE FOR WAR. PEACE REQUIRES TWO THINGS, A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND A WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS. I'M PROUD TO REPORT A FEW DAYS LEFT IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, OUR ADMINISTRATION IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES, THAT DID NOT GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. THAT IS PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. [APPLAUSE] WITH THAT STRENGTH AND THE VALOR OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN, AND OUR ARMED FORCES AROUND THE WORLD, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. A YEAR AGO, OUR ARMED FORCES CAPTURED LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS AND THE 10TH MOUNTAIN WAS IN THE FIGHT FROM EARLY ON. U.S. FORCES CRUSHED CALIPHATE AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR AS WELL, WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS ON THE PLANET THREATEN TO DO HARM TO AMERICAN FORCES, WE ACTED. AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, KASEM SULEIMANI, IS GONE. THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND THE COURAGE AND VALOR OF OUR ARMED FORCES, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. PEACE NEGOTIATIONS RESUMED THIS MONTH IN DOHA, QATAR, BETWEEN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE TALIBAN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 26 YEARS, FOR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] SO, WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY HAVE BEEN AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE. YOUR READINESS, STAYING ARMY STRONG, IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN PARTICULAR WILL BE THE VANGUARD IN THE YEARS AHEAD, TO ENSURE THAT NO NATION WILL EVER AGAIN BECOME A SAFE HAVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT COULD THREATEN OUR PEOPLE OR THE WIDER WORLD. WE ARE ALL COUNTING ON YOU, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND, KEEP TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER, AND NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE MATTERS TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR NATION, AND ARE VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS ABROAD. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. IN THE VERY BEST TRADITION OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. AND AS YOU STAY ON YOUR POST, I WANT YOU TO NOTE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEHIND YOU 100%. YOU KNOW, I AM ALWAYS HUMBLED TO STAND BEFORE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU. BECAUSE, WHILE MY DAD WAS A COMBAT VETERAN, U.S. ARMY. [APPLAUSE] HE SAW ACTION IN THE KOREAN WAR. AND WHILE OUR SON AND SON-IN-LAW ARE SERVING IN THE MILITARY TODAY, MY LIFE DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES. SO IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING, TO STAND BEFORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. BUT MAYBE IT IS ALTOGETHER FITTING THAT YOU HEAR FROM AN AMERICAN LIKE ME, NOT SO MUCH AS HER VICE PRESIDENT, , NOT SO MUCH AS YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, BUT AS A GRATEFUL CITIZEN, TO SAY THE WORDS THAT YOU SHOULD HERE NOW AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION HERE AT FORT DRUM, I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WHERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE THOSE IN GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, THE DATE YOU STEPPED FORWARD, YOU KNEW, THAT THE SOLDIER DOES NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. SO, AS I THINK ALL OF YOU HERE, AND ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DEPLOYED OVERSEAS AT THIS HOUR, LET ME SAY TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, OUR NATION WILL NEVER FORGET, OR FAIL TO HONOR, THOSE IN THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION WHO GAVE THEIR LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION. I PROMISE YOU THAT. AND I WANT TO ENSURE IT , AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU SHOULDER EVERY DAY. KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION. AND YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. EVERY DAY, IN HOMES ACROSS THE LAND, AND ON THE FARM, AROUND DINNER TABLES, AND PLACES OF WORSHIP, OR JUST IN QUIET MOMENTS, I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS, THAT NO HOME , NO HARM WOULD BEFALL YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, AND AS YOU SERVE, HIS FAITHFULNESS WOULD BE YOUR SHIELD AND YOUR RAMPART. SO, THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AND AS OUR TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ALL OF YOU, AND MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN ALL OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD, WEARING THE UNIFORM OF THE ARMED FORCES, OF THE UNITED STATES. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE ALL BEEN THROUGH A LOT THIS PAST YEAR. BUT THROUGH IT ALL, I HAVE SEEN THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORTH. AND I SEE THAT STRENGTH IN YOUR FACES TODAY. LOOKING OUT AT ALL OF YOU, AND REMEMBERING THE COUNTLESS HEROES WE HAVE MET ALONG THE WAY THESE PAST FOUR YEARS, AND REMEMBERING THE GRACE OF HIM THAT HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS NATION, I HAVE FAITH, THAT THE DAY WILL COME, WHEN WE PUT THESE CHALLENGING TIMES IN THE PAST, AND EMERGE STRONGER AND BETTER THAN EVER. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. WE WILL RENEW OUR STRENGTH. AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. IN THIS ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] SO, GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN HERE AND IT DEPLOYED WITH HIS PROTECTION AS YOU CLIMB FOR GLORY. GOD BLESS ALL THOSE IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.
