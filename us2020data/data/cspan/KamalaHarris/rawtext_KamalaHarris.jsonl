[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW OAKLAND IS PROUD SHE IS OUR KIND OF LEADER. SHE HAS GOT OAKLAND PROGRESSIVE VALUES AND A VISION OF INCLUSION. THIS INCLUDES EVERYBODY NO MATTER YOUR IDENTITY, NO MATTER YOUR BACKGROUND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OAKLAND IS WHERE KAMALA HARRIS STARTED HER CAREER FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE. SHE WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST LEADERS TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND INVEST IN A REENTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST LEADERS ON A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WHEN IT WAS STILL POPULAR TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME. SHE WAS SMART ON CRIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO ONE FOUGHT HARDER FOR US WHEN IT WAS TIME TO HOLD BANKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR RUINING THE LIVES OF SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ALL KNOW THAT AS PRESIDENT, SENATOR HARRIS WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY AMERICAN EVERY DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A STORY OF HOW I FIRST MET KAMALA HARRIS. IT WAS MORE THAN 23 YEARS AGO. I SHARE IT WITH YOU BECAUSE IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT HER CHARACTER, THE KIND OF LEADER SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN LONG BEFORE ANYONE WAS WATCHING. 23 YEARS AGO SHE WAS THE YOUNG PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR FS MOMA. I WAS STARTING A CENTRALIZED VOLUNTEER PROGRAM FOR THE OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS. NEITHER OF US THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING INTO POLITICS. SHE CAME TO ME TO MY OFFICE BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO ESTABLISH A MENTORING PROGRAM BETWEEN SF MOMA AND THE ARTS MAGNET IN WEST OAKLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] SHE KNEW IT WAS CRITICAL THAT A MUSEUM LIKE SF MOMA SHOULD REACH OUT AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE KIDS IN THE WEST OAKLAND WITH SO MUCH ARTISTIC TALENT, BUT MAY BE FROM FAMILIES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-COST MUSEUMS. THAT PARTNERSHIP OPENED UP WORLDS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR WEST OAKLAND CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] I AM HAPPY TO SHARE 23 YEARS LATER, IT IS ALSO WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF COLE MIDDLE SCHOOL IS HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT. WHERE ARE YOU, MISS JACKIE? OH, THERE SHE IS. LONG BEFORE ANYONE WAS WATCHING ,, LOW WAS FIGHTING TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE, FIGHTING TO KEEP FAMILIES SAFE AND FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO SHE IS. THAT IS WHY WE LOVE HER. THAT IS WHY SHE IS THE LEADER THIS COUNTRY NEEDS NOW MORE THAN EVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO ENDORSE KAMALA HARRIS AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OK, OAKLAND. SHE HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR US HER WHOLE LIFE. NOW IT IS TIME WE FIGHT FOR HER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OAKLAND, ARE WE READY TO FIGHT FOR KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARE WE READY TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARE WE READY TO FIGHT FOR KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RB READY TO FIGHT TOGETHER , ARE WE READY TO FIGHT TOGETHER FOR THE PEOPLE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S DO THIS, OAKLAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) WE ARE EXPECTING DEMOCRATIC SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, A FIRST-TERM SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA, TO SPEAK TO THE RALLY IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA ANY MINUTE.

COVERAGE OF IT THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE 2020 CONTINUES ON C-SPAN. (music) (music) ['RUN THE WORLD' BY BEYONCE PLAYS] (music) STILL WAITING FOR SENATOR HARRIS TO COME OUT AND SPEAK TO THE CROWD IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE DAY. WE SAW THE SPEECH BEING LAID ON THE PODIUM. THAT MEANS THE CANDIDATE WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY. TRUE JUSTICE, DECENCY, EQUALITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY. THESE ARE NOT JUST WORDS BUT THE VALUES AMERICANS CHERISH. THEY ARE ON THE LINE. THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY DEPENDS ON YOU AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS LIFTING OUR VOICES FOR OUR AMERICAN VALUES. THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. TO BRING OUR VOICES TOGETHER, GO TO, LET HARRIS.ORG. LET'S CLAIM OUR FUTURE FOR OURSELVES, OUR CHILDREN, AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. [DRUMMING] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY HEART IS FULL RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK THE GREAT MAYOR OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE INTRODUCTION AND OUR LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP. OUR MOTHERS WERE FRIENDS ALSO IN OAKLAND. I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP. HERE WE ARE. [LAUGHTER] HERE WE ARE. LET ME TELL YOU, I AM SO PROUD TO BE A DAUGHTER OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS A MOST OF YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN UP THE ROAD AT KAISER HOSPITAL. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS JUST A FEW MILES AWAY THAT MY PARENTS FIRST MET AS GRADUAL , AS GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THEY WERE BORN HALF A WORLD APART FROM EACH OTHER. MY FATHER CAME FROM JAMAICA TO STUDY ECONOMICS. MY MOTHER CAME FROM INDIA TO STUDY SCIENCE. [APPLAUSE] THEY CAME HERE IN PURSUIT OF MORE THAN KNOWLEDGE. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, THEY CAME IN PURSUIT OF A DREAM. THAT DREAM WAS A DREAM FOR THEMSELVES, FOR ME, AND MY SISTER. AS CHILDREN IN THE EAST BAY, WE WERE RAISED BY A COMMUNITY WITH A DEEP BELIEF IN THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTS OF THE PROMISE THAT STILL REMAIN UNFULFILLED. WE WERE RAISED IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE WERE TAUGHT TO SEE A WORLD BEYOND OURSELVES. TO BE CONSCIOUS AND COMPASSIONATE ABOUT THE STRUGGLE OF ALL PEOPLE. WE WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE PUBLIC SERVICE IS A NOBLE CAUSE AND THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN FACT, MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN, DO SOMETHING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BASICALLY, SHE WAS SAYING, YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND STAND UP AND DO NOT GIVE UP THE FIGHT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS A DEEP ROOTED BELIEF THAT INSPIRED ME TO BECOME A LAWYER AND PROSECUTOR. IT WAS A COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM THIS SPOT 30 YEARS AGO AS A YOUNG DISTRICT ATTORNEY I WALKED INTO THE COURTROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SAID THE FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD GUIDE MY LIFE. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNEW OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS DEEPLY FLAWED. I ALSO KNEW THE PROFOUND IMPACT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ON PEOPLE LIVES. IT'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO GIVE THEM SAFETY AND DIGNITY. I KNEW I WANTED TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND I KNEW THE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WHO ARE MOST OFTEN TARGETED BY PREDATORS ARE ALSO MOST OFTEN THE VOICELESS AND VULNERABLE. I BELIEVE , [CHANTING] ON THAT POINT, I BELIEVE , I BELIEVED THEN AS I DO NOW, NO ONE SHOULD BE LEFT TO FIGHT ALONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, WE BELIEVE A HARM AGAINST ANY OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US. THAT IS WHY WHEN A CASE IS FINAL , IT DOES NOT READ THE NAME OF THE VICTIM, THAT IT READS, THE PEOPLE. THIS IS A POINT I HAVE OFTEN EXPLAINED TO COUNSEL, SURVIVORS OF CRIME, PEOPLE WHO FACE HARM OFTEN AT THE HANDS OF SOMEONE THEY TRUST, BE IT A RELATIVE OR A BANK OR A CORPORATION, I WOULD REMIND THEM, YOU ARE NOT INVISIBLE. WE ALL STAND TOGETHER. THAT IS THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE ONLY HAD ONE CLIENT, THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, A FIGHT NOT JUST AGAINST PREDATORS, BUT A FIGHT AGAINST VIOLENCE AND STIGMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANS FIGHTING FOR A MORE FAIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN THE PREVENTION AND A REDEMPTION WERE NOT IN THE VOCABULARY OR MINDSET OF MOST DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. WE CREATED AN INITIATIVE TO GIVE JOB TRAINING AND SET OF JAIL TIME FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO HAD BEEN DEFRAUDED BY BANKS AND WERE MOVING THEIR HOMES BY THE MILLIONS IN THE GREAT RECESSION. SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM BIG BANKS, I WITNESSED THE ARROGANCE OF POWER. WEALTHY BANKERS ACCUSING INNOCENT HOMEOWNERS OF FAULT AS IF WALL STREET'S MESS WAS OF THE PEOPLES MAKING. WE WENT AFTER THE FIVE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE U.S. WE $120 BILLION FOR CALIFORNIA. WE PASSED THE STRONGEST ANTI-FORECLOSURE LAW IN THE U.S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DID THAT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING TRANSNATIONAL GANGS WHO TRAFFIC GUNS AND HUMAN BEINGS. THEY ARE PERSISTENT AND RUTHLESS. ON THE SUBJECT OF TRANSNATIONAL GANGS, LET'S BE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT'S MEDIEVAL VANITY PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO STOP THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [DRUMMING] IN THE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE, TO HOLD THIS ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE, I HAVE SEEN THE AMAZING SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DURING THE HEALTH CARE FIGHT, I SAW PARENTS AND CHILDREN WITH GRAVE ILLNESSES WALK THE HALLS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS. FAMILIES WHO TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT INCREDIBLE SACRIFICE. THEY CAME TO OUR NATIONS CAPITAL , BELIEVING IF THEIR STORIES WERE HEARD AND IF THEY WERE SEEN, THEIR LEADERS WOULD DO THE RIGHT RING. , RIGHT THING. I SAW THE SAME THING WITH OUR DREAMERS. THEY CAME BY THE THOUSANDS, PLANE, TRAIN, AUTOMOBILE. THEY WERE SLEEPING ON SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM FLOOR. THEY CAME BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN AT HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET SURVIVORS WHO SHARE THEIR DEEPEST AND MOST PAINFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WHO TOLD STORIES THEY HAVE NEVER BEFORE REVEALED EVEN TO THEIR CLOSEST LOVED ONES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IF THEY WERE SEEN, THEIR LEADERS WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROTECT THE HIGHER COURT IN OUR LAND. TOGETHER, WE TOOK ON THESE BATTLES AND TO BE SURE WE WON AND WE HAVE LOST. WE HAVE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. WE ARE HERE KNOWING, WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ARE UNDER ATTACK AND ON THE LINE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE HERE AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE WE MUST ANSWER A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. WHO ARE WE? WHO ARE WE AS AMERICANS? LET'S ANSWER THAT QUESTION TO THE WORLD AND TO EACH OTHER RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. AMERICA, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS WHO BULLY AND ATTACK THE FREE PRESS AND UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WHITE SUPREMACISTS MARCH AND MURDER IN CHARLOTTESVILLE OR MASSACRE INNOCENT WORSHIPERS IN A PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE CHILDREN IN CAGES CRYING FOR THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS, DON'T YOU DARE CALL THAT BORDER SECURITY. THAT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS WHO ATTACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND VILIFY PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN BANKERS WHO CRASHED OUR ECONOMY GET BONUSES, BUT THE WORKERS WHO BROUGHT OUR COUNTRY BACK CANNOT EVEN GET A RAISE, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE BARELY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, WHAT IS THIS ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE? THEIR RESPONSE IS TO TRY AND TAKE HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. [BOOING] THEIR RESPONSE IS TO GIVE AWAY $1 TRILLION TO CORPORATIONS. [BOOING] THEIR RESPONSE IS TO BLAME IMMIGRANTS AS THE SOURCE OF OUR PROBLEMS. [BOOING] LET'S UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING. PEOPLE IN POWER ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE US THE VILLAINS IN OUR AMERICAN STORY IS EACH OTHER. THAT IS NOT OUR STORY. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS NOT ABOUT US VERSUS THEM, IT IS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THIS MOMENT, WE MUST ALL SPEAK TROOPS ABOUT , SPEAK TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, SEEK TRUTH, SPEAK TRUTH, AND FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHALL WE? [LAUGHTER] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. OUR ECONOMY TODAY IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. THE COST OF LIVING IS GOING UP BUT PAYCHECKS ARE NOT KEEPING UP. FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, A DECENT RETIREMENT FEELS OUT OF REACH AND THE AMERICAN DREAM FEELS OUT OF TOUCH. THE TRUTH IS, OUR PEOPLE ARE DROWNING IN DEBT. RECORD STUDENT LOAN DEBT. CAR LOAN DEBT. CREDIT CARD DEBT. RESORTING TO PAYDAY LENDERS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE BILLS. PEOPLE ARE DROWNING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF AMERICANS LIVING WITH A SINKING FEAR THEY WILL NOT DO AS WELL AS THEIR PARENTS. WOMEN ARE PAID ON AVERAGE $.80 ON THE DOLLAR, BLACK WOMAN, $.63, LATINAS, $.53. HERE IS THE THING. WHEN WE LIFT UP THE WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, WE LIFT UP THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY, WE LIFT UP THE FAMILIES OF OUR COUNTRY, AND THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND IF IT'S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK ANOTHER TRUTH. BIG PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE UNLEASHED AN OPIOID CRISIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA COAST TO THE MOUNTAINS OF WEST VIRGINIA, AND PEOPLE, ONCE AND FOR ALL, WE HAVE GOT A CALL DRUG ADDICTION WHAT IT IS , A NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS, FROM WILDFIRES IN THE WEST TO HURRICANES IN THE EAST, TO FLOODS AND DROUGHT IN THE HEARTLAND, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUY THE LIE. WE ARE GOING TO ACT BASED ON SCIENCE FACT, NOT SCIENCE FICTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK AND UNCOMFORTABLE BUT HONEST TRUTH WITH ONE ANOTHER. RACISM, SEXISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL IN THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TOO MANY BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS ARE BEING LOCKED UP, FROM MASS INCARCERATION, THE CASH BAIL, TO POLICING, OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS DRASTIC REPAIR. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, AMERICA'S POSITION IN THE WORLD HAS NEVER BEEN WEAKER. WHEN DEMOCRATIC VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK AROUND THE GLOBE, WHEN AUTHORITARIANISM IS ON THE MARCH, WHEN NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IS ON THE RISE, WHEN WE HAVE FOREIGN POWERS INVESTING , IN FASTING THE WHITE HOUSE , INFESTING THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE MALWARE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT OUR CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. AND LET'S SPEAK THE BIGGEST TRUTH, THE BIGGEST TRUTH OF ALL. IN THE FACE OF POWERFUL FORCES TRYING TO SO HATE , SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONGST US, THE TRUTH IS THAT AS AMERICANS, WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND LET'S NOT BUY THE STUFF THAT SOME FOLKS ARE TRYING TO PEDDLE. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES, WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND IT YOU KNOW, SOME WILL SAY, WE NEED TO SEARCH TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND. HERE IS WHAT I SAY. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE ALREADY STANDING ON COMMON GROUND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I SAY WE RISE TOGETHER OR WE FALL TOGETHER AS ONE NATION, INDIVISIBLE. AND I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT UNITY FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. HEAR ME OUT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT UNITY FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOME FACADE OF UNITY. AND I BELIEVE WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WORD UNITY HAS OFTEN BEEN USED TO SHUT PEOPLE UP OR PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL, LET'S REMEMBER, WHEN WOMEN FOUGHT FOR SUFFRAGE, THOSE IN POWER SAID THEY WERE DIVIDING THE SEXES AND DISTURBING THE PEACE. LET'S REMEMBER, WHEN ABOLITIONISTS SPOKE OUT AND CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS MARCHED, THEIR OPPRESSORS SAID THEY WERE DIVIDING THE RACES AND VIOLATING THE WORD OF GOD. BUT FREDERICK DOUGLASS SAID IT BEST, AND HARRIET TUBMAN AND DR. KING KNEW, TO LOVE THE RELIGION OF JESUS IS TO HATE THE RELIGION OF THE SLAVE MASTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE TRUE UNITY, NO ONE WILL BE SUBJUGATED FOR OTHERS. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR A COUNTRY WITH EQUAL TREATMENT, COLLECTIVE PURPOSE, AND FREEDOM FOR ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE FIGHT AHEAD AND WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. WITH FAITH IN GOD, WITH FIDELITY TO COUNTRY, AND WITH THE FIGHTING SPIRIT I GOT FROM MY MOTHER , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WILL TELL YOU , I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I LOVE MY COUNTRY, I LOVE MY COUNTRY. I AM RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR ALL PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM RUNNING TO FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE THE ECONOMY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. FOR AN AMERICA WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PAY THE BILLS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL DELIVER THE LARGEST WORKING AND MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT IN A GENERATION, UP TO $500 PER MONTH TO HELP AMERICA'S FAMILIES MAKE INTIMATE , MAKE END'S MEET. AND WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY REVERSING THIS ADMINISTRATIONS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP CORPORATIONS AND TOP 1%. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM RUNNING TO FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE OUR DEMOCRACY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL HONOR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS SO THAT NO ONE WHO HAS SERVED THIS COUNTRY HAS TO WAIT IN LINE FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS TO GET WHAT THEY ARE OWED WHEN THEY RETURN HOME, ON THE FIRST DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AN AMERICA WHERE EVERY PARENT CAN SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WITHOUT BEING HAUNTED BY THE HORROR OF YET ANOTHER KILLING SPREE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHERE RETREAT ATTACKS ON VOTING RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AS ATTACKS ON OUR COUNTRY ITSELF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AN AMERICA WHERE OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR SISTERS AND OUR MOTHERS AND OUR GRANDMOTHERS ARE RESPECTED WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHERE THEY WORK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE WE KEEP OUR WORD, AND WHERE WE HONOR OUR PROMISES, BECAUSE THAT IS OUR AMERICA. AND THAT IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. THAT IS THE AMERICA I KNOW WE BELIEVE IN. AND AS WE EMBARK ON THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I AM NOT PERFECT. LORD KNOWS I AM NOT PERFECT. BUT I WILL ALWAYS SPEAK WITH DECENCY AND MORAL CLARITY, AND TREAT ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL LEAD WITH INTEGRITY AND I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND, OF COURSE, WE KNOW THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY, GUYS. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE DOUBTERS WILL SAY. IT IS THE SAME THING THEY HAVE ALWAYS SAID. THEY WILL SAY, IT'S NOT YOUR TIME. THEY WILL SAY, WAIT YOUR TURN. THEY WILL SAY, THE ODDS ARE LONG. THEY WILL SAY, IT CAN'T BE DONE. BUT AMERICA'S STORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE WHAT CAN BE, I'M BURDENED , UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THAT IS OUR STORY. THAT IS OUR STORY. AND AS ROBERT KENNEDY MANY YEARS AGO SAID, ONLY THOSE WHO DARE TO FAIL GREATLY CAN EVER ACHIEVE GREATLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE ALSO SAID, I DO NOT LIGHTLY DISMISS THE DANGERS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF CHALLENGING AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. BUT THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY TIMES, AND THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY ELECTION. HE SAID, AT STAKE IS NOT SIMPLY THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR PARTY AND EVEN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS OUR RIGHT TO MORAL LEADERSHIP OF THIS PLANET. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO TODAY I SAY TO YOU, MY FRIENDS, THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY TIMES AND THIS WILL NOT BE AN ORDINARY ELECTION. BUT THIS IS OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SO HERE IS THE THING, IT IS UP TO US, IT IS UP TO US, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. SO LET'S REMEMBER, IN THIS FIGHT, WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE CAN ACHIEVE THE DREAMS OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. WE CAN HEAL OUR NATION. WE CAN GIVE OUR CHILDREN THE FUTURE THEY DESERVE. WE CAN RECLAIM THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EVERY, SINGLE PERSON IN OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS] AND LET'S DO IT TOGETHER, AND LET'S START NOW, AND I THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music)(music) [MUSIC] (music)(music) [INDISCERNIBLE] [APPLAUSE] [PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE] [INDISCERNIBLE] OUR C-SPAN ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE CONTINUING AS WE WAIT FOR THIS EVENT WITH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE KAMALA HARRIS TO GET UNDERWAY AND AS WE WAIT, LET'S BRING YOU A PORTION OF \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL.\" INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW IVAN EILAND IS ON YOUR SCREEN. HE STUDIES THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND POWERS OF BOTH. WHEN IT COMES TO DECLARING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, FROM WHERE DOES A PRESIDENT DERIVE THAT SPECIFIC POWER? THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION WILL FROWN ON ANY DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY POWER. THIS HAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME AS THE EXECUTIVE HAS BECOME MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN FRAMERS INTENDED. THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION, TO GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND, THEY SORT OF REJECTED THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY PARADIGM BECAUSE THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION IS NOT SET UP TO BE EFFICIENT LEGISLATION. PEOPLE CRITICIZE CONGRESS OR GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON FOR NOT BEING MORE EFFICIENT PASSING THINGS BUT OF COURSE THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS UP. THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IS PRIMARILY TO SPREAD OUT POWER SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TYRANNY AND NOT ONLY THE TYRANNY OF THE EXECUTIVE BECAUSE THEY HAD THE KING GEORGE MODEL OF BRITAIN IN MIND BUT ALSO LEGISLATIVE TYRANNY BECAUSE THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THEY FELT WAS A TYRANNICAL BODY, AS WELL, EFFECT ON THEM. SO WHAT THEY DID WAS, THE ONLY THING THAT RESEMBLES THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION IS THAT THEY CAN SUSPEND, RAISE HABEAS CORPUS, DURING INVASIONS OR INSURRECTIONS. THOSE ARE PRETTY DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY DON'T MENTION A GENERAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT. THIS DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY HAVE BEEN TRIVIALIZED AND THEY WERE BUILDING UP IN THE EARLY 1970'S, I THINK, HUNDREDS OF THEM. I THINK ALMOST 500 AT ONCE. SO THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT OF 1976 WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO SUNSET SOME OF THOSE AND REIN IN THE PRACTICE. WELL, IT REINED IN TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE NOW WE ONLY HAVE 30 AND WE HAD 59 SINCE THEN AND SOME HAVE GONE AWAY BUT WE HAVE ABOUT 31 RIGHT NOW. SO ONE MIGHT ASK, WELL, IS THIS ALL THAT SERIOUS? WELL, MOST OF THESE EMERGENCIES HAVE BEEN USED TO SANCTION OTHER COUNTRIES AND THERE'S BEEN LARGELY AN AGREEMENT, THERE'S BEEN ABUSE BY THE EXECUTIVE BUT CONGRESS HAS ABDICATED AUTHORITY BY ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN SO WE SORT OF TRIVIALIZE THESE THINGS. (music)(music) [MUSIC] (music)(music) HI, EVERYONE. HI! IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU! IT'S GREAT TO BE IN THE GRANITE STATE! THANK YOU, GUYS! ALL RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE A WHILE. THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I CALLED TERRY BEFORE MY VISIT TO JUST CHECK IN AND GET SOME ADVICE AND COUNSEL. YOU HAVE BEEN A TRAIL BLAZER IN YOUR CAREER AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR ROLE OF LEAPER , LEADERSHIP AND FOR INTRODUCING ME THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S A HOLIDAY. IT IS SNOWING OUTSIDE AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR TIME BUT THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN TO SPEND IT BEING HERE MEANS THE WORLD TO ME AND OBVIOUSLY IS A REFLECTION OF THE LEADERS WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM AND HOW MUCH WE ALL CARE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY SO I THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I JUST ARRIVED THIS MORNING AND THE PRESS , I DID A COUPLE OF, LIKE THEY CALL IT A GAGGLE. A COUPLE OF PRESS INTERVIEWS. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS, I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM. [LAUGHTER] GET THE ELEPHANTS OUT OF THE ROOM. I INTEND TO COMPETE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I INTEND TO SPEND TIME HERE. I INTEND TO SHAKE EVERY HAND THAT I POSSIBLY CAN. I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU. I WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU. I WANT TO BE CHALLENGED BY YOU. I WANT TO ENSURE THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE ARE RELEVANT AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WILL BE ACHIEVED IS BY SPENDING TIME WITH LEADERS SUCH AS THOSE IN THIS CHURCH AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MANY CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN DEPTH SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU I PLAN ON SPENDING TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I PLAN ON COMPETING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I PLAN ON DOING VERY WELL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] SO THAT IS MY INTENTION. AND I AM GOING TO WORK TOWARD IT. SO I AM HERE TO LISTEN, NOT EVEN MORE THAN I INTEND TO TALK BUT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A FEW THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR A CONVERSATION AND TAKE QUESTIONS. WE ANNOUNCED THIS CAMPAIGN JUST A LITTLE OVER THREE WEEKS AGO, IN MY HOME TOWN OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME, WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? SO I'LL TELL YOU. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE, I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. AND I KNOW WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF. I KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, THE VALUES, THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED AND I'M PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR THOSE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AN AMERICA TODAY WHERE AMERICAN VALUES AND THE AMERICAN DREAM ARE UNDER ATTACK AND WE HAVE GOT TO STAND TO DEFEND THOSE DREAMS AND IDEALS AND VALUES. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME TO RESTORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST A FEW, NOT JUST THE TOP 1%, NOT JUST BIG CORPORATIONS, BUT EVERYONE. AND RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY WE ARE LOOKING AT EXTREME INEQUITIES AND WE HAVE TO CORRECT COURSE AND I GUESS THE FINAL PLAN IS THERE. MY SISTER AND I , SHE'S HERE, MAYA. WE WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO, WHEN WE'D COME HOME AND TALK ABOUT THIS HAPPENED OR THIS PROBLEM AND COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, THE FIRST THING SHE'D SAY IS, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] SO THERE YOU GO. SO IT IS A TIME TO RESTORE TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. MANY OF YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND INCLUDES, AND THE SPEAKER TOLD YOU PART OF MY BACKGROUND WAS I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR MANY YEARS. I PROSECUTED EVERYTHING INCLUDING HOMICIDES. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME TO RESTORE TRUTH AND JUSTICE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. IT'S AN INFLECTION POINT. WE'RE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING EACH OF US AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN A MIRROR AND ASK THIS QUESTION , WHO ARE WE? AND I BELIEVE PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT FOR THOSE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THAT WORD \"JUSTICE.\" SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN. IT IS NOT JUSTICE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU GIVE A ONE TRILLION DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO THE TOP 1% AND THE BIG CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. THAT IS NOT JUSTICE. IT IS NOT JUSTICE WHEN WE SEPARATE BABIES FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AT THE BORDER. [APPLAUSE] AND CLAIM , AND CLAIM THAT THAT'S ABOUT BORDER SECURITY WHEN, IN FACT, WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. IT IS NOT JUSTICE, IN A COUNTRY THAT , THAT VALUES CIVIL SOCIETY, THAT WE DO NOT PASS GUN SAFETY LAWS BECAUSE OF FEAR OF LOBBYISTS , [CHEERING] INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR VALUES SHOULD BE ABOUT PROTECTING OUR BABIES WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL, PROTECTING PEOPLE WHERE THEY WORSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SHOULD NEVER BOW DOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID THAT WE MAY NOT WIN RE-ELECTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE DYING IN OUR STREETS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE. TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTH. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO RIGHTLY ARE FEELING QUITE DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AND LEADERS AND THE THING ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS THIS. THE VERY NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS SUCH THAT IT IS A RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUST IS TRUTH. BUT THERE IS A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. SPEAKING TRUTH OFTEN MAKES PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THESE MICROPHONES AND STAND BEHIND PODIUMS, THERE IS AN INCENTIVE THAT WHEN WE SPEAK, EVERYONE WILL FEEL LOVELY AND THEY WILL APPLAUD AND SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST ALL OVER THE ROOM, AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE HAD A GOOD DAY. SPEAKING TRUTH DOESN'T ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. HERE IS THE OTHER THING WHICH WE ALL KNOW. PEOPLE MAY WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION THINKING, I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I HAD TO HEAR. PEOPLE WILL ALSO WALK AWAY KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION. SO LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTHS. AS WE ATTEMPT TO RESTORE TRUST. YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE KNOW THAT ALMOST HALF OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY, THAT IT WILL PULL THEM IN A SPIRAL, WE KNOW WE MUST SPEAK TRUTH THAT AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. WHEN WE KNOW THAT IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, IN DO NOT , IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES OF THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR A FULL BEDROOM APARTMENT. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW AMERICA IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHY I PROPOSE WE CHANGE THE TAX CODE TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND IN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO WORKING FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, I PROPOSE A TAX CREDIT THAT THEY GET TO COLLECT $500 A MONTH TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO WALK AROUND TOUTING THE ECONOMY IS GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY TALKING TO FOLKS. I AM MEETING FOLKS WHO SAY, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS, I AM WORKING. I AM WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS. MY WAGES AREN'T MEETING THE COST OF LIVING, GAS, RENT, UTILITIES. WE HAVE GOT TO SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT EDUCATION. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. NOT SO MUCH OF THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S AGREE. [APPLAUSE] THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO PUT THE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INSTEAD WE ARE PUTTING TONS OF MONEY INTO A SYSTEM OF MASS INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] BECAUSE WE ARE NOT BEING SMART ABOUT INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT PUTS IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT TALKS MORE ABOUT GRIZZLY BEARS THAN CHILDREN WHO NEEDS (music) RESOURCES. AND IS TRYING TO PRIVATIZE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, MANY IF NOT MOST AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE JUST SHORT OF BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO PAY A HOSPITAL BILL. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND THAT THE TRUTH ALSO IS HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE A PRIVILEGE, IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IF CHARLOTTESVILLE DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, IF THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANSFORMING A , TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THEM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND LET'S SPEAK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTHS THAT THIS TIME MUST BE SPOKEN WHEN WE HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FORCES THAT ARE TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTH I BELIEVE WE MUST KNOW IN OUR HEADS AND HEARTS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. WE ARE A BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSE COUNTRY. LOOK AT THE WEATHER OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW AND IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE IN HAWAII RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIVERSITY, OF RELIGION AND RACE AND ETHNICITY AT TOPOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRY GREW WE COULD GO ON AND ON WE ARE A BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSE COUNTRY. SOME WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITHIN DIVERSITY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE UNITY. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENCES. HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE UNITY. I WILL TO YOU THIS. THE WAY WE ACHIEVE UNITY IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES, WE ARE DIVERSE AND HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT SOME OF US CALL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THOUGHT. OTHERS THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. THE WITCHING HOUR, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP WITH THAT THING THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU IN A COLD SWEAT, FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP, HAD THAT MOMENT THINKING THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WAITING ON US, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME DEMOGRAPHIC A POLLSTER PUT US IN. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF VERY FEW THINGS, PERSONAL HEALTH, THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN, PARENTS. FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, CAN I KEEP A JOB, PAY THE BILLS, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY? FOR SO MANY PARENTS, CAN I GET MY CHILD ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? FOR SO MANY STUDENTS, CAN I PAY OFF THOSE STUDENT LOANS? THE MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AS WE GO FORWARD AND FIGHT THIS GOOD FIGHT, LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT. LET'S NOT LET ANYONE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM US. [APPLAUSE] AND LET'S REMEMBER OUR STRENGTHS AS A NATION. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT THAT HAS HAPPENED THAT HAS CAUSED US TO SHOUT AT THE TV, THROW THINGS, INDIVIDUAL GROUP THERAPY. [LAUGHTER] BUT LET'S HOLD ON TO SOMETHING. LET'S HOLD ON TO AN IMAGE I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT I HAVE WITNESSED IN , I HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE TWO YEARS. MY OFFICE IS IN THE HRART BUILDING ON THE FIRST FLOOR. I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF DREAMERS DESCEND ON OUR NATIONS CAPITAL TRAVELING BY BUS, TRAIN, CAR, SLEEPING I AM SURE 10 DEEP ON SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM FLOOR, MERGING THE HALLS OF CONGRESS BELIEVING THAT IF THEY ARE SEEN AND THEIR STORIES HEARD, IT WILL MATTER. I HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING WITH THESE TEENAGERS FROM PARKLAND AND THEIR PARENTS TRAVELING, MERGING. REQUIRING , MARCHING, REQUIRING PEOPLE TO SEE AND HEAR THEM. I SAW IT WITH PARENTS WHO CAME WITH CHILDREN TO FIGHT DURING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHO BROUGHT CHILDREN AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISABILITY, FAMILIES FOR WHOM IT IS AN EFFORT TO MOVE THE CHILD FROM ONE ROOM OF THE HOUSE TO ANOTHER. TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WALKING THOSE HOLES, BELIEVING IF THEY WERE SEEN AND THEIR STORIES HEARD, IT WOULD MATTER. I TALKED WITH SURVIVORS AROUND THE KAVANAUGH HEARING WHO BY THE HUNDREDS, MOST OF WHOM HAD NEVER TOLD THEIR STORY TO ANYONE AND HAD THE COURAGE AND THE CONVICTION TO TRAVEL TO OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, BELIEVING IF THEY WERE HEARD, IT WOULDN'T , IT WOULD MATTER. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER IN THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. CONVICTION AND HOPEFULNESS. WE CANNOT LOSE THAT. WE MUST HOLD ON TO THAT AS WE GO FORWARD TO 2020. WE MUST REMEMBER WE ARE A NATION THAT PART OF OUR STRENGTH IS THOSE PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED, THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE WRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE IDEALS BEHIND THOSE WORDS WE HAVE SPOKEN IN 1776 THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUALS. PART OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION IS WE WERE FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS AND WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE. WE ARE AN ASPIRATIONAL NATION. LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NOT MET THOSE IDEALS. WE KNOW THAT. BUT OUR NATURE IS TO FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THEM. WE CANNOT LOSE THAT ASPIRATIONAL NATURE BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR STRENGTH. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS MOMENT, THAT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND WHO WE ARE. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS, AND THEN QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS, WHATEVER ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SAY. YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, THEY WILL LOOK IN EACH OF OUR EYES. YOU MAY LOOK IN SOMEBODY'S EYES. THEY WILL LOOK, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, AND THEY WILL ASK US WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT INFLECTION MOMENT? WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY IS WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THIS CHURCH TOGETHER AND OUR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH MORE THAN HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT. OUR ANSWER WILL BE WHAT WE DID, WHAT ACTION WE TOOK THAT WE STOOD UP, STOOD OUT, WE STOOD UP, MARCHED, SHOUTED, DID EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. [APPLAUSE] OK, QUESTIONS? OK, THEY TOLD ME I GET TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION. I HEAR A LOT EVERY DAY ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME A PARTY OF THE COASTS. I ALSO HERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE TELLING ME WE HAVE TO HAVE , THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED THAN EVER ABOUT THE CANDIDATE COMING OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY THAT CAN ACTUALLY WIN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. MY QUESTION IS WHAT WILL YOUR CAMPAIGN LOOK LIKE AND HOW WILL YOU REACH YOUR MESSAGE TO THE HEARTLAND OF OUR COUNTRY? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. FOR STARTERS I PLAN ON PROSECUTING THE CASE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DO NOT TELL THE TRUTH AND WHO ARE PURVEYORS OF THE INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT CASE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF INJUSTICE AND A LACK OF TRUTH AND COMMITMENT TO WORKING PEOPLE. IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE A MATTER OF UNDERSTANDING BACK TO THE COMMONALITY. I REJECT THE NOTION THAT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE BORN , YOU DON'T IDENTIFY WITH OR CARE OR CONNECT WITH SOMEONE ELSE. ULTIMATELY THIS ELECTION WILL COME DOWN TO WHO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BELIEVES WILL BE A LEADER . A LEADER IN A WAY THAT ALSO UNDERSTANDS POWER IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING AND CARING AND HAVING AN INTEREST IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE OTHER THAN ONESELF. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN ACTING ON THEIR NEEDS AS OPPOSED TO SELF INTEREST. AND ULTIMATELY MY EXPERIENCE HAVING RUN AN OFFICE OF OVER 5000 PEOPLE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE WORK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE WORK I KNOW IT HAPPENED AROUND REALLY RESTORING AMERICA'S ROLE AND STANDING ON THE GLOBE IS GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I AM PREPARED TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] HI, TAKE , THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH. THAT IS REFRESHING AND I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT MEDICARE FOR ALL. I HAVE A 14-YEAR-OLD SON WHO HAS A LIFE-THREATENING DISABILITY. HE REQUIRES MEDICATION HE CARRIES WITH HIM EVERYWHERE HE GOES AND HAS SINCE HE WAS TWO AND WILL THE REST OF HIS LIFE. WE HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF DRUG RICES BEING RISEN , PRICES RAISING. SO I AM WONDERING IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER COSPONSORING A SENATE BILL, 102, THE DRUG COMPANY PRICING BILL THAT WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DRUG COMPANIES DOING THIS, USING MONOPOLIES BY TAKING PATENTS FROM DRUG COMPANIES WHEN THEY EXPLOIT CONSUMERS IN THIS WAY AND PARTICULARLY WITH CHARGING AMERICAN 10 TIMES MORE THAN PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL SAFER FOR MY SON IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I THINK I AM ON THAT LEGISLATION. I KNOW I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE IN THE PAST. I CAN CHECK ON THAT, BUT FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO TELL YOUR STORY. I THINK MORE PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE YOU AND PARENTS LIKE YOU AND INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOU AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO GO THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE FAR TOO MANY ARE PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NEEDS HEALTH CARE OR BE THE FAMILY MEMBER AND LOVING SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO GO THROUGH THIS SYSTEM. I WILL SHARE YOU MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. MY MOTHER, WHO RAISED US, PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO. AFTER HAVING CANCER. MY MOTHER WAS A FEROCIOUS WOMAN WHO AFTER YOU MET HER YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL BUT SHE WAS FIVE FEET. SHE WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER AND HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE, TO RAISE HER DAUGHTERS AND END BREAST CANCER. SHE ENDED UP HAVING CANCER. GOING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM WITH HER, YOU KNOW, I WILL NEVER FORGET MEETING A NURSE WHO SAID HAS ANYONE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT ANTICIPATORY GRIEF? I HAD NEVER HEARD THE TERM BUT IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH SOMEONE FACING AN ACUTE ILLNESS AND YOU ARE ALREADY GRIEVING THEIR DEPARTURE, YOU DON'T REALIZE IT. YOU ARE GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OF HOPING THAT YOUR SON IS NOT IN PAIN, OF MONITORING THE REACTION THAT SOMEONE HAS TO THE MEDICATION THEY ARE BEING GIVEN, MAKING SURE THAT THE MEDICAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TREATING THEM ARE ON TOP OF THEIR NEEDS AND ARE RESPONDING TO THE FEEDBACK THEY ARE GIVING, MAKING SURE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN BE CREATIVE AND GIVING SOMETHING THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY EAT OR WANT TO EAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE. WORRYING PHYSICALLY WHERE THEY WILL BE WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TWO GO THROUGH THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL , I DON'T WANT TO SAY BURDEN. IT IS WHAT YOU DO, BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. THEN ON TOP OF THAT TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO PAY THAT BILL, THAT IS NOT THE SIGN OF A CIVIL SOCIETY. MY MOTHER DID HAVE MEDICARE. IT WAS NOT OUR CONCERN BUT IT IS THE CONCERN OF MANY IN THE SYSTEM. A CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO ARE , LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPIOID CRISIS IN AMERICA TODAY. THESE AFFIRMANCE OR COMPANIES ARE PUSHING THIS DRUG KNOWING OF ITS SIDE EFFECTS AND NOT APPROPRIATELY INFORMING THE PUBLIC. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE BEEN GOUGED, THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN COUCHED IN TERMS OF ANY DRUGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE THROUGH RECOVERY. IT IS A SYSTEM THAT IS IMMORAL BECAUSE THE WAY IT IS WORKING RIGHT NOW AND THE WAY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE WORKING, FOR THE MOST PART IT IS CLEAR THEIR MOTIVATION IS PROFIT, NOT PUBLIC HEALTH. [APPLAUSE] IT IS IMMORAL WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH, TALKING ABOUT HEALTH AND SO MEDICARE FOR ALL, ONE OF THE REASONS I SUPPORT IT IS BECAUSE WHEN IT WOULD BE ACHIEVED, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF OF ALL OF US AGAINST THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. WHICH MEANS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING DOWN PRICES AND HAVE MORE INFLUENCE AROUND GREATER ACCESS TO GENERICS AND NOT HAVE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SHUTDOWN COMPETITION BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID COMPETITION MEANS THE PRICES WOULD GO DOWN AND THE QUALITY MIGHT GO UP. I AM I IN BOARD , I AM ALL ON BOARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR STORY. I KNOW IT IS NOT EASY. HOW ABOUT RIGHT HERE? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. I AM PART OF A GRASSROOTS INDIVISIBLE NEW HAMPSHIRE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WORKING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO OPPOSE VOTER SUPPRESSION. YOU MAY REMEMBER NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS GROUND ZERO FOR VOTER SUPPRESSION IN 2016 WHEN TRUMP DECLARED BUSLOADS OF THE LEGAL VOTERS THE REASON HE LOST THE STATE TO HILLARY CLINTON. THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE JOINED THE KOVAC COMMISSION AND VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS WERE PASSED. VOTING RIGHTS IS A CORE ISSUE FOR ME AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS. I AM AN ACLU VOTER AND CARE ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES. MY QUESTION IS WHAT YOU COMMIT TO PASSING A MODERN VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE STATES TO ADOPT SAME DAY AND AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION AND EXPAND EARLY AND MAIL IN VOTING OPPORTUNITIES AND MAKE ELECTION DAY A NATIONAL HOLIDAY? ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. ABSOLUTELY, NO QUESTION. [APPLAUSE] AND IF I MAY, I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR POINT. IN THE 2018 ELECTION CYCLE WE SAW MASSIVE VOTER SUPPRESSION TAKING PLACE. REMEMBER 2013 THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN SHELBY VERSUS HOLDER GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. IT HAD ONLY BEEN AROUND LIKE 50 YEARS. PART OF WHAT IT GUTTED WAS THE PROVISION THAT RECOGNIZED CERTAIN STATES HAD A HISTORY OF VOTER SUPPRESSION AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE MONITORED. IT REMOVED THE REQUIREMENT BASICALLY OF MONITORING THOSE STATES. GUESS WHAT HAPPENED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS? SOMETHING LIKE 20 SOMETHING STATES, THEIR LEGISLATURES, PUT IN PLACE VOTER RESTRICTIONS TO THE POINT THAT ONE, THERE WAS A CASE OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA WAS CHALLENGED BECAUSE IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY RESTRICTIVE. THE COURT OF APPEALS SAID, I WILL QUOTE, THAT THE LAW THEY PUT IN PLACE WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT , \"WITH SURGICAL PRECISION ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE BLACK VOTERS FROM VOTING.\" WE SAW IT IN 2015 AROUND NATIVE AMERICAN VOTERS GREW WE SAW IT IN 2018 WITH STUDENTS. VOTER SUPPRESSION IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE NATION. I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT IT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS TO ALL OF THE LEADERS HERE. 2020, WE ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO SEE THESE ATTEMPTS HAPPEN AGAIN, SO LET'S BE PREPARED FOR IT, RIGHT , WE WILL LITIGATE. THE ACLU DOES AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB AREAS SO DOES THE NAACP. , JOB. SO DOES THE NAACP. WHAT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO IT AS ORGANIZERS IS THINK ABOUT HOW WE WILL AND START DOING IT NOW, HOW WE WILL TRY AND MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO VOTE BECAUSE WE CAN GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE SUPPRESSION. AND THE SECOND POINT, THE OTHER VOTER MANIPULATION IS RUSSIA. LET'S GET READY. LET'S GET READY FOR THAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TOOLS SADLY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN USED TO VOTER SUPPRESSION IN THE CLASSIC WAY, THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER THING. I HAVE A BILL, BIPARTISAN BILL, WITH A REPUBLICAN FROM OKLAHOMA, HE AND I ARE THE ONLY TWO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TO HAVE SERVED ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND SENATE INTELLIGENCE AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAVE A BILL THAT BASICALLY WOULD REQUIRE STATES TO UPGRADE ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE GOING BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE BEST AND SMARTEST WAY, PAPER BALLOTS. PAPER BALLOTS. I JOKE AND I SAY PAPER BALLOTS BECAUSE RUSSIA CAN'T HACK A PIECE OF PAPER. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT LATEST VERSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN AROUND ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS WE VOTE. COUNT ME IN. HI. I AM THE UNION , I AM A UNION MAN. [APPLAUSE] UP UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE AT THE NAVAL SHIPYARD, 40 YEARS AT THE SHIPYARD. [APPLAUSE] I AM SURE THERE ARE UNION BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS ROOM, SHIPYARDERS IN THIS ROOM. PERSONALLY I AM TIRED OF THE WAY LABOR UNIONS AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE BEING VILIFIED AND SUBJECTED TO TERRIBLE LEGISLATION THAT IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I WANT TO KNOW SENATOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW AS A SENATOR AND WHAT YOU WILL DO AS PRESIDENT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR UNIONS AND TO HELP RESTORE THE REALITY OF THE DIGNITY OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] I AGREE WITH YOU. LET ME START FROM THE BEGINNING. I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED ORGANIZED LABOR. THEY HAVE LONG SUPPORTED ME. I HAVE WALKED PICKET LINES. I AM WITH YOU. THERE HAS BEEN AN EROSION OF LABOR AND ORGANIZED LABOR AND WE HAVE SEEN IT IN WISCONSIN AND OTHERS BECAUSE THERE ARE POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT NO WHEN WORKING PEOPLE UNITE ESPECIALLY AROUND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THAT WORKING IN THE WIN. THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE DECIDED IT IS A ZERO-SUM GAME NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WORKING PEOPLE WIN, AMERICA WINS, THAT WHEN WORKING PEOPLE HAVE THE WAGES AND BENEFITS COMMENSURATE WITH THE VALUE THEY PERFORM BUT IT FLIPS , IT UPLIFTS FAMILIES AND SOCIETY WE HAVE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A WHOLESALE ATTACK ON ORGANIZED LABOR. HAVE SEEN IT IN PARTICULAR OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I WILL STAND WITH LABOR. WE GOT THE FIVE DAY WORK WEEK. THE HOLIDAY HAVE TODAY, RIGHT? SICK LEAVE? WE DON'T HAVE FAMILY PAID LEAVE BUT WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. ANY WORKING PERSON OWES A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO ORGANIZED LABOR IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] HOW ABOUT LET'S GO OVER HERE? THERE IS A MIC READY. I WAS TRYING NOT TO GO TOO LONG WITH ALL OF MY TRUTHS BUT LET'S SPEAK A TRUTH THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS. CLIMATE CHANGE ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] , CHANGE IS REAL, AND IT POSES AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] LET'S ALL BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A METEOR THAT MIGHT HIT THE PLANET. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIORS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING DIRECTLY TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIORS THAT ARE RESULTING , YOU KNOW IT HERE IN THIS REGION, TO WHAT WE NEED AROUND CLEAN DRINKING WATER. OUR NEED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR, AND WE ARE AT A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE ABOUT TO THROW AWAY THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. IT IS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS WITH A GREAT SENSE OF URGENCY. I WILL TELL YOU I FIND IT OUTRAGEOUS AND MALPRACTICE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE YOU WRITING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF , BUYING SCIENCE-FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT, THAT THERE IS A HAND TRYING TO FEED BIG COAL AND OIL INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET. OUR ROLE OF LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE NOT EVEN BEGUN THIS EVENING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE SEETHING , WE ARE CEDING OUR POSITION AMONG NEIGHBORS AROUND THE GLOBE . IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. [APPLAUSE] I AM SUPPORTING THE GREEN NEW DEAL. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE HAVE TO HAVE GOALS, AND WE HAVE TO , IT IS A REVOLUTION THAT REQUIRES US TO HAVE GOALS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE AND WHAT METRICS ON IT. SOME OF THEM WILL ACHIEVE, SOME OF THEM WE WILL NOT. IF WE DON'T ASPIRE, THIS WILL BE A BAD ENDING. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE AN ALARMIST BUT IT IS VERY REAL AND WITHIN OUR POWER. IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES WE HAVE SEEN AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. BUT THIS IS A CHALLENGE OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE LEADERS. CLEARLY WE DON'T HAVE A LEADER IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. IN THE LAST 15 OR 20 YEARS, SUICIDE RATES HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE. I HAVE SEEN THE SHORTCOMINGS THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OFFERS ITS PATIENCE. I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOUR ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO TO ALLEVIATE THIS. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY WE SHOULD HAVE A NATIONAL POLICY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT ON DEMAND. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT I AM PROPOSING. JUST LIKE YOU CAN GO INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM ANYWHERE AND GET CARE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK INTO A TREATMENT FACILITY AND RECEIVE CARE. WHAT WE KNOW WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM SUICIDE RATES TO DRUG ADDICTION, THERE WAS A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN EITHER THE PRESENCE IN AREAS OF RESEARCH OR NOT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE AS A COUNTRY IS WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO PUT RESOURCES INTO CREATING INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO GO INTO THOSE PROFESSIONS AND HAVE NOT DONE AN ADEQUATE JOB OF CREATING INCENTIVES FOR THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHERE THEY ARE TO COME TO REMOTE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE HAD SOME OF THE HIGHEST NEED FOR THAT KIND OF TREATMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE ALSO FAILED IN TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES. WE HAVE FAILED TO GIVE GOOD REIMBURSEMENT RATES. ALSO IT SOMETIMES DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE PROFESSION TO BE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NOT LARGE POPULATIONS. THAT IS A FAILING OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THOSE ARE HOTSPOTS IN TERMS OF THE NEED AND DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED. IT IS VERY MUCH A PRIORITY FOR ME. WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. LOOKING AT MEDICARE FOR ALL, WE HAVE TO TWEAK IN THAT SYSTEM LOOKING UP WHERE WE ARE CREATING INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE AND WORK. MY FINAL POINT WOULD BE , I COULD GO ON AND ON , TELEMEDICINE. WE SHOULD ALWAYS REALIZE THERE ARE BAD ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGY AND GOOD. THE BAD IS THAT, STEALING OUR PRIVACY AND WE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, BUT THE BENEFIT OF TECHNOLOGY, AN EXAMPLE OF BENEFIT IS TELEMEDICINE WHICH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS ARE AGREEING IS A WAY TO GET SERVICES TO REMOTE AREAS THAT OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THOSE PLACES. I AM A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE BUT I AM ALSO ONE OF 10.2 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS NOT PROTECTED BY DR.. , PROTECTED BY DACA. [APPLAUSE] MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS, I KNOW LIKE A LOT OF POLITICIANS SPEAK ABOUT DREAMERS AND HOW YOU WILL PROTECTED THEM AND HOW THEY BRING SO MUCH TO THIS COUNTRY BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY PARENTS AND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE IN WAR ZONES AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THEM. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WILL DO TO PROTECT THEM AND OTHER STUDENTS LIKE ME BUT MORE IMPORTANT LATELY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS WHO NOBODY REALLY LISTENS TO? WE ARE LISTENING TO YOU, AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO STAND UP. YOU ARE RIGHT. THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION IS NOT A MONOLITH, TO THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION. THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC SUBSETS UNDER THAT HEADING THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AND UNDERSTOOD INCLUDING THE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WHO DID NOT RECEIVE DACA PROTECTION AND ARE HERE CONTRIBUTING AND IDENTIFYING IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT WANTING TO STAY AND WANTING TO BE PROTECTED. FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. WE ARE NOT , IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT A GOAL. THERE IS NO TASK RIGHT NOW FOR , NO PATH RIGHT NOW FOR CITIZENSHIP. THERE IS NO PATH. WE HAVE 11 MILLION, 12 MILLION PEOPLE , LUNCH TIME 11 MILLION PEOPLE FOR WHICH THERE IS NO REAL PATH. SO IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO NOT COME UP WITH A PLAN AREA THERE HAS BEEN BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT SIGN ANY OF THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS CREATED A FICTION ABOUT A CRISIS AT THE BORDER AND HE HAS HELD UP THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS WORKERS AROUND HIS VANITY PROJECT CALLED A WALL. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL ISSUES, AND IT IS A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL ISSUES. SO THE PLAN HAS TO BE, I SAY TO YOU, YOU YOUNG LEADER, THAT WE HAVE TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER AND WE HAVE TO PASS GOVERNANCE OF REFORM. THE POINT YOU MADE OF PARENTS, STUDENTS, IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I WAS IN THOSE ROOMS AND IT WAS A FIGHT TO SAY, THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT WE DO HAVE DECIDED THE POSTER CHILD FOR ADORATION, THESE CHILDREN HAVE PARENTS WHO LOVE THEM. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A POLICY THAT SAYS, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS BUT NOT THE PARENTS THAT ARE RAISING THEM? THAT IS WRONG. THE POINT ALSO IS THE POLICY HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE PARENTS WHO WORK HARD, LOVE THEM AND THERE SHOULD BE A PLAN FOR THE PARENTS. OTHERWISE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A POLICY THAT WILL AGAIN SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM PARENTS. IMAGINE ANYONE OF US WITH OUR COLLEGE AGE KIDS AND THE POLICY IS THE KID CAN STAY IN YOU HAVE GOT TO GO AWAY , AND YOU HAVE GOT TO GO AWAY? YOU ARE RIGHT TO RAISE THE SUBJECT. THERE MUST BE A PLAN FOR THE PARENTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND UNDERSTANDING IT WOULD NOT BE CIVIL AND IT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING ANYONE OF US WOULD WANT WHICH IS A POLICY THAT SAYS THE KID CAN STAY IN THE PARENTS HAVE TO LEAVE. MY NAME IS BRENDA. I LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH. MY HUSBAND PASSED AWAY IN 2017 AFTER 12.5 YEARS LIVING WITH YOUNGER ONSET ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. MY MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED AT 92 GREAT SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S LAST SUMMER. AS YOU KNOW, 5.7 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH ALZHEIMER'S TODAY AT A COST OF $277 BILLION. IT IS ANTICIPATED BY 2050 WE WILL HAVE 14 MILLION AMERICANS ENTR'ACTE , ENTR'ACTE , I UNDERSTAND THE MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL TOLL THE DISEASE TAKES. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WHEN MY SISTER IS PRESCRIBED MEDICATION THERAPY UOB BE THE SAME , THERAPY, IT WILL BE THE SAME FROM 23 YEARS AGO. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HALT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND DEVASTATING DISEASE? THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU ARE AMAZING AND THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A LOT. AND IT IS ABOUT THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILY TO THE POINT OF YOUR STORY BECAUSE THERE IS A COMMUNITY AROUND THIS ISSUE. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH SUPPORTING WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AROUND RESEARCH. NIH FUNDING. THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR EXAMPLE HAS MADE IT ONE OF THE LOWEST PRIORITIES. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT VALUES OF THE RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO RESEARCH MOTIVATED BY WHO IS PAYING. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A MATTER OF RESEARCH. THE INCENTIVES IN TERMS OF THE MEDICATION, AND I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS ABOUT THIS, MAYBE WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON YOUR THOUGHTS, BUT THE LACK OF INCENTIVES FOR RESEARCH AROUND MEDICATION AS IT RELATES TO ALZHEIMER PATIENTS AND REALLY PART OF THE ISSUE IS WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE CREATING GOOD GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVES AROUND AN AGING POPULATION AS A GENERAL MATTER. TO YOUR POINT WE ARE STUCK IN DECADES-OLD RESEARCH AND APPROACHES AND PROTOCOLS INSTEAD OF UPGRADING IT. IT IS ON MY RADAR. NIH IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AS A GENERAL MATTER WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY IN TERMS OF SENIORS AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR LIVES ARE EXTENDED WITH HEALTH NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET BECAUSE THE MODEL IS BASED ON A DIFFERENT RANGE OF LIFE, FRANKLY. I WILL ADD TO THAT POINT THE OPIOID CRISIS. WHAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS , I WILL JUMP INTO THAT SUBJECT, NOT TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SENIORS WHO ARE MEDICATED AND PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN OF AGING AND THE ADDICTION THAT IS COMING FROM THAT, THAT IS NOT BEING DIAGNOSED AND TREATED. WHEN WE COUPLE THAT WITH ALSO THE FACT WE HAVE SO MANY SENIORS WHO ARE RAISING AND CAREGIVING FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE THE PARENTS OF THAT CHILD IS ADDICTED, AND WHAT WE ARE DOING OR NOT DOING TO SUPPORT THOSE GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE DEALING WITH THEIR OWN HEALTH NEEDS AND RAISING A GENERATION THAT IN PREVIOUS TIMES THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO RAISE. THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO AS IT RELATES TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SENIORS. I APPRECIATE YOUR STORY. I HAVE A COMMENT. YOU WERE TERRIFIC ON CNN. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. FIRST TIME WE GET TO SEE YOU. HOW DO YOU HELP AMERICANS GIVE BACK , GET BACK TO THE VALUES? YOU SEE THE POLLS THAT ARE 80% SOME KIND OF GUN CONTROL AND WE STILL HAVE GUNS. WHAT IS CURIOUS TO ME IS THE SENATE, ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, CAN TURN THEIR BACK ON AN 80% POLL TO PUT SOME KIND OF CONTROL IN. HOW DO YOU HELP AMERICANS? [APPLAUSE] I LIKE YOUR SAYING FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS HOW IT WAS CONSTRUCTED. HOW DO YOU HELP AMERICANS TOUCH BACK TO THEIR VALUES? THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU SAID. PART OF IT IS I BELIEVE REMINDING US WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND OPERATING FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THE PERSPECTIVE OF GUN VIOLENCE, OPERATING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MOTHER OR FATHER THAT LOST THEIR CHILD OR, AND THIS IS AN ALL TOO COMMON EXPERIENCE, WHEREVER THAT PARENTS MAY BE, LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT AND LOOKING UP BULLETPROOF BACKPACKS. YEAH, THAT PARENT HAVING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN THE KID COMES HOME ABOUT THE DRILL THEY HAD IN CLASS TAUGHT THEM TO RUN INTO A CLOSET AND BE QUIET AND TURN DOWN THEIR CELL PHONE IF THERE IS A SHOOTER IN THE CLASSROOM. THE COMMONALITY BETWEEN THE PARENT WHO LOST THEIR CHILD IN THE MESS SHOOTING AND THE MOTHER OR FATHER WHO IS LIVING IN A CITY WHERE GUN VIOLENCE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN BLACK AND BROWN MEN AND UNDERSTANDING THE COMMONALITY OF THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LOSS OF THEIR CHILD AND BRINGING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE LOST OUR VALUES. I THINK WE NEED A RESURGENCE AND REMINDER OF THE FACT THAT WE ALL AT OUR KITCHEN TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN, WE HAVE THE SAME VALUES. IT IS A MATTER OF AGREEING AND DECLARING WE ARE OPERATING FROM THE SAME PLACE AND NOT BUYING INTO THE IDEA THAT IT IS US VERSUS THEM AND WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON. WE HAVE TO ACT ON OUR VALUES. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE , YOU MENTIONED THE TOWN HALL, BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. THE SCALE , THE FAILURE TO ACT ON GUN VIOLENCE IS , WE CAN ACT, BUT LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT THE ISSUE IS. THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT WE ARE WAITING FOR ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THE TRAGEDY TO GET EVERYONE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SANDY HOOK, 20 SIX AND SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BABIES WERE SLAUGHTERED. WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR THE NEXT TRAGEDY. I WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M VISITED , I VISITED MOTHER EMMANUEL CHURCH WHERE THEY WERE PRAYING, AT BIBLE STUDY AND A GUNMAN COMES IN AND SLAUGHTERS THEM. WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR ANOTHER TRAGEDY. THAT IS NOT IT. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WE ARE WAITING FOR THE GOOD IDEA. WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR THE GOOD IDEA AND WE HAVE HAD THEM ALL. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? IT IS THIS IN ITS ESSENCE. YOU WANT TO BUY A GUN? WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND BY A COURT TO BE A DANGER TO YOUR SELF OR OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE WE LET YOU. [APPLAUSE] UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK. WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT FELONY BEFORE WE LET YOU BUY A GUN. WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR A GOOD IDEA. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR THE GOOD IDEA OF ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE WEAPONS OF WAR CLOGGING THE STREETS OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR THEM? WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR IS MEMBERS OF THE NRA IN CONGRESS HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR. AND ELECTIONS MATTER. BUT YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I WANT TO STRESS THAT IN ALL GOOD FIGHTS, GUYS, THEY ARE BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. LET'S REMEMBER WE ONCE DID HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. IT WAS NOT PERMANENT OBVIOUSLY, SO IT NEEDS TO BE RENEWED, BUT WE HAVE BEEN THERE IS MY POINT. THIS IS ACHIEVABLE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT AND WE CANNOT GIVE UP. [APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION. SPEAKING OF TRUTH TELLING AND HOLIDAYS, WE HAVE A BILL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HB2 21, TO CHANGE COLUMBUS DAY TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY. TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE THAT IS MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL ISSUE, TO ME AS SOMEONE BORN AND RAISED AND WENT TO SCHOOL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, COLUMBUS GOT A LOT OF FOCUS AND HE NEVER STEPPED FOOT ON MAINLAND NORTH AMERICA. GENOCIDAL HISTORY ASIDE, AND WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO ELEVATE VOICES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO ARE STILL HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT ARE BEING ERASED AND MARGINALIZED EVERY DAY. I AM WONDERING WOULD YOU SUPPORT EFFORTS ON A FEDERAL LEVEL TO SUPPORT CHANGING TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY AND WHY DOES THAT MATTER SO MUCH? [APPLAUSE] WHY IT MATTERS IS, TO YOUR POINT, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HISTORY. THIS QUESTION REALLY IS CONNECTED TO THE LAST QUESTION ABOUT MORALS AND OUR COMPASS, AND\/OR GOALS AND OUR ASPIRATIONS. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER OUR HISTORY. UNCOMFORTABLE TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TRUTH, THOUGH IT MAY MAKE US. LAST WEEK , WE WROTE A BUDDHA , A BILL IN MY OFFICE, 200 YEARS, COULDN'T GET PAST IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE WROTE A BILL TO MAKE LYNCHING A FEDERAL CRIME. [APPLAUSE] IT FINALLY GOT PAST. IN THE SENATE. IT IS STILL GOING OVER TO THE HOUSE. HERE IS THE THING. WHY, YOU ASK, WHY? IT WILL BE THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019 ONLY THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. PART OF IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL AND ACCEPT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ADMIT THAT WE ARE THE SCENE OF A CRIME WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE DID WITH SLAVERY AND JIM CROW AND INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO BE HONEST. BECAUSE IF WE ARE NOT HONEST WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THE VESTIGES OF ALL OF THAT HARM AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO CORRECT COURSE. WE WILL NOT BE TRUE TO OUR VALUES AND MORALS. SO SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO INDIGENOUS AMERICANS, THE PEOPLE, THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO. I APPRECIATE AND APPLAUD YOUR POINT AND EFFORT AND COUNT ME IN ON SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS.

I WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW I PLAN ON COMPETING HARD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] AND I PLAN ON DOING WELL HERE. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WHEN WE RUN THIS ELECTION AND WHEN WE RUN OUR CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY THAT WE NOT ONLY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF THE INTENTION TO WIN BUT FRANKLY THE WAY THAT I WILL MEASURE OUR SUCCESS IS NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT OF THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. THE ONLY WAY I THINK TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE RELEVANT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING TIME WITH LEADERS AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE INFORMED, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WHO CARE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I PERSONALLY SPEND TIME IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I'M BEING CHALLENGED AND WHERE I'M LISTENING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN I TALKED. SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN BEAUTIFUL STATE AND I APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO FAR. SO I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET INTO A GROUP CONVERSATION AND BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PART OF THIS MORNING. BUT AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, I AM A CAREER PROSECUTOR BY MOST OF MY CAREER. I WAS BORN IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. A DAUGHTER OF TWO PARTICIPANTS , PARENTS WHO ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THERE. SO MY SISTER MIA AND I, MY SISTER IS HERE, WE GREW THAT UP WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND AMONG THE HEROES, OF COURSE, THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WERE THE LAWYERS. THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SCHOOL OF THE PROFESSION AS LAW. TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND TO DO THE WORK THAT WE MUST BE DONE OF REMINDING OF GREAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776. WE ARE ALL AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. AT A YOUNG AGE I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER AND I WENT TO HOWARD AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, AND RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I JOINED THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH HAS REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE YEARS BEFORE EARL WARREN RAN THAT OFFICE. WHEN I DECIDED TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE THAT QUESTIONED THAT DECISION. MY SISTER WENT TO RUN ACLU. BUT WHAT I SAID THEN AND WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER AS PROSECUTOR , I WAS A COURTROOM TRIAL LAWYER, I PROSECUTED EVERYTHING INCLUDING HOMICIDE CASES. I WAS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF A MAJOR CITY. I WENT ON TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MY STATE. WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER PROSECUTOR IS THIS, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS A PROFOUND AND DIRECT IMPACT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING PEOPLE SAFETY, TO GIVE THEM DIGNITY. I ALSO BELIEVE HAVING KNOWN THE SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR REFORM OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THAT AS WELL. AND SO OF THE MANY PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF THE VOTERS WILL HAVE ME AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ONE OF THEM WILL BE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SMARTER AROUND WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND WILL ENJOY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DISTRUSTFUL OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AND ITS LEADERS, AND WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL AS WE GO FORWARD . THE NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUST IS SUCH THAT IT IS RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS IN TRUST IS TRUTH. BUT THERE'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. AND AS ROOM OF LEADERS WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH IS SPEAKING TRUTH CAN OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. WHEN YOU STAND BEHIND MICROPHONES LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE AT A PODIUM LIKE THIS THERE'S INCENTIVE THAT WHEN WE SEEK THE , WE SPEAK THE CROWD AND EVERYONE WILL FEEL LOVELY AND SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST IN THE ROOM AND THE JOB WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. SPEAKING TRUTH DOES NOT ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH IS THIS. YES, PEOPLE WILL WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION SAYING I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE WHAT I HAD TO HEAR BUT THEY'LL ALSO WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION . AND AS WE PROCEED IN THIS CAMPAIGN YEAR I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS LEADERS WE SPEAK TRUTH WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT OFFENDING OUR , OR MAKING PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT WITH THE PURPOSE OF DEALING WITH ISSUES AND INSPIRING TRUST AMONG THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. SO IN THAT CONTEXT I WILL MENTION A FEW ISSUES THAT I THINK NEED TO BE SPOKEN AND A WAY THAT'S ABOUT THE TRUTH. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. THE ECONOMY IN AMERICA TODAY IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I SAY , THAT. I SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA, THE FACTS THAT TELL US THAT ALMOST HALF OF AMERICAN FAMILIES TODAY CANNOT AFFORD A $400 EMERGENCY OR UNINFECTED EXPENSE. , UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. THAT $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE THAT THE CAR BREAKS DOWN, MEDICAL BILL THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WILL CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THEIR FOOTING OR GOING TO FINANCIAL SPIRAL. THAT'S A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY IS THAT IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. THAT IS A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. SO THIS DISCUSSION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS NOT ABOUT SAYING, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HARD AND GAINED SUCCESS TO BE VILIFIED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I APPLAUD THAT. THAT'S PURSUIT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE AND IF WE HAVE HONEST CONVERSATION WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE RULES AREN'T APPLYING EQUALLY TO ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY HAD EQUAL ACCESS TO A PATH TOWARDS SUCCESS AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CORRECT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, I PROPOSE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE MAKING LESS THAN $100,000, THE FAMILY IS MAKING LESS THAN A $100,000 A YEAR, I'M PROPOSING THAT WE CHANGE OUR TAX CODE TO GIVE THOSE FAMILIES UP TO A $6,000 TAX CREDIT THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE A $500 A MONTH. SO THEY CAN MEET THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL SAY THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY TODAY THAT IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT. WELL, NOT SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK, HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE GREATNESS OF THE ECONOMY? AND PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. WELL, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY. YEAH, PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT ABOUT WAGES. WAGES FOR THE MOST PART REMAIN STAGNANT WHILE THE COST OF LIVING, TUITION, GAS, HOUSING KEEPS GOING UP. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE TRUTHS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S SOME COURSE CORRECTION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO ON THE SUBJECT OF RENTERS, FOR EXAMPLE, I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ISSUE HERE. THE OTHER PROPOSAL THAT I OFFER IS THAT IF A RENTER IS PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT PLUS UTILITIES, THAT THEY GET A TAX CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COST OF THEIR RENT. SO THAT'S A SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LONGER AND MORE IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION THERE. ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION, LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION BUT NOT SO MUCH THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR MOST OF OUR CHILDREN. AND WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT. WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES AND, AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY. I'VE MET TEACHERS WHO ARE WORKING TWO JOBS, SOMETIMES THREE TO NOT ONLY PAY THE BILL BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING OUT OF POCKET ON A CONSISTENT BASIS TO PAY FOR THE TOOLS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOM TO ACTUALLY BE EDUCATED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PUTTING THE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WE SHOULD. I WILL TELL YOU MY PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS IS VAST. MY FIRST-GRADE TEACHER, MRS. FRANCES, GOD REST HER SOUL ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL , GRADUATION. IT WAS A TIME IN AMERICA WHERE WE WERE PAYING PUBLIC TEACHERS THEIR VALUE. UNDERSTANDING THAT IN ADDITION TO PARENTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE , RAISING OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR TEACHERS AND WE MUST GIVE THEM THE VALUE OF WHAT THEY ARE GIVING US IN RETURN. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK MORE TRUTH. CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. AND IT IS POSING EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS HUMAN BEINGS AND WE MUST NOT ONLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, WE MUST HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS. I WAS IN PORTSMOUTH YESTERDAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE IN TERMS OF DECLINE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DECLINE, WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT WILL BE UNDER WATER. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED AT THE UNITED STATES SENATE I WAS , WELL, I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I'M ON SEVERAL COMMITTEES. I'M ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I'M HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND I'M ON JUDICIARY AND I'M ON BUDGET. IN ADDITION, WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE I WAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC WORKS. SO I SAT IN HEARINGS WHERE I KID YOU NOT, ONE OF THE HEARINGS WE HAD, THE PREMISE OF THE HEARING WAS ESSENTIALLY TO SCIENCE THE BASIS OF PUBLIC POLICY. FURTHER BACKGROUND ABOUT ME. MY SISTER AND I WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. MY MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER AND SHE HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS AND END BREAST CANCER. WE SHOULD TAKE US TO THE LAB WITH HER. WE WOULD GO AFTER SCHOOL ON WEEKENDS. I GREW UP AROUND THE PEOPLE WHO THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE FOR BEING WAS TO USE RESEARCH AND FACTS AND SCIENCE IN A WAY THAT COULD IMPROVE HUMAN CONDITION. AND WE RIGHT NOW ARE IN A SITUATION, HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION WHO HAS AMERICAN PUBLIC BUY SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT, TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. [APPLAUSE] TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. AND YOU KNOW, I JOKE ABOUT IT ON THIS ISSUE. LOOK, I CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ANY PARTICULAR DESIRE TO HUG A TREE , BUT I HAVE A VERY STRONG DESIRE TO HUG A HEALTHY BABY. AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THIS IS A MATTER THAT INCLUDES WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR. LET'S TALK TRUTH AND FACTS. LET'S LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT, AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY LEADERS IN BUSINESS HERE, WHETHER WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. LET'S TALK TRUTH. OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS IT IS PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED AND AGREED UPON THAT OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS UP TO 40% OF THE JOBS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WILL NO LONGER EXIST. WE HAVE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT AUTOMATION IS REAL. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE IN THE MIX OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIXED OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIDSST OF AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE NOT EQUIPPING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE , AGREE WITH PART OF WHO WE ARE CULTURALLY WHICH IS HARD-WORKING , HARD WORK IS GOOD WORK. BUT YET WE AS LEADERS ARE NOT PREPARING THE WORKFORCE OF AMERICA FOR THE JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THERE'S A LIST THAT CAME OUT FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS MID-LAST YEAR THAT PROJECTS THE 20 JOBS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2026 THAT WILL SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS LIST. SHE IS ABOUT TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT LIST. YES, I AM. SO I'M GOING TO NOW GET INTO AN INTERACTIVE MOMENT IF YOU GIVE THE DACHSHUND TILDE ME FOR A MOMENT. THE 20 JOBS THAT WILL SEE THE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I WILL TAKE TWO GUESSES, JIM, OK. GUESS WHAT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO ARE. YES? SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE A LOT THAT RELATE TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT'S NOT THAT, THAT'S NOT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. YES, IN THE BACK. I KID YOU NOT. YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON. YES, TECHNOLOGY JOBS OR THEY'LL GUESS RIGHTLY BECAUSE MOST JOBS RELATE TO PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE ALSO HAVE AN AGING POPULATION. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO, INSTALLATION OF MAINTENANCE OF SOLAR PANELS AND WIND TURBINES. SO, RIGHT, RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS IS PART OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THE REASON THOSE JOBS ARE ON OUR LIST IS BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP WHERE A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE THE SKILL ED LABOR. HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR COUNTRY TO PREPARE OUR WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT HAS GOT TO INCLUDE AS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT CONVERSATION THE PRIVATE SECTOR? WHAT JOBS DO YOU NEED PERFORMED? WHAT ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THAT JOB? IT HAS TO INCLUDE OUR EDUCATORS, THERE'S SO MANY IN THIS ROOM. ARE WE AS GOVERNMENT LEADERS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT IS HAPPENING IN AN HONEST WAY? INCLUDING OUR LABOR LEADERS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WAS TALKING WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING TRADES ABOUT THIS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEY SAID. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE NEW SKILLS THAT ARE INVOLVED, THAT'S GOOD-OLD FASHION WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOREVER. PIPE FITTING, ELECTRICIANS, WELDERS. RIGHT QUESTION MARK , RIGHT. SO THE TRUTH, I WILL NOW END MY ISSUE SPOTTING. THERE ARE SEMI TRUTHS THAT WE MUST SPEAK RIGHT NOW. I WILL SAY THIS I REMAIN VERY , OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AND WHERE WE WILL GO. I BELIEVE AND I KNOW WE ALL DO, THIS IS A ROOM FULL OF LEADERS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEAS. , IDEALS. WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEALS THAT WERE BEHIND AND INFORMED THE WRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THE IDEA THAT WERE BEHIND THOSE WORDS IN 1776 THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. PART OF OUR STRENGTH AS A NATION IS WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE IDEALS. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NEVER QUITE REACHED THOSE IDEALS BUT OUR STRENGTH IS , THAT WE FIGHT TO REACH THOSE IDEALS. AND THIS IS THE MOMENT IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE MUST KEEP FIGHTING KNOWING THAT THESE ARE NOBLE IDEALS, KNOWING THAT IS PART OF OUR STRENGTH AND PURPOSE AND JUST THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. SO I THINK OF THIS AS BEING AN EXCITING MOMENT IN TIME AND I'M HONORED THAT YOU ALL HAVE FROM YOUR BUSY LIVES IN YOUR COMMITMENTS CHOSEN TO SPEND THE MORNING WITH ME. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM YOU. [APPLAUSE] WELL DONE. WE HAVE A YOUNG STUDENT HERE, HALEY MORGAN HAS THE MICROPHONE. IF ANYONE WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION DOWN FRONT, MAYBE YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF TOO. SO THE SENATOR KING YOU , SENATOR CAN CAN GIVE YOU A STERN LOOK. INFRASTRUCTURE IS A BIG ISSUE. YES. THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT IT WHEN HE GOT ELECTED, ONE OF MY PRIORITIES. THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND CONGRESS TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROADS, BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS, IMPROVE THE ECONOMY, WE HAVE TO GET MORE JOBS. BUT THEN WHEN YOU GET IN THE WEEDS OR YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT HOW WE PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. IN LIGHT OF NATIONAL DEBT JUST WENT UP $2 TRILLION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. NOW IT IS $22 TRILLION. DO YOU RAISE GASOLINE TAX, DO YOU REVISIT THE TAX CUTS WHICH WERE PASSED BY CONGRESS AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE WERE TOO GENEROUS IN THE CORPORATE AND GOING DOWN TO 21%. MAYBE WE SHOULD REVISIT AND GO BACK UP TO 25%. MAYBE REVISIT THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. THE HIGH END, MAYBE REMAINED AT 39% AS OPPOSED , HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION? THE WAY I THINK OF IT IS THERE ARE TWO PIECES. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO REPEAL THAT TAX BILL THAT GAVE BENEFITS TO THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE TOP 1%. THEY DON'T NEED IT. IT PUT ANOTHER $1 TRILLION OF BURDEN ON THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. I ALSO BELIEVE THIS, AND I TAKE MY LEAVE FROM MY FRIENDS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO WERE SO SMART AND THE WAY THEY CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. WHICH IS WHEN ASKING ABOUT OUR EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY AND WHATEVER THE OUTLAY IS, IS IT WORTH IT? THERE IS A REALLY SIMPLE ANALYSIS CAPTURED AND THREE LETTERS. ROI. WHAT IS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT? IT'S A MISTAKE IF WE THINK ONLY IN TERMS OF COSTS AND OVERLOOK THE INVESTMENT. , INVESTMENT COMPONENT. IF BUSINESSES OVERLOOK INVESTMENT AND JUST CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH COST, WE WOULD NEVER SEE GROWTH. WE WOULD NEVER SEE INNOVATION. WHEN I LOOK AT AN ISSUE LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABOUT 150 YEARS OLD. I DON'T NEED TO TELL NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT JUST INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISREPAIR. IT'S ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY. IT IS LITERALLY , THIS IS A REMOTE LEADERS, WHICH IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH THE DETAILS. SOME WILL CALL THEM THE MUNDANE DETAILS OF WHAT IS INVOLVED IN ANY ISSUE. WHEN YOU HAVE ROADS IN BRIDGES WERE PEOPLE HALF THE TIME LANES OR SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF POTHOLES ARE SO DEEP, OR THE PERSON WHO WAS WORKING AND COMMUTING AND IN THE CAR FOR TWO HOURS, THEIR CAR KEEPS BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE THE TIRES KEEP THE FLEETING, THIS IS A , DEEFLATING. IT IS NOT EFFICIENT IN THE WAY IT'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED AND THEY ARE NOT AT A FAMILY MEAL. THESE ARE PART OF THE COSTS OF A FAILURE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFITS FOR AN THOSE ARE JOBS. TO BUILD UP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, THOSE ARE GOOD JOBS. SO WHEN I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK OF IT THAT WAY, AND LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER. INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT NOW, EIGHT USUALLY WAS ABOUT ROADS AND BRIDGES. WELL, THE LIST DOESN'T END THERE ANYMORE. IT IS ALSO WHAT NEED , WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT INVESTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES, INVESTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THAT, WATER. RIGHT NOW WARS ARE BEING FOUGHT OVER OIL, AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY WILL BE FOUGHT OVER WATER. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRIORITY AROUND WATER POLICY, UNDERSTANDING THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE AN INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND STORAGE AND CAPTURING WATER. LET'S ALSO THINK ABOUT OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE, BECAUSE I WILL ALSO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF ELECTIONS. UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY DESIGNATED ELECTIONS AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW LET'S SPEAK ANOTHER TRUTH. RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. A BILL THAT I HAVE, AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE VERY NATURE OF THE ISSUE, IT IS NOT BIPARTISAN IT IS NONPARTISAN, A COSPONSOR IS REPUBLICAN , IS A REPUBLICAN FROM OKLAHOMA. HIS NAME IS JAMES LANKFORD. HE AND I WERE THE ONLY SENATORS TO SERVE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE AT THE SAME TIME, AND WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING SO WE HAVE PROPOSED THAT PART OF THE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO BE UPGRADING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF STATES AROUND ELECTIONS BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT, FOR ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BROUGHT US, GOOD AND BAD, THE MOST SECURE WAY TO CONDUCT ELECTIONS IS PAPER BALLOTS. I SAY IT KIND OF HALF JOKING, RUSSIA CAN'T HACK A PIECE OF PAPER. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF INVESTMENT. IT WILL COST SOMETHING, BUT THE BENEFIT WILL BE OUR DEMOCRACY. THAT IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING HERE TODAY AND GIVING US A CHANCE TO KNOW YOU BETTER. MY NAME IS MARK BOYD. I AM AN AARP VOLUNTEER. AMERICANS CONTINUE TO PAY THE HIGHEST PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES IN THE WORLD. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND TAKING THEIR MEDICATION. DO YOU AGREE DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH? AND IF SO, HOW WILL YOU WORK TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND REDUCE COSTS FOR ALL AMERICA? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR BEING A VOLUNTEER WITH AARP. I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE YEARS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AARP. THERE ARE A LOT OF POINTS YOU ARE RAISING. ONE IS THE ISSUE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND FRANKLY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS IS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE PRIORITIZED IN MANY CASES PROFIT OVER PUBLIC HEALTH. SO PEOPLE ARE BEING CHARGED EXORBITANT PRICES FOR CRITICAL MEDICATION, INSULIN BEING AN EXAMPLE. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I HAVE MET WHO ARE MAKING CHOICES ABOUT PAYING THEIR RENT OR PUTTING THE MONEY INTO THE INSULIN THEY NEED TO LIVE. SO THERE HAS TO BE GREATER OVERSIGHT INTO WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND PRICING AS IT RELATES TO DRUGS, AND THAT INCLUDES OVERSIGHT AROUND GENERIC DRUGS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURING OF GENERIC DRUGS. LET'S LOOK AT THE OPIOID CRISIS. THERE IS ALSO THE REALITY THAT THERE WAS A MARKETING OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS A DRUG THAT HAS LETHAL CONSEQUENCES, WITHOUT HONEST INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS USE. THERE WAS A GREAT PROFIT INCENTIVE THERE. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION OF FAMILIES AS A RESULT OF THAT. SO THAT BRINGS UP THE POINT ABOUT OVERSIGHT AROUND NOT ONLY MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION AND PRICING, BUT ALSO ADVERTISING, AND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AROUND ADVERTISING. SPECIFIC TO AARP, AND I SAY THIS AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS AN ABJECT FAILURE. WE CRIMINALIZED WHAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER. WE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INCARCERATING WHAT IS OTHERWISE A DISEASE, AND WE ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COST OF THAT. WE PUT THIS MONEY INTO MASS INCARCERATION INSTEAD OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND TO WHAT END? SO BACK TO THE OPIOID CRISIS AND SENIORS, PART OF WHAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT, AND THE MAYOR AND I WERE DISCUSSING THAT THIS MORNING, WE ARE LOOKING AT WHOLE POPULATIONS OF SENIORS THAT ARE RAISING THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN, BECAUSE THE PARENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN , THE PARENT OF THOSE CHILDREN IS ADDICTED. AND ON TOP OF THAT IS THE IRONY THAT WE MAY BE LOOKING AT THAT SAME SENIOR WHO IS EXPERIENCING HEALTH ISSUES THAT CREATE PAIN FOR WHICH THEY ARE BEING PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS, AND WE ARE NOT TREATING THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE AND THE INCENTIVES AROUND WHAT THEY ARE GETTING AND NOT GETTING OUR UPSIDE DOWN. SO THERE HAS GOT TO BE GREATER OVERSIGHT AND WE HAVE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, WHAT IS HAPPENING, WHAT INCENTIVES ARE PRESENT AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO CORRECT COURSE. BUT THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. GOOD MORNING, SENATOR. RECENTLY THE NATION SUFFERED THROUGH THE SHUTDOWN OF THE GOVERNMENT, AN OBSCENE ATTACK ON OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY THE CONGRESS , AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT AND DURING YOUR REMAINING TENURE AS PRESIDENT TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER OCCURRING, AND THE DAMAGE IT INFLICTS? WHAT TRIGGERED THE QUESTION WAS WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT INSULIN, AND STORIES FROM GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO COULD NOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN. I WAS RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO WOULD NOT TOLERATE COMPLAINING. IF YOU STARTED COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING SHE WOULD SAY, WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING ABOUT IT. SO ON THE POINT YOU JUST RAISED, I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WE CANNOT HAVE LEADERS WHO PUT SELF-INTEREST IN FRONT OF THE INTERESTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. PUBLIC SERVICE IS NOBLE SERVICE WHEN DONE RIGHT. BUT WHEN THE POWER THAT COMES WITH THESE OFFICES IS USED FOR SELF-INTEREST, WHEN IT IS AN EXERCISE OF RAW POWER USED IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT BEATING PEOPLE DOWN AND DIMINISHING THEM AND BELITTLING THEM, WE KNOW WE NEED A CHANGE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ELECTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED A CHANGE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION AND A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO PUTS HIS VANITY PROJECTS AHEAD OF THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME BE MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. I HAVE BEEN TO THE BORDER. I PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE VERY IDEA THAT HE IS TRYING TO SAY THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO INVADE OUR COUNTRY TO COMMIT MASS CRIME IS A CRISIS OF HIS OWN MAKING. YOU TALK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE AN OATH TO PROTECT OUR BORDER, AND THEY WILL TELL YOU THE TRAFFICKING THAT IS HAPPENING OF DRUGS AND GUNS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRIES HAPPENING AT PORTS OF ENTRY. WE DON'T NEED A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR WALL. THAT WALL WASN'T GOING TO STOP THEM. WE NEED RESOURCES AT OUR PORTS OF ENTRY, AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO HAVE BORDER SECURITY. BUT THIS IS A CRISIS OF HIS OWN MAKING BECAUSE WAS A CAMPAIGN PLEDGE THAT TOOK HEAT AND PROPELLED HIM TO VICTORY, AND HE KEEPS RECITING WHAT IS A LIE. [APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO GO ON MORE, IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME. I HAVE MET THOSE WORKERS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, FEDERAL WORKERS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT RANGE FROM AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS TO PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHO PLEDGED TO TAKE AN OATH TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH OUR SAFETY, AND THEY WENT FOR A MONTH WITHOUT GETTING PAID, NOT TO MENTION THE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT WERE DIMINISHED. I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK TURNED THE CORNER WAS WHEN AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS SENT A LETTER SAYING, WE ARE BARELY SLEEPING AT NIGHT, ESSENTIALLY THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SAID, THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS FOR THERE TO BE A CRASH. WE BETTER FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT. WHY WOULD IT HAVE TO COME TO THAT, FOR THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO FIGURE OUT THAT HE IS ABUSING HIS POWER AND HE HAS GOT TO STOP? THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BOTH VERMONT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE HEALTH CENTERS, AS WELL AS WORKING FAMILIES AND THOSE VULNERABLE, AND GIVING DIGNITY AND SAFETY TO THOSE. I'M GOING TO LEAN INTO A QUESTION ABOUT THE OTHER 15 LIKELY ON THE LIST AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SUPPORTING MORE PRIMARY AND PREVENTION CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH? THAT IS THE ACCESS SIDE OF IT, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU ALSO DO ABOUT THE COVERAGE SIDE OF IT? THANK YOU. I WILL TAKE THE SECOND PART FIRST. I'M A PROPONENT OF MEDICARE FOR ALL AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE, BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY NOT CREATING INCENTIVES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE, FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE TO EXIST, MUCH LESS THRIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT MOST NEED THEM. WE HAVE COMPLETE DESERTS IN OUR COUNTRY, OF AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO TREATMENT SELL AT FACILITY OR TREATMENT PROVIDER AVAILABLE, AND THOSE ALSO HAPPEN TO BE SOME OF THE AREAS WITH HIGHER NEED. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE ON DEMAND, SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT ON DEMAND, AND BY THAT I MEAN, LIKE YOU CAN GO INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO INTO A TREATMENT FACILITY AND GET MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE AND SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT ON DEMAND. I'M GOING TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL. WE ALSO NEED NATIONAL STANDARDS AROUND WHAT IS VIABLE AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO DRUG TREATMENT, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE NATIONAL STANDARDS RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE SETTING UP TENTS AROUND DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES AND THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING THE KIND OF SUPERVISION THAT SHOULD HAPPEN ABOUT WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL AND HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN PAYING OUT-OF-POCKET TO DO THAT. THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS THAT WE NEED INCENTIVES AT A FEDERAL LEVEL FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY GO INTO THESE PROFESSIONS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEARTH OF PROFESSIONALS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS MOST IN NEED AND A LOT LARGE PART OF IT IS THE REIMBURSEMENTS. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT AND IN RURAL AREAS OF OUR COUNTRY, YOU DON'T SEE THOSE PROFESSIONALS. THE BENEFITS WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE IS TELEMEDICINE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE TECHNOLOGY CAN REALLY IMPROVE A SYSTEM OF SERVICE DELIVERY. THERE ARE SOME GREAT MODELS OF HOW IT WORKS AND WE NEED TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR MORE OF THAT. BUT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH IS A VERY REAL ISSUE. PART OF OUR FAILING IS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR, WE HAVE OVERLOOKED THE SIGNIFICANCE ALSO OF TRAUMA AND WE HAVE NOT DONE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF WORK IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF TRAUMA, WHICH LEADS TO NOT ONLY MENTAL-HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT ALSO PHYSICAL HEALTH. I COULD TALK MORE EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THAT BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER WE HAVE TO ELEVATE THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WILL KEEP IT BRIEF, BECAUSE I KNOW WE ARE AT THE END. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU SUPPORT LAWS THAT PROVIDE COMMUNITY SERVICES TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES OR SENIORS, SO THEY CAN HAVE IN-HOME SERVICES AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITY IN THEIR HOME WHERE THEY ARE BEST OFF, INSTEAD OF EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONS. AT WE HAVE LIKE THE BIGGEST AGING POPULATIONS IN THESE FEW STATES AROUND HERE, SO WE ARE GOING TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THIS HEAVILY. MY MOTHER-IN-LAW PASSED AWAY AT THE END OF OCTOBER AND WE WERE SENT HOME WITH ALMOST NO SERVICES, AND IT IS PRETTY SCARY. AND I THINK IT COMES UNDER THE TITLE OF THE DISABILITY INTEGRATION ACT THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES UNDER HEALTH CARE. THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, AND THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AROUND PUBLIC POLICY THIS IS A MOMENT WHAT WE HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE, SO MUCH OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY WAS BASED ON A LIFESPAN THAT IS MUCH SHORTER THAN THE LIFESPANS OF AMERICANS TODAY. SO WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THOSE YEARS BETWEEN 65 AND 100, LITERALLY, WE NEED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. YES? MOVING RIGHT ALONG. LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE RAY BUCKLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE, RIGHT UP FRONT. THANK YOU, RAY. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT A POLITICS AND EGGS TOTE BAG, BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME APPEAR AND MAYBE YOU COULD USE IT WISELY. WE APPRECIATE YOU STOPPING BY, WE KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY, BUSY DAY BUT YOU FOUND TIME TO COME TO POLITICS AND EGGS. YOU DID A GREAT JOB AND WE THANK YOU FOR GIVING THE COUNCIL A TREAT ON POLITICS AND EGGS A TREAT, HEARING YOUR REMARKS. THANK YOU.

I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR VOICE, AND I AM VERY HONORED YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US THIS AFTERNOON TO INTRODUCE ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I SPOKE TO A FEW OF THE FOLKS OUTSIDE, THE FIRE MARSHAL, LUCKY US. SPEAKING TO THE FOLKS OUTSIDE, ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID IS, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, I THINK SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES WE HAVE MADE, SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE HAVE MADE AN OUR MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND JUST PROGRESS , IN OUR MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND JUST PROGRESS HAS BEEN PROMPTED AND FUELED BY THE STUDENTS OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND, YET AGAIN, YOU'RE DOING IT. YOU ARE DOING IT. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH. I OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY BACK IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. I JOKE, ME AND MY SISTER JOKE WE GREW UP BY A GROUP OF ADULTS THAT WERE , SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING. YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU GUYS. [LAUGHTER] AND THAT IS HOW THE CYCLE CONTINUES. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. THE LEADERS WHO WERE IN THE ROOM OF EVERY AGE, THANK YOU FOR THIS. I WILL SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND THEN WE WILL PASS AROUND THE MIC, BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE. I TELL YOU I FULLY INTEND TO WIN THIS ELECTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT, A MEASURE OF SUCCESS FOR ME IS ALSO THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS, THAT WE WILL BE RELEVANT, AND RELEVANT IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE LISTEN AS MUCH AS WE TALK , MORE THAN WE TALK. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU JUST A LITTLE OF MY THOUGHTS. WE ANNOUNCED OUR CAMPAIGN SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN THE PLACE OF MY BIRTH, OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. WE WERE HOPING WE WOULD HAVE A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ABOUT 22,000 OVER FRIENDS SHOWED UP , OF OUR FRIENDS SHOWED UP, THAT WAS KIND OF NICE. DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROCESS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING , WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? SO I SHARE WITH THEM A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH WHAT I THINK EVERYONE HERE KNOWS. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING EACH INDIVIDUAL, AND COLLECTIVELY, TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING , WHO ARE WE? I THINK WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS THAT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] SO, THIS IS A MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRING US THEN TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. I THINK OF THIS ALSO AS BEING A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE A LEADER MUST FIGHT TO RESTORE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING. I GUESS A VERY PERSONAL REASON IS, MY SISTER AND I WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO WAS FIVE FEET TALL, BUT IF YOU HAD EVER MET HER, YOU WOULD THINK SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL. OUR MOTHER WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO IF YOU OVERCAME A , CAME HOME , IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, SHE WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, \"WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?\" SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] THERE YOU GO. [APPLAUSE] SO, LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE. CERTAINLY IN THESE LAST TWO YEARS AND SEVERAL MONTHS, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRUTH, MOSTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF TRUTH VERSUS UNTRHT , UNTRUTH. BUT I ASK WE ALSO CONSIDER ANOTHER CONTEXT, WHICH IS THIS. RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO RIGHTLY FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF DISTRESSED , DISTRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT, ITS INSTITUTIONS, AND LEADERS. THE THING ABOUT RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST, IS BY ITS VERY NATURE, A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS RECIPROCAL. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS OF TRUST IS THE TRUTH. BUT THERE IS A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. SPEAKING TRUTH CAN OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO SPEAK OFTEN BEHIND A MICROPHONE ARE BEHIND A PODIUM, THERE IS AN INCENTIVE THAT WE WILL ENGAGE IN. WE WILL MAKE EVERYONE FEEL LOVELY, SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST ALL OVER THE ROOM, PEOPLE WILL APPLAUD IN THE JOB WILL HAVE BEEN DONE. WHILE SPEAKING TRUTH, DOESN'T ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. HERE IS THE OTHER THING ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH , YES, PEOPLE MAY WALK AWAY FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THINKING THEY DID NOT LIKE PARTICULARLY WHAT I'D HAD TO HEAR, BUT THEY WILL ALSO WALK FROM THE , WALK AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATION KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE MUST SPEAK TRUTH. SO NOW, YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT ME, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TRUTHS YOU HAD IN MIND? I WILL SHARE A FEW WITH YOU. IF CHARLOTTESVILLE DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR, IF THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE COULD NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, RACISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL IN THIS COUNTRY, AND WE MUST SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, IN SPEAKING THAT TRUTH, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE BORN OUT OF HATE, HATE WHICH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS RECEIVED NEW FUEL. WE MUST AGREE THAT WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THAT HATE PRESENTS ITSELF, WE MUST ALL SPEAK OUT, SPEAK UP, AND WE MUST AGREE THAT WHOEVER IS THE TARGET OF THAT HATE, THEY SHOULD NEVER BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. THE ECONOMY OF AMERICA IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? WELL, IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, ALMOST HALF OF AMERICAN FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. $400. THAT COULD BE THE CAR BREAKING DOWN, A HOSPITAL BILL, $400 UNEXPECTED WILL COMPLETELY TOPPLE THAT FAMILY. IN AMERICAN TODAY , IN AMERICA TODAY, IN 90% OF THE COUNTIES IN OUR COUNTRY, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER FOR WORKING , WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN APARTMENT. AND OUR COUNTRY LAST YEAR, 12 MILLION PEOPLE BORROWED ON AVERAGE $400 FROM THE PAYDAY LENDER AT AN INTEREST RATE OFTEN ABOVE 300%. THESE ARE THE TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, WHICH IS WHY AS 300%. PRESIDENT, I WILL REFORM THE TAX CODE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, THEY WILL RECEIVE A $6,000 TAX CREDIT A YEAR THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH OR NOT. AND, IT IS AN INTERESTING THING, BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU THE ECONOMISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IS TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAX CUT WE WILL SEE IN GENERATIONS. THIS WILL LIFT UP ONE INTO AMERICAN FAMILIES, TWO AND THREE AMERICAN PHAROAH , TWO IN THREE AMERICAN CHILDREN. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WILL PRESENT THE QUESTION , HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? [LAUGHTER] WELL, I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THAT TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND THE GREATEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. BUT NOT SO MUCH THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. SO, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY, I HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH TEACHERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE WORKING TO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS TO PAY THE BILLS , TWO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS TO PAY THE BILLS. MONEY COMES OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, THAT BLESS HER SOUL , GOD BLESS HER SOUL, ATTENDED MY HIGH SCHOOL , LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. WE'LL HAVE MEMORIES OF THAT TEACHER WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. , WE ALL HAVE MEMORIES OF THAT TEACHER WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. WE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SPECIAL, BUT WE BELIEVED THEM, AND IT PUT US ON A PATH TO BE IN A PLACE SUCH AS THIS WHERE WE MIGHT BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S BE CLEAR, THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN , PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS AND ON SAND UNCLES , AND AUNTS AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE MAKE 10% LESS THAN SOME OF THE COLLEGE-EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS, WHICH IS WHY AS PRESIDENT, I WILL IMPLEMENT WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION, A FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT GAP ON AVERAGE IS EFFECTIVELY $13,500 A YEAR. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT $13,500 A YEAR. IN MOST PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT REPRESENTS A YEAR'S WORTH OF MORTGAGE STATEMENTS. , PAYMENTS. IT IS A YEAR'S WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. IT PUTS A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND TO MAKE A FINE POINT ON THIS, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AND ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE THAT A SOCIETY CAN EXTEND TOWARD ITS CHILDREN IS TO INVEST IN THEIR EDUCATION, AND BY EXTENSION, THAT MEANS INVESTING IN THEIR TEACHERS. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT TO WHICH EVERYONE RECEIVES AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF JUST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT, WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE LET'S BE CLEAR, IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THEIR PAIN OR SAVE THEIR LIVES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR POCKET. THAT IS IMMORAL, AND IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN FIX, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND UNDERSTAND THIS WILL BE A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT OUR VALUES ARE AS A NATION. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] NOW, HONESTLY GUYS, ISN'T IT KIND OF SET I HAD TO SAY IT THAT WAY? [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW WHY I DID? BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON DC ON THIS SUBJECT WHO REPRESENTS AN EXCESS ESSENTIAL THREAT , AN EXCESS ESSENTIAL , AND EXISTENTIAL , AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. BUT THESE LEADERS ARE PUSHING SCIENCE-FICTION INSTEAD OF COLLECTIVE , INSTEAD OF FACTS. WE ARE IN A COLLECTIVE PERIL. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IN AMERICA THIS EVENING, IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY, FAMILIES WILL SIT DOWN FOR THEIR WEEKLY, NIGHTLY DINNER, THE PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THEIR CHILDREN ACROSS THE TABLE AND ASK THEM, HONEY, HOW WAS YOUR DAY? TO WHICH THOSE CHILDREN WILL RESPOND, WASN'T A GOOD DAY. WHY, WHAT HAPPENED? TODAY, WE HAD TO HAVE A DRILL. WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW WE HAD TO GO AND HIDE IN A CLOSET IN CASE THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF OUR SCHOOL. WHY, MOMMY AND DADDY, DID WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT DRILL? TO WHICH OF COURSE THE ANSWER IS, WELL, YOU SEE, THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH SUGGESTS YOU'RE ALWAYS , EITHER IN TABLE , EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE GUNS AWAY. WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, HONESTLY, I AM KIND OF FED UP WITH THIS ISSUE. I MEAN, LOOK, SOME PEOPLE WONDER WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG? WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN? WE ALL KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE WE ARE WAITING FOR A TRAGEDY , WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF TRAGEDIES. AND I DON'T EVEN NEED TO GO DOWN THE LIST WITH YOU GUYS. WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF TRAGEDIES. THE IDEAS HAD BEEN HAD. IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE FAILING TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT. HERE IS WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, WHEN I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I AM GOING TO GIVE THE CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER, AND IF THEY DON'T, I'M GOING TO EXERCISE EXECUTIVE POWER AND DO THREE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. ONE, I AM GOING TO REQUIRE THAT ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR IS REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS. I AM GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE ATF WILL REMOVE THE LICENSES FROM ANY GUN SELLER WHO VIOLATES THE LAW. AND, I AM GOING TO REVERSE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION DID AS IT RELATES TO FUGITIVES FOR JUSTICE. THEY TOOK THEM OFF THE LIST OF PIVOTED BUYERS , OF PROHIBITED BUYERS. I AM GOING TO PUT THEM BACK ON THAT LIST. THAT IS ALL I WILL DO IF CONGRESS FAILS TO ACT. [APPLAUSE] AND JUST TO PUT A FINE POINT ON IT, ON THE ISSUE OF GUN DEALERS? BECAUSE I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE. DID YOU KNOW THAT 90% OF THE GUNS THAT ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH CRIMES ARE SOLD BY 5% OF THE DEALERS? WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IN AMERICA TODAY, THERE ARE FAMILIES AND PARENTS THAT HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH MOSTLY THEIR SONS, SOMETIMES THEIR DAUGHTERS, WHEN THAT CHILD TURNS 12 YEARS OLD TO HAVE WHAT IS CALLED \"THE TALK,\" WHEREIN THOSE PARENTS EXPLAIN, SON, YOU MAY BE STOCKED, YOU MAY BE ARRESTED , STALKED, YOU MAY BE ARRESTED, YOU MAY BE CHASTE, YOU MAY BE SHUT BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH THAT IN AMERICA TODAY WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS DEEPLY FLAWED, THAT HAS BEEN INFECTED IN MANY WAYS BY BIAS, AND THAT CAN BE REFORMED. WE SHOULD AGREE THAT IN OUR AMERICA, NO YOUNG MEN SHOULD FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN. [APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE HAVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WHO ON THAT SUBJECT, PREFERRED TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THAT WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED. THAT WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, A JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS. AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO HAVE THAT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] I COULD GO ON AND ON WITH THE TRUTH. I AM GOING TO CLOSE UP ON THIS ONE, WHICH I BELIEVE ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY POWERFUL FORCES AND VOICES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. IT IS NOT ONLY CRITICAL THAT WE SPEAK, BUT THAT WE KNOW AND FEEL IN OUR HEARTS AND IN OUR SOLE. THAT TRUTH IS THIS , THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH AND KNOW IT TO BE TRUTH. RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS WHAT I CALL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THOUGHT, THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT, THE WITCHING HOUR, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT, , THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF A SIMPLISTIC DEMOCRATIC A , DEMOGRAPHIC A POLLSTER PUT US IN. AND FOR THE MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, AND HAS TO DO WITH JUST ONE OF VERY FEW THINGS, OUR PERSONAL HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, OUR PARENTS, CAN I GET A JOB, KEEP A JOB, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY? CAN I PAY OFF THE STUDENT LOANS? FOR SO MANY FAMILIES IN AMERICA, RIGHT HERE INCLUDED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, CAN I HELP MY FAMILY MEMBER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND SO, I SAY, AS WE MARCH TO 2020, LET'S MARCH ONTO THAT KNOWING THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE. LET'S REJECT THE STUFF THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SAY IT IS US VERSUS THEM. I AM NOT BUYING THAT. I AM NOT BUYING IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SAY YOU ARE , YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE CONVERSATION IN THE MIDWEST, ANOTHER ONE DOWN SOUTH, ANOTHER ONE ON THE COAST, I AM NOT BUYING THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND SO, I ALSO SAY THIS , ON OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IS BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE IN ASPIRATIONAL PEOPLE. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1770 6 , THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY? WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THOSE IDEALS. BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS THAT WE FIGHT TO GET THERE. AND SO, LET'S OWN THAT STRENGTH. LET'S OWN THAT STRENGTH IN A WAY THAT WE FIGHT KNOWING WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. LET THIS BE A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. LET THIS BE A FIGHT THAT WE KNOW IS BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY. AND KNOWING WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THAT IS HOW I THINK OF THE TASK BEFORE US. AND MY FINAL POINT THEN IS THIS , THIS MOMENT IN TIME WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, OTHERS WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT INFLECTION MOMENT? AND PART OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SAY IS, THERE WAS THIS ONE AFTERNOON HANGING OUT AT DARTMOUTH. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHAT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN TIME , WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WHAT ACTION WE TOOK. THAT WE STEP UP. , STEPPED. UP. . , THAT WE STEPPED UP. THAT WE ORGANIZED. WE GOT PEOPLE REGISTERED TO VOTE. WE TOOK THEM TO THE POLLS, AND WE WORKED KNOWING THE POWER OF WHO WE ARE WHILE WE ARE ALL IN THIS. WHEN WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF THIS NATION IS THE PEOPLE, AND WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE CAN BE. SO YEARS FROM NOW, WE WILL TELL THEM ALL THAT AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE WON. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS ONE OF , IT IS A BIG AREA OF CONCERN FOR ME. NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO FEAR THAT BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT BRINGS RIGHT NOW. ON AVERAGE, NEW HAMPSHIRE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH $32,000 IN DEBT. BACK TO THE ISSUE I AM TALKING ABOUT WITH THE TEACHER PAY, I HAVE MET MORE TEACHERS WHO LEFT THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT AFFORD TO DO THE WORK AND PAY OFF STUDENT LOANS. ON THIS POINT, I WANT THAT STUDENT WHO MIGHT BE YOU OR ANYONE OF YOU, WHO IS EXCELLING IN SCIENCE AND HAS A PASSION TO GO TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS, I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO LOOK OUT ON YOUR FUTURE AND NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENT LOAN THAT YOU ARE FACING AND THE COST OF LIVING AND THEN DECIDE INSTEAD OF GOING TO TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS, I HAVE TO GO AND JOIN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, OR WALL STREET BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO TEACH. THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES THAT COME WITH THE ISSUE OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT ONE IS ABOUT A BURDEN, A REAL BURDEN, EMOTIONALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, AND FINANCIALLY AS WELL AS WHAT WILL END UP BEING CAREER DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PAY THE BILL AS OPPOSED TO FOLLOWING YOUR PASSION AND DOING SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GROWING OUR SOCIETY. THESE ARE THE WAYS I THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. FIRST OF ALL, YES, TUITION FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, DEBT-FREE COLLEGE. NEXT, WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO LET STUDENTS REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT. FOR EXAMPLE, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE ANY OF YOU, BUT A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS BEFORE, IF THEY TOOK OUT THEIR LOANS BETWEEN 2006 IN 2013, THEY WERE LOOKING AT ABOUT 7% INTEREST RATE. I AM PROPOSING THAT WOULD BE RENEGOTIATED TO 3.5%. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN AND ACTUALLY BANNED THE SYSTEM SO THAT THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE IS GOING TO BE INCOME-BASED. SO, IT WOULD BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE MAKING. THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WILL GO BACK TO MY DAYS AS BEING AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO WERE DEFRAUDING CONSUMERS, IS THE NUMBER OF PREDATORY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUT THERE WHO ARE SERVICING LOANS BUT REALLY IN A PREDATORY WAY THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STUDENTS. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THEM AND PROSECUTE THEM WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGED IN WRONG BEHAVIOR. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN, FINALLY, SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF THE ENTRY POINT IS SIMPLIFY THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCESS. ALL THE STUDENTS HERE KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS AWFUL. IT IS JUST AWFUL AND IT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN HAVE ACCESS AND KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO. THOSE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] NATALIA ASKED, HOW DO WE PLAN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO GET SOMETHING DONE, RIGHT? I HEAR YOU. HERE'S THE THING. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS BIPARTISAN WORK THAT IS HAPPENING. I AM VERY PLEASED AND EXCITED TO HAVE TWO PIECES OF SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION THAT DO SOME VERY IMPORTANT WORK. ONE, I AM SPONSORING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REFORM THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ISSUE AND AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE SITTING IN JAIL FOR DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS EVEN POTENTIALLY YEARS WAITING TO GO TO TRIAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR BACK POCKET TO PAY FOR BAIL TO GET OUT WHILE THEY ARE PENDING TRIAL. I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD BASICALLY CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM. MY COSPONSOR, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T AGREE ON MOST OF ANYTHING, HIS NAME IS RAND PAUL, A REPUBLICAN FROM KENTUCKY. HE IS MICHAEL COSPONSOR AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] , HE IS MY COSPONSOR AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] HE SAID, KAMALA, APPALACHIA LOVES IT. GETTING BACK TO THE EARLIER POINT, THE BEST MAJORITY OF US HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. ANOTHER BILL DEALING WITH A VERY BIG ISSUE THAT DEALS WITH CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ELECTION AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS ELECTION SECURITY. SO, I SIT ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, AND WE RECEIVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE VULNERABILITIES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT WE ARE VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE WITH OUR ELECTIONS. I AM WORKING WITH A REPUBLICAN FROM OKLAHOMA, AND WE HAVE A BILL THAT WILL UPGRADE ALL OF THE STATES' ELECTIONS SYSTEMS, AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE MOST SECURITY , THE MOST SECURE WAY TO VOTE HIS PAPER. , IS PAPER. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE REPUBLICAN DEALER , REPUBLICAN LEADER WOULD BE ON THE FLOOR FOR A BOAT, WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED, BUT THERE IS BIPARTISAN WORK HAPPENING. I WILL SAY THIS ALSO. AFTER THE SELECTION, IT IS MY INTENTION , AFTER THIS ELECTION, IT IS MY INTENTION TO BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER AND TO SAY WE HAVE GOT TO FIX SOME THINGS. BECAUSE PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE FRUSTRATION WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS US STARING AT OUR BELLY BUTTON. THE WORLD IS PASSING US BY. WE HAVE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT ARE BEING NEGLECTED IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE BECOMING WEAKER BECAUSE OF IT. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. AIN'T NOBODY ELSE GOING TO COME IN HERE AND FIX OUR PROBLEMS. IF WE DON'T DO IT, WHO WILL? WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT GLOBALIZATION, AT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO COMPETE ON A MUCH BIGGER PLANE, WE BETTER GET OUR ACT TOGETHER. AND MOST OF THE INTRACTABLE ISSUES THAT WE MUST ADDRESS ARE NOT EVEN BIPARTISAN. I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THEY ARE NONPARTISAN. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE REAL LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP, AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

[CHEERS & APPLAUSE] SO I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THEIR CAMPAIGN STAFFS FOR BEING HERE NOT ONLY TODAY BUT FOR BEING HERE IN IOWA AND WORKING SO HARD ALL ACROSS OUR STATE TO HELP ORGANIZE AND CONNECT WITH VOTERS AND REJECTED PEOPLE IN ALL CORNERS OF OUR STATE. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE OUR AWARD WINNERS TODAY, FRED AND CHARLOTTE, RIGHT, CINDY, ELWOOD, MEGAN, AND THE SIOUX COUNTY DEMOCRATS. ALL OF YOU REPRESENT SOME OF THE BEST ADVOCATES AND VOLUNTEERS NOT ONLY IN OUR STATEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. ALL OF YOU HELP SHAPE OUR COUNTRY AND CONTINUE TO PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE TO MOVE OUR PARTY FORWARD. SO ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS EVERYWHERE, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE, THE WORK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO, AND THE WORK THAT YOU WILL DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY REMAINS ONE OF THE BEST STATE PARTIES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND, FINALLY, I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. NOW, AS YOU CAN TELL, BY THE LARGE AMOUNT OF PRESS WE HAVE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM AND THE CROWDS THAT YOU SO WHEN YOU WALKED IN, THIS IS THE LARGEST GATHERING OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TODAY. [APPLAUSE] AND SO ALL OF YOU TODAY COME ALL OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY REPRESENTS ONCE AGAIN THAT I WAS DEMOCRATS TAKE OUR ROLE AS FIRST IN THE NATION SERIOUSLY. YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CANDIDATES SOME OF THE ISSUES FACING OUR COMMUNITIES, SCHOOLS, TOWNS, AND URBAN CENTERS. WE BEGIN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU AND OTHERS LIKE YOU ALL ACROSS THE BEST WAY TO KICK THE TIRES AND TEST OUR CANDIDATES. AND WE KEEP THIS PROCESS, BECAUSE WHEN I WILL COMMIT SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES WILL DISCOVER THAT THERE ARE NO HARDER WORKING VOLUNTEERS IN THE COUNTRY THAN IOWA DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND BEING A PART OF THIS PROCESS NOT ONLY TODAY BUT EVERY DAY IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. THIS YEAR, WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES TO CHOOSE FROM. YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHO HAVE POKED FUN AT THE SIZE OF OUR FIELD. JUST BEFORE I CAME IN HERE, I SAW THE COUNTERPARTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF IOWA CALLING THIS A CIRCUS. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WILL BE THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THIS OUTSTANDING FIELD OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEMONSTRATE THE AMAZING DIVERSITY OF OUR PARTY, THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, THE DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUND. THIS FIELD DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE THE PARTY OF MANY, AND THAT EVERYONE HAS A HOME IN THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [APPLAUSE] IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES, REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO STAND BY HIM. HE UNILATERALLY ANNOUNCES A TRADE WAR ON TWITTER AND IN THE PROCESS CRUISE OVER FARMERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, AND CHUCK GRASSLEY AND JONI ERNST STAND BY HIS SIDE HERE DEAL ALONE IMPLEMENT A POLICY THAT SPLITS FAMILIES ON THE BORDER. THEY TAKE ACTION TO SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROY THE VERY INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE OUR COUNTRY THE BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD. THE GOP SAYS IT IS ABOUT TIME. AND WHEN HE SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT IT IS OK TO HARASS AND ATTACK PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN YOU, THEY CHEERED EVEN LOUDER. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE PARTY OF TRUMP. BUT WHILE THEY ARE THE PARTY OF ONE, WE ARE THE PARTY OF MANY. I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF A PARTY , [APPLAUSE] I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF A PARTY THAT EMBRACES OUT OF HER, THAT CELEBRATES OUR DIVERSITY. THIS DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, WHEN EVERYONE IS DOING BETTER, IT IS WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO WIN UP AND DOWN THE TICKET IN 2020. IT IS WHY WE WILL TAKE BACK THE LEGISLATURE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS WHY WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY OF ONE ONLY SERVES ROPE ONE TERM, WHEN WE TURN IOWA BLUE AND TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WE WILL DO ALL OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR PARTY AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING YOU FOLKS ARE DOING ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. AND NOW, LET'S GO OUT AND WIN THIS THING. [APPLAUSE] OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS SOMEONE WHO MANY OFUS SAUL AT OUR LAST , OF US SAW AT OUR LAST IDP PARTY, THE FALL GALA. SENATOR CORY BOOKER HAILS FROM NEW JERSEY, BUT HIS FAMILY TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE OLD MINING COMMUNITY OF BROCKTON. SINCE JOINING THE RACE FOR PRESIDENCY, SENATOR BOOKER HAS MADE TRIPS TO IOWA WITH EVENTS IN 24 COUNTIES. HE HAS PUT FORWARD BOLD SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, INCLUDING GUN VIOLENCE, HOUSING, AND WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. OR A WAS A GREAT FRIEND TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAST YEAR, HELPING TO RAISE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR OUR CANDIDATES AND FOR THE PARTY IN CAMPAIGNING ALL ACROSS THE STATE, AND WE ARE PROUD TO WELCOME HIM BACK TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY STAGE. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR CORY BOOKER. (music) HELLO, IOWA! AND THANK YOU, TROY. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THIS YEAR'S HONOREES. THAT IS WHAT THIS GATHERING IS ACTUALLY ABOUT. IT IS ABOUT THESE GRASS GRASSROOTS LEADER THAT GIVE US WHAT WE TRULY NEED TO WIN. WE HAVE A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HERE THIS AFTERNOON, BUT OUR STRENGT AS A PARTY COMES FROM THE GRASSROOTS. OUR PARTY DOES NOT NEED A SAVIOR , WE NEED EACH OTHER. WE NEED , [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] TO DEEPEN OUR BONDS, WE NEED TO ORGANIZE, WE NEED TO BUILD COMMUNITY STRENGTH . I AM HERE, LITERALLY, BECAUSE OF THAT TRADITION. MY GRANDPA WAS BORN AND RAISED IN IOWA. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] MY FAMILY COMES FROM A MINING TOWN CALLED BOSTON, WHERE , BUXTON, WHERE BLACKS AND WHITES WENT DOWN TO THE MINDS TOGETHER TO CARVE OUT OF THE EARTH THEIR AMERICAN DREAM, WHERE WE HAD A COMMUNITY THAT LIVED TOGETHER, BUILD COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. THEY BUILT A MORE BELOVED COMMUNITY TOGETHER. WE IN AMERICA HAVE A COMMON PURPOSE, A COMMON CAUSE, A COMMON AMERICAN DREAM, AND DESTINY. BUT TODAY, THOSE BONDS ARE BEING TESTED, LEADING MANY TO BELIEVE THAT THE FORCES TEARING US APART ARE STRONGER THAN THE BONDS HOLDING US TOGETHER. WE ARE BEING TESTED. WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WORK FULL-TIME JOBS, PICK UP EXTRA SHFT WHEN THEY CANS, BUT THEY STILL NEED FOOD STAMPS TO FEED THEIR FAMILY. WHEN THERE ARE SHRINES ON THE STREETS TO SHOOTING VICTIMS, LIKE IN FRONT OF SCHOOLS AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WHEN WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT SAYS THEY WILL TREAT YOU BETTER IF YOU ARE RICH AND GUILTY THAN POOR AND INNOCENT, WE ARE BEING TESTED. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE WE CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP! [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] GOV. BULLOCK:SEN. BOOKER: I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE BEATING DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ENOUGH. WE MUST HAVE BIGGER ASPIRATIONS AND BOLDER DREAMS THAN JUST THAT.B BEATING DONALD TRUMP IS THE FLOOR. IT IS NOT THE CEILING. BEATING HIM WILL GET US OUT OF THE VALLEY, BUT IT WILL NOT GET US TO THE MOUNTAIN TOPS. DEMOCRATS, WE CANNOT LET THIS ELECTION BE ABOUT WHAT WE ARE AGAINST. IT MUST BE AN ELECTION FOR WHAT WE ARE FOR, WHO WE ARE FO. WE ARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN WORKER , BECAUSE THEY DESERVE A LIVING WAGE, A RIGHT TO UNIONS, AND TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND SECURITY. WE ARE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO HAVE ARE VALUING THEM, SUPPORTING THEM, AND RAISING THEIR PAY. WE ARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, ABORTION WE'RE FOR ENDING MASS ENCARS RADIFICATION, AND FOR , ENCARS ENCARSATION. WE WILL TAKE THE FIGHT OF THE GUN LOBBY AND WE WILL WIN. WE COME FROM GENERATIONS THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE CHALLENGE, THEY KEPT THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE. THEY CAME UP FROM THE EYES OF BUCKSTON TOGETHER. TOGETHER THEY BOARDED BUSES KNOWING THAT THEY COULD BE BOMBED CROSSING BRIDGES, KNOWING THAT THEY COULD BE BEATEN. THEY DID NOT TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE FACE JUSTICE. THEY STOOD WITH EACH OTHER AND FOR EACH OTHER, THEY BEAT THE DEMAGOGUES AND BULLIES AND THOSE WHO TRIED TO PUSH THEM DOWN. THIS ELECTION IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON ONE PERSON IN ONE OFFICE. IT IS A REFERENDUM ON WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MUST BE TO EACH OTHER AND FOR EACH OTHER. DONALD TRUMP WANTS THIS ELECTION TO BE ABOUT HIM ON HIRS TERMS , ON HIS TERMS AND HIS TURF. WE WIN WHEN WE RISE WITH GREAT AND GRIT. RISE WITH PATRIOTISM, LOVE OF COUNTRY AND LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE WILL NOT STAY IN THE VALLEY OF DARKNESS AND FEAR. WE WILL RISE. WE WILL LIFT UP OUR VOICES, WE WILL RAISE OUR SIGHTS, WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION MANY AND, AMERICA, WE WILL RISE! THANK YOU! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD THANK YOU, SENATOR BOOKER. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SOMEONE THAT MANY IOWANS HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. A NATIVE IOWAN, ERIC SWALWELL HAS MADE NUMEROUS TRIPS TO IOWA. SINCE JOINING THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT. PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL. THANK YOU, IOWA. WELCOME TO MY FELLOW CANDIDATES. I CONSIDER US ALL A PART OF BEING THE AVENGERS. THE REPUBLICANS IN 2016, THAT WAS THE HUNGER GAMES. WE ARE IN THIS WITH YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE SO MUCH. BUT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE SOME OF THAT WORK. THE WORK THAT YOU DID IN 2018, BY MAKING HISTORY AND SENDING THE FIRST TWO WOMEN TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WERE YOU DONE WHEN YOU DID THAT WORK? NO. WERE YOU DONE WHEN YOU GAVE US , WHEN YOU GAVE US THE MAJORITY? I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE DONE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID, YOU CUT OUR TIME IN HELL IN HALF. YOU GAVE US A SHOT TO SAVE THE COUNTRY. BUT I THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE DON'T JUST PLAY DEFENSE, BUT WE ACTUALLY GO ON OFFENSE. I WAS BORN IN WESTERN IOWA. MY DAD WAS A COP. MY MOM WORKED A NUMBER OF ODD JOBS. THEY HAD A SIMPLE DREAM. THAT IF THEY WORKED HARD ENOUGH, DUG DEEP ENOUGH, SACRIFICED ENOUGH, THAT THEIR FIRST-BORN SON COULD GO TO COLLEGE. THEIR HARD WORK PAID OFF. BUT FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION, WE ARE AT RISK OF BEING THE FIRST GENERATION THAT DOES WORSE THAN OUR PARENTS. THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT. THE ONLY WAY TO REVERSE THAT IS TO GO BIG ON THE ISSUES, BE BOLD WITH THE SOLUTIONS, AND DO GOOD IN THE WAY THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER AND THE WAY THAT WE GOVERN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO LIVES LIKE YOU LIVE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE GRIT THAT YOU HAVE, AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DREAMS THAT YOU HAVE. I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED THAT STRUGGLE AND I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORKED AND WHAT YOU EXPECT IT TO ADD UP TO, BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE REAL WITH YOU. I WILL BE BOLD WITHOUT THE BOLD , WITHOUT THE BULL. MY WIFE AND I FIGHT INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN THE SURPRISE BILLS COME, WE STAND IN LINE AT THE PHARMACY AND SEE HOW EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE. HERE'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO. WE SHOULD HAVE MEDICARE FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS IT IN AMERICA, BUT ALSO STRIVE TO INVEST IN CURES IN OUR LIFETIME TO BELIEVE WE CAN SOLVE THE UNSOLVABLE, FIND THE UNFINDABLE AND INVEST IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CURE THE INCURABLE. I ALSO BELIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO STARTING A FAMILY FOR OUR FAMILY AND EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA, IT IS MY WIFE'S BODY, IT IS A WOMAN'S BODY. IT IS HER CHOICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL ONLY APPOINT JUDGES THAT UPHOLD THE ROE DECISION. LET'S REPEAL THE DISCRIMINATORY HYDE AMENDMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, THE LESSONS AND MEMORIES OF COLLEGE, THOSE SHOULD LAST A LIFETIME. THE DEBTS SHOULD NOT. WE SHOULD HAVE ZERO PERCENT INTEREST ON EVERY STUDENT LOAN IN AMERICA. MORE MONEY TO START A FAMILY, BUY YOUR FIRST HOME, TAKE A GOOD IDEA AND START A BUSINESS. WE SENT MY 2-YEAR-OLD TO HIS FIRST DAY OF SUMMER PRESCHOOL LAST WEEK, AND WE WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT A GENERATION BEFORE US DID NOT, WHETHER HE WOULD COME HOME. I KNOW YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT TOO. LET'S HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS IN EVERY SINGLE STATE. MAKE ME YOUR NOMINEE AND YOU WILL GET SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING ME, IOWA, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO COME BACK HERE EVERY SINGLE MONTH SO I CAN BEAT JONI ERNST. I'M ALSO THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO WANTS TO BAN AND BUY BACK 16 MILLION ASSAULT WEAPONS. I WANT TO TAKE THEM OUT OF OUR CHURCHES, OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS. BUT ON THIS ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE, IT WAS SUMMED UP TO ME BY A TRAUMA COUNSELOR. HE SAID THE BEST THEY CAN DO IT TO SAVE LIVES IS TO PUT A TURN KET ON EVERY CORNER. HE WAS TELLING ME THE BEST WAY TO STOP THE SHOOTING WAS TO APPLY TOURNEQUETTE. HE BELIEVED WE HAVE A FAILURE OF THE WILL TO BRING BIGGER SOLUTIONS. I ASK YOU TODAY, ARE WE IN THIS, WHEN IT COMES TO GUN VIOLENCE TO STOP THE BLEEDING, OR DO WE THINK WE CAN BE SO BOLD AND DO SUCH GOOD THAT WE CAN STOP THE SHOOTINGS? I THINK WE CAN STOP THE SHOOTINGS. SO ON THESE ISSUES, I ASK YOU, IOWA, GO TO ERIC SWALWELL'S WEB SITE. GO BIG, GO BOLD. THANK YOU SO MUCH, IOWA. THANK YOU! (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN SWALWELL. FOUR YEARS AGO A BESPEAK LED SENATOR FROM VERMONT CAME TO IOWA AND LAUNCHED A REVOLUTION. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS WON SUPPORTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY ADVOCATING FOR A PROGRESSIVE VISION FOR OUR FUTURE. AFTER 2016, SANDERS CONTINUED THIS FIGHT BY STANDING UP TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AN FIGHTING FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD RESTORE THE POWER FOR THE PEOPLE. SENATOR SANDERS HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR HIS BELIEFS, WHICH INCLUDES WORKERS RIGHTS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE IOWA CENTER STAGE, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. (music) POWER TO THE PEOPLE (music)(music) CONGRATULATIONS TO THE HONOREES, AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE WITH YOU, AND THANK YOU ALL FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO DEFEAT THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS A LIAR, A RACIST, A SEXIST, AN HOMOPHOBE AND SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES HE IS ABOVE THE LAW. TOGETHER WE WILL PUT AN END TO THE UGLINESS AND DIVISIVENESS THAT COMES FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. LET ME BE FRANK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT. WHILE WE ARE ALL UNITED IN THE NEED TO DEFEAT TRUMP, THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS AMONGST US AS TO THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT. IN MY VIEW WE WILL NOT DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP UNLESS WE BRING EXCITMENT AND ENERGY INTO THIS CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN, UNLESS WE GREATLY EXPAND VOTER TURNOUT, AND UNLESS WE GIVE MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE A REASON TO VOTE AND A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT PARTICIPATING IN POLITICS WILL IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. THE STATUS QUO, SAME OLD, SAME OLD KIND OF POLITICS WILL NOT DO THAT. THE ONLY WAY WE WIN IS WITH A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT FROM THE TOP OF THE TICKET TO THE BOTTOM IS PREPARED TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY, BLACK AND WHITE, LATINO, NATIVE AMERICAN, AND ASIAN AMERICAN, A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT HAS THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO HAVE SO MUCH CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIFE OF OUR COUNTRY, A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT CREATES A GOVERNMENT AND AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US, NOT JUST THE 1%. [APPLAUSE] NOW I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE WELL-INTENTIONED CANDIDATES WHO BELIEVES THE BEST WAY FORWARD IS A MIDDLE-GROUND STRATEGY THAT ANTAGONIZES NO ONE, THAT STANDS UP TO NOBODY, AND THAT CHANGES NOTHING. IN MY VIEW, THAT APPROACH IS NOT JUST BAD PUBLIC POLICY, BUT IT IS A FAILED POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT I FEAR COULD END UP WITH THE REELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT CHANGE, THEY WANT REAL CHANGE, AND WE HAVE TO GOT TO PROVIDE THAT CHANGE. AND THAT MEANS , AND THAT MEANS IF WE BELIEVE IN MEDICARE FOR ALL AS A HUMAN RIGHT, WE MUST TAKE ON THE POWER OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST END ENDLESS WARS, WE MUST TAKE ON THE POLITICAL DOMINANCE OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. IF WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SAVE OUR PLANET FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS, WE MUST TAKE ON THE LIES OF THE FOSSIL FUELS INDUSTRY. HISTORY REMINDS US THAT REAL CHANGE NEVER COMES EASY. IT REQUIRES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STANDING UP FOR JUSTICE AND TOGETHER WE CAN DO THAT. WE CAN CREATE A NATION WHERE ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME, HAVE HEALTH CARE AND UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITIES AS A RIGHT, WHERE VETERANS , WHERE VETERANS ARE NOT SLEEPING OUT ON THE STREET AND WHERE CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING HUNGRY, AND WHERE WE FINALLY PUT AN END TO SEXISM AND RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA AND RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] IT TAKES TOGETHERNESS, AND IT TAKES A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE AND TWO PEOPLE BECOME FOUR AND FOUR BECOME SIX AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN SIOUX COUNTY. IN 2017, WHILE MYSELF AND MANY OTHER DEMOCRATS WERE REALLY BASICALLY LICKING OUR WOUNDS, SIOUX COUNTY WAS JUST PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. THEY DID NOT LET IT GET THEM DOWN. WHAT'S NEEDED IS HOW THIS , WHAT'S NEAT IS HOW THIS WHOLE THING HAS EVOLVED INTO A GREAT, STABLE COUNTY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY A RED COUNTY. THE SIOUX COUNTY RESIDENTS SHOW HOW TENACIOUS AND STRONG THEY ARE. SIOUX COUNTY IS NOT AN EASY COUNTY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY HAVE SHOWN AS A BEACON THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR RURAL IOWA AND WIN IN RURAL IOWA AND THEY ARE THE REASON WHY WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN 2020. KIM CAME TO OUR DISTRICT WORK SHOP AND EVERYONE SAID, WHO IS THAT LADY? AND SOMEONE SAID, I THINK SHE SAID SIOUX COUNTY. AND SOMEONE SAID IS SHE WAS FROM SIOUX COUNTY AND EVERYBODY APPLAUDED. ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE THIS YEAR IS THAT WE HAVE AN ORGANIZER WHO HAS BEEN TO ALL 39 COUNTIES, AND THAT'S MAKING A HUGE IMPACT. AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY, YOU KNOW, PUSHED BACK AGAINST STEVE KING ALL THAT THEY CAN, AND SO THEY GOT TOGETHER WITH INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS, IMMIGRANTS, AND NATIVES OF SIOUX COUNTY, AND THEY HAD A BIG OLD RALLY OUTSIDE THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, AND WHAT WAS IMPRESSIVE IS THERE WAS 500 PEOPLE THERE. THAT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WOKE UP A WEEK AGO AND SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULD DO THRALLY. , THIS RALLY. THIS IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK THEY DID BEHIND-THE-SCENES. THEY OPENED UP CONVERSATION BY PLAIN CONVERSATIONS AND INVITING INDEPENDENTS AND SOME REPUBLICANS. THEY DEMAND RESPECT AND THEY ARE ALWAYS RESPECTFUL OF OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ID P-4 CAUCUS CHECK IN CALL. WHEN IT CAME TO SIOUX COUNTY, NEARLY THE FIRST CALL, THEY HAD ALREADY SECURED THE LOCATION AND ALL THEIR VOLUNTEERS SET. SO THESE GUYS ARE GOING AFTER IT. IF THEY CAN DO IT IN THE REDDEST COUNTY IN IOWA, THE REST OF US CAN DO IT. IT IS NEVER JUST ABOUT ONE PERSON. IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE GROUP AND WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S SIOUX COUNTY IN A NUTSHELL. THAT'S SIOUX COUNTY. THEY ARE ON THE PICKET LINE TOGETHER, THEY ARE KNOCKING DOORS, MAKING PHONE CALLS, AND IT IS ALWAYS TOGETHER AND THEY ARE STRONGER FOR IT. THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE A PLAQUE ON THE WALL AT THE I.D.P. IS SIMPLE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE WHAT IOWA IS. IT STARTS HERE. THEY WORK TOGETHER, THAT'S HOW YOU GET IT DONE. I'M PROUD AND THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU CAN SEE, THE SIOUX COUNTY DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE TREMENDOUS WORK. AND SO IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO INDUCT INTO THE DEMOCRATIC IOWA HALL OF FAME, OUR 2019 CAMPAIGN OF THE YEAR THE SIOUX COUNTY DEMOCRATS. COME ON UP. (music) THANK YOU, TROY. KIM IS VERY SORRY SHE COULDN'T BE HERE WITH US TODAY AND JOIN US, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WHAT HUNDREDOR IT IS TO ACCEPT THIS APARRED FROM THE I.D.P. YOU SEE GREAT LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND STATES AND WE SEE GREAT ADVOCATES THAT MAKE US PROUD TO BE DEMOCRATS THAT STAND FOR OUR VALUES. IF YOU TOLD US A YEAR AGO WE'D BE STANDING ON THE STAGE WITH ONE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WE NIGHT NOT BELIEVE , MIGHT NOT BELIEVE YOU, SO TO BE HERE WITH 19, THAT KIND OF FLOORS US, ESPECIALLY BEING IN THE NORTHWEST RED CORNER OF THE STATE. [APPLAUSE] I'D LIKE TO THANK THOSE THAT NOMINATED US. IT IS SUCH AN HONOR AND WE COULD NOT DO THIS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THOSE PEOPLE. THIS RECOGNITION IS FROM THE COUNTY AND THE VOLUNTEERS. IT IS MY HORNE TO WORK , HONOR TO WORK WITH SUCH GREAT LEADERS. IT IS SUCH AN HONOR. WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE FUTURE HAS IN STORE FOR ALL OF US IN IOWA. [APPLAUSE] CONGRATULATIONS TO THE SIOUX COUNTY DEMOCRATS. IT IS DEFINITELY A WELL-DESERVED HONOR. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS THE FIRST FEMALE COMBAT VETERAN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD HAS SERVED FOR 16 YEARS AND DEPLOYED TWICE TO THE MIDDLE EAST. TULSI SERVED ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE. PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN TULSI GABBARD. (music) ALOHA, IOWA DEMOCRATS. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND A HUGE CONGRATULATIONS GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU DESERVING HONOREES. OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF A GOVERNMENT FOUNDED BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. INSTEAD WHAT WE SEE IS A GOVERNMENT THAT IS OF, BY, AND FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL. LEAVING WE, THE PEOPLE, BEHIND. THIS MUST END. AS YOUR PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I WILL BRING THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE ABOVE SELF TO THE WHITE HOUSE, PUTTING PEOPLE AHEAD OF PROFITS, PUTTING THE WELL BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOVE ALL ELSE. I'LL CRACK DOWN ON BIG PHRMA AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO EXTORT THE SICK, WHO PUT THEIR PROFITS AHEAD OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE AND TO WORK ON MEDICARE FOR ALL. 0 TO MAKE SURE , ALL. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS SICK WILL GET THE CARE THEY NEED. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL REINSTATE THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT AND BREAK UP THE BIG WALL STREET BANKS THAT ARE GAMBLING WITH OUR FUTURE. I'LL CRACK DOWN ON THE OVERREACHING INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND THESE BIG TECH MONOPOLIES WHO TAKE AWAY OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY AN CORPORATE GREED. I'LL PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND FREE SPEECH. I'LL TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE BY USHERING IN A GREEN SENSORY. ENDING THE AGRI-CORRESPONDENT BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS, AND HARNESS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FARMERS TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING, KEEP MORE OF OUR FOOD DOLLARS LOCAL HERE AT HOME AND PROTECT OUR SOILS AND WATER AND AIR. [APPLAUSE] I'LL FIGHT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, GET RID OF PRIVATE PRISONS, END THE FEDERAL MARIJUANA PROHIBITION AND ENACT TRUE SENTENCING REFORM. [APPLAUSE] NOW, THE REALITY IS THERE'S MANY NEEDS WE NEED TO ADDRESS, BUT WE WILL NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES UNLESS WE DEAL WITH ONE CENTRAL ISSUE, AND THAT ISSUE IS THE COST OF WAR. MOST , THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS IS TO SERVE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I SERVED AS A SOLDIER FOR OVER 16 YEARS, DEPLOYED TO THE MIDDLE EAST TWICE AND SERVED ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEES. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR SDMIESHLT AND I KNOW THE COST OF WAR. I'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE WAR MONGERS FROM BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES WHO HAVE BEEN DRAGGING US FROM ONE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE REGIME CHANGE WAR TO THE NEXT, WHO ARE HYPING UP A NEW COLD WAR AND NEWARK ARMS RACE NOW. AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I WILL END OUR LONGSTANDING POLICY OF FWAILS REGIME CHANGE WARS THAT HAS COST US TRILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND UNDERMINED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. [APPLAUSE] I'LL WORK TO END THIS NEW COLD WAR AND NEWARK ARMS RACE AND LEAD US AWAY FROM THE ABYSS OF A NEWARK WAR THAT WOULD DESTROY OUR ENTIRE WORLD IN MERE MINUTES. I'LL TAKE THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, YOUR HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE WASTED ON THESE PROGRAMS AND INSTEAD INVEST THEM IN SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THINGS LIKE QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR ALL, TRULY SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CLEAN WATER, CLEAN AIR, REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, IMPROVING EDUCATION, AND SO MUCH MORE. I'LL BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES BASED ON SHARED INTERESTS AND COOPERATION RATHER THAN CONFLICT. I'LL HAVE THE COURAGE TO MEET WITH BOTH ADVERSARIES AND FRIENDS IN THE PURSUIT OF PEACE AND NATIONAL SECURITY, UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE FAIL TO EXERCISE THAT COURAGE, THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS WAR. FINALLY, I'LL BRING A SOLDIER'S PRINCIPLES TO THE WHITE HOUSE RESTORING THE VALUES OF INTEGRITY AND HONOR AND RESPECT TO THE PRESIDENCY. NOW, WE KNOW THE ROAD AHEAD WILL HAVE MANY CHALLENGES, BUT WHEN WE STAND UNITED BY OUR LOVE FOR OUR PEOPLE, OUR PLANET, AND OUR COUNTRY, THERE'S NO OBSTACLE WE CANNOT OVERCOME. SO I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME. VISIT TULSI2020'S WEB SITE AND HELP ME BUILD PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY, AND ALOHA. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER HAS MANY TITLES, MAYOR, RODE SCHOLAR, FIRST CAME ON AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE D.N.C. CHAIR, VOWING TO BRING A MIDWESTERN VOICE IT OUR PARTY. NOW AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, HE HAS CONTINUED TO BRING THE FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WIN THE ERA. AND IF HE DOES GET ELECTED, HE WILL BEAT ME TO MY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF BEING THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PRESIDENT. PLEASE WELCOME MR. PETE BUTTIGEIG. HELLO. HELLO, IOWA DEMOCRATS! THANK YOU TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THANK YOU TO THE HONOREES BEING ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY, FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT DEMOCRATIC POLITICS AND PROGRESSIVE VALUES ARE ALIVE AND WELL IN THE AMERICAN HEARTLAND. MY NAME IS PETE BUTTIGEIG, THEY MOSTLY JUST CALL ME MAYOR PETE BACK HOME. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WHO I AM, WHAT I BELIEVE, AND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE OUR VALUES ARE ON THE LINE AND THIS SEASON, IN THE LIFE OF AMERICA'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, IS ONE TO END THE IDEA THAT AMERICAN VALUES ARE THE PROPERTY OF CONSERVATIVE AND REPUBLICANS. STARTING WITH FREEDOM. FREEDOM IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE VALUE. IT IS AN AMERICAN VALUE. AND WHILE OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT FREEDOM LIKE IT IS THEIRS ALONE, WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM INCLUDES ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND YOU'RE NOT FREE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LIVING WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE GOP HAS SACRIFICED ITS ABILITY TO CLAIM TO BE THE PARTY OF FREEDOM, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE AN ATTACK ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM THAT ALL OF US, ESPECIALLY MEN, OUGHT TO BE STANDING UP TO DEFEND. [APPLAUSE] AND, YES, HERE IN IOWA WHERE YOU TURN HEADS AROUND THE NATION TEN YEARS AGO, WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT FREE IF SOME COUNTY CLERK GETS TO TELL YOU WHO YOU OUGHT TO MARRY BASED ON THEIR IDEA OF RELIGION. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM COMES BY WAY OF ORGANIZING, THAT'S WHY WE STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH LABOR, AND WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM COMES BY WAY OF EDUCATION, WHICH IS WHY ON DAY ONE THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO APPOINT A SECRETARY OF EDUCATION THAT ACTUALLY BELIEVES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FREEDOM DOESN'T BELONG TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND NEITHER DOES PATRIOTISM. WHEN I GOT ON THAT GRAY TAIL C-17 THAT TOOK ME ON TO THE PLANE, THE FLAG ON MY SHOULDER WAS NOT A REPUBLICAN FLAG, IT WAS AN AMERICAN FLAG REPRESENTING ALL OF US IN THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS. SO DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THEY OWN NATIONAL SECURITY, NOT WHEN THEIR VISION OF SECURITY GOES NO FURTHER THAN PUTTING UP A WALL FROM SEA SO SHINING SEA BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP WITH CYBER SECURITY, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP WITH ELECTION SECURITY, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP US NAME AND CONFRONT THE VIOLENT WHITE NATIONALISM THAT PRESENTS A CLEAR PRESENT THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL CEDAR RAPIDS THAT THE TIME TO COME TO TREAT CLIMATE DISRUPTION AS AND SECURITY ISSUE. WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD NOT ONLY JOIN THE PARIS ACCORDS, WE SHOULD BRING TOGETHER AMERICAN COUNTIES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SUPPORT. FREEDOM IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE VALUE, PATRIOTISM IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE-ONLY VALUE AND GOD DOES NOT BELONG TO ONE POLITICAL PARTY, LEAST THE ONE THAT PRODUCED THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO VINDICATE OUR VALUES, TO ESTABLISH A NEW DEMOCRACY WHERE MONEY CAN'T OUTVOTE PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS CAN'T CHOOSE THEIR VOTERS BY DRAWING DISTRICTS THE WAY THEY LOOK. A DEMOCRACY WHERE ALL CITIZENS, INCLUDING THOSE OF D.C. AND PUERTO RICO ENJOY PROPER REPRESENTATION IN OUR POLITICAL CAPITOL. AND MAYBE WE MIGHT GO ABOUT CHOOSING OUR PRESIDENT BY GIVING IT TO THE PERSON WHO GOT THE MOST VOTES. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE MORE OR LESS OF ONE ACCORD ON OUR VALUES. THE BIG QUESTION IS, HOW ARE WE GOING TO WIN? WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN BY PLAYING IT SAFE. OR PROMISING TO GO BACK TO NORMAL. WE CAN NO LONGER PROMISE TO RETURN TO THE 1990'S THAN REPUBLICANS CAN RETURN US TO THE 1950'S. THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS TO LOOK AT THAT SHOW THAT THIS PRESIDENT'S CREATED, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT REALITY SHOW, HORROR SHOW, GAME SHOW, AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HELP ME CHANGE THE CHANNEL. HELP US WIN THE ERA. HELP US BRING ABOUT A NEW ERA IN THE LIFE OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE BE , WE WILL BE GLAD THAT IT STARTED RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. THANK YOU, AND I'LL SEE YOU ON THE TRAIL. THANK YOU! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. OUR NEXT SPEAKER HAS BEEN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. KAMALA HARRIS IS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE FIRST SOUTH ASIAN TO BE ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE AND. THROUGHOUT HER KA SHEER SHE HAS BEEN A FEARLESS ADVOCATE FOR THE VOICELESS AND VULNERABLE AND A VOCAL AND DETERMINED FIGHTER ON BEHALF OF ALL PEOPLE. IN THE SENATE SHE HAS BEEN A KEY VOICE IN THE FIGHT TO HOLD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE, ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND NOW, AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, SHE IS RUNNING TO MAKE SURE OUR GOVERNMENT LIVES UP TO THE IDEAL THAT IT IS TRULY FOR THE PEOPLE. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. WHAT'S UP, IOWA? IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK WITH YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF IOWA BECAUSE EVER SINCE THE FIRST TRIP I CAME HERE AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMING IN HELPING ME TO BE A BETTER CANDIDATE AND YOU UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HELP ME BE A BETTER PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. ONE OF THE FIRST MEETINGS I HAD WAS WITH A GROUP OF TEACHERS HERE, AND DURING THAT MEETING YOU SAID TO ME, HEY, THIS TEACHER , THIS ISSUE OF TEACHER PAY IS A NATIONAL ISSUE. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD, THAT AS MY FIRST POLICY PROPOSAL, I AM PREPARED TO MAKE THE FIRST FEDERAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE HISTORY , INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTRY IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. I THANK YOU. AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE BACKBONE , PART OF THE BACKBONE OF WHAT I BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICA, MAKE THE CASE FOR OUR AMERICA, AN AMERICA WHERE HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE, AMERICA, WHERE PEACHERS ARE , TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE, AND, AMERICA, WHERE WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES, AN AMERICA WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO WORK ONLY ONE JOB TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD, AN AMERICA WHERE OUR CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND BE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOLS, AND AMERICA , AN AMERICA WHERE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO KNOWS IT IS A SIGN OF BE STREBTSDZ NOT TO , STRENGTH NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN BUT TO LIFT PEOPLE UP. SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND. SO I WAS RAISED AS A CHILD, AS A DAUGHTER OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THAT MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I JOKED THAT WE WERE RAISED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT TIME SHOUTING. MY MOTHER IS FIVE FEET TALL. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD DO, PUT A HAND ON A HIP, LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO THE OTHER THING I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT MY BACKGROUND IS I SPENT A CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR. I PROSECUTED BANKS, I PROSECUTED BIG PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO WERE PREYING ON THE MOST VULNERABLE CONSUMERS. I PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS AND FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES WHO WERE DEFRAUDING HOME OWNERS AND CONSUMERS. I WILL TELL YOU SOMEONE WHO HAS DEFRAUDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DONALD TRUMP. HE PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF DREAMERS, THAT HE WOULD PROTECT FARMERS AND HELP WORKING PEOPLE. WHAT DID WE GET INSTEAD IN WE GOT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO MADE A WHOLE LOT OF PROMISES AND BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT DID WE GET? A LOT OF BROKEN PROMISES. SO WE NEED TO PROSECUTE THE CASE. AND, IOWA, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THERE'S A RAP SHEET FULL OF EVIDENCE TO MAKE THE CASE. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. HE PROMISED HEALTH CARE AND THEN HE TRIED TO RIP HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHAT'S THAT CALLED? HEALTH CARE FRAUD. HE SAID HE WAS FOR WORKING PEOPLE, THEN HE PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITTING THE 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S TAX FRAUD. HE BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA AND A NORTHERN KOREAN DICTATOR, AND THEN HE CLAIMS TO BE THE BEST PRESIDENT WE'VE SEEN IN A GENERATION. I'D SAY LET'S CALL BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE THAT'S IDENTITY FRAUD. SO I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE I AM PREPARED TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICA AND TO PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU, IOWA. [APPLAUSE] AS ONE OF THE VICE CHAIRS OF THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF 2017, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH OUR VARIOUS CONSTITUENCY CAUCUSES AND ONE OF WHICH IS THE YOUNG DEMOCRATS OF IOWA. I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY IMPRESSED BY THIS GROUP OF YOUNG ACTIVISTS, LEADERS FOR THE THINGS THEY HAVE DONE TO ENCOURAGE AND GAUGE DEMOCRATS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY RAISED THEIR VOICES FOR THOSE ISSUES THAT IMPACT THEM AND THAT ARE PROGRESSIVE IN NATURE. SOMETIMES WHEN WE OLDER PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD, WE ALWAYS HAVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO MOVE US FORWARD ON CERTAIN ISSUES. I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE THESE BOLD LEADERS. THEY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY AMAZING. I THINK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET A BUM RAP AND NOT GIVEN ENOUGH CREDIT. FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS THOSE STEREOTYPES, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WILL TAKE ANY STEREOTYPE THAT YOU HAVE AND SHATTER IT. I HAVE SEEN THEM PUT TOGETHER CONFERENCES. I'VE SEEN THEM ADVOCATE ON THE HILL. I'VE SEEN THEM SITTING IN THE IOWA SUPREME COURT SAYING THAT OUR VOTES ARE OUR VOICES AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SUPPRESSED IN STANDING UP. THEY ARE RELIABILITY, HUMBLE, COMMITTED, PASSIONATE. THEY ARE FOLLOW THROUGH, THEIR INTEGRITY, THEY ARE AMAZING. THEY ARE NOT ONLY A VERY COMMITTED GROUP, BUT THEY ARE A VERY ACTIVE GROUP AND A VERY FUN GROUP, SPECIFICALLY OLIVIER HEYBANK. SHE HAS CREATED WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION,ING EVERYTHING FROM GETTING CORN TATTOOS TO ARM WRESTLING GILLIBRAND. I THINK THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM COMING OUT OF THIS ORGANIZATION IS REALLY HELPING TO GROW OUR PARTY AN REACH OUT TO NEW PEOPLE AND BRING YOUNG PEOPLE INTO OUR PARTY WHICH WE SO DESPERATELIED NEED. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR PARTY. THEY DESERVE THIS AWARD TO RECOGNIZE SUCH A STRONG AND POWERFUL VOICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. I CAN TELL YOU, BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE A PLAQUE ON THAT WALL JUST BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE PUT IN FOR THEIR PASSION. OUR PARTY IS BLESSED BY YOUR LEADERSHIP, ACTIVISM AND COMMITMENT. CONGRATULATIONS. TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON IN THE ROOM, DO NOT SLEEP ON THE YOUTH. HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE ON , AT THE TABLE ENGAGED, INVOLVED. LISTEN TO THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR FUTURE AND THEY ARE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOW MY HONOR AND MY PLEASURE TO INDUCT INTO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY HALL OF FAME AS OUR 2019S.E.C. MEMBER OF THE YEAR, THE YOUNG DEMOCRATS OF IOWA. HERE IS THEIR PRESIDENT AND THEIR VICE PRESIDENT. (music) WE DO A LOT OF STUFF TOGETHER. FIRST, WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, FIRST AND FOREMOST TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. CAN WE HAVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THEM FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND, HONESTLY WHEN WE GOT THE CALL THAT WE WERE GETTING THIS AWARD THAT WE WERE BOTH ASKED TO BE ON A CONFERENCE CALL, WE THOUGHT WE WERE IN TROUBLE. IN ALL HONESTY, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HUMBLING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR SUPPORTING US, AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR CHAPTERS ALL ACROSS COLLEGE CAMPUSES, THEY ARE PUTTING OUT A TOUGH SITE TO GET EVERYBODY INVOLVED. [APPLAUSE] ONE MORE THING. I'M AN ORGANIZER AT HEART, SO I CAN'T LEAVE THE STATE WITHOUT AND ASK. MY ASK IS LIKE LEAVING THIS SPACE AND THINK ABOUT WHO IS THE YOUNG PERSON IN YOUR LIFE WHO YOU CAN CONNECT WITH AND ENGAGE WITH, BRING TO AN EVENT WITH A CANDIDATE, GET THEM REGISTERED, GET THEM VOTING. WE WANT TO STAND UP FOR YOUNG DEMOCRATS IN IOWA. THANK YOU. GAY RIGHTS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS YOU CAN SEE, WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOUNG DEMOCRATS AND PROUD OF THE WORK THEY HAVE BEEN DOING. THANK YOU, AGAIN, FOR ALL THE WORK YOU FOLKS ARE DOING. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ARE ONLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEHIND SCHEDULE FOR OUR RUN OF SHOW SO WE'RE MOVING THIS THING ALONG. ALL RIGHT. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SOMEONE WHO HAS PUT IN A LOT OF WIND SHIELD TIME. CONGRESSMAN DELANEY WAS THE FIRST ONE TO HIS RUN FOR , FIRST ONE TO ANNOUNCE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, DELANEY HAS BEEN WORKING TO BRING THE FOCUS BACK ON WORKING MEN AND WOMEN AND ADVOCATEING FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSMAN JOHN DELANEY TO THE STAGE. (music) HAVE BEEN , I HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE. GOOD AFTERNOON, IOWA. HOW'S EVERYONE DOING? ALL RIGHT. GOOD. SO ONE OF THE GREAT PRIVILEGES OF TRAVELING TO ALL 99 COUNTIES IS THAT I'VE SEEN SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND IT IS BEEN GREAT TO TALK TO YOU, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL IOWA, AND DON'T TELL , LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT RURAL IOWA DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES, AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD THE BIG TEN DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT WE NEED TO WIN AND GOVERN. SO I STAND BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM AND AM SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN ME. TO BE THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE, TO BE A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR, TO SERVE MY COUNTRY IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO BE BLESSED WITH AN AMAZING FAMILY. BUT THESE STORIES ARE SO MUCH HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY. WHY? BECAUSE WE STOPPED DOING OUR JOB. WE STOPPED DOING THE BASIC THINGS WE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO PREPARE OUR CITIZENS FOR THE FUTURE. I STAND BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY AS SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT HARD WORKING AMERICANS NEED IS MORE IDEOLOGY, MORE GRIDLOCK OR MORE PARTISANSHIP. THEY NEED SOLUTIONS, AND MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHERE I'M FROM. THEY DO. MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHERE I'M FROM. MY DAD WAS A UNION ELECTRICIAN. HE WIRED BUILDINGS FOR A LIVING. HE DID HONEST WORK. AND WHEN YOU DO HONEST WORK, YOU GET A BUILDING THAT WORKS. YOU FLIP ON A SWITCH, THE LIGHTS GO ON, YOU TURN ON A FAUCET, THE WATER COMES OUT. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR PRESIDENT IS HE DOESN'T BUILD ANYTHING. HE DOESN'T CARE IF ANYTHING WORKS. ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT AMERICA WORKS FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO IS COMMITTED TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE, TO REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, TO INVESTING IN ALL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING AMERICA, AND WITH DEALING WITH ALL OF THE CHANGE THAT'S COMING FROM TECHNOLOGY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS COMMITTED TO CREATING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE EVERYONE GETS HEALTH CARE AS A BASIC RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP. NO AMERICANS SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN PAY FOR THEIR INSULIN OR WORRY ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE OR WORRY ABOUT WHETHER IF THEY MAKE A DECISION TO GET HEALTH CARE THAT THEY MAY BE SIGNING UP TO BANKRUPT THEMSELVES. NO AMERICAN SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THAT, AND WE KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. WHY DO WE KNOW THAT? BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE IT. FRANCE HAS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, SWEDEN HAS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THE NETHERLANDS HAS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND GERMANY HAS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, SO WE CAN BUILD A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN THE WORLD. BUT THE ONE THING ABOUT ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHOSE SYSTEMS WE ADMIRE, NONE OF THEM HAVE A SINGLE-PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH SHOWS THERE'S LOTS OF WAY OF CREATING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY. MY PLAN, BETTER CARE, GIVES EVERY AMERICAN HEALTH CARE AS A RIGHT. IT INVESTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ENSURES WE HAVE HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE, IT PUTS MONEY AGAINST BASIC RESEARCH SO WE CAN CURE CANCER AND CURE ALZHEIMER'S, AND IT GIVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT, WHICH IS CHOICES. THAT'S THE BEST WAY FORWARD ON UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AND SO WE NEED , WE NEED TO BECOME THE PARTY OF IDEAS, THE PARTY THAT EMBRACES THE DEBATE, THE PARTY THAT WANTS TO BUILD A BIG TENT SO THAT PROGRESSIVES WHO WANT CHANGE, MODERATES WHO WANT SOLUTIONS, INDEPENDENTS WHO JUST WANT THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO PUT THE COUNTRY FIRST AND EVEN THOSE DISAFFECTED REPUBLICANS WHO SEE THIS PRESIDENT HAS NO MORAL COME PASS AND , COMPASS AND TURN THEIR BACK ON THAT PARTY. IF THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL BE ABLE TO GOVERN. BECAUSE WHETHER IT IS CREATING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE ORDEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE OR INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES LEFT BEHIND OR REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, HAVING MORE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, MAKING COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE, LAUNCHING NATIONAL SERVICE OR DEALING WITH THE BLESSINGS OF TECHNOLOGY AND MAKING SURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH IT, ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES, THERE'S A COMMONSENSE WAY FORWARD AND LET'S BUILD THE COALITION PARTY AN GOVERN AND LEAD , AND GOVERN AND LEAD THIS COUNTRY. GOD BLESS YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN. IF YOU WERE AT OUR 2018 HALL OF FAME, THEN OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE NO STRANGER TO YOU. GOVERNOR JAY ENDSLY HAS WORKED TO GET DEMOCRATS ELECTED, AS A HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION, HE HAS FLIPPED GOVERNORS FROM RED TO BLUE. HE HAS DETAILED PLANS TO GET TO 100% GREEN ENERGY. HE HAS TRAVELED FROM DAVENPORT TO HAMBURG TO WITNESS CLIMATE CHANGE HERE IN IOWA. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE IOWA HALL OF FAME GOVERNOR JAY ENDSLY. THANK YOU. IT LOOKS LIKE IOWA IS READY FOR A NEW PRESIDENT. I'M HAPPY TO OBLIGE. I WILL TELL YOU WHY I THINK WE WILL MAKE TRUMP A BLIP IN HISTORY. NUMBER ONE, WE DEMOCRATS NOT ONLY EMBRACE PROGRESSIVE VALUES, BUT MY STATE, THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ECONOMIC PROGRESS, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESSIVE VALUES BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO DRIVE HIM NUTS WHEN HE FINDS OUT THAT HE'S RUNNING AGAINST A GUY WHO'S A DEMOCRAT WHO HAS PRODUCED THE SINGLE BEST ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT'S THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, AND THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE HIM NUTS. NOW, I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY I BELIEVE WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THIS. ANY EDUCATORS IN THE ROOM? A FEW EDUCATORS IN THE ROOM. I'M A SON OF A BIOLOGY TEACHER, AND SO I THINK A LOT ABOUT EDUCATORS. THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO IS HAVE A QUALITY TEACHER IN EVERY CLASSROOM. I'M THE GOVERNOR WHO GOT THE BIGGEST PAY INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO CARRY THAT ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. I HEAR REPUBLICANS SAYING, GEE, IF WE PAY PEOPLE A LIVING WAGE, HOW WILL THE ECONOMY FUNCTION? I'LL TELL YOU WILL HOW IT WILL FUNCTION. IT WILL FUNCTION LIKE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON BECAUSE I'M PROUD TO SAY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE AND PROGRESSIVE GROWTH. I'M PROUD TO SAY, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THIS RADICAL IN WASHINGTON STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT WOMEN SHOULD GET PAID THE SAME FOR MEN FOR THE WORK THEY DO. AND SO WE PASSED A LAW TO PROTECT GENDER PAY EQUITY SO THE BOSS CAN'T HIDE THE FACT THAT HE'S PAYING MORE TO THE MEN THAN THE WOMEN. THIS HASN'T RETARDED ECONOMIC GROWTH, IT IS BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF FAIRNESS INTO THE WORK PLACE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE STOOD UP FOR CHOICE, AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC LIFE FOR 27 YEARS, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TODAY, YESTERDAY, EVERY DAY TO MOVE FORWARD TO PASS THE REPRODUCTIVE PARITY ACT SO NOT ONLY DO WOMAN HAVE A RIGHT OF CHOICE, THEY HAVE A RIGHT OF HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR SERVICES EXERCISING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. WE'VE DONE THAT IN MY STATE. WE NEED TO DO IT NATIONALLY. WE KNOW IN OUR STATE DIVERSITY IS NOT A WEAKNESS, IT IS A STREBTSDZ. IT IS WHY , STRENGTH. IT IS WHY OUR ECONOMY IS SO GOOD. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF WITH DIVERSITY. I AM PROUD TO SAY I WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO STAND UP AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MUSLIM BAN AND NOW I'VE BEAT HIM 21 TIMES IN COURT. [APPLAUSE] BUT THE SECOND REASON WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HIM A BLIP IN HISTORY IS WE UNDERSTAND THE EX EXTENSIONAL CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE. WE FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE TO SAVE THIS NATION FROM OUR RTH , FROM THIS URGENT AND IMMINENT CATACLYSM. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER CHANCE. AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE, I THOUGHT ABOUT BEING GOVERNOR FOR A WHILE. I'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL, AS I INDICATED, AND I LOVE THE JOB. BUT I MADE A PERSONAL DECISION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ON MY FINAL DAYS ON EARTH I CAN LOOK AT MY THREE GRANDKIDS AND LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO SAVE YOU FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES AND AND I CAN TELL YOU , AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF I'M GIVEN THIS HONOR, I WILL WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND I'M PLEDGING THIS TO YOU, AND I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS MADE THIS CLAIM, I WILL MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE THE FIRST PARAMONT DUTY CAN. DONALD TRUMP, HE SAID THAT WIND TURBINES DON'T CAUSE CANCER, THEY COST JOBS. WE NEED TO PICK A CANDIDATE. WE NEED TO MOBILIZE THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES INDUSTRY. I BELIEVE THIS TOO. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OUGHT TO HAVE A FULL, FAIR DEBATE WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND EVERYBODY'S CALLED TO ACCOUNT TO PUT THEIR PLANS ON THE TABLE. THIS PARTY NEEDS TO STAND UP. WE NEED TO STAND UP TO DEFEAT CLIMATE CHANGE. WE NEED TO SAVE OUR KIDS FROM THE THREAT OF ASTHMA. WE'VE GOT TO SAVE THE FARMERS FROM THE FLOODS. WE'VE GOT TO PUT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE TO WORK IN CLEAN ENERGY. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE EPICENTER, THE PLACE WHERE WE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IOWA IS ON THE FRONTLINE OF DISASTER AND IT IS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF ECONOMY. WE NEED TO HAVE AN ECONOMY EARLY TO BED, EARLY TO RISE AND I HOPE I CAN EARN YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. OUR NEXT SPEAKER HAILS FROM NEW YORK STATE. SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND HAILS FROM NEW YORK AND WILL FIGHT FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AS HARD AS SHE FIGHTS FOR HER OWN. SHE SPEARHEADED THE PASSAGE OF THE 9\/11 HEALTH BILL AND LED THE FIGHT AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND IN THE MILITARY AND WILL ARM WRESTLE ANYONE WHO CHALLENGES HER. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. (music) THANK YOU, IOWA, AND CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES, NOT VERY POLITE. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD I WAS BY A FOX NEWS HOST AT THE TOWN HALL I DID IN IOWA LAST WEEK BECAUSE I SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE NATIONWIDE ASSAULT ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS. NOT VERY POLITE. YOU GOT THAT ONE RIGHT. BECAUSE IF FOX NEWS TAKES ISSUE WITH ME DEMANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS FOR WOMEN, 50% OF AMERICA, I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. WOMEN, LUCKILY I'M NOT ALONE. I PROUDLY COUNT MYSELF AMONG THE FORMERLY WELL-BEHAVED WOMEN FIGHTING BACK, THE WOMEN IN THIS ROOM, THE MEN WHO LOVE US. WE ARE RISING UP AND WE ARE DEMANDING OUR RIGHTS AND OUR VOICES. WOMEN ARE ON FIRE IN AMERICA TODAY. WE HAVE MARCHED, WE HAVE ORGANIZED, WE HAVE RUN FOR OFFICE, AND WE HAVE WON BECAUSE OF WOMEN WE FLIPPED THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENT MORE THAN 100 WOMEN TO CONGRESS. WE ELECTED SIDNEY AND ABBY, THE FIRST TWO WOMEN FROM IOWA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THESE ARE UNSUNG HEROES. THERE ARE UNSUNG HEROES ALL ACROSS IOWA. WHETHER IT IS THE EVERY DAY ACTS OF RESILIENCE OR THE BIG, BOLD MOMENTS OF RESISTANCE, WOMEN ARE TAKING A STAND. NOW, MORE THAN EVER, OUR RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK, WHETHER IT IS GEORGIA OR IOWA OR ALABAMA OR MISSOURI. IN THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE SUPREME COURT, ACROSS THIS COUNTRY RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS, AND A WHOLE LOT OF MEN ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT OUR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE POLITE. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR SMALL STEPS. NOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT LIKE HELL. TO THE PUNDITS WHO SAY , WHO STILL SAY, CAN A WOMAN REALLY WIN? YES, OF COURSE WE CAN. PRESIDENT TRUMP KRYPTONITE IS A STRONG WOMAN WHO STANDS UP FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVES IN. WE KNOW WOMEN LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE ACTUALLY HAVE FASTER GROWING ECONOMIES, ARE MORE INCLUSIVE, TOLERANT, AND COLLABORATIVE. WHEN WOMEN LEAD, WE GET THINGS DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TAKEN ON THE POWERFUL, CORRUPT, AND SEEMINGLY POWERFUL THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. I TOOK ON A 2-1 DISTRICT AND WON, FOR THE SECOND TIME BY A 24-POINT MARGIN AND I WON BACK 18 COUNTIES WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD WON. WHETHER I'M STANDING UP TO THE PENTAGON OR CONGRESS OR WALL STREET OR CORRUPT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, I HAVE TAKEN ON THE FIGHT THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL AND WON. I HAVE VOTED AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP MORE THAN ANY OTHER U.S. SENATOR ON THIS STAGE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL GO TOE TO TOE WITH ANYONE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. I WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO PLEDGE I WILL ONLY NOMINATE JUSTICES AND JUDGES WHO SEE ROE V. WADE AS A PRECEDENT. AND I WILL REPEAL HYDE SO ALL WOMEN GET ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ROOM IN OUR PARTY FOR A CANDIDATE WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT A WOMAN'S FULL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS. THE DAY FOR DISMISSING PAID LEAVE OR UNIVERSAL PRE-K OR EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK IS JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE, THOSE DAYS ARE LONG GONE. WHEN AMERICA'S FAMILIES SUCCEED, WE ALL SUCCEED, THAT IS WHY I WILL PASS MY FAMILY BILL OF RIGHTS WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF BEING PRESIDENT. JUST IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD ACHIEVE WITH A WORKING MOTHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD OF A MISOGYNIST. IMAGINE THE PROGRESS WE COULD MAKE WITH A DIVERSE CABINET OF AMERICANS WHO ACTUALLY REFLECT WHY WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND THE AGENDA WE COULD PASS NOT ONLY WITH WOMEN AT THE TABLE BUT WITH A WOMAN AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. NOW IT IS NOT THE , NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SETTLE FOR THE STATUS QUO OR TO COMPROMISE OR TO BE POLITE. NOW IS THE TIME THAT WE MUST BE BRAVE BECAUSE WHEN HOPE RISES, FEAR LOSES, AND BRAVE WINS. GOD BLESS IOWA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT AN HONOR IT IS TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE IN THIS INCREDIBLE DISTRICT WHERE, ALONG WITH IOWA'S STREETS, WE DID SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IN 2018. THERE WERE FOLKS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, EVEN IN THE STATE WHO SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, THAT IOWA WOULD NEVER ELECT A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN, AND YOU ALL PROVED ACROSS THE STATE THAT THEY WERE WRONG AND WE STOOD UP FOR OUR VALUES AND WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS AN HONOR OF MY LIFE TO GET TO SERVE IN CONGRESS ALONGSIDE CINDY AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK SINCE DAY ONE STEPPING UP FOR IOWANS EVERY CHANCE WE GET. YOU SEE, IT IS NOT ABOUT PUBLICS TO US, IT IS ABOUT PUTTING IOWA FIRST. IT IS ABOUT CUTTING THROUGH ALL THE MUD, ALL THE MUCK THAT IS THROWN ARE AROUND IN D.C. AND JUST GETTING THE JOB DONE. [APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TAKE THIS MOMENT TO JUST SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM ACROSS THE STATE WHO STEPPED UP, WHO KNOCKED DOORS, WHO MADE HISTORY HAPPEN, AND WHO DEMANDED BETTER FROM THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN WASHINGTON. AND , AND SOME OF YOU ARE BEING HONORED TONIGHT. IT IS TRULY TO GET TO SEE YOU AND ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE PARTY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU WE STILL HAVE A HECK OF A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY ELECTION AND WE HAVE A LOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEXT YEAR GOING INTO THE CAUCUSES. IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE SO MANY DEDICATED FOLKS HERE TONIGHT. BUT I WANT TO RIM YOU AFTER THESE CAUCUSES ARE OVER IN FEBRUARY, AFTER WE SORT OUT WHO OUR CANDIDATE IS WHO IS GOING TO KICK DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THAT WHITE HOUSE, WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSSED HERE IN IOWA. WE'VE GOT TWO CONGRESSIONAL , OR THREE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS THAT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP BLUE AND WE'VE GOT A FORCE WE BETTER FLIP. ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP PETERSON AND PR ITC HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TURN IT BLUE AND TAKE BACK OUR STATE. THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK LEFT DO. IT IS AN HONOR TO GET TO DO IT BY YOUR SIDE AND IT IS ANOTHER HONOR TO GET TO NOW WILLIAM AND INTRODUCE CONGRESSWOMAN CINDY AKN AKNY. ABBY, THANK YOU FOR KICKING THIS OFF. ME AND ABBY ARE ASKED, WHO IS THE NEATEST PERSON YOU MET, WHAT IS MOST SURPRISING AND ARE YOU GLAD YOU'RE THERE? I SAY, ARE YOU HAVING FUN, IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY. BECAUSE CHIP ROY , WHEN CHIP ROY STOPS A DISASTER BILL GOING THROUGH ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE HE THINKS IT IS HIS RIGHT AS A REPUBLICAN TO OBSTRUCT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT, THAT IS JUST WRONG AND THAT GUY'S NAME IS NOW IN OUR HEAD AS SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT IOWANS AND WE WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO. BUT IS THERE SOME FUN? ABSOLUTELY. WHEN I SIT NEXT TO KATIE PORTER, BY THE WAY AN IOWA GIRL, WHO'S QUESTIONING HER HOUSE , OUR HOUSE SECRETARY ABOUT A REAL ESTATE TERM AND HE THINKS IT IS A COOKIE, WELL, THAT'S A FUN DAY FOR ME. WHERE ARE YOU LIVING? WELL, I KNOW ABBY SAID TO FIND A PLACE ON HER OWN, I'M LIVING IN A DORM-LIKE SITUATION WITH OUR FELLOW WOMEN REPRESENTATIVES OUT THERE, AND EVERY WEDNESDAY I GET UP AND MAKE A CALL INTO KMA RADIO IN SPENTEN DOA , SHENANDOAH, IOWA TO MAKE SURE RURAL AMERICA KNOW THAT I'M FATING , FIGHTING FOR THEM, ABBY'S FIGHTING FOR THEM AND RURAL IOWA IS PROTECTED UNDER OUR WATCH. WHAT'S MOST SURPRISING? THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT POLICY, FOLKS. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM, AND WE SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT POLICY, BUT WE'RE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE ACROSS THE AISLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK, THOSE SYSTEMS HAVE GOT TO GO, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE, AS FRESHMEN, ARE WORKING ON, AND I CAN TELL YOU AFTER A DECADE IN STATE GOVERNMENT HOLDING IT ACCOUNTABLE, I'M USING THOSE SHARP ELBOWS TO MAKE SURE WE DOUBT JUST FIX , DON'T JUST FIX POLICY, BUT WE FIX SYSTEMS IN GOVERNMENT. WHO IS THE NEATEST PERSON YOU MET? I DON'T KNOW WHO'S YOURS, ABBY? WELL, MINE MUST BE PRESIDENT OBAMA. FOR THE FIVE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T MET HIM HERE, HE IS AS COOL AS YOU THINK IT HE IS. , THINK HE IS. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE. AND YOU KNOW WHY? IT IS BECAUSE OF FOLKS LIKE ABBY AND ME AND THOSE FOLKS PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WALL WE NEED. THAT IS THE WALL THAT WE ARE HOLDING UP IN CONGRESS TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM THE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IN THE SENATE. [APPLAUSE] SO, FOLKS, WE STARTED THIS LAST YEAR, BUT WE'VE GOT TO FINISH THIS IN 2020 AND WE'RE DOING IT BY VISITING OUR COUNTIES, BY PAFG HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION, BY , PASSING HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION, AND BY GIVING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL WITH THE DREAM ACT, THE EQUALITY ACT AND THE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK BILL. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ABBY AND I NEED YOUR HELP. WE ARE TWO OF THE TOP 20 GO P. , GO P. IN CONGRESS AND WE ARE THE IOWA GIRLS THAN DON'T BACK DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO HELP US HOLD THE HOUSE, HELP US FLIP THE SENATE, HELP US GET THE PRESIDENCY FOR YOUR FAMILY, FOR OUR STATE, FOR THIS COUNTRY. LET'S WIN THIS IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING TODAY? ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. I WANTED TO COME UP HERE TO SAY TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, THANK YOU. BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE, I WAS ABLE TO IN MY RACE FOR STATE AUDITOR BEAT A REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT IN IOWA STATEWIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 34 YEARS. THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO SAY ONE OTHER THING. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. I'M TALKING ABOUT 2020. STAND UP IF YOU MADE PHONE CALLS FOR DEMOCRATS IN 2018. GET ON YOUR FEET. ALL RIGHT. STAND UP IF YOU KNOCKED DOORS FOR DEMOCRATS IN 2018, GET ON YOUR FEET. STAND UP IF YOU VOTED IN 2018 FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE OF IOWA. GET ON YOUR FEET! IF EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM DOES THAT AGAIN IN 2020, EVEN IN THAT MOMENT, BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN , IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT MOMENT IN THE SUMMER OF 2020 WHERE THE POLLS ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT TIGHT AND SOMEONE'S GOING TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW. IT COULD GO EITHER WAY. SOMEONE WHO THERE'S A , THEY ARE A PUNDIT WHO CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE. THE TEAM THAT WORKS THE HARDEST WILL WIN. YOU KNOCK ON THOSE DOORS, MAKE THE PHONE CALLS, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN 2020 IN IOWA AND BEYOND. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HEY, IOWA DEMOCRATS. OH, MY GOSH. I'LL TELL YOU FROM HERE, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M LOOKING FROM THE MISSOURI TO THE MISSISSIPPI. THIS IS SPECTACULAR. SAM TOLD YOU TO GET UP ON YOUR FEET, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. NOBODY'S MOVING, BUT IF YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE MINUTE HERE, I WANT YOU TO STAND AND STRETCH. AND THEN IF YOU HOLD YOUR WAULT IN YOUR , WALLET, STRETCH, IF THE PURSE IS HANGING OFF THE BACK OF YOUR CHAIR, STRETCH. YOU SAW THIS PARTY WITH THE BEST CANDIDATES, THE BEST CHAIR, THE BEST STAFF, THE BEST VOLUNTEERS, THE BEST MESSAGE, YOU SAW WHAT WE DID IN 2018. ABBY AND CINDY AND ROB SAND, THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE IOWA HOUSE, THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE IOWA SENATE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THAT? WE CALL IT A GOOD START. SO THIS TIME WE'RE NOT DOING TROY PRICE , WE HAVE CLOCKS, THINGS GOING EVERYWHERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO A TRADITIONAL BUCKET PASS. WE'RE DOING THE STATIONARY BUCKET PASS. LOOK ON YOUR TABLES. YOU'VE ALL GOT ONE OF THESE. YOU ALL GOT A PILE OF THESE. SO WHEN YOU FEEL THE NEED, STRETCH THOSE SHOULDERS, REACH DOWN, PUT ONE OF THESE IN. IF YOU HAVE A $50, HOOK IN HERE, SOME OF MY GOOD FRIENDS, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'VE GOT TEN PEOPLE AT A TABLE. IF EVERYBODY DID THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS COME AROUND AND PICK THESE UP. YOU CAN DO IT BY TEXTING TO THE TEXT NUMBER. THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO DO THIS. YOU ARE ASKED CONSTANTLY AND YOU GIVE CONSTANTLY. THE CELEBRATION OF THESE YOUNG VOLUNTEERS AND NO SO YOUNG BUT NEW VOLUNTEERS AND NOT SO YOUNG OR NEW BUT LONG-TIME VOLUNTEERS, THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THING. YOU'RE ASKED CONSTANTLY AND YOU GIVE CONSTANTLY AND EVERY TIME. THANK YOU FROM EVERY SINGLE FAMILY THAT IS IMPACTED BY THE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE. LOVE YOU GUYS. GIVE TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE STAFF WILL BE AROUND TO PICK THEM UP. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. ALWAYS CAN COUNT ON YOU TO PROVIDE A SPIRITED KICK IN THE REAR TO GET PEOPLE TO DONATE AN BEFORE WE GO TOO MUCH FARTHER, WE DID HIGHLIGHT OUR NEWEST ELECTED CONGRESSIONAL PEOPLE AND STATEWIDE FOLKS HERE A SECOND AGO, BUT TODAY IS ALSO ABOUT THE FOLKS WHOSE SHOULDERS WE STAND UPON AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE THE LONGEST SERVING PEOPLE IN THEIR POSITIONS. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM SHOUTOUT AND WELCOME TO FITZGERALD AND MILLER, TWO OF THE ROCKS OF OUR PARTY. [APPLAUSE] AND CONGRESSMAN LOVESACK SENDS HIS REGRETS. HE WAS ACTUALLY OUT OF THE STATE. HE WAS OUT OF THE STATE BUT WISHES EVERYONE WELL. WE ARE NOW NINE CANDIDATES THROUGH. SO WE ARE AT THE HALFWAY POINT. SO WEET DON'T WANT ANYONE TO LEAVE, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT FOLKS WILL START HEADING TO THE BAR, TO THE BATHROOM. SO WE'VE GOT , WHEN YOU WALKED IN, YOU FOLKS SAW THERE WERE SOME SWAG TABLES, SWAG, STUFF WE ALL GET. WE HAVE MOVED THOSE CLOSER IN. CAMPAIGNS HAVE PROVIDED SOME STUFF FOR YOU ALL TO TAKE. THE O'ROURKE CAMPAIGN PROVIDED SOME EDIBLE STUFF. THEY HAVE PROVIDED SOME PIZZA. SO IF ANYONE NEEDS A SNACK, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STOP BY OR PICK UP ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE OUT THERE AND THEN COME BACK IN AND GRAB YOURSELF A COCKTAIL AND COME BACK IN BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING MUCH OUR NEXT SPEAKER HAS BEEN A LONG-TIME ADVOCATE FOR AMERICA'S WORKERS. CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN HAS REPRESENTED NORTHEAST OHIO WHERE HE HAS SEEN THE EFFECT OF BAD TRADE POLICIES ON OUR WORKERS. IT IS WHY AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT HE IS GOING TO RESTORE THE VOICE FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND BUILD AN AMERICA THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS BEEN A PLEASURE SPEED DATING WITH YOU TONIGHT. IF YOU WANT A SECOND DATE, GO TO MY WEB SITE, TIME RYAN FOR AMERICA. MY NAME IS TIM RYAN, I'M FROM NORTHEAST OHIO. MY WIFE ANDREA IS A FIRST-GREAT TEACHER, I HAVE A 15 AND AN AND A 5-YEAR-OLD. WE HAVE GROWN-UP AT THE EPICENTER OF INDUSTRIALIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES. I COULD TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT HER DAD 40 YEARS AGO WHEN HE LOST HIS JOB ATS YOUNGSTOWN , JOB AT YOUNGSTOWN SHEET AND TUBE. HE HAD TO SELL INSURANCE AND CUT DOWN TREES TO MAKE A LIVING. I COULD TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT MY COUSIN DONNIE, VIETNAM VETERAN. HIS LAST ACT AT HIS FACTORY WAS TO UNBOLT THE MACHINE FROM THE FACTORY FLOOR, PUT IT IN A BOX, AND SHIP IT TO CHINA. I COULD GO BACK JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO THE GENERAL MOTORS PLANT JUST OUTSIDE OF YOUNGSTOWN IOWA WHO HAD 15,000 WORKERS LAID OFF ITS LAST SHIFT, DEVASTATING OUR COMMUNITY. THE REASON I TELL YOU THIS IS BECAUSE THE NEXT NOMINEE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS GOT TO DEEPLY, DEEPLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORKERS IN AMERICA ARE GOING THROUGH. AND WE HAVE , [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE IN MY COMMUNITY, WATCH THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THESE ECONOMIC TRADE DEALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THE DEVASTATION WHERE YOU CAN'T GET MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE, YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR YOUR SCHOOLS, YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR YOUR ROADS, THERE'S POLLUTION IN YOUR RIVER, THERE'S LEAD PAINT AND HIGH RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY AS THIS RIPPLES THROUGH THE ECONOMY. THE NEXT PERSON HAS GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS THE PERSON WHO CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S THE PERSON WHO CAN WIN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND IOWA AND OHIO, AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, TO PULL THESE WORKERS BACK INTO THE FOLD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND UNDERSTAND THAT WORKING HARD AND PLAYING BY THE RULES SHOULD MATTER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND I WILL PROMISE YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH AND THAT WE CAN WIN THESE WORKERS BACK OVER AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEATING DONALD TRUMP. IT IS ABOUT PUTTING AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO WE START BUILDING THINGS AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND WE DON'T , AND WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT $15 AN HOUR. WE TALK ABOUT $30 AN HOUR AND $40 AN HOUR AND $50 AN HOUR JOBS SO THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU MAY BY THE RULES, YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. G.M. GETS A BAILOUT, G.M. GETS A TAX CUT. THE BANKS GET A BAILOUT, THE BANKS GET A TAX CUT. MEANWHILE THE WORKER IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUES TO SUFFER. IT IS LIKE THE OLD COUNTRY SONG, \"THEY GET THE GOLD MINE, WE GET THE SHAFT.\" THOSE DAYS, MY FRIENDS, ARE OVER. I WILL MAKE NO PROMISES TO YOU BUT THIS. EVERY MORNING WHEN I WALK INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, I WILL USE EVERY OUNCE OF POWER THAT THAT OFFICE HOLDS. I WILL PULL EVERY LEVER TO HELP REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LET ME END WITH ONE QUICK STORY ABOUT MUHAMMAD ALI. WHEN ALI WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN KENTUCKY AND SOMEONE RAN INTO HIM AND SAID, HEY, CHAMP, I SAW A FIGHT YOU WERE IN WHEN I WAS A KID AND HE SAID, YEAH. THE KID SAID, YEAH. YOU GOT KNOCKED DOWN IN THE THIRDED ROUND. ALI SAID IT WASN'T MY FIGHT. THE KID SAID, MY DAD TOOK ME. YOU DID GREAT BUT YOU GOT KNOCKED DOWN IN THE THIRD ROUND. HE SAID IT WASN'T MY FIGHT. I AIN'T NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. I'M EITHER UP OR I'M GETTING UP. WELL, THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. YOU WERE EITHER UP OR YOU WERE GETTING UP. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE DEMOCRATS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. THEY ARE EITHER UP OR THEY ARE GETTING UP. THE WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. THEY ARE EITHER UP OR GETTING UP. THE WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. THEY WERE EITHER UP OR GETTING UP. AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN. WE ARE EITHER UP OR WE ARE GETTING UP. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN. OUR NEXT SPEAKER WANTS TO GIVE YOU, AND EVERY OTHER AMERICAN, SOME MONEY. ANDREW YANG IS AN ENTREPRENEUR AND FOUNDER FOR VENT UR FOR AMERICA. HE IS FOCUSED ON MEETING THE CHALLENGES THAT AUTOMATION BRINGS TO WORKING FAMILIES AND THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A WORKING INCOME. PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW YANG. IT IS FANTASTIC TO BE BACK. THANK YOU! WHEN I SAW THE PROGRAM FOR TODAY, I THOUGHT THE SAME THING YOU ALL DID, WHICH IS THIS: JOE BIDEN MUST REALLY LIKE NOT TO TRAVEL. YOU LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM, THERE ARE ONE,000 IOWANS , A THOUSAND , ABOUT A THOUSAND IOWANS. I'M HERE IT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU ALL HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING, HOW DID YOUR STATE WIN IOWA, HOW DID HE WIN MICHIGAN? HOW DID HE WIN OHIO? HOW DID HE EVEN WIN WISCONSIN? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, WE AUTOMATED AWAY FOUR MILLION JOBS IN WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, AND HERE IN IOWA. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE LEADERS IN TECHNOLOGY AND WE KNOW WHAT WE DID TO THE MANUFACTURING JOBS, WE WILL NOW DO TO THE RETAIL JOBS, THE CALL CENTER JOBS, THE FAST FOOD JOBS, THE TRUCK DRIVING JOBS AND ON AND ON THROUGH YOUR ECONOMY. HOW MANY NOTICED STORES ARE CLOSING WHERE YOU LIVE IN IOWA? WHY ARE THE STORES CLOSING? AMAZON. AMAZON IS LIKE A GIANT VACUUM SUCKING UP $20 MILLION. HOW MUCH DID AMAZON PAY IN TAXES LAST YEAR? ZERO. $20 BILLION OUT, ZERO BACK IN AND THE NUMBER ONE JOB IN YOUR COMMUNITIES IS WORKING IN RETAIL. THE AVERAGE RETAIL WORKER IS A 39-YEAR-OLD WOMAN MAKING $10 AN HOUR. WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO WHEN HER MAIN STREET MALL CLOSES. I WAS AT THE BIGGEST TRUCK STOP IN THE UNITED STATES AND MY FRIENDS IN SILICON VALLEY ARE WORKING ON TRUCKS THAT CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES. WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR THE 10 AND A HALF MILLION AMERICANS WHO DRIVE TRUCKS AND THOSE WHO WORK IN DINERS AND RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS THAT NEED TRUCKERS TO GET OUT AND HAVE A MEAL. THE REASON TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT IS THAT WE'RE IN THE THIRD INNING OF THE GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WHAT EXPERTS ARE CALLING THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. HE IS A SYSTEM OF OUR DISEASE. IT IS YOUR JOB TO PRESENT THE CURE TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT YOUR VISION. SO WHAT DOES THAT , WHAT IS THAT CURE? IF YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT ME IN THE CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW THERE'S AN AN ASIAN MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO WANTS TO GIVE EVERYONE $1,000 A MONTH. ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. YOU THINK IT IS A GIMMICK. THOMAS PAYNE WAS FOR THIS CALLED THE CITIZENS DIVIDEND, MARTIN , IT PASSED THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TWICE IN 1971 UNDER NIXON AND ONE STATE HAS ALREADY HAD A DIVIDEND FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS WHERE EVERYONE IN THAT STATE GETS BETWEEN $1,000 AND $2,000 A YEAR, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. WHAT STATE IS THAT, IOWA? AND HOW DO THEY FUND IT? AND WHAT IS THE OIL OF THE 21ST CENTURY? TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S RIGHT. DATA, A.I., SELF-DRIVING CARS AND TRUCKS, WHAT THEY ARE DOING FOR THE PEOPLE IN ALASKA WITH OIL MONEY, WE CAN DO HERE IN IOWA AND EVERYONE AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH TECHNOLOGY MONEY. HOW WOULD YOU ALL SPEND THAT MONEY? I KNOW HOW YOU WOULD SPEND THAT MONEY. YOU WOULD SPEND IT ON TUTORING FOR YOUR KIDS, CAR REPAIRS AND MOST OF IT WOULD STAY HERE IN IOWA. IT WOULD GROW YOUR CONSUMER ECONOMY BY 12%, IT WOULD CREATE 40,000 NEW JOBS, REVITALIZE RURAL AREAS AND GIVE YOUR KIDS A PATH FORWARD. IT WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY SENIOR CITIZEN IS ABLE TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND NOT IT WOULD REVITALIZE RURAL AREAS AND IT WOULD GIVE YOUR KIDS A PATH FORWARD. IT WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY SENIOR CITIZEN IS ABLE TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND ARE NOT WORKING AT A CONVENIENCE STORE TO MAKE ENDS MEET UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ALL ABOUT EMPOWERING WOMEN. WE KNOW THERE ARE MILLIONS OF WOMEN AROUND THE COUNTRY IN EXPLOITIVE OR ABUSIVE JOBS OR RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD BE IMPROVED BY $1,000 A MONTH. WE CAN EITHER TALK ABOUT EMPOWERING WOMEN OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I SAY WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT TODAY BECAUSE HE GOT THE PROBLEMS RIGHT BUT HIS SOLUTIONS ARE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED. HIS SOLUTIONS WERE TURN THE CLOCK BACK, BUILD A WALL AND I'M SAYING WE HAVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. WE HAVE TO TURN THE CLOCK FORWARD. WE HAVE TO ADVANCE IN THE WAY WE SEE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. NOW, MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW MARIANNE WILLIAMSON AS AN AUTHOR OR AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER. WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS THAT SHE HAS SPENT HER 35-YEAR CAREER HELPING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TRANSFORM TIMES OF CRISIS THAT ARE STARTLINGLY SIMILAR TO THE ONES OUR COUNTRY FACES NOW. THIS HAS GIVEN HER A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEEPER HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THE BASIS OF HER CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY. PLEASE WELCOME MARIANNE WILLIAMSON. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND THAT IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020? NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO FIND IS SOMEBODY TOUGH ENOUGH, WHO'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP? BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY DEEP FEELING THAT IF YOU THINK THAT OUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO FIND SOMEONE TOUGH ENOUGH TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, YOU ARE NAIVE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE OPPONENT. SOMETHING DEEPER, SOMETHING FAR MORE DANGEROUS IS GOING ON HERE THAN TRADITIONAL POLITICAL TOUGHNESS EVEN KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TOUCHED PEOPLE IN A VERY, VERY FEARFUL PLACE AND ONLY ONETHI CAN CAST OUT THAT FEAR. IT'S NOT MONEY; IT'S NOT JUST STRATEGY; IT'S NOT JUST ANGER AND IT'S NOT JUST MOBILIZING OUR BASE. IT IS LOVE. LAST TIME, WE WON WITH HOPE. THIS TIME, WE WILL WIN WITH LOVE. AND ULTIMATELY, WE WILL ONLY WIN IF WE TOUCH ENOUGH PEOPLE'S HEARTS. I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HARNESSING THE EMOTIONS OF LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HERE, I'M APPALLED BY HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE THAT, BUT UNLIKE MANY PEOPLE HERE, I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HOW HE HAS DONE IT. DONALD TRUMP HAS BUILT A CAREER HARNESSING FEAR AND I HAVE BUILT A CAREER INSPIRING LOVE. TRUMP HAS SPOKEN TO A VERY DARK AND PRIMAL PLACE WITHIN THE HUMAN PSYCHE, A PLACE OF FEAR THAT BECOMES LIKE AN EMOTIONAL KNOT IN PEOPLE'S BRAINS AND THIS KNOT CANNOT BE UNRAVELED BY MERE INTELLECTUAL OR RATIONALISTIC ARGUMENT FOR I ASSURE YOU THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT RATIONALLY ANALYZES AN ISSUE IS NOT THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT DECIDES WHO TO VOTE FOR. THAT EMOTIONAL KNOT CAN ONLY BE UNRAVELED THROUGH THE POWER OF AN EQUALLY PRIMAL PLACE WITHIN THE PSYCHOEE, PSYCHE. THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT A BIG LIE IS THROUGH THE POWER OF A BIG TRUTH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ONLY BIG TRUTH IS THE REAL TRUTH, NOT THE KIND OF, SORT OF, SOMETIMES, WHEN IT PASSES FOR TRUTH AMONG THE POLITICAL CLASS. THE REAL TRUTH IS NOT JUST THE TRUTH OF THE MOMENT. IT IS THE TRUTH OF THE AGES. AND IT IS NOT THE TRUTH BASED ON SELF-INTEREST. IT IS A TRUTH BASED ON PRINCIPLE. REPUBLICANS DON'T WALK THEIR WALK, WE ALL KNOW THAT, BUT TOO OFTEN WE DON'T TALK OUR WALK. OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES WE HAVE CEDED 1\/3 LIKE MORALITY AND PATRIOTISM TO THOSE WHO WERE MORE THAN GLAD TO TAKE IT FROM US. PEOPLE WHO PASS POLICIES DESTRUCTIVE TO EVERYTHING FAMILIES SHOULD STAND FOR HAVE CLAIMED TO STAND FOR FAMILY VALUES. PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED POLICIES THAT HAVE CREATED THE LARGEST INCOME INEQUALITY SINCE 1929 CLAIM TO HAVE GIVEN US A GOOD ECONOMY. AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE LED US INTO UNJUSTIFIABLE WARS THAT HAVE KILLED TENS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CLAIM TO BE STRONGER ON SECURITY. THOSE ARE LIES BUT HAVE THEY BEEN POLITICALLY POWERFUL? OH, YES AND WHY HAVE THEY NOT BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LIES? BECAUSE WE TOO OFTEN HAVE NOT HELD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO TRUTH. TOO OFTEN THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN THE PARTY THAT STANDS FOR THE RIGHT THING, BUT STILL COZIES UP TO THE FORCES THAT DO THE WRONG THING, THINKING THAT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE ONCE WE GET IN POWER WE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING, AND THEN WE NAIVELY THINK THAT THAT DOESN'T SMELL TO PEOPLE, THAT THE PUTRID STENCH OF THAT MORE COMPLICATED CORRUPTION WILL NOT BE WAFTING INTO THE NOSTRILS OF THE AVERAGE VOTER. IN OTHER WORDS, TOO MANY DEMOCRATS ARE HALF-TRUTH TELLERS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND DONALD TRUMP WILL EAT THE HALF-TRUTH TELLERS ALIVE. THE REAL TRUTH IS HOW DEEPLY CORRUPT OUR COUNTRY HAS BECOME. HOW WE'RE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING AS A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. WE ARE A GOVERNMENT OF THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS FOR THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FOR THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. WE REJECTED OF THE PEOPLE, BY A FEW OF THE PEOPLE, WE REJECTED THAT NONSENSE IN 1776 AND IT IS TIME FOR US TO REPUDIATE THAT STUFF AGAIN! THE POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT AND IT IS NOW TIME IF WE, THE PEOPLE, TO STEP IN. THE ABOLITIONIST MOVEMENT ENDED SLAVERY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE STEPPED IN AND THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT GOT WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE WHEN THE PEOPLE STEPPED IN. AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ENDED SEGREGATION WHEN THE PEOPLE STEPPED IN. IT WAS NOT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT INITIATED THOSE CHANGES. THOSE CHANGES OCCURRED WHEN THE PEOPLE STEPPED IN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS NOW TIME ONCE AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE TO STEP IN. [APPLAUSE] SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW THEM FROM BEING TEACHERS. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THEM WHEN THEY WERE STILL TEACHING. I KNOW THEM AS DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS AND IF THIS IS A SECOND CAREER FOR THEM, WOW. THEY'RE DOING GREAT. THE FIRST TIME I MET THEM IT WAS AT THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS FORUM. AND IT WAS MY FIRST YEAR, FIRST SESSION, 2012. AND I LOOKED OUT INTO THE CROWD AND I SAW THESE TWO PEOPLE JUST SMILING, SMILING, AND THEN PRETTY SOON THE NEXT FORUM I SAW THEM AGAIN AND THE NEXT FORUM I SAW THEM AGAIN. AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE EVER SINCE. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS SHOW UP. CINDY AND ELWOOD ARE THE BEST VOLUNTEERS EVER. AND I THINK 100% OF THEIR RETIREMENT TIME IS SPENT DOING, YOU KNOW, ACTIVIST ACTIVITIES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOT ONLY DO THEY COME TO THE STATE CAPITAL, BUT THEY GO TO ALL THE FORUMS AND THEY ORGANIZE PROTESTS. AND THEN THEY ORGANIZE PHONE BANKS AND THEY GET PEOPLE ELECTED AND THEY KNOCK ON DOORS. THEY JUST DO IT ALL. AND THEY DO IT CONSISTENTLY. THEY DO IT WHEN IT'S RAINING, WHEN IT'S SNOWING. THEY ARE THERE. EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY'RE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE DOING THINGS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. I HAVE NOT BEEN TO AN EVENT IN CEDAR RAPIDS WHERE I DON'T SEE ONE OR BOTH OF THEM. EVEN ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION I STOPPED IN CEDAR RAPIDS AND THERE WAS CINDY PICKING UP A PACKET. THEY WORK HARD. THEY DON'T ASK FOR A LOT IN RETURN OTHER THAN TO JUST GET GOOD LEADERS WHO ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS STATE A BETTER PLACE. THEY'VE DONE SOME VERY FUN THINGS LIKE I WOULDN'T CALL IT MAYBE A SIT-IN IN THE OFFICE, BUT CLOSE TO IT. THEY SHOWED UP EVERY WEEK. IT'S DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISM AT ITS BEST BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSISTENT AND PERSISTENT. THEY HELPED START INDIVISIBLE WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE FORCE FOR SUPPORT OF CANDIDATES, BUT MORE THAN THAT IT'S BEEN INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL. SO THEY DO A LOT OF FACEBOOK POSTINGS, BUT THEY ALSO DO POST CARD PARTIES AND YOU MIGHT BE ASKED TO WRITE SEVERAL OF THESE POST CARDS TO SEVERAL LEGISLATORS. AT THE END OF SOME SESSIONS THEY GATHERED PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WROTE POST CARDS TO US, CONGRATULATING US AND COMMISERATING WITH US. AND SO I RECEIVED A POST CARD FROM CINDY AND THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED. I TOOK THAT POST CARD AND WHEN THINGS GET BAD, OCCASIONALLY, WHEN I COME HOME ON THE WEEKEND I'LL GO AT LEAST CINDY STILL LOVES ME. THEY ARE FEARLESS. CINDY IS THIS COOL, CALM AND COLLECTED PERSON SO I WAS STANDING THERE AT A HILLARY CLINTON GET TOGETHER A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO? AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I TURN AROUND AND THERE SHE IS, SHE'S INTRODUCING HILLARY CLINTON. AMAZINGLY, AMAZINGLY INTRODUCING HILLARY CLINTON. THEY ARE TOTALLY DESERVING OF THIS AWARD BECAUSE THEY'RE 100% COMMITTED, THEY'RE DEDICATED, THEY'RE LOYAL, THEY HAVE LEADERSHIP, THEY'RE JUST , THEY'RE JUST TERRIFIC. TERRIFIC PEOPLE. IF I COULD SEE THEM NOW, I WOULD SAY CONGRATULATIONS FOR A JOB WELL DONE AND KEEP GOING, KEEP SUPPORTING US AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR US. [APPLAUSE] AND SO NOW, IT IS MY EXTREME HONOR TO INDUCT INTO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC HALL OF FAME TWO OF THE HARDEST WORKING ACTIVISTS I HAVE EVER MET, AS OUR ACTIVISTS OF THE YEAR, PLEASE WELCOME CINDY AND ELWOOD. (music)(music) (music)(music) THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU, TROY, THANK YOU TO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. ELWOOD AND I ARE UP HERE ON THE STAGE NOT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE'VE DONE ANYTHING ALL THAT SPECTACULAR. I'M NOT SURE WHO LIZ WAS , A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE HERE WHO SUPPORT THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DOING AND I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT-OUT TO ALL OF THOSE ACTIVISTS HERE. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU KEEP US GOING EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE FOLKS WHO ALWAYS SHOW UP. THEY ALWAYS SPEAK UP. THEY NEVER, EVER GIVE UP. AND I WOULD CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU, YOU SAW LIZ AND WE HAD A LITTLE FUN WITH ROD BLUM AND CARDBOARD ROD. AND LUCKILY, WE WON THAT BATTLE. WE MOVED OUR SIGHTS NOW TO JODY ERNST SO I CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU PLEASE KEEP SHOWING UP, KEEP SPEAKING UP, AND NEVER, EVER GIVE UP. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT SENATE SEAT BACK. THANK YOU. (music)(music) (music)(music) THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO FOR OUR PARTY. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE I WANT TO THANK BEFORE WE KEEP GOING. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO GIVE MY EXTREME , EXPRESS MY EXTREME GRATITUDE TO THE HARD-WORKING STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO PUT THIS ON TODAY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THANKING THE STAFF HERE AT THE HOTEL FOR ALL THEIR WORK AND FOR MAKING SURE THIS EVENT HAS GONE OFF SO GREATLY. [APPLAUSE] AND SO OUR NEXT SPEAKER GREW UP ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN OKLAHOMA. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN HAS DEDICATED HER CAREER TO HELPING THOSE WHO ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. HER HARD WORK AND PERSISTENCE LED TO THE CREATION OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. AND IN 2012, SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE FROM MASSACHUSETTS. AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, WARREN IS CONTINUING THE FIGHT TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY, AND ENSURE EVERYONE IN THIS STATE GETS A SELFIE. PLEASE WELCOME ELIZABETH WARREN. (music)(music) (music)(music) SO IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE STANDING ON THIS STAGE, NOT SOMETHING THAT IN A MILLION YEARS I EVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO. I'VE HAD AMBITIONS, JOB AMBITIONS SINCE I WAS IN SECOND GRADE. I'VE KNOWN WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I WANTED TO BE A PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHER. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS? IT WAS A PRETTY ROCKY PATH FOR US. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY, MY DADDY ENDED UP AS A JANITOR. I GOT TO SCHOOL, DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AT 19 AND GOT MARRIED. BUT I SCRATCHED MY WAY BACK. I FINISHED MY FOUR-YEAR DIPLOMA AND I BECAME A SPECIAL NEEDS TEACHER. I HAVE LIVED THE DREAM JOB. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT TEACHERS. WE UNDERSTAND THE WORTH OF EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING. WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND WE NEVER GIVE UP. RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S BROKEN. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S WRONG. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST, BUT I COME TO YOU TODAY WITH A HEART FILLED WITH OPTIMISM. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ACROSS IOWA. I'VE BEEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA, THERE IS A REAL HUNGER. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE READY FOR BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE READY FOR CHANGE AND I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR THAT. IN FACT, I'VE GOT A LOT OF PLANS SO LET ME JUST MENTION A FEW. HOW ABOUT A WEALTH TAX ON THE TOP .1%? MAKE THEM PAY 2 CENTS, THEY CAN AFFORD IT. AND WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THAT 2 CENTS? WE CAN CANCEL STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 43 MILLION AMERICANS. WE CAN PROVIDE UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE AND PRE-K FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR KIDS. WE CAN CREATE 1.2 MILLION NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS, REBUILD AN INDUSTRIAL BASE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. AND ON CLIMATE CHANGE, THE TRULY EXISTENTIAL THREAT BEARING DOWN ON US. I DON'T HAVE JUST ONE PLAN. I'VE GOT TWO PLANS TO ATTACK IT HEAD ON BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. AND JUST ONE MORE THAT I WANT TO MENTION, AND THAT IS ROE VERSUS WADE. I'VE GOT A PRACTICAL PLAN TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED TO WOMEN UNDER ROE VERSUS WADE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DOES. THERE'S A LOT BROKEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THE CORRUPTION. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING WE COULD DO IS BREAK THE , I PROPOSE COMES TO ONE CENTRAL QUESTION. WHO DOES THIS GOVERNMENT WORK FOR? IS IT GOING TO CONTINUE TO JUST WORK FOR A THINNER AND THINNER SLICE AT THE TOP OR ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THIS GOVERNMENT WORK FOR THE REST OF AMERICA? I'M IN THIS FIGHT TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THE REST OF AMERICA. AND I'M BUILDING A GRASSROOTS OPERATION TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I'VE DONE 90 PLUS TOP HALLS. I'VE TAKEN LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN TO 20 STATES AND PUERTO RICO AND WE'RE COMING UP ON OUR 30,000th SELFIE. THAT IS HOW YOU BUILD A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT. BECAUSE HERE'S WHY. WHY DO I HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT? BECAUSE I'M NOT SPENDING MY TIME WITH HIGH-DOLLAR DONORS AND WITH CORPORATE LOBBYISTS. I'M SPENDING MY TIME WITH YOU. THAT'S HOW WE BUILD A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. ONE THAT WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE, ONE WHERE WE CAN WIN UP AND DOWN THE TICKET. ONE WHERE WE CAN WIN THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE WHERE WE CAN START TO MAKE REAL CHANGE COME JANUARY, 2021. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. WE SHOULD TREME BIG, FIGHT HARD AND WIN! [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, IOWA. THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE JUST AS COMFORTABLE BEHIND A BAR AS THEY ARE A GOVERNOR'S DESK, BUT OUR NEXT SPEAKER , TO HEAL THE DIVIDE AND GET OUR COUNTRY MOVING. PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR JOHN HICKENLOOPER. (music)(music) (music)(music) WELL, HELLO, IOWA DEMOCRATS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OFF ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING AWARDS TONIGHT. YOU ALL DO THE HARD WORK, KNOCKING ON DOORS IN THE SNOW AND THE HEAT. PHONE BANKING, LATE INTO THE NIGHT IS DIFFICULT, OFTEN THANKLESS WORK, BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL WORK. YOU ALL ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE RESISTANCE. YOU PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY. PRESIDENT TRUMP REMINDS US EVERY DAY THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS SOMETHING WE NEGLECT AT OUR OWN PERIL. WE NOW LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE CHILDREN ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND PUT INTO CAGES. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY IS UNDER CONSTANT ASSAULT. THE SICK AND THE ELDERLY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THEIR MEDICAL BILLS OR THEIR UTILITY BILLS. DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] DEFEATING HIM IS FAR FROM GUARANTEED. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE RIGHT APPROACH. WE MUST BE PROGRESSIVE BUT ALSO PRAGMATIC. WE NEED A DREAMER BUT ALSO A DOER. WE MUST PRESENT A BOLD VISION FOR THE FUTURE, BUT WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE ATTACK THE REPUBLICANS CAN LEVEL AGAINST US IS ONE OF SOCIALISM. NOW, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD SHY AWAY FROM BIG PROGRESSIVE GOALS, FAR FROM IT. A PRAGMATIST DOESN'T SAY NO TO BIG IDEAS. THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEM DONE. I KNOW BECAUSE IT'S WHAT WE DID IN COLORADO. TODAY, COLORADO HAS NEAR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. ALL 64 COUNTIES HAVE RELIABLE BROADBAND SERVICE. WE'VE HAD THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. WE WERE THE FIRST STATE TO COMPEL THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY TO ELIMINATE METHANE EMISSIONS. AND WE BEAT THE NRA AND BECAME THE FIRST PURPLE STATE TO PASS UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND MAGAZINE LIMITS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN OTHER STATES WERE LIMITING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, WE PROVIDED LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION TO ANY WOMAN WHO WANTS IT. WE CUT UNINTENDED PREGNANCY IN YOUNG WOMEN BY TWO THIRDS. I AM THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING WHO IS , WHO HAS DONE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT. SO I CAN TELL YOU WE DO BIG THINGS BY BRINGING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT WE WILL MAKE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. WE WILL DO IT BY CREATING A PUBLIC OPTION. THE MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS WHO LIKE THEIR INSURANCE CAN KEEP IT. AND THE MILLIONS WHO DO NOT WILL HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, AMERICA WILL NOT ONLY REJOIN THE PARIS ACCORD, BUT WE WILL EXCEED ITS GOALS. WE WILL WORK WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND NONPROFITS TO DO THE MASSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WILL NEED TO RAPIDLY ADDRESS OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, EVERY AMERICAN WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE THEIR OWN VERSION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE WILL MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A PATH TOWARDS THE MORE THAN 65% OF AMERICANS WHO WON'T GET A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. I WILL WORK WITH UNIONS AND BUSINESSES TO DO THE BIGGEST EXPANSION OF APPRENTICESHIP IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. 1 MILLION APPRENTICESHIPS A YEAR. [APPLAUSE] I AM PROUD TO BE THE PARTY THAT NOT ONLY DARED TO DREAM BIG DREAMS, BUT HAD THE PERSISTENCE TO GET THEM DONE, FROM CREATING SOCIAL SECURITY, TO PUTTING A MAN ON THE MOON. I AM A DREAMER AND A DOER AND WE NEED BOTH TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS, NOT JUST BIG IDEAS, BUT GETTING THEM DONE. FINDING COMMON GROUND WHEN IT SOMETIMES SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING THERE BETWEEN US, BUT MOUNTAINS. THAT'S MY RECORD. AND THAT WILL BE MY PROMISE TO YOU AS PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. OUR NEXT STRANGER SPEAKER IS SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, SHE IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF FAMILIES IN THE HEARTLAND AND ENSURING THAT KIDS WHO GROW UP IN RURAL AMERICA CAN STAY IN RURAL AMERICA. THROUGHOUT HER MORE THAN 12 YEARS IN THE SENATE, KLOBUCHAR CAN OFTEN BE SEEN RUNNING AROUND IOWA HELPING TO ELECT DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET. NOW, AS THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT SHE HOPES TO BRING HER MIDWESTERN VALUES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR. THANK YOU, IOWA DEMOCRATS! I AM YOUR SENATOR NEXT DOOR. AND I CAN SEE IOWA FROM MY PORCH. SO NEIGHBORS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN MY ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A MINNESOTA BLIZZARD. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT ANNOUNCEMENT? THE PRESIDENT SENT OUT A TWEET, AND HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOWSTORM, AND HE GAVE ME A NICKNAME, SNOW WOMAN. SO I WROTE BACK, HEY, DONALD TRUMP, THE SCIENCE IS ON MY SIDE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW YOUR HAIR WOULD FARE IN A BLIZZARD. I ANNOUNCED BY THAT RIVER BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT THAT I COME FROM THE HEARTLAND AND YES, WE HAVE SNOW IN THE HEARTLAND AND I DON'T COME FROM MONEY, BUT I HAVE GRIT. YOU KNOW I GOT INTO POLITICS WITH THAT GRIT WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS BORN AND SHE WAS REALLY SICK, SHE COULDN'T SWALLOW AND BACK THEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD A RULE THAT THEY KICKED YOU OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AFTER 24 HOURS AND SHE WAS IN INTENSIVE CARE AND I GOT KICKED OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL AND WHEN WE GOT OUT AND SHE GOT A LITTLE BETTER, I WENT TO THE LEGISLATURE AS A NEW MOM, NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, AND ADVOCATED AND GOT PASSED WHAT WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A COUNTRY GUARANTEEING NEW MOMS AND THEIR BABIES A 48-HOUR HOSPITAL STAY. MY BACKGROUND IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN DONALD TRUMP'S. MY GRANDPA A UNION MEMBER WORKED 1,500 FEET UNDERGROUND IN THE MINES. HE SAVED MONEY IN A COFFEE CAN TO SEND MY DAD TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MY MOM, SHE GREW UP IN WISCONSIN. SHE BECAME A TEACHER, A PROUD UNION TEACHER, AND SHE TAUGHT SECOND GRADE UNTIL SHE WAS 70 YEARS OLD. AND I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF AN IRON ORE MINER, THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT, BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR CONNECTIONS ARE, NO MATTER WHO YOU LOVE, THAT YOU CAN BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS A COUNTRY OF SHARED DREAMS AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT TRIES TO FRACTURE THOSE DREAMS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I SAY WHAT BETTER PLACE TO GO TO REVIVE THE HEART OF AMERICA THAN IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT MEANS AN OPTIMISTIC ECONOMIC AGENDA BRIDGING THAT RURAL-URBAN DIVIDE. IT MEANS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE IN THE URBAN AREAS UNDERSTAND THAT FOOD DOESN'T JUST MAGICALLY APPEAR ON YOUR TABLE. IT MEANS INVESTING IN CHILDCARE AND FAIR HOUSING, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND GETTING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BACK ON TRACK. IOWA, IT MEANS STANDING UP TO RISKY SCHEMES OF PRIVATIZING MEDICAID. IT MEANS STANDING UP FOR OUR RURAL HOSPITALS AND IT MEANS SAYING TO THOSE BIG PHARMA COMPANIES YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MIGHT HAVE TWO LOBBIES FOR EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS, YOU MIGHT THINK THEY OWN WASHINGTON, BUT THEY DON'T OWN ME. THAT IS WHAT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA IS ABOUT. SO LET'S STAND UP FOR OUR UNIONS AND THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE BECAUSE WHEN UNIONS ARE STRONG, OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG. LET'S STAND UP LIKE THE RANGERS OF IOWA 130 YEARS AGO AND STAND UP AGAINST MONOPOLY POWER. AND LET'S PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. THAT IS HOW WE GET THE DARK MONEY OUT OF OUR POLITICS. BUT TO DO THIS WE NEED TO WIN AND I KNOW I CAN WIN BECAUSE I'VE DONE IT EVERY PLACE, EVERYWHERE, EVERY TIME AND IF WE DON'T THINK WE CAN WIN IN THE MIDWEST WITH A MIDWESTERNER ON THE TICKET, I HAVE FOUR WORDS FOR YOU. FORMER GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. IOWA LOOK AT THE ARCH THAT WE'RE ON, THE DAY AFTER THE INAUGURATION, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PEACEFULLY MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY, DENYING THE MEAN SPIRITED REFUGEE ORDER, PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY SHOWED UP AT THE AIRPORTS. DAY 100, THE MARCH FOR SCIENCE, MY FAVORITE SIGN. AND THEN THE FIGHTING DEMOCRATS, WE STOOD UP AGAINST THEIR ATTEMPT TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND THEN THOSE STUDENTS MARCHED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE AND THEY DIDN'T JUST MARCH. THEY VOTED. AND THEN FINALLY, LAST FALL, WITH WE INTERPRETED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BACK INTO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. THAT IS HOW WE WIN, THAT IS HOW WE WIN IN 2020. AND THAT IS HOW WE WILL BRING BACK AMERICA AND REVIVE THE HEART OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT MY CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT. IT IS A GRASSROOTS EFFORT. SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. (music)(music) (music)(music) THE FIRST TIME I MET ROB, I REMEMBER BEING REALLY STRUCK WITH HIS PERSONALITY, HIS VIEWS. I THOUGHT WOW THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT I REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH. AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED WHEN I SAW THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER. WE WERE BOTH BRAND-NEW AND WE CAME INTO AN INCREDIBLY VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT AND PRETTY MUCH JUST THROWN IN AND SAID START FIGHTING. AND IT REALLY FORGED A STRONG VIBE BETWEEN ROSS AND I, AND WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE. IT'S GREAT TO JOKE WITH HIM WHEN WE'RE IN LIKE FOUR OR FIVE, SIX, EIGHT HOUR CAUCUSES. IT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO VENT TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON AND CAN EITHER TALK YOU OFF A LEDGE OR PUT YOU UP ON ONE IF YOU NEED TO BE. I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH THE THINGS THAT HE KNOWS OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND IF YOU ASK HIM SOMETHING AND HE DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER HE WILL GO AND FIND IT. WORK HARD AND DO HIS RESEARCH SO THAT HE CAN BE WELL INFORMED AND DO HIS JOB TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY. WHAT KIND OF A GUY IS ROSS OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITOL? HE'S A LOT OF FUN, INCREDIBLY FUNNY. HE MAKES ME LAUGH SO HARD SOMETIMES. THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES THAT I COULD TELL YOU, BUT THEN I WOULD HAVE TO KILL YOU. , HOW DEEPLY HE CARES ABOUT THE KIDS THAT WE WORKED WITH IN WATERLOO AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THE SPEECH THAT HE GAVE DURING THE STAND YOUR GROUND DEBATE. I THINK THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLY BRAVE OF HIM TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT IT REALLY MADE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE, TO KIND OF SEE JUST HOW QUICKLY THEIR ATTITUDE OR THEIR VIEWS CAN CHANGE BASED ON THE PERSON STANDING THERE IN A SUIT AND TIE AND STANDING THERE IN A HOODY. I KNOW HE'S NOT REALLY A FAN OF AWARDS OR BEING PUT UP ON A PEDESTAL IN ANY SORT OF WAY, BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD RECOGNITION OF THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT HE HAS DONE AND IT COMES AT THE PERFECT TIME WHERE HE'S REALLY STARTING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE HOUSE WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FIRST-EVER BLACK CAUCUS. AND AS THE FIRST CHAIR OF THAT CAUCUS, HE HAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND A LOT OF WORK AND HE HAS REALLY TAKEN THAT ON JUST QUITE FEARLESSLY. HE REPRESENTS THE FUTURE OF OUR PARTY. IN HIS TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ADVOCATE FOR HIS CONSTITUENTS, BLACK HAWK COUNTY AND FOR NORTHEAST IOWA AND I KNOW THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT HE'S GOING TO DO FOR OUR STATE. HE REALLY FEELS COMPELLED TO DO THIS WORK AND SOME OF US DO FEEL THAT WAY AND SOME OF US ARE THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO IN THE WINTER, BUT HE FEELS COMPELLED TO CHANGE IOWA AND CHANGE THE WORLD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND SO IT IS MY HONOR TO INDUCT INTO THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S HALL OF FAME, OUR 2019 RISING STAR AND HE TRULY IS A RISING STAR PLEASE WELCOME REPRESENTATIVE SMITH. (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) WELL, I THINK YOU SAID IT BETTER THAN I COULD, BUT A COUPLE OF WORDS, I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE AND MY KIDS FOR ALLOWING ME TO REALLY DO THIS WORK. THANK YOU TO MY PARENTS FOR THEIR CONSTANT SUPPORT FOR ME AND KEEPING ME IN LINE WHEN I STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. ALSO, THANK YOU TO REPRESENTATIVE NIELSEN FOR THOSE KIND WORDS. ALSO, A SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO MEMBERS OF THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC HOUSE CAUCUS. BUT I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS, WITH ONE ASK. THAT AS A DEMOCRATIC PARTY WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO BECOME BIGGER THAN WE HAVE BEEN. WE NEED TO BE MORE COURAGEOUS AND GREATER IN SPIRIT IN OUR OUTLOOK THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN BEFORE. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. LET US KEEP MOVING FORWARD AS WE TRY TO CHANGE NOT ONLY IOWA, BUT THE WORLD AND THE WAY THAT WE DO BUSINESS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) THANK YOU, REPRESENTATIVE. OUR NEXT SPEAKER HAS SHOWN HOW TO WIN IN A RED STATE BECAUSE HE'S DONE IT THREE TIMES. HE WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF MONTANA IN 2012, REELECTED IN 2016 AFTER HAVING SERVED AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THROUGHOUT HIS TENURE HE HAS ENACTED PROGRESSIVE CHANGE BY EXPANDING MEDICAID, PASSING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CREATED LANDMARK LEGISLATION FOR LGBTQ RIGHTS JUST TO MENTION A FEW. AS PRESIDENT HE SEEKS TO BRING HIS ABILITY TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE IN WASHINGTON. PLEASE WELCOME THE GOVERNOR OF MONTANA, STEVE BULLOCK. THANKS FOR NOT CHANGING THE RULES THIS WEEK FOR WHO GETS TO BE ON THIS STAGE. YOU'RE ALL HERE, YOU'VE LISTENED TO 37 SPEECHES. WE'RE HERE FOR YOU TO FIND REASON. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR NATION, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR NATION'S STANDING IN THE WORLD AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE AMERICA THAT WE PASS ON TO OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS, WE'RE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] IT'S MORE THAN JUST BEATING HIM, THOUGH. IT'S REJECTING THE BEHAVIOR HE'S NORMALIZING. LIES, MISSTATEMENTS, DIVIDING US BY RACE, BY GENDER, BY GEOGRAPHY. TWITTER TIRADES AND TEMPER TANTRUMS. WE NOW EXPECT MORE OUT OF OUR PRESCHOOLERS THAN WE DO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT REJECTING CRONY CAPITALISM. A TRILLION DOLLARS OF STOCK BUY BACKS DIDN'T GO TO YOU AND ME. THANKS TO THE TAX CUTS, THE CREW CLEANING UP WILL PAY MORE IN TAXES LAST YEAR THAN COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON AND CHEVRON. OUR EFFORT IS ABOUT MAKING EVERY AMERICAN KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMY AND OUR DEMOCRACY WILL WORK FOR THEM THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, HOW MUCH MONEY YOUR FAMILY HAS, YOU HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT THAT AMERICAN DREAM. BUT FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO WIN. 2016 I WAS THE ONLY DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY TO WIN A STATEWIDE REELECT WHERE TRUMP WON. HE TOOK MONTANA BY 20 POINTS, I WON BY FOUR. 25% OF MY VOTERS VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. THE PATH TO VICTORY ISN'T JUST THROUGH THE COASTS. IT INCLUDES PLACES THAT WE LOST LAST ELECTION. THINK ABOUT IT. ALMOST A THIRD OF YOUR COUNTIES VOTED FOR OBAMA TWICE THEN TRUMP. THIS IS ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOUR STATE HOUSE. AND IF WE CAN'T FIRE UP DEMOCRATS TO WIN BACK PLACES THAT WE LOST IN '16, WE MAY AS WELL FOLD UP THAT GREAT BIG TENT RIGHT NOW. AND THIS ELECTION, IT'S MORE THAN ABOUT WINNING. IT'S MAKING WASHINGTON, D.C. WORK FOR US. IN THIS WORLD WHERE MONEY EQUALS SPEECH, CORPORATIONS HAVE THE SEMIRIGHT AS PEOPLE UNTIL WE ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE RULES ARE NOW WRITTEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE BIGGEST CHECKBOOKS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANY OF THE PROBLEMS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE LAST 17 SPEECHES. LOOK, I GET THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM MONEY IN OUR ELECTIONS. BUT D.C.'S BECOME A PLACE WHERE TALKING HAS BEEN THE PLACE AND NOT DOING. THIS HAS BEEN THE FIGHT OF MY CAREER. WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL I NOT ONLY ORGANIZED THE STATES AGAINST CITIZENS UNITED, BUT THEN WHEN WASHINGTON AND EVERY OTHER STATE SAID THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD DO I BROUGHT THE FIRST CHALLENGE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AGAINST THAT CASE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I'M NOT THE ONLY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE ROOM. YOUR LEGENDARY A.G. TOM MILLER IS HERE WITH US TODAY. [APPLAUSE] I'M HONORED TO HAVE HIS ENDORSEMENT FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU, TOM. AFTER THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN MONTANA'S CORPORATE SPENDING BAN, AS GOVERNOR I WORKED WITH THAT REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE TO PASS ONE OF THOSE PROGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. A FULL DISCLOSURE OF ALL SPENDING, 90 DAYS OUT FROM AN ELECTION. MAILERS FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS COMING IN TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BUT ON DAY 90 IT STOPPED. AND IF WE CAN STOP THE KOCH BROTHERS IN MONTANA WE CAN STOP THEM IN IOWA, WE CAN STOP THEM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED THERE. WE ARE THE ONLY STATE THAT REQUIRES EVERY COMPANY SEEKING STATE CONTRACTS DISCLOSE EVERY SINGLE WAY THEY'RE TRYING TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS FIELD HOLDING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT FOR TRYING TO TURN OUR ELECTIONS INTO DARK MONEY AUCTIONS. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT BEATING DONALD TRUMP. WINNING BACK PLACES WE LOST, BUT ALSO GIVING PEOPLE A REASON TO VOTE FOR US, NOT JUST AGAINST HIM. ALSO ABOUT MAKING OUR ECONOMY AND OUR DEMOCRACY WORK FOR ALL OF US SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A FAIR SHOT AT THAT AMERICAN DREAM. THERE ARE 239 DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE IOWA COX CAUCUS. HELP ME MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DAYS COUNT. THANKS SO MUCH. I LOOK FORWARD TO EARNING YOUR SUPPORT AND THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS OUR MOST RECENT ENTRANT IN THE RACE FOR WHITE HOUSE. HIS WORK IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO WAS ELECTED IN 2013. HE HAS CREATED UNIVERSAL PRE-K FOR ALL 74,000 4-YEAR-OLDS IN NEW YORK CITY, EXPAND THE PAID SICK LEAVE LAW AND RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL CITY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS. DE BLASIO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP AND PUT WORKING PEOPLE CLOSE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) EVERYBODY LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I THINK IT IS A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE. I THINK IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE IN IOWA. I THINK DEMOCRATS IN IOWA ARE ON THE MARCH, DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DID IN 2018, FOR ALL YOUR VICTORIES IN THIS STATE AND LET'S THANK TROY PRICE FOR ALL HE'S DOING TO GET YOU READY FOR MORE VICTORIES IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE AND I ALSO HAVE TO SHARE SOMETHING PERSONAL WITH YOU. A FEW WEEKS AGO I HAD THE JOY OF CELEBRATING MY 25th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. [APPLAUSE] AND 25 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, YOU KNOW IT TAKES LOVE, IT TAKES COMMITMENT, IT TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE AND IT TAKES REALLY BEING THERE FOR THE PERSON YOU LOVE. NOW, THE PERSON I LOVE I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE TO YOU AND SHE HAS A LOT OF PATIENCE, EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES FOR THE ISSUES SHE WORKS ON IN NEW YORK AND ALL OVER AMERICA, WHICH IS MENTAL HEALTH AND SHE IS IMPATIENT TO SEE CHANGE, TO MAKE SURE FOLKS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS GET THE HELP THEY NEED IN IOWA AND ALL OVER AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE YOUR REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS HAVE SLASHED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IT'S BEEN UNFAIR TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND WE NEED CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY. MY WIFE HAS FOUGHT TO END THE STIGMA AND MAKE SURE THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL. LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU AND LET'S THANK HER, THE FIRST LADY OF NEW YORK CITY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE PARTNERS IN EVERYTHING WE DO. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN WE FIRST WERE MARRIED AND WE HAD KIDS, WE HAD TWO WONDERFUL KIDS, BUT WE STARTED TO STRUGGLE LIKE SO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES DO, BOTH OUR MOMS GOT SICK WHEN OUR KIDS WERE STILL YOUNG AND I TALKED TO IOWANS ABOUT THIS, I TALKED TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TO KEEP IT TOGETHER AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND MAKE A LIVING AND TRY TO MEET ALL THEIR OBLIGATIONS. AND IOWANS AS I'VE TALKED TO THEM I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOD AT EVERY GROUP I'M IN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT FEELING. IOWANS AND AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER, THEY'RE WORKING LONGER HOURS, A LOT OF PEOPLE TWO JOBS, A LOT OF FOLKS STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THERE'S MORE STRESS IN OUR LIVES. AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU AND IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THEM. THE WAY PEOPLE ARE LIVING TODAY IN IOWA AND IN AMERICA AND WHAT THEY NEED. NOW, THESE TOWNS, THESE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING, I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THEY HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT, BUT BROTHERS AND SISTERS THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. IT WAS A REPUBLICAN AGENDA THAT MADE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR WORKING PEOPLE TO GET THEIR FAIR SHARE. IT MADE IT EASIER AND EASIER FOR THE RICH TO GET RICHER. OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ON THE SIDE OF THE WEALTHY AND THE CORPORATIONS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND IT'S NOT NOT BEEN ON THE SIDE OF WORKING PEOPLE. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD PUT WORKING PEOPLE FIRST IN AMERICA? [APPLAUSE] IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, BUT WE SEE FROM RONALD REAGAN ALL THE WAY TO THOSE TAX CUTS THAT DONALD TRUMP DID, THE GIVEAWAY TO THE CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. WE'VE SEEN THIS COUNTRY GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WHEN I TALK TO WORKING PEOPLE AND NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS, TOO, THEY WANT CHANGE. THEY WANT US TO INVEST IN WORKING COMMUNITIES, INFRASTRUCTURE, THINGS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE. WELL, YOU KNOW, ANY TIME I TALK ABOUT IT, ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT INVESTING IN PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HEAR? THERE'S ALWAYS THOSE PUNDITS AND THOSE CRITICS WHO SAY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO INVEST IN PEOPLE. WELL, HERE'S WHAT I SAY TO THEM EVERY TIME. THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THIS WORLD AND THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S JUST IN THE WRONG HANDS! [APPLAUSE] AND WE NEED TO PUT MONEY BACK IN THE HANDS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT IN NEW YORK. I RUN THE BIGGEST, TOUGHEST MOST DIVERSE CITY IN THE WORLD, 8.6 MILLION HIGHLY OPINIONATED CONSTITUENTS, ALL OF THEM HAVE AN OPINION, BUT ONE THING WE AGREE ON IS PUTTING WORKING PEOPLE FIRST. AND SO WE GAVE PRE-K TO ALL OUR CHILDREN FOR FREE, A UNIVERSAL RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT IN IOWA? WE GIVE PAID SICK DAYS TO WORKING PEOPLE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A DAY'S PAY AND STAYING HEALTHY AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR FAMILIES. DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT IN IOWA AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY? WE GOT SICK OF WAITING ON WASHINGTON SO GUESS WHAT WE'RE DOING? WE ARE GUARANTEEING HEALTHCARE FOR ALL NEW YORKERS. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE IS GUARANTEED HEART ATTACK. WE'RE DOING THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE NEED TO PUT WORKING PEOPLE FIRST IN AMERICA. WE CAN DO IT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THANK YOU. (music)(music) (music)(music) THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND AS HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS SPOUSE, SOMEONE I FORGOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE EARLIER IS MY SPOUSE. AND HE WILL BE MAD AT ME FOR DOING THIS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY HUSBAND, ERIC, WHO'S HERE WITH US TONIGHT. HE PUTS UP WITH A LOT OF CRAP FOR HAVING THIS JOB SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ERIC. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SENATOR MICHAEL BENNETT WHO HAS SERVED IN THE U.S. SENATE FOR 10 YEARS WHERE HE HAS BUILT BROAD COALITIONS TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES. PREVIOUSLY HE WORKED FOR KIDS AS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN HELPING TO FAILING COMPANIES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BUILD ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS, ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE NOW AND RESTORE INTEGRITY TO OUR GOVERNMENT. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR MICHAEL BENNETT. (music)(music) (music)(music) HEY, IOWA. SIT DOWN PLEASE, I'M MICHAEL BENNETT, I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THIS RACE FOR A MONTH. MY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE WITH ME ARE QUITE SMALL TONIGHT, BUT THEY INCLUDE MY DAUGHTER CAROLINE WHO TRAVELED FROM COLORADO TO BE HERE TODAY, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT'S BEEN SUCH A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO LISTEN TO EVERYBODY TODAY AND ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN SO PATIENT AND WHAT I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY IS HOW MUCH SIMILARITY THERE IS BETWEEN WHAT WE ALL WANT FOR THIS COUNTRY, WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT WORKING PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA WANT FOR THEIR KIDS AND FOR OUR GRANDKIDS. BUT TO DO ANY OF THESE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIX THE BROKEN POLITICS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT MEANS BEATING DONALD TRUMP, BUT IT ALSO MEANS OVERCOMING THE BLOCKADE, THE STRANGLEHOLD THAT MITCH McCONNELL AND THE FREEDOM CAUCUS HAVE PERPETRATED ON THIS COUNTRY FOR THE LAST DECADE OR MORE. THEY HAVE IMMOBILIZED OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE IMMOBILIZED OUR EXERCISE IN SELF-GOVERNMENT. AND BY THE WAY, THAT BEGINS WITH THE SENATE RACE RIGHT HERE IN IOWA IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] TRUMP IS THE STAR OF HIS OWN THREE-RING CIRCUS IN WASHINGTON, BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO THE RING MASTER ACTUALLY IS. AND THAT IS MITCH McCONNELL. HE HAS DONE THIS WITH THE FREEDOM CAUCUS TO PREVENT POPULAR WILL IN THIS COUNTRY FROM BEING ADOPTED. ON CLIMATE CHANGE, ON HEALTHCARE, ON ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT TODAY, HE THOUGHT SAID NO AND SENT IT TO THE LEGISLATIVE GRAVEYARD TO DIE. ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM , AND BY THE WAY, WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT, HE SPENT $5 TRILLION ON TAX CUTS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH WENT TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AND $5.6 TRILLION ON WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE KIDS IN MY OLD SCHOOL DISTRICT, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST HAVE LIT THAT MONEY ON FIRE. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, WHO HAVE NOT HAD A PAY RAISE, THAT'S 90% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST LIGHT THAT MONEY ON FIRE. WE COULD HAVE FIXED EVERY ROAD AND BRIDGE IN AMERICA. WE COULD HAVE FIXED EVERY AIRPORT IN AMERICA. WE COULD HAVE GIVEN THE MIDDLE CLASS A REAL TAX CUT IN THIS COUNTRY AND MADE SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENT FOR MY DAUGHTER CAROLINE! AND WE DID NONE OF IT. WE DID NONE OF IT BECAUSE OF WHAT McCONNELL WAS DOING THERE. AND IT'S MY VIEW THAT TO OVERCOME THIS, WE NEED TO BUILD A BROAD BASED AGENDA FOR AMERICA THAT UNIFIES OUR COUNTRY, THAT UNIFIES DEMOCRATS, BUT ALSO BRINGS ALONG INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW THE FREEDOM CAUCUS IS NOT REPRESENTING WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR KIDS OR FOR THEIR GRANDKIDS OR FOR AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD. AND THAT'S MOST OF THE DEMOCRATS IN MY STATE, REPUBLICANS IN MY STATE AND I'LL BET THERE ARE A FEW HERE IN IOWA AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY I PROPOSED A CLIMATE PLAN THAT SAYS EVERYBODY IN AMERICA CAN HELP SOLVE THIS CRISIS THAT WE FACE, INCLUDING OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT'S WHY I HAVE PUT FORWARD A PLAN ON UNIVERSAL HEART HEALTHCARE THAT GIVES EVERY AMERICAN THE CHOICE TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S WHY I PROPOSED THE AMERICAN FAMILY ACT THAT WILL REDUCE CHILDHOOD POVERTY IN AMERICA BY 40% AND NOT A SINGLE BUREAUCRATIC TO WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR 3% OF THE PRICE OF MEDICARE FOR ALL AND BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF KIDS LIVING IN POVERTY, IT'S WHY EVERY SINGLE KID IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL AND EVERY KID IN AMERICA SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO A K-12 SCHOOL A SENATOR WOULD SEND THEIR KIDS TO. AND EVERY KID IN AMERICA WHO GETS INTO THE BEST COLLEGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRADUATE FROM THAT COLLEGE DEBT-FREE. AND THAT 70% OF AMERICAN KIDS WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO EARN MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE WE'VE GIVEN THEM THE SKILLS THEY NEED IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHICH THEY CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY ON. AND SPEAKING OF SUPPORTING FAMILIES AS THE FORMER SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, WE NEED TO PAY TEACHERS LIKE THE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY ARE! NOT A FEW PERCENT HERE OR THERE. WE HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND BRING IT INTO THE 21st CENTURY. THAT ALL MAY SOUND REALLY HARD, BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY MORE DEMOCRATIC, MORE FAIR, AND MORE FREE. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARD. SO I SAY THAT KIDS THAT COME TO SEE ME IN WALKING WHO THINK THE WASHINGTON MONUMENTAL WAS JUST THERE, THE SUPREME COURT WAS JUST THERE, NONE OF IT WAS JUST THERE. ALL OF IT WAS THE WORK OF PEOPLE AT THE BEGINNING WE CALLED THE FOUNDERS WHO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION. BUT THEN THERE WERE OTHER AMERICANS WHO CAME AFTER THEM. DOUGLAS WHO WAS BORN A SLAVE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO IN HIS LIFETIME ENDED HUMAN SLAVERY AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR WOMEN. THEY ARE OUR FOUNDERS, TOO. WE CAN DO THAT HARD WORK OURSELVES. THANK YOU, IOWA FOR LETTING ME JOIN THIS RACE. I LOOK FORWARD TO EARNING YOUR SUPPORT. (music)(music) (music)(music) OUR NEXT SPEAKER TOOK ON ONE OF THE LEAST POPULAR SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY AND BECAME A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

PLEASE WELCOME OUR FINAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DAY, CONGRESSMAN BETO O'ROURKE. (music)(music) (music)(music)SEN. O'ROURKE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. AMY AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE KINDNESS AND WARMTH WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WELCOMED US. TO SHARE THE STAGE WITH SO MANY EXTRAORDINARY CANDIDATES, TO MEET SO MANY OF THEIR FIRED UP SUPPORTERS, TO KNOW THAT SO MANY OF OUR SUPPORTERS ARE HERE AND ALL ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW, DOING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN I THIS MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR OUR COUNTRY, THE POWER AND JOY WITH WHICH WE MEET THIS MOMENT IS SOMETHING THAT I AM GRATEFUL FOR. BECAUSE WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON THE SAME GOAL FOR THIS COUNTRY. DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP IN 2020. AND BRINGING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER AGAIN IN 2021. AND TO EACH ONE OF YOU THAT I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET AT ONE OF OUR TOWN HALLS OR VISITS TO YOUR COMMUNITY, I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE LESSONS THAT YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME. TO THOSE VETERANS WHO HAVE APPEARED AT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY TOWN HALLS, WHO DISTINGUISHED THIS COUNTRY THROUGH THEIR SERVICE AND THEIR SACRIFICE, WHO ONLY ASK THAT WHEN THEY COME HOME, THEY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE CARE AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED, THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, AND ASK THAT WE NO LONGER PURSUE THIS COUNTRY'S FOREIGN POLICY GOALS ON THE BACKS OF 19, 20, AND 21-YEAR-OLD WOMEN AND MEN, THAT WE END THE WARS WE ARE IN TODAY AND BRING THOSE SERVICEMEMBERS BACK HOME. [APPLAUSE] TO THE STUDENTS, INCLUDING THE YOUNG STUDENT I MET AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL IN NEWTON, IOWA, WHO ASKED US TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN OUR POWER TO END THE BLOODSHED AND THE CARNAGE WE ARE SEEING IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT WILL CLAIM MORE THAN 40,000 LIVES THIS YEAR, BUT ONLY ASKS OF US THAT WE PASS GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND CLOSE EVERY LOOPHOLE, THAT WE STOP SELLING WEAPONS OF WAR INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND ADOPT RED FLAG LAWS TO STOP THOSE WHO POSE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. TWO THOSE FARMERS LIKE THOSE WE GOT TO VISIT WITH YESTERDAY IN LACONIA, WHO SIMPLY ASK THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A PROFIT ON THE FOOD THEY GROW THAT FEEDS NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY BUT SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND IF THEY BE PLACED IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT IN CONFRONTING THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED, CLIMATE CHANGE, BY ALLOWING THEM TO PROFIT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, COVER CROPS THAT PULL MORE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR, AND REGENERATIVE RANCHING TO MAKE SURE WE DISTURB LESS OF IT THAN IS IN THE SOIL. [APPLAUSE] TWO THOSE STEELWORKERS I MET IN THE QUAD CITY WHO ASKED THAT WE ONLY RESPECT THE WORK THEY HAVE PUT IN, THIS COUNTRY THEY HAVE HELPED TO BUILD AND ENSURE THAT THE PENSIONS THEY HAVE PAID INTO FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES ARE GUARANTEED. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN THE WOMEN WHO ARE LEADING ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES, INCLUDING PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THIS COUNTRY, GUARANTEED HIGH-QUALITY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, WHICH MEANS PRIMARY CARE AND IN A STATE THAT RANKS 51ST MENTAL HEALTH CARE, THAT MEANS MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE ISLAND AND AMERICAN. AND THAT HEALTH CARE ALSO MEAN THAT EVERY WOMAN MAKES HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY AND HAS ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT ALLOWS THAT TO BE POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] BUT IN ORDER TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, AND TO FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP AND INSPIRATION AND GUIDANCE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED HERE IN IOWA, WE MUST FIRST FIX THIS BADLY BROKEN DEMOCRACY. CONGRESS, WHICH HAS CAPTURED AND CORRUPTED BY SPECIAL INTEREST, AND CORPORATIONS, AND A DEMOCRACY AND OUR ELECTIONS THAT HAVE SHUT OUT TOO MANY. THAT IS WHY AT THE HEART OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS A BOLD SET OF DEMOCRACY REFORMS TO REPAIR OUR DEMOCRACY. FIRST, LET'S BRING TENS OF MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS THROUGH SAME-DAY AND AUTO , AN AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION. NEXT, LET'S REMOVE EVERY BARRIER IN PLACE, A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT FOR THIS COUNTRY. NO MORE PURGES OF THE VOTER ROLLS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT. [APPLAUSE] LET'S RESTORE FAITH IN DEMOCRACY BY HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO INVADED IT IN 2016 AND AFTERWARDS, SOUGHT TO COVER UP AN ABSTRACT OF THE INVESTIGATION. IF WE DO THAT, I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL MEET EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CHALLENGES. AND THAT FOREVER AFTER, THIS COUNTRY WILL BE KNOWN NOT BY OUR FEARS OR DIFFERENCES, BUT BY OUR AMBITIONS AND ASPIRATIONS WE HOLD IN COMMON IN THIS GREAT DEMOCRACY THAT CAN ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE THEM. IOWA, THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US OUT HERE TONIGHT. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE RUNNING TO SERVE YOU AS PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ALL. [APPLAUSE] OUR HOLLOW , HALL OF FAME IS FILLED WITH SOME OF THE BEST OF OUR PARTY. YOU SEE THE SHOULDERS ON WHICH OUR PARTY WAS BUILT. IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT FRED AND THE CHARLOTTE ARE IN OUR HALLWAY. IT AND CHARLOTTE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE TWO MYTHICAL FIGURES WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SOME ARE LARGER THAN LIFE. THE FIRST TIME I MET THEM, THEY ARE BOTH SO INCREDIBLY, , KIND AND GENEROUS. THEREFORE FRED RAN FOR GOVERNOR, THEY WERE KNOWN AS BEING A TREMENDOUS ADVOCATE. THEY DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES. THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR BUSINESSES. BUT THEY CARED ABOUT WAS DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT. ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY ENJOYED ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS ALWAYS FINDING OUT NEW THINGS THAT FRED AND CHARLOTTE HAD DONE. ONE DAY I WALKED INTO THEIR MANAGER'S OFFICE AND SAW THIS STUFFED PIG SITTING IN THE CORNER AND I SAID, WHAT IS THAT? IT WAS A STUFFED ANIMAL THEY SOLD AT YOUNGERS STORES TO HELP FUND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY THE FARMERS CRISIS. I HAVE SEEN THEM BE INVOLVED IN SO MANY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM. BUT OFTENTIMES, PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF IT BECAUSE THEY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES. I WAS TALKING TO CHARLOTTE'S STAFFER, AND WAS ASKING WHAT CHARLOTTE WAS UP TO. SHE SAID SHE IS OUT DOORKNOCKING. I STOPPED AND SAID REALLY? COME TO FIND OUT, CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN OUT DOORKNOCKING EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WHEN SHE WAS NOT ON THE ROAD, SHE WENT DOWN TO THE OFFICE AND PICKED UP A PACKET. I KNOW FRED DOES THAT AS WELL. THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND DO THE DIRTY WORK. THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE MOST COMFORTABLE. FRED AND CHARLOTTE HAVE BEEN LEADERS ON PROGRESSIVE ISSUES FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS IN THE STATE. THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET. I HEARD A LOT FROM PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT FRED'S CAMPAIGN AND THE WORK THAT FRED AND CHARLOTTE WERE DOING, IT MEANT TO THEM THAT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS FIGHTING FOR THEM. FIGHTING FOR ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH, FOR WOMEN, FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE A VOICE. ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, FRED AND CHARLOTTE HAVE STOOD FIRM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE PASSIONATELY IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM ON THE GROUND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT IS GREAT TO SEE THE TWO OF THEM WORKING TOGETHER OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN TO REALLY TRY AND TURN OUR STATE AROUND. THE LEGACY OF FRED AND CHARLOTTE IS NOT GOING TO BE JUST THE BUILDING THAT BEARS THEIR NAME. IT IS GOING TO BE IN THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WHOSE LIVES ARE BETTER BECAUSE OF THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE. I WOULD SAY TO THEM SIMPLY, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE DONE. EVERYTHING THEY CONTINUE TO DO. THEY HAVE HELPED GROW THIS PARTY AND MAKE THIS PARTY WHAT IT IS TODAY. AND THAT IS WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHO THEY RP THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM SUCH TREMENDOUS ADVOCATES AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE WORTH TO SUPPORT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, FRIED WAS HIT BY A CAR EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND HIS RECOVERY HAS GONE WELL. BUT HE HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER SURGERY ON FRIDAY. TO MAKE SURE HIS PROGRESS CONTINUES MOVING FORWARD. KEY AND CHARLOTTE , HE IS WHO PARADING IN DES MOINES, CHARLOTTE IS TAKING CARE OF THEM. THEY PASSED ALONG THIS VIDEO MESSAGE THAT THEY WANTED TO SHARE TODAY. HELLO, EVERYONE. NO, THIS IS NOT A COMMERCIAL. WE ARE DOING THIS VIDEO BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, WE CANNOT BE WITH YOU FOR THE HALL OF FAME EVENT. WE WERE IN ARIZONA IN FEBRUARY AND I WAS RIDING MY BIKE WHEN I WAS HIT BY A CAR. I HAVE BEEN RECOVERING SINCE, A LONG SLOW PROCESS, BUT IT IS GOING WELL. I HAVE TO HAVE ONE MORE SURGERY WHICH WILL BE THIS WEEK. THREE DAYS BEFORE THE HALL OF FAME EVENT. IT CHARLOTTE AND I CANNOT JOIN YOU BUT WE WANTED TO DO THIS VIDEO SO WE CAN SAY THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE AND THANKS TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR THIS HONOR. WE WILL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU VERY MUCH ALL DAY ON SUNDAY. THANK YOU TO THE 19 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS WHO HAVE MADE THE TRIP TO IOWA. WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. BUT JUST KNOW THAT WE AS DEMOCRATS IN IOWA IN 2018, WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS. WE DID NOT WIN EVERY RACE WE WANTED TO WIN BUT WE MADE GOOD PROGRESS ON THE HOUSE, WE ELECTED TO BE REPRESENTATIVES FOR US, AND WE ELECTED OTHER DEMOCRATS ACROSS IOWA. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IN 2020 WE BUILD ON THAT MOMENTUM AND MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ELECT THREE WOMEN, AND OUR TWO INCUMBENTS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. WE CAN WIN THE U.S. SENATE ELECTION. AND WE CAN TAKE BACK THE MAJORITY OF THE IOWA HOUSE. AND MAKE PROGRESS IN THE SENATE. STOP THIS REPUBLICAN TRIFECTA AND THEIR EXTREME AGENDA WHICH IS HARMING OUR STATE IN ALL AREAS OF LIFE WHETHER IT IS HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION OR THE ACADEMY. WE CAN CHANGE THIS IF WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER. IF WE DO THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL, WE WILL HELP ELECT A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ON SECOND, WE ARE SORRY WE CAN'T JOIN YOU. WE KNOW IT WILL BE A GREAT EVENT. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR PUTTING ON THE EVENT AND RECOGNIZING FOLKS LIKE US FOR OUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STAYS STRONG AND SUCCESSFUL IN IOWA. WELL, WHEN WE ANNOUNCED HOW MANY SPEAKERS WE HAD COMING TO THIS DINNER, FOLKS STARTED ASKING ME , THE ONLY QUESTION I GOT LAST WEEK WAS WHEN WILL YOU BE DONE? WHEN WILL YOU BE DONE? I SAID WE WILL BE DONE BETWEEN 5:38 AND 545 TIME. I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE IT IS 5:11 P.M. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WHO JOINED US TODAY. IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE SO MANY FOLKS HERE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK AGAIN ALL OF THE AWARD WINNERS AND CONGRATULATE THEM AND I WANT TO THANK AGAIN ALL OF YOU. FOR ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING AND FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE TO HELP MAKE THIS PARTY ONE OF THE BEST PARTIES IN THE COUNTRY. SO, I HOPE EVERYONE IS SAFE GOING HOPE , HOME, I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD REST OF YOUR SUNDAY, YOU STILL HAVE SEVERAL HOURS LEFT WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN MOST DEMOCRATIC PARTY DINNERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ALL ON THE TRAIL OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE GOING TO DO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU NOVEMBER 1 FOR THE FALL DINNER. THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

RECENTLY HELD A TOWN HALL MEETING IN DEROIN, IOWA , DES MOINES, IOWA. JUST OVER AN HOUR. [CROWD CHANTING] THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. PLEASE, CAN WE GIVE IT UP FOR ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS OF IOWA AND AMERICA. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. AND YOU DESERVE A VOICE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. SIME HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. CONFLUENCE BREWERY, THANKS FOR TAKING US IN. THAT'S THE LAST MINUTE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE AND YOU JUST , YOU SHIFTED THE PLAN AND YOU CAME HERE. I CAN'T THANK CONFLUENCE BREWERY AND ALL OF YOU ON A RAINY AFTERNOON FOR BEING HERE. I'M VERY, VERY TOUCHED. THANK YOU. I'M KAMALA HARRIS, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF MY THOUGHTS AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING QUESTIONS. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY BEFORE, I FULLY INTEND TO WIN THIS ELECTION. I REALLY DO. PART OF THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I AND WE LISTEN AS MUCH AS I TALK, ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, SO I AM HERE TO LISTEN AS MUCH AS I AM TO TALK BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. FIRST OF ALL, CAN WE GET A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR NARAL. YAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE WE ARE. SO I THANK YOU FOR COHOSTING THIS MEET AND GREET AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERS OF NARAL, MOST OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE WORK THEY DO AND YOU DO EVERY DAY. WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING, WHO ARE WE? WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES UPON WHICH WE BASE THAT PERSPECTIVE IS THAT RIGHT NOW, AND IT IS NOT A NEW MOMENT IN AMERICA, BUT IT IS A HIGHLIGHTED MOMENT. WOMEN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS UNDER ATTACK IN AMERICA. AND WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN ALABAMA, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN GEORGIA AND MISSOURI. WE ARE NOT BEING ALARMISTS WHEN WE SAY WOMEN WILL DIE. AND IN PARTICULAR, POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THOSE WHO CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE, WHICH IS IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED TO TELL WOMEN WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES. THEY CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED THEY KNOW BETTER ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS THAN HER OWN PHYSICIAN, AND WE ARE AT A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WOMEN ARE GOING TO NEED OUR SUPPORT AND OUR HELP AND THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RIGHT OF COURSE, TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVES, AND SO MANY OF THEM WILL NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE STATE IN WHICH THEY LIVE. NARAL, YOU'RE DOING THAT WORK OF SUPPORTING THESE WOMEN AND HELPING THEM IN THOSE PLACES AND BEING LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN IS UNDER ATTACK. MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW, MY SISTER AND I , SHE IS HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE SHE IS. BUT YOU KNOW, I GREW UP, WE GREW UP HEARING ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. OUR MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE WAS A SCIENTIST. MY EARLIEST MEMORIES, SHE WOULD COME HOME ENRAGED OFTEN ABOUT THE LACK OF DIGNITY THAT WOMEN WERE GIVEN IN THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, IN THE CONTEXT OF TAKING WOMEN SERIOUSLY AND AT THEIR WORD WHEN THEY INDICATE OR EXPRESS WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. SO THIS ISSUE IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR TO ME. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT NOT ONLY REPRESENTS WHAT IS RIGHT IN TERMS OF GIVING A WOMAN HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND TO EXERCISING FREE WILL AND EXERCISING AGENCY, IT IS NOT ONLY AN ISSUE THAT IS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN AND THAT WOMEN MAY ACTUALLY DIE. IT IS ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING EQUALITY, FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF EQUALITY. MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED THAT QUESTION, IS THERE ANY LAW THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT TELLS A MAN WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BODY AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE GOING TO ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING PLACES WITH THAT, RIGHT? NO, IT IS ABOUT EQUALITY. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF EQUALITY. SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ON THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY, PART OF WHAT I AM PREPARED TO DO IS NOT ONLY CONTINUE ENJOYING WITH ALL OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS FIGHT FOR FULL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR WOMEN, BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU AFTER ELECTED, I AM PREPARED TO REQUIRE THAT AS IT RELATES TO ANY STATE THAT HAS A HISTORY OF RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, THAT THAT STATE HAS TO CLEAR THAT LAW, TO CLEAR IT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, TO CLEAR THAT IT COMPORTS WITH ROE V. WADE THROUGH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT IS CALLED PRECLEARANCE. AND UNTIL THAT LAW CLEARS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, IT CANNOT GO INTO EFFECT. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE CLEARLY, WE NEED SOME OVERSIGHT, CONSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT, SO WE WILL PLAY ON THE DEFENSE, BUT LET'S ALSO TAKE IT ON THE OFFENSE. [APPLAUSE] THIS ISSUE IS ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES THAT FOR ME, IT RELATES TO THE ISSUES PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE TIME OF MY BIRTH. OUR PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WE JOKE THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, FOR JUSTICE, FOR EQUALITY, IS A FIGHT THAT MUST BE FOUGHT AND WON WITH EACH GENERATION. RIGHT? I THINK THERE WERE TWO POINTS THERE. ONE, THAT IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, THAT WHATEVER GAINS WE MAKE, THEY WILL NOT BE PERMANENT. IT IS THE NATURE OF IT. THE SECOND PART OF IT IS, , POINT THEN IS, KNOWING IT IS THE NATURE OF IT, DO NOT DESPAIR. DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED, LET'S NOT THROW UP OUR HANDS WHEN IT'S TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, RIGHT? SO ON THIS FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE GET TO WORK AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE DEFENSE AND THE OFFENSE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES RIGHT NOW AT PLAY AS WELL. I WILL TELL YOU, THAT SAME MOTHER OF OURS, SHE WAS FIVE FEET TALL, BUT YOU COULD SAY SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL. SHE WAS FIERCE. SHE WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A HAND ON HER HIP AND WITH A VERY STRAIGHT FACE ASKED, \"WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?\" SO, I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT PLAY RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, CURRENTLY. OK? HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT HE HAS ACTUALLY BETRAYED AMERICA. HE RAN ON A PLATFORM THAT SAID I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF Y'ALL. I DON'T NEED TO TELL IOWA THAT THIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY , TRADE BY TWEET , HAS RESULTED IN IOWA FARMERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, THOSE WHO HAD CULTIVATED A MARKET OVER AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE IN CHINA TO SELL SOYBEANS, NOW SITTING ROTTING IN BINS. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW HE BETRAYED PEOPLE WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT AS MANY AS 700,000 AUTOWORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY LOSE THEIR JOB BY THE INDUSTRY YEAR. , BY THE END OF THE YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WITH THE SO-CALLED TRUMP TRADE POLICY, WHICH I CALL THE TRUMP TRADE TAX, AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE SPENDING 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS A MONTH MORE FOR EVERYTHING FROM SHAMPOOS TO WASHING MACHINES. IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HE WANTS TO TAKE AMERICA BACKWARD, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. [APPLAUSE] AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I'M HERE TO TEACH YOU ABOUT PART OF MY BACKGROUND , I HAVE A BACKGROUND WHERE SUCCESSFULLY, I HAVE PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS WHO PREYED ON HOMEOWNERS, PROSECUTED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO PREYED ON SENIORS, PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PREYED ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND THE THING ABOUT THIS PERSON, IS HE'S GOT PREDATORY INSTINCTS AND A PREDATORY NATURE. BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET ABOUT PREDATORS. THEY PREY ON THE VULNERABLE. THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY ASSUME ARE WEAK. THEY PREY ON THOSE THEY ASSUME ARE DESPERATE. THE THING ABOUT PREDATORS IS THIS , THEY ARE COWARDS. WHAT WE NEED AND WANT IN OUR AMERICA IS A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO RECOGNIZES THAT HER STRENGTH DERIVES FROM AN ABILITY NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN, BUT LIFT PEOPLE UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LIFT THEM UP. LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET ON THIS CASE. LET'S LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET, SHALL WE? SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT PROMISED WORKING PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD BE HELPED, BUT THEN HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF YET AGAIN CONTINUOUS ATTEMPTS TO TAKE HEALTH CARE FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES, INCLUDING REVIVING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AS A BAN ON GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN IN CAGES AND THEY ARE SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF ORDER SECURITY, WHEN IN FACT THAT IS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE THIS CASE, BUT LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT IS BEFORE US IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE, IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND FIGHTING FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. TOMORROW, WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR NATION'S INDEPENDENCE. TOMORROW, WE WILL REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO DERIVES ITS GREATEST STRENGTH FROM THE FACT THAT BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THOSE WORDS WE , THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY , WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR-EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE FIGHT TO GET THERE, AND SO, FIGHT WE WILL AND FIGHT WE MUST, AND LET US BE CLEAR , THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF SEEING AND KNOWING WHAT CAN BE, AND BELIEVING IN THAT, UNBURNED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN NOT ONLY OF KNOWING WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE YOUR , LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A FIGHT, THEREFORE, FOR OUR AMERICA AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY WILL PAY THEIR BILLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN ARE PAID THE SAME AS MEN. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE NO CHILD HAS TO ATTEND A HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN HIDE IN A CLOSET BECAUSE OF A GUNMAN ROAMING THE HALLS OF THEIR SCHOOLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE IS GIVEN DIGNITY AND IS TREATED WITH EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT, AND AS WE MARCH TOWARD THE SELECTION IN , THIS ELECTION IN 2020, WITH AND BORN OUT OF AN ULTIMATE AND FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT WE ALL RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND THAT THE POWER IS IN THE PEOPLE, WITH ALL THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR SOULS, I PROMISE YOU, DES MOINES, WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. MY NAME IS KATIE, AND I AM AN UNDECIDED IOWA DEMOCRAT. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE IN THE DEBATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT WAS AWESOME. AND ALSO, BECAUSE I'M JUST VERY HAPPY TO BE IN A ROOM WITH SO MANY PRO-CHOICE IOWANS. WE REALLY DO NOT GET TOGETHER ENOUGH. ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, I FOUND MYSELF FACING AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY. I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT, AND TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, I HAD NEVER THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD NEED THEM, BUT I DO DISTINCTLY REMEMBER THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT. I HAD TWO IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS BEFORE THE DENIAL AND GRIEF AND ALL THOSE THOUGHTS THAT COME LATER. I REMEMBER THINKING, I NEED TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND, \"OH, I LIVE IN IOWA.\" I KNEW ABORTION WAS A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT, BUT UP UNTIL THAT POINT, I NEVER CONSIDERED HOW THE CONTROVERSY WHAT IMPACT THE TRAJECTORY OF MY LIFE. I REMEMBER GOOGLE SEARCHING IF ABORTION IS LEGAL IN IOWA AND HOW TO GET AN ABORTION IN IOWA, AND I REMEMBER SEEING PAGES OF RESULTS ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS IOWA REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO RESTRICT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. FORTUNATELY, I WAS LUCKY AND I WAS ABLE TO GET ABORTION CARE IN MY HOME STATE WITHOUT HAVING TO JUMP THROUGH TOO MANY LEGAL HOOPS, BUT THAT FEELING, THAT FEAR OF \"I KNOW WHAT I NEED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BE ABLE TO LEGALLY ACCESS IT,\" HAS STAYED WITH ME. IT HAS BEEN 10 YEARS SINCE MY ABORTION, AND IF I'M TOTALLY HONEST, MY FEELINGS HAVE FLUCTUATED. SOMETIMES I'M 100% CONFIDENT I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION, AND SOMETIMES I'M NOT THAT SURE. SOMETIMES, I THINK ABOUT IT AND I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT I WAS ABLE TO CHOOSE MY OWN PATH, AND SOMETIMES I REALLY AM SAD ABOUT THE PATH I DID NOT CHOOSE, BUT THE ONE THING IN WHICH I'M CONFIDENT IS I AM INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR MYSELF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE OTHER THING THAT HAS BEEN CONSTANT IS THAT REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THAT POWER AWAY. THAT IS WHY, FOR ME, IT IS ESSENTIAL THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS NOT JUST PRO-CHOICE, BUT IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE A NATIONAL LEADER FOR THE CAUSE OF REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. AS YOU SAID, I HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND QUITE AS LONG, BUT I'M VERY TIRED OF THIS FIGHT, AND I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NOT JUST DEFEND THE STATUS QUO, BUT WILL DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS HAVE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. MY QUESTION , THIS IS A CROWDED FIELD WHERE WE KNOW DEFENDING ABORTION ACCESS IS THE FLOOR, NOT THE CEILING, FOR CANDIDATES. WE KNOW EACH CANDIDATE HAS PROMISED TO VETO DANGEROUS ANTI-CHOICE LEGISLATION, BUT WITH ROE V. WADE UNDER DIRE AND IMMEDIATE THREAT, WE NEED MORE THAN THAT. MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR PROACTIVELY SAFEGUARDING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND LOCKING IN THESE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND WHAT WOULD A HARRIS ADMINISTRATION DO THAT OTHERS MIGHT NOT TO PROTECT REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE? THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST, I AM IN AWE OF YOUR COURAGE. REALLY, TO SPEAK IN THIS VENUE WITH ALL WHO ARE HERE AND WITH SUCH GRACE, TO TELL YOUR STORY THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL STORY, AND IT IS A STORY THAT MANY WOMEN IN AMERICA CAN TELL, BUT YOU HAVE A SPECIAL ABILITY TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE TO SPEAK IT IN A ROOM LIKE THIS AND THOSE TRUTHS NEED TO BE HEARD BY EVERYONE, SO I FIRST JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WHAT I'M OFFERING IS SOMETHING NO ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT OR OFFERED BEFORE, A NEW APPROACH, AND MAYBE IT COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IN MY BACKGROUND, I WAS FOR TWO TERMS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. I RAN THE SECOND LARGEST DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES SECOND ONLY TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU IN TERMS OF MY BACKGROUND, I SHARE WITH YOU THAT MY PARENTS WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WHAT INSPIRED ME TO WANT TO BECOME A LAWYER WAS ACTUALLY THOSE LAWYERS WHO WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THURGOOD MARSHALL AND CHARLES HAMILTON HOUSTON. IT WAS THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SKILL AND POWER WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LAW TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION OF THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DESERVE FULL EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW RECEIVE IT. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER, TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. AND SO, IT IS THROUGH THAT LENS I ACTUALLY DO THINK OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING THIS ISSUE. WHICH IS, LET'S CONTINUE WITH OUR ACTIVISM AND CONTINUE TO TAKE IT TO THE STREETS. LET'S ALSO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AROUND LITIGATION AGAINST THESE BAD LAWS, BUT ALSO FROM A PROACTIVE POSITION, THINK ABOUT HOW THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF JUSTICE AND IN THAT WAY, THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS WHY I'M SAYING IN A HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL HAVE PRE-CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY STATE THAT INFRINGES ON A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IF THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF DOING THAT. THAT IS A NEW AND DIFFERENT APPROACH. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT FOR ME, THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE WORKING ON THIS. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WOMEN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR A LONG TIME, THROUGHOUT MY YEARS AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN THERE WERE LAWS THAT WERE BEING PASSED AND LEGISLATION THAT WAS BEING PASSED THAT IN ANY WAY WOULD RESTRICT A WOMAN'S ACCESS INCLUDING ISSUES LIKE PARENTAL CONSENT, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER BEING AN ADVOCATE ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT INFRINGE UPON A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS. THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE FOR ME. IT IS SOMETHING I WILL ALWAYS WORK ON, AND AGAIN, IT GOES BACK TO WHAT I SHARED AT THE BEGINNING. I WAS BORN AND GREW UP IN A FAMILY, IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES WERE , MY MOTHER HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. ONE WAS TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS. THE OTHER GOAL WAS TO END BREAST CANCER. AND SHE WAS A GOOD COOK, BUT THERE WAS NOT MUCH ELSE HAPPENING IN OUR HOUSEHOLD. SO IT IS REALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO ME. TO THE EARLIER POINT ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS, EQUALITY, HEALTH, WELL-BEING, LET'S TALK ABOUT PROPERTY. ONE OF THE OTHER INITIATIVES THAT I'M OFFERING THAT IS NEW IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS AROUND EQUAL PAY. OK? LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. IF I CAN, I WILL OFFER THE SEGUE INTO THAT BY SAYING THAT IT IS REALLY WELL-ESTABLISHED THAT IN PLACES AND COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A RESTRICTION ON A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, IT IS COEXISTENT WITHOUT , WITH THAT WOMEN DO NOT HAVE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THESE ARE INTERRELATED IN A VERY DIRECT WAY, SO I THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ALL ASSOCIATED ISSUES, RIGHT? AND SO, MOVING OVER TO THE EQUAL PAY ISSUE, DO YOU KNOW AS SO MANY DO HERE , THE EQUAL PAY ACT. ANYBODY KNOW WHEN THAT WAS PASSED? 1963. SINCE 1963, WE ACKNOWLEDGED , IT GOT PASSED, RIGHT? WE ACKNOWLEDGED WOMEN ARE NOT BEING PAID EQUAL TO MEN FOR EQUAL WORK. IN 1963. FAST FORWARD TO THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019, WOMEN ARE PAID $.80 ON THE DOLLAR. BLACK WOMEN, $.61. LATINAS, $.53. RIGHT? KIND OF DONE, RIGHT? THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY IN TERMS OF IS IT REAL OR IS IT A FACT? THAT IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? HERE IS WHAT I AM PROPOSING. LET'S GO ON THE OFFENSIVE IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE DEFENSIVE. HERE'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING. ALSO BACK TO THE POINT OF YOUR STORY. THE WAY WE SHOULD ALWAYS THINK ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY, I BELIEVE, IS HOW DOES IT IMPACT A REAL PERSON? YOU CAN HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL DISCUSSION AND ALL THESE FANCY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT, BUT HOW DOES IT REALLY IMPACT A REAL PERSON? EQUAL PAY, HERE'S HOW IT REALLY WORKS. LET'S SAY SUE IS WORKING NEXT TO JOHN, AND THEIR CUBICLES ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. MAYBE ONE DAY, THEY ARE HANGING OUT AT THE WATER COOLER AND JOHN IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE GOT HIS KIDS FOR THE HOLIDAYS, AND SUE IS TALKING ABOUT HER KIDS DID NOT GET THAT STUFF AND SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW TO THE PARKING LOT AND SEES JOHN IS DRIVING A NEW CAR AND HER CAR IS 10 YEARS OLD, SO SHE THINKS SHE'S GOING TO GO TO THE SUPERVISOR TO FIND OUT IT IS GOING ON HERE. I HAVE A HUNCH. ASKING THE SUPERVISOR, ARE WE MAKING THE SAME AMOUNT? THE SUPERVISOR WILL PROBABLY SAY THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT SALARIES. MAYBE SHE GOES TO THE EEOC, THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OFFICE. \"I HAVE A HUNCH HERE.\" \"CAN YOU PROVE IT? WHAT YOU GOT?\" PUTTING THE ONUS ON HER. TO PROVE THE SITUATION. AND MAYBE, SHE MIGHT EVEN TAKE IT SO FAR THAT SHE WANTS TO TAKE IT TO LITIGATION. THAT HAS TO COME OUT OF HER OWN POCKET FOR HER LAWYER. THIS WORKING WOMAN HAS TO PROVE THE BURDEN IS ON HER TO PROVE SHE IS NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. KIND OF DONE WITH THAT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AND WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO. SHIFT THE BURDEN TO THE CORPORATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THERE'S MORE. BUT THERE'S MORE. REQUIRING THEM TO POST ON THEIR WEBSITE , ARE THEY PAYING WOMEN EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK? YOU KNOW HOW RESTAURANTS GET RATINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT? IT'S GOT TO BE ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND , BECAUSE THERE IS MORE , UNTIL THEY REACH EQUITY, WHAT WILL ALSO HAPPEN TO GIVE POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT AND TO CREATE SOME KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY, FOR EVERY 1% DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT THEY ARE PAYING MEN AND WOMEN FOR EQUAL WORK, THERE WILL BE A FINE OF 1% OF THEIR PREVIOUS YEAR'S PROFIT. THAT WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION. THAT WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION. AGAIN, THE WAY UNDER A HARRIS ADMINISTRATION THAT I THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES IS THAT IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG. TO THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION, WHAT WILL BE THE NEW APPROACH, IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING THAT HAS WORKED, LET'S ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW WE LEVERAGE THE POWER WE HAVE IN A WAY THAT IS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL, NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT, BUT ACTUALLY GET THERE, SO THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AMAZING, AND A PLAN FOR ALL OF IT, WHICH IS GREAT. OK. WE HAVE TIME FOR MORE QUESTIONS. I SEE SOME SAVE THE CHILDREN PEOPLE HERE. WHO IS GOING TO REPRESENT? I'LL REPRESENT. I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR SAVE THE CHILDREN ACTION NETWORK. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US ON THIS BEAUTIFUL RAINY DAY. WE HAVE THREE MAIN CONCERNS. ONE OF THOSE IS THAT THERE IS INADEQUATE ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR KIDS. 40% OF KIDS IN THIS NATION DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILD CARE, AND THAT TRANSITION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS IS A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COUNTRY. SECONDLY, 20% OF THE KIDS AROUND THE WORLD LIVE IN CONFLICT ZONES AND WE ARE HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS DOING CURRENTLY AND CAN DO TO LOOK OUT FOR THE NEEDS OF KIDS WORLDWIDE. AND CERTAINLY, OUR CURRENT REALITY IN THE U.S.-MEXICAN BORDER, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE KIDS BEING HELD IN THE CONDITIONS THEY ARE FOR LONGER THAN IS LEGALLY APPROPRIATE, SO WE ARE WONDERING WHAT YOU WOULD DO AS SENATOR CURRENTLY AND THEN AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT TO INVEST IN KIDS, TO LOOK OUT FOR THE NEEDS OF KIDS AND YOUNG FAMILIES. PERIOD. OFTEN, THROUGH MY CAREER , I KNOW JEAN MENTIONED THIS IN THE INTRODUCTION , I WAS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR TWO TERMS INTO FRANCISCO , IN SAN FRANCISCO, THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR TWO TERMS AND OBVIOUSLY NOW ON THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I HAVE ALWAYS WHEN TALKING WITH MY TEAM ABOUT POLICY INITIATIVES ARE SOMETHING WE ARE TO DO, I HAVE ALWAYS SAID OK, SIT BACK , AND IT COULD BE ANY SUBJECT , AND I HAVE SAID TELL ME HOW THIS WILL GO , TELL ME HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT A CHILD. IT IS AN INTERESTING ANALYSIS WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT ANY ISSUE. IT COULD BE THE FUTURE OF WORK, IT COULD BE CLIMATE CRISIS. NAME AN ISSUE THAT SEEMINGLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CHILDREN, AND IF YOU ASK HOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT ISSUE WILL IMPACT A CHILD, IT WILL TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW IT WILL ACTUALLY PLAY OUT, AND IF IT IS GOOD OR RELEVANT ENOUGH, SO I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE WORK YOU DO. UNDER A HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU CAN LOOK AT MY TRACK RECORD. WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I CREATED WHAT I THINK IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHAT I NAMED THE BUREAU OF CHILDREN'S JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] THE REASON IS IN A STATE OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE, I WAS LOOKING AROUND AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF WHO AND WHERE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRACKING AND PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW CHILDREN ARE DOING. THE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS DRIVEN ME BANANAS IS THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT BASICALLY TREATS CHILDREN'S ISSUES AS SMALL ISSUES. WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL PEOPLE? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHAT WE KNOW, THINKING PEOPLE KNOW, IS THAT WHEN YOU IMPACT THE WORLD OF A CHILD, YOU IMPACT THE WORLD. I'M NOT GOING TO GO ON AND ON, BUT I CAN POINT TO A LOT IN MY BACKGROUND TO TELL YOU THIS IS ONE OF MY GREATEST PRIORITIES, AND IT IS THROUGH THAT LENS THAT I THINK OF THE WORLD AND A MOST , AND ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO. I CAN GO THROUGH HOW I THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM THE VIOLENCE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT SMART GUN SAFETY LAWS TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AROUND THE CLIMATE CRISIS, ALL THROUGH THE LENS OF A CHILD. WE CAN TALK ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, MY PROPOSAL ON TEACHER PAY. MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, MRS. FRANCES WILSON, GOD REST HER SOUL, ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. HERE'S THE THING , MANY OF US HAVE A SIMILAR STORY. MANY OF US DO. SOME TEACHER ALONG THE WAY WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. WE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SPECIAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY TOLD US WE WERE AND WE BELIEVED THEM, AND IT PUT US ON A PATH TO BEING HIT , HERE TOGETHER TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONE OF MY PLANS FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX AMERICA IS WE NEED TO PAY TEACHERS THEIR VALUE, KNOWING THAT , AND KNOWING THAT THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN, PARENTS OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS OR AUNTS AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. TEACHERS ARE PAID LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS, YET 94 PERCENT OF TEACHERS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS COME OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. PART OF WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO THIS TO PUT IN PLACE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN IOWA, THE GAP IS ABOUT $12,200 A YEAR, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. $12,200 A YEAR , THAT IS IN , A YEAR'S WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. $12,200 A YEAR , THAT IS A YEAR'S WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. THAT IS PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DEBT , PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BARRIERS TO OUR KIDS COMING OUT OF COLLEGE AND ENTERING A PROFESSION IN WHICH THEY HAVE A PASSION. SO THIS IS ONE OF MY PROPOSALS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ALSO. THE THREE POINTS. THE CHILDREN AT THE BORDER. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A DEBATE IN , HAD A DEBATE IN MIAMI ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK AND THE NEXT DAY, I WENT TO HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA. AND IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA, THERE IS A FOR-PROFIT FACILITY THAT CURRENTLY HOUSES 2,700 CHILDREN. SO WE GET THERE, AND THEY WOULD NOT GIVE US ACCESS. I AM A MEMBER OF THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE. IT IS A FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTION. THESE FOR-PROFIT WILL NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN, BY THE WAY. ALL OF THEM. [APPLAUSE] ALL THESE DETENTION FACILITIES. THE PRIVATE PRISONS, PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES, THEY ALL NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN. THEY ALL NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHY. HERE IS WHY. HERE IS WHY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS MODEL ON THESE PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES. THE BUSINESS MODEL IS FOR CERTAIN HUMAN BEINGS TO PROFIT OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. TO PROFIT. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAW. THEY WOULD NOT LET US IN. SO WE GOT A LADDER AND CLIMBED UP AND LOOKED OVER THE FENCE. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAW. THERE WERE TWO LINES OF KIDS, GIRLS AND BOYS. THEY WERE LINED UP IN SINGLE FILE. WALKING INTO BARRACKS. THEY WERE TREATING THESE CHILDREN LIKE PRISONERS, AS THOUGH THEY COMMITTED A CRIME. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DOING THIS. IMMEDIATELY ON DAY ONE, WHEN ELECTED. I WOULD END IT. [APPLAUSE] AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE THING TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I SAW. I ALSO MET WITH PARENTS. TO BE CLEAR, SOME OF THEM ARRIVED AS UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY OF THEM WITH PARENTS ON THE OTHERS OF , ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE I DESCRIBED. THESE KIDS, SOME OF THEM ARE BEING HELD FOR 40 DAYS. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? THEIR PARENTS ARE THERE, YEARNING TO BE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. BACK TO MY EARLIER POINT, THEY NEED TO BE PROSECUTED AND A CASE I BELIEVE WILL APPEAL TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE VALUES OF WHO WE ARE, AND IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR BEST SELF. WE CAN DO BETTER. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. IT IS HOT AS BLAZES IN HERE. IOWA. IOWA. IT'S WARM. I THINK THEY TOLD ME WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION. THE YOUNG LADY RIGHT BACK THERE WITH THE SUNGLASSES AND A BEAUTIFUL STRIPED DRESS. YES. HOW ABOUT YOU? LET'S REACH WAY BACK THERE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS, BUT THEY ARE REALLY SHORT. FIRST, I AM A BIG FAN AND I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR YOU WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS. WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA. HOW CAN WE TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR RECORD WHEN WE HEAR NEGATIVE THINGS? WHAT SHOULD WE BE SAYING? AND SECOND, I AM SORT OF THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR SCHOOL BOARD. ANY ADVICE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] KAMALA HARRIS: I HAVE PLENTY OF ADVICE. [LAUGHTER] FRANKLY, THERE WERE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PUT MY EXPERIENCE AS A PROSECUTOR AND MAKE IT A NEGATIVE. WHAT I WILL TELL YOU, AS A PROSECUTOR, I AM VERY PROUD OF MY RECORD. FIRST OF ALL, AS I SHARED WITH YOU ABOUT MY BACKGROUND, I GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY IN A FAMILY , AND IN A FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE I WAS ACUTELY AWARE SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN ABOUT THE FLAWS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I MADE A VERY CONSCIOUS DECISION, THEREFORE, TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR, BELIEVING THAT WHEN WE WANT TO REFORM SYSTEMS, THERE IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO BE PLAYED ON THE OUTSIDE IN TERMS OF ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM, BUT WHY NOT BE ON THE INSIDE WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE AND YOU CAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A VOICE, A POTENTIALLY VERY POWERFUL VOICE? , AND POTENTIALLY A VERY POWERFUL VOICE? THAT IS WHY I MADE THE DECISION. AND SO, I AM PROUD OF MY RECORD THAT I AM ONE OF THE FIRST ELECTED PROSECUTORS IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE STARTED A RE-ENTRY INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON FIRST-TIME DRUG SALES OFFENDERS AND GIVING THEM JOBS, COUNSELING, AND SUPPORT. MY PROGRAM INITIATIVE ENDED UP BEING DESIGNATED AS A MODEL FOR INNOVATION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK I DID AS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REQUIRED MY SPECIAL AGENTS TO WEAR BODY CAMERAS AND KEEP THEM ON. I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST STATE AGENCY TO DO THAT. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE, EVEN IN MY ROLE IN THE U.S. SENATE AS BEING A LEADER ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REFORM THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IN AMERICA, WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY IN AMERICA, THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING IN JAIL, WAITING FOR TRIAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR BAIL. THAT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM MATTER, AND ALSO ECONOMIC JUSTICE. I WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THE DETAILS ON THAT, BUT I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR RECORD, AND I AM NEVER GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM THE REALITY THAT I ALSO STRONGLY BELIEVE, IF A WOMAN IS RAPED, IF A CHILD IS MOLESTED, IF SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE ELSE, THERE NEED TO BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, AND I WILL NOT SHY AWAY FROM THAT WERE , OR APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THE QUESTION SO WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND AIR OUT THESE ISSUES. RUNNING FOR OFFICE. LET ME TELL YOU. FIRST OF ALL, DON'T YOU EVER LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THAT YOU CANNOT WIN AND IT CANNOT BE DONE. OK? DO NOT HEAR THAT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I EAT \"NO\" FOR BREAKFAST. OK? THIS WILL BE YOUR FIRST OFFICE? MY FIRST OFFICE I RAN FOR WAS DA. THE INCUMBENT CAME FROM AN OLD POLITICAL FAMILY. TWO TERMS. HIS NECK NAME IS KO, BECAUSE HE WAS KNOWN , NICKNAME IS KO, BECAUSE HE WAS KNOWN FOR KNOCKING PEOPLE A. EVERYONE SAID IT IS NOT YOUR TIME, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT, IT WILL BE UGLY. I DID NOT LISTEN. WE GOT IN THE RACE AND MY FIRST NUMBERS CAME BACK AND I STARTED OUT AT A VERY HEALTHY SIX POINTS IN THE POLL. SIX AND 100. BUT I KNEW IF WE COULD GET TO 12, WE COULD WIN. LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE CAMPAIGNED. I CAMPAIGNED WITH MY IRONING BOARD , IF WE COULD GET TO 12, WE COULD WIN. I CAMPAIGNED WITH MY IRONING BOARD. I WRAPPED IT WITH DUCT TAPE AND I HAD POSTERS AND I WOULD TAKE IT AND GET IN MY CAR AND DRIVE TO THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. I WOULD POLL OUT MY IRONING BOARD, LITERATURE, DUCT TAPE, AND POSTERS. I WALKED TO THE FRONT OF THE GROCERY STORE AND WOULD OPEN UP MY IRONING BOARD. AND IRONING BOARD MAKES A GREAT STANDING DESK. RIGHT? THEN WITH THE DUCT TAPE I WOULD TAKE MY POSTERS SO PEOPLE WALKING BY WOULD SEE MY POSTERS AND I WOULD REQUIRE PEOPLE TO TALK TO ME AS THEY WALKED IN AND OUT OF THE GROCERY STORE. THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT. THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, IT IS VERY NICE OF YOU. HI, GUYS. THANK YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHAT SENATOR HARRIS, PLEASE PUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS YOU CAN ON YOUR WEBSITE. WE NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS. I AM A 67-YEAR-OLD , I LOVE MEDICARE FOR ALL, BUT I NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS. I AM A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER HERE. HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN. THEY TALK ABOUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. WE HAVE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT SECONDARY SENATOR, NEXT TIME THEY ASK YOU ABOUT HEALTH CARE, CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK THEM WHEN THEY SAY THAT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS GOING TO GO AWAY? PLEASE CHECK THEM. BECAUSE THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I AM A CURRENT EDUCATOR. AS A GAY WOMAN MARRIED TO A HISPANIC WOMAN FROM PANAMA, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. I HOPE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I KNOW THAT. IT IS SOMETHING I ABSOLUTELY THINK ABOUT. I AM ON LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR YEARS, ACTUALLY. WE HAVE SO MANY RUNAWAYS. THEY ARE SO VULNERABLE. ALL OF THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, AND THEY ARE STARTING NEW ONES. MY BROTHER IS 24. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WAR. MAKE SURE WE DON'T GET INVOLVED. I WAS JUST TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE PROBLEM , FAMILIES ARE SACRIFICING SO MUCH WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, AND YOU CANNOT TAKE THAT CASUALLY. I WAS JUST LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER, SAYING INSTEAD OF THE MILITARY PARADE AND ALL OF THIS BUSINESS, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY FAMILIES. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE TREATING AND ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY WE SHOULD TAKE ANY ACTION THAT COULD PREVENT DEATH AND EXPOSURE TO THE LOSS OF LIFE AND INJURY, BECAUSE WE ARE ENGAGED IN WARS. THANK YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THAT'S GREAT. SOMETIMES, THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR THIRD SOMETIMES I THINK I KNOW, SOMETIMES I DON'T. YOU WILL HAVE CERTAIN OF THAT. THAT IS PART OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. SEE YOU NEXT TIME. I'M ALWAYS SO HAPPY WITH YOU ARE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE VIDEO, THAT WAS WONDERFUL.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?462218-1\/senator-kamala-harris-town-hall-des-moines-iowa","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, held a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa.

BUT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE TOUCHED ON THE ICE RATES THAT STARTED THIS MORNING IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THOSE RAIDS, THE TOPIC OF SUNDAY TALK SHOWS. HERE'S NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO. HELLO EVERYONE. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE LAKES REGION. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR OPENING YOUR HOME AND THIS OUTDOOR CONCERT AREA. THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU. AND THANK YOU ALL, ON A GORGEOUS AFTERNOON, THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, I REALLY DO. I KNOW WE ARE ALL HERE FOR ONE REASON FOR SURE. AND ALSO WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY DO. I DO. AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE A MEASURE AND A METRIC OF OUR SUCCESS, BUT THE OTHER ONE THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS, THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THAT, ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE, THAN I TALK. WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AND HAVE A CONVERSATION AFTER I SHARE A FEW OF MY THOUGHTS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE AND IMPORTANT STATE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE AND VALUE YOUR CONSIDERATION. LET'S GET STARTED. I THINK WE ALL KNOW, THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH AS INDIVIDUALS, AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING \"WHO ARE WE? I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT WE WILL. FIGHTS FOR US, IN TERMS OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE, THAT IS NOT NEW. IT IS NOT NEW FOR US. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FAMILY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S. WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I, WE JOKED THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING, ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND OF COURSE, OF THE MANY HEROES OF THAT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THERE WERE THE LAWYERS, THURGOOD MARSHALL, CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SKILL OF THE PROFESSION OF LAW. TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM COURTROOMS. TO DO THE WORK WE KNOW MUST CONSTANTLY BE DONE OF REMINDING FOLKS OF THE GREAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL TO BE TREATED AS EQUALS. IN FACT, THAT'S WHY I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER AT A YOUNG AGE. I WAS AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY AND I ENDED UP GOING TO LAW SCHOOL AND THEN JOINING AN OFFICE THAT EARL WARREN HELPED BUILD, THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. HAD THAT COURT OF EARL WARREN NOT DECIDED BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. SO, FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY, FIGHTING FOR THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I THINK ABOUT IT THROUGH THAT LENS. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE WAY I WAS RAISED. MY SISTER AND I HAVE A MOTHER WHO IS ALL OF FIVE FETAL, BUT SHE WAS FEROCIOUS. SHE WAS INTENSE. SHE WAS A POWER, ALL FIVE FEET OF HER, AND OUR MOTHER RAISED US WITH AN UNDERSTANDING AND A PROFOUND BELIEF THAT THE MEASURE FOR ANY OF US WILL BE BASED ON WHAT WE DO FOR OTHERS AND HOW WE SERVE, AND HOW WE LIFT OTHERS UP. OUR MOTHER WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO WOULD SAY TO ME MANY TIMES, KAMALA, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS, BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE, YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED. [APPLAUSE] MY MOTHER WAS ALSO THE KIND OF PARENT WHO, IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU, PERHAPS WITH ONE HAND ON HER HIP, AND WITH A VERY STRAIGHT FACE WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND SAY WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO, I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME. YES, BUT WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TWO. WE HAVE TO PUT HALL OF THIS IN CONTEXT, THE REASON ALL YOU GUYS ARE HERE. BUT LET'S PUT IT IN CONTEXT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE. THE GUY RUNS ON A PLATFORM THAT IS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. OF COURSE, THAT LEGS THE QUESTION, GREAT FOR WHOM , BEGS THE QUESTION, GREAT FOR WHOM? AND I ALSO , YES, I LIKE INVOLVEMENT. INVOLVEMENT IS GOOD HERE. IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO ACT. GREAT AGAIN. YOU MEAN GOING BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, THE FAIR HOUSING ACT? WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. ON ALL OF THESE PROMISES OF HOW HE WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WORKING PEOPLE, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE DOES POLICY BY TWEET BASED ON FEAR. HIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY, TRADE POLICY BY TWEET, RESULTING IN THE FACT THAT FARMERS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY MAY BE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, THAT 700,000 AUTO WORKERS MAY BE OUT OF A JOB BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THE AMERICAN FAMILY ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY, WHICH I CALL THE TRUMP TRADE TAX, AMERICANS TODAY ARE SPENDING $1.4 MILLION MORE A MONTH. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BETRAYED US. HE SAID HE WOULD DO ONE THING AND HAS DONE QUITE ANOTHER. HERE IS WHAT I SAY. THE FIGHT BEFORE US INCLUDES THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST HIM. AND I SAY THAT A PROSECUTOR SHOULD DO THE JOB. [APPLAUSE] SO I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVE IN MY CAREER, PERSONALLY PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES WHO PREYED ON HOMEOWNERS, CAUSING ONE OF THE GREATEST ECONOMIC UPHEAVALS WE HAVE SEEN IN GENERATIONS WITH THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. I HAVE TAKEN ON PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTRIES WHO PREYED ON SENIORS SELLING LIES AND MISINFORMATION. I HAVE PROSECUTED BIG OIL, THAT WAS IN THE BUSINESS OF POLLUTING THE WATER WE NEED TO DRINK. I HAVE TAKEN ON AN PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PREY ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I KNOW PREDATORS, AND WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HAS PREDATORY INSTINCTS AND A PREDATORY NATURE. HERE'S IS THE THING ABOUT PREDATORS. HERE'S THE SECRET. THEY PREY ON THE VULNERABLE. THEY PREY ON THE WEAK, ON THOSE THEY PERCEIVE TO BE WEAK. THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF HELP, THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN DESPERATE FOR HELP, AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT PREDATORS, THEY ARE COWARDS. THEY ARE COWARDS, SO LET'S TAKE THIS ON AND IN SO DOING, LET US ALSO DO IT WITH THE SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE AND WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY. LET'S TURN THE PAGE. LET'S WRITE THAT NEXT CHAPTER. AND LET'S WRITE THAT NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. AND AMERICA WHERE UNLIKE TODAY, WHERE ALMOST HALF OF FAMILIES ARE A 400 DOLLAR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM COMPLETE UPHEAVAL, AND AMERICA WHERE TODAY, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL TIME IN 99% OF COUNTIES, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT, IN AMERICA WHERE LAST YEAR 400 MILLION PEOPLE TOOK OUT LOANS FROM PAYDAY LENDERS WITH INTEREST OFTEN IN EXCESS OF 300 PERCENT, LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND IN SO DOING, WHEN WE GET ELECTED, CHANGE THAT TAX CODE SO THAT FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR WILL RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO $6,000 A YEAR THAT THEY CAN TAKE HOME AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN ENDING THE MONTH WITH DIGNITY OR NOT. AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. WELL, I WILL TELL YOU. ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THAT TAX BILL. THAT'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. IN OUR AMERICA, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHERE TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE. [APPLAUSE] SO, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TEACHERS I MET WHO ARE WORKING TOO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS. TEACHERS ARE TAKING MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE MAKE 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS, AUNTS AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. BUT WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM THEIR VALUE. THIS IS PERSONAL TO ME. MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, MISSES FRANCIS WILLIAM, GOD REST HER SOUL, ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. MANY OF US HAVE A SIMILAR STORY OF SOME TEACHER ALONG THE WAY WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. WE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SPECIAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY TOLD US WE WERE AND WE BELIEVED THEM. THEY PUT US ON A PATH TO BEING HERE, TO MAYBE BEING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IN THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN, WE WILL MAKE THE FIRST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NATIONALLY, THAT GAP IS $13,500 A YEAR. IN MOST PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT'S A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. IT MEANS PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BARRIERS TO OUR STUDENTS COMING OUT AND JOINING A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PASSION. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND AMERICA WERE NONE OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GO THROUGH A DRILL WHERE THEY ARE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD GO HIDE IN A CORNER OR IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A MESS SHOOTER ROAMING , MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IN AMERICA TODAY, WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO EVERY DAY ARE GOING THROUGH THIS. UNDER TERRIFIED. TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT THIS ALL MIGHT MEAN. AND WHEN THEY COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND SIT AT THE FAMILY DINNER TABLE, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ASKING THEIR PARENTS WHY, MOMMY AND DADDY, DID WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT DRILL, THE RESPONSES BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY EATERS IN WASHINGTON, , SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE THAT SUGGESTS YOU ARE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY. SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY IT'S FINE IF YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING, BUT WE NEED TO HAVE REASONABLE GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IN THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN, AFTER THIS ELECTION, I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE AND PUT A BILL ON MY DESK FOR SIGNATURE. AND IF THEY DO NOT, I AM PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION BY PUTTING IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT WE HAVE HAD, REQUIRING THE ATF TO REVOKE THE LICENSES OF GUN DEALERS WHO ARE VIOLATING THE LAW, AND YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW, 90% OF THE GUNS ASSOCIATED WITH CRIME OR SOLD BY JUST 5% OF THE DEALERS. WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BETTER ON THAT. FINALLY, BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, I AM PREPARED TO PUT IN PLACE A BAN ON THE IMPORTATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BUT TO PUT A FINE POINT ON THESE TWO AND SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS, I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS A TWO-TERM ATTORNEY GENERAL IN A STATE OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE. I WAS A DISTRICT ATTORNEY ELECTED TWICE. IN ALL OF MY CAREER, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I HAVE ALWAYS CHALLENGED OUR TEAM TO TELL ME ON ANY ISSUE HOW IT AFFECTS THEIR CHILD. THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN SELL ABOUT THE RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF ANY POLICY IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW IT WILL IMPACT A CHILD. I COME FROM A PLACE THAT STRONGLY BELIEVES YOU SHOULD JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND THAT IT REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS A SPECIES. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A GREEN NEW DEAL AND WE WILL IMMEDIATELY REENTER THE PARIS AGREEMENT. [APPLAUSE] AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE SEE NOW, WHICH IS A FELLOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO IS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. AND I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, MY MOTHER WAS A SCIENTIST. SHE WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE, TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS AND TWO DAUGHTERS AND TO END BREAST CANCER. SHE WOULD TAKE US TO THE LAB WITH HER AFTER SCHOOL AND ON WEEKENDS. MY FIRST JOB WAS CLEANING PIPETTES. I WAS AWFUL AND SHE FIRED ME. SO I BECAME A LAWYER. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE IDEA THAT ON THIS ISSUE, IT DOES REPRESENT AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US, THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUCH A LEVEL OF NOT ONLY DENIAL BUT REALLY REJECTION OF WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF A LEADER, REALLY POINTS OUT ONE OF THE MOST URGENT NEEDS AND COME IN ON THE UNITED STATES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL BE PAID EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. [APPLAUSE] SO HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHEN THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS PASSED? YES. 1963, SAYS THE GENTLEMAN OVER HERE. 1963, OUR COUNTRY ACKNOWLEDGED BY STATUTE, BY ACT, THAT WOMEN WERE NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. FAST-FORWARD TO THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019, AND WOMEN ARE PAID $.80 ON AVERAGE TO THE DOLLAR. BLACK WOMEN, $.68. NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN $.58. LATINA WOMEN $.53. THERE IS NO LONGER A DEBATABLE POINT ON THIS. THIS SHOULD HAVE BECOME A BASIC RIGHT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, TO PAY PEOPLE EQUALLY? HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. INSTEAD OF MAKING IT INCUMBENT ON A WOMAN TO PROVE SHE IS NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY TO THE FELLOW IN THE CUBICLE NEXT TO HER, WE ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CORPORATION TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE PAYING PEOPLE EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. WE WILL REQUIRE THAT THEY PROVE THAT THEY ARE PAYING PEOPLE EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, MICROPHONES WILL WORK. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. OK. NO. AT THIS POINT, I'M GOING TO PROJECT. AND THEN I WILL LET YOU GUYS FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THAT WOMAN TO SHOW THAT SHE IS BEING PAID EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK, WE ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE BURDEN TO THE CORPORATIONS. TO PROVE THEY ARE ACTUALLY PAYING WOMEN EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. AND THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO POST THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITE. [APPLAUSE] THERE WE GO. I THINK IT'S WORKING. THERE IS A WHALE HERE SOMEWHERE. HELLO. I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING AND LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT. THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE DEBATE WAS LIKE THAT. I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING AND I HOPE YOU GUYS IN THE BACK CAN HEAR ME. I WILL PROJECT A LITTLE MORE. NOT ONLY WILL THEY HAVE TO POST IT ON THEIR WEBSITE, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO REQUIRE , BECAUSE THERE IS MORE, THAT FOR EVERY 1% DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT A WOMAN IS BEING PAID AND A MAN IS BEING PAID FOR EQUAL WORK, THE CORPORATION WILL BE FINED AN EQUAL PERCENT BASED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S PROFITS. [APPLAUSE] THAT WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION. LET'S TALK ABOUT AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, CHILDREN WILL NOT BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE CALLED BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. UNLESS YOU ARE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOUR PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE THEN, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY RENEW DACA PROTECTIONS. AND WE WILL FIGHT TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. HI, KATIE. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN , OK. IS THERE ANOTHER MIKE FOR ME? TEAM? WHERE IS THE TEAM? IS ANYONE FROM THE TEAM AROUND? WE ARE WORKING ON IT READ COME CLOSER. THAT'S WORKING ON IT. COME CLOSER. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. OK, GREAT. MAYBE I WILL STAY ON THIS SIDE. OK, I AM JUST GOING TO STAND RIGHT HERE. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WE CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IN OUR HISTORY AND RECENTLY, WHICH IS A FULL ON ATTACK AGAINST A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO HER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY, AND I HAVE MET A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE RIGHTLY TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT THESE LAWS THAT ARE BEING PASSED MEAN. I WAS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN ALABAMA, WHERE, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THAT STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE AND INCARCERATE A PHYSICIAN WHO ASSIST IN AN ABORTION, UP TO 99 YEARS IN PRISON. GEORGIA, WE EXPECT. MISSOURI, WE EXPECT THE SAME KIND OF THING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE NOT BEING ALARMIST WHEN WOMEN WILL DIE. IN PARTICULAR, POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR, THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY, THE FINANCIAL ABILITY, OR ACCESS TO TRAVEL TO PLACES WHERE ABORTION AND AXIS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE LEGAL. WOMEN WILL DIE. AS PRESIDENT, I AM PREPARED TO REQUIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, REVIEW THE LAWS COMING FROM ANY STATE THAT HAS A HISTORY OF RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, TO DETERMINE IF THAT LAW IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND COMPORTS WITH ROE V. WADE. AND UNTIL IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL, IT CANNOT GO INTO EFFECT. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE THING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THIS ISSUE ON THE DEFENSIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING WORK ON THE GROUND, LEGAL AID, ALL THE NONPROFITS THAT ARE HELPING MOST WOMEN, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THIS ON THE OFFENSIVE. HE SEEN THIS WAS A NUMBER OF POLICIES AND PERSPECTIVES , WE HAVE SEEN THIS WITH A NUMBER OF MY POLICIES AND PERSPECTIVES. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO APPRECIATES THAT SHE IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND TAKE THAT JOB ON RESPONSIBLY. UNLIKE THE CURRENT APPLICANT TO THE WHITE HOUSE , [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY HAS BONE SPURS. BUT IS A SUPPOSE IT COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO ON THE SUBJECT , SUPPOSED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF RUSSIA'S PROVEN INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ON THE SUBJECT OF AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, A JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S TURN THE PAGE. LET'S TURN THE PAGE AND LET'S WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER. AND IT IS WELL WITHIN OUR POWER AND OUR ABILITY TO DO THIS. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF MANY THINGS, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WHO WE ARE, WE ARE STRONG AS A PEOPLE. WE ARE STRONG AS A PEOPLE, AND ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE WORDS WE WROTE THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. BY OUR NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR-EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS. BUT PART OF THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. SO, FIGHT WE WILL, AND FIGHT WE MUST, KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS, THEREFORE, IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. I GUESS WE ARE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE QUESTIONS , OH, DO YOU WANT TO DO THE QUESTIONS? OK. IN THE DEBATES LAST WEEK OR WHATEVER IT WAS, YOU HAD A POSITION ON BUSING. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHERE YOU STAND AFTER , NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE DEBATE. YEAH. I MEAN, I , THE QUESTION WAS HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT BUSING? IT CAME UP DURING THE DEBATE AND WHERE DO I STAND, AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT NOW NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE DEBATE? I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT CAME UP, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FORMER MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHO WERE PROVING TO BE SEGREGATIONIST, WHO HAD A HISTORY AND PRETTY MUCH LET THEIR CAREERS AND REPUTATIONS OFF OF THAT HISTORY, FIGHTING AGAINST THE INTEGRATION IN OUR COUNTRY. OF FIGHTING AGAINST INTEGRATION OF THE RACES IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY WERE FIGHTING AGAINST INTEGRATION IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BACK TO BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE REASON THAT CASE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT, BECAUSE THIS WAS SUCH A CONTESTED ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY. THERE WERE LAWS AND LEADERS IN PLACE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE SEGREGATION OF THE RACES AS IT RELATES TO COLLEGE EDUCATION. THIS IS PART OF THE SAD HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF, AND THERE IS A LOT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE PROUD OF, AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. I WILL SAY THIS WITH A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIDE. A FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA WENT ON TO BECOME THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT THE SUBJECT WAS, IT WAS REALLY INTEGRAL TO A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS. PART OF THE HISTORY OF THAT, EARL WARREN SAID THIS IS A CASE THAT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR A UNANIMOUS DECISION. IF YOU READ THE HISTORY BEHIND THE CASE, HE PUSHED THERE WOULD BE EIGHT UNANIMOUS DECISION THAT THERE WAS, TO INTEGRATE THE SCHOOLS AND THE CALIFORNIA. FAST-FORWARD ALMOST 20 YEARS. I WAS AN EDUCATOR IN URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 20 YEARS. THIS IS BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS BEING A PROGRESSIVE PLACE, RIGHT? IN BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, I WAS ONLY PART OF THE SECOND CLASS TO INTEGRATE BERKELEY SCHOOLS. THIS IS THE REALITY OF HOW ALL THAT PLAYED OUT IN OUR NATION, WHICH IS IT DIDN'T JUST , 1954, IT GOT DECIDED, AND THE KEY WAS UNLOCKED. THERE HAD TO BE POLICIES AND PRESSURES IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY FULFILL THE PROMISE OF BROWN V BOARD OF EDUCATION TO INTEGRATE THE SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE WERE RESISTING IT, VIOLENTLY RESISTING IT, AND WE CAN REMEMBER THE IMAGES THEMSELVES. VIOLENTLY RESISTING THE DESEGREGATION OF OUR SCHOOLS. SO WHAT ELSE HAS TO HAPPEN? THEY HAD TO BE PUT IN PLACE, MANDATORY BUSING. BERKELEY WAS NOT ONE OF THE PLACES THAT DID IT VOLUNTARILY, BUT IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY, MANDATORY BUSING HAD TO BE PUT IN PLACE, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH RESISTANCE, EVEN VIOLENT RESISTANCE TO THE INTEGRATION OF OUR SCHOOLS. ON THE SUBJECT OF MANDATORY BUSING IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THAT ERA AND THAT PLACE IN TIME, YES. I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS NECESSARY. ONE OF MY OPPONENTS IN THIS RACE, STILL TO THIS DAY, DISAGREES WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HIM, BUT I DO KNOW HE AND I HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THAT ISSUE, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY, BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE QUESTION THAT IS BEING ASKED, THERE IS NO QUESTION, AND I THINK THE EDUCATORS AMONG US KNOW THAT EVEN TODAY, WE ARE SEEING EXTREME SEGREGATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. THERE IS A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR IT, INCLUDING, IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CANDID CONVERSATION, THAT AFTER BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE INTEGRATION, FORCED INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS, THERE WERE SOME FAMILY THAT SAID, I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE EDUCATED WITH BLACK KIDS, AND FAMILIES STARTED PULLING THEIR KIDS OUT OF THE SCHOOLS. YOU CAN TRACK THEIR RESOURCES BEING PULLED OUT OF THOSE SCHOOLS. IF YOU GO INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF MANY STATES AND OUR COUNTRY, YOU WILL SEE EXTREME SEGREGATION BY RACE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS NOT A FUNCTION OF PEOPLE IN STATEHOUSES AND LEGISLATURES WHO ARE RESISTING INTEGRATION, IT, THE REASON IS DIFFERENT. FOR THAT REASON, I THINK MANDATORY BUSING IS NOT A SOLUTION TO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN NUMBER OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO DO IT. ONE IS WE NEED TO TRACK IT AND KEEP THE STATISTICS ABOUT RACE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND GERRYMANDERING ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING WHO CAN LIVE IN WHAT DISTRICT AND WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL BOARDS TO GET AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT TO DO TO ENCOURAGE SUPPORTING PUBLIC MAGNET SCHOOLS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS. BUSING MAY BE ONE OF THEM, BUT NOT THE KIND OF MANDATORY BUSING WE SAW THEN. IT IS SAD THAT KIDS JUST LIKE ME WHO WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE WAR ZONES THEY ARE LIVING IN, WANT TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT THEY GET SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER TO BE PUT IN A CAGE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LOVE OUR YOUNG LEADERS. I JUST DO. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, ELLIE, I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. THANK YOU. IT TAKES A LOT WITH THIS BIG CROWD TO STAND UP AND SPEAK LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC WITH NO MIC. THANK YOU, ELLIE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT IS ABOUT SO MANY THINGS. IT IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD LIVE OUR VALUES TO THE WORLD. WE AS A COUNTRY, WE SAY THAT WE PRIORITIZE HUMANITARIAN APPROACHES TO ISSUES, BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF THAT IN THE POLICIES OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. AFTER THE DEBATE, WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE DEBATES, IT WAS IN MIAMI ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, AND THE MORNING AFTER, I, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, DROVE DOWN TO A PLACE IN FLORIDA CALLED HOMESTEAD. AND IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA, THERE IS A FOR-PROFIT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY THAT IS CURRENTLY HOUSING 2700 CHILDREN. FOR PROFIT, RIGHT? LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BUSINESS MODEL IS THERE. THE BUSINESS MODEL THERE IS THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE PROFITING OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED CHILDREN. WE GET THERE, AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, BUDGET COMMITTEE, AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THIS IS A FACILITY THAT IS A PRIVATELY RUN FACILITY, BUT PAID WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS. THEY WOULD NOT LET US IN. I MEAN, WE COULD NOT FORCE THEM PHYSICALLY, RIGHT? IT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IT IS HARD, AND IT IS WRONG, AND IT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. OF COURSE WE NEED TO TAKE THEIR MONEY. WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN ALL OF THOSE AT DETENTION FACILITIES. , THOSE PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I SAW. I WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND CLIMBED UP A LADDER TO LOOK OVER THE FENCE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT GIVE US ACCESS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAW. I SAW CHILDREN , CHILDREN , LINING DOWN SINGLE FILE, BY GENDER, WALKED INTO BARRACKS. BY THE WAY, I ALSO MET SOME OF THEIR PARENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. IT'S INHUMANE, TO ELLIE'S POINT. IT'S INHUMANE AND IT'S WRONG FOR THAT REASON. AND WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND ALSO, TO YOUR VERY POINT, ELLIE , LISTEN, IT AS A BASIC MATTER, MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT. LET'S GO BASIC FOR A MOMENT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. THE PLACE WHERE YOU GREW UP, WHERE YOUR COUSINS AND FAMILY LIVE, THE PLACE WHERE YOU MIGHT WORSHIP AND YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. SO YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND ASK, WHY ARE THEY HERE? IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN, WHAT IS THAT STORY? PART OF THAT STORY IS THIS. THERE'S A MOTHER AND A FATHER WHO DECIDED TO PAY A COYOTE, TO PAY A STRANGER TO TRANSPORT THEIR CHILD FROM THEIR HOME, THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, TRANSPORT THEM THROUGH THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF MEXICO, FACING UNKNOWN PERIL. WHY WOULD THAT PARENTS DO THAT? BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY LET THEIR CHILD STAY WHERE THEY ARE, THEY WOULD FACE GREATER DANGER. WHAT DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS PERSON, THIS PRESIDENT DO? TO MOST OF THEM, HE SAYS \"GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.\" IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF HUMAN VALUES, IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF AMERICAN VALUES. IT IS WRONG AND IT MUST STOP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO ELLIE, THANK YOU. AND YOU ARE THINKING, IT YOU ARE SPEAKING UP TODAY. YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOUR WORDS, WHEN YOU STOOD UP ON THAT CHAIR AND SPOKE LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF ALL OF THESE FOLKS, YOU JUST SPOKE FOR ALL OF THOSE KIDS. YOU JUST SPOKE FOR ALL OF THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GET IT. WE ARE IN A RURAL STATE. WE HAVE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH OUR CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO HAVE BROADBAND. IT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT DOES NOT GET ANSWERED ENOUGH FOR US. ONE WE TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF , HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE, ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS, WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WE NEED, , IS AN OPTION, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE BROADBAND. I THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF , IT IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE. IT IS CREATING A SUPPORT SYSTEM. I LIKE THAT IDEA. IS THERE A KID GOVERNOR ELECTION? THERE IS, RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE? WHEN IS IT? ARE YOU CAMPAIGNING? THE MIDTERMS? ALL RIGHT. OK? ALL RIGHT. DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP. I WILL SEE YOU LATER, OK?","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?462455-1\/senator-kamala-harris-gilford-hampshire","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke to supporters at a house party in Gilford, New Hampshire","Source":"462455-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

LET ME THINK ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM , THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK YOU ARE DOING EVERY SINGLE DAY. TOGETHER HERE IN IOWA, AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, WE WILL DEFEAT THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] TOGETHER, WE WILL END THE RACISM AND THE SEXISM AND THE ISLAMOPHOBIA AND THE HOMOPHOBIA, AND ALL THE OTHER PHOBIAS THAT THIS PRESIDENT EXHIBITS. AND WE WILL END WHITE NATIONALISM IN THIS COUNTRY, AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] TOGETHER, WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. AND TOGETHER, WE WILL CREATE AN ECONOMY AND A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, AND NOT JUST THE 1%. [APPLAUSE] BUT LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. WE WILL NOT DEFEAT TRUMP UNLESS WE HAVE AN AGENDA THAT SPEAKS TO THE PAIN AND REALITY OF THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF WHOM ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR LOWER WAGES. WE WILL NOT DEFEAT TRUMP UNLESS WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE POWERFUL CORPORATE INTERESTS WHO DOMINATE OUR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIFE. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, ARE BEGGING CONGRESS, FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION. AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, AND THAT IT'S CAUSING DEVASTATING PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE YEAR 2019, WE MUST MAKE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE AND CANCEL ALL STUDENT DEBT IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO END AN ABSURD TAX SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS WALL STREET AND MAJOR CORPORATIONS TO GET HUGE TAX BREAKS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, INCREASINGLY MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY, THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. [APPLAUSE] AND EVERY POLL THAT I HAVE SEEN TELLS ME THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, THAT WE MUST PASS MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] BUT TO DO THAT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, WHICH CHARGER US THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD FOR THE MEDICINE THAT WE NEED. [APPLAUSE] TO DO THAT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, WHICH MADE $100 BILLION IN PROFITS LAST YEAR. AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW WE TAKE ON WALL STREET AND THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND THE NRA IS WHEN WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED, GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STANDING UP, FIGHTING BACK, AND DEMANDING AN ECONOMY AND A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US, AND NOT JUST WEALTHY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTORS. [APPLAUSE] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, WE NEED AN UNPRECEDENTED, GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT. JOIN OUR EFFORTS AND LET US RECLAIM AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL PEOPLE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT TO USE THE FIVE MINUTES IN THE WAY YOU NORMALLY WOULD FOR AN EVENT LIKE THIS. I KNOW THAT 2020 DOESN'T STAND FOR THE YEAR BUT THE NUMBER OF US RUNNING. I WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT THAT WE CAN'T NORMALIZE. WE SAW A VIDEO FROM BETO O'ROURKE AND HE IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. I WORRIED THAT IN THIS ELECTION AS WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT DRIVE US, THE VALUES UNDERNEATH THOSE ISSUES IS WHAT WE NEED TO HIT ON AGAIN AND AGAIN. THIS ELECTION IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON ONE GUY. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A BRILLIANT GENIUS AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS TO KNOW HE'S A PROBLEM. THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON US AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO BE TO EACH OTHER. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MORAL MOMENTS IN OUR NATION THAT IS GOING TO DEFINE THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY AND THIS IS A WEEK WHERE I WILL NOT LET THE SLAUGHTER OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS DISAPPEAR IN THE NEXT MEDIA CYCLE. I WANT TO USE THE THREE MINUTES I HAVE LEFT TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE BONDS US TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE A NATION THAT WHEN FOUR GIRLS WERE KILLED IN A BOMBING IN BIRMINGHAM, WE RAISED OUR MORAL CONSCIENCE AND TRANSFORMED NATION TO A MORE COMPASSIONATE EMPHATIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS HAS TO BE THAT MOMENT. I WANT TO ASK YOU AND TELL YOU IT IS NOT JUST THE MASS SHOOTINGS. EVERY DAY IN AMERICA PEOPLE ARE BEING SLAUGHTERED IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHERE THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE IS SO REGULAR. FOR 10 YEARS, I LIVED IN HIGH-RISE PROJECTS. HE CAME HOME TO THIS NATION AND WAS KILLED BY PEOPLE IN THIS NATION. I NEVER FORGET ASKING HER WHAT SHE LIVED IN THOSE BUILDINGS WHEN HER SON WAS MURDERED THEIR AND SHE SAID I'M IN CHARGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY. SHE SHOWED THE GRIT AND TOUGHNESS LIKE WHAT LANGSTON HUGHES WROTE TO SAVE THE DREAM FOR ONE, WE MUST SAVE THE DREAM FOR ALL. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE WISDOM OF A GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVOR. THE WISDOM OF A WOMAN ON THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE PROJECTS. THIS ROAD WILL BE EASY. THERE WILL BE WEEKS LIKE THIS. I WITNESSED ANOTHER SHOT, BUT HE BLED OUT AND DIED. I WAS TRAUMATIZED AND ANGRY. I FELT LIKE GIVING UP. I FELT A DARKNESS IN MY HEART AND I WILL NEVER FORGET A MORNING AFTER THE SHOOTING AND I SAW HER. SHE SEES ME AND OPENS HER ARMS AND I RUN OVER TO HER AND SHE HOLDS ME AND I FEEL THE PAIN OF ANOTHER BLACK TEENAGER KILLED AND SHE SAID TWO WORDS TO ME. THESE ARE THE TWO WORDS I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH. OVER AND OVER, THIS DEFIANT WOMAN THAT HAS THIS INCREDIBLE LOVE THAT KNOWS YOU CANNOT LEAVE , LEAD THE PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T LOVE THE PEOPLE. SHE RUBBED MY BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SAID TWO WORDS, STAY FAITHFUL. STAY FAITHFUL. STAY FAITHFUL. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE COME THIS FAR BY FAITH. WE HAVE OVERCOME DARKER MOMENTS AND NOW MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED TO STAND UP WITH FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY, FAITH IN OUR IDEALS, FAITH IN EACH OTHER AND COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND STAND TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND LOVE TOGETHER AND OVERCOME THIS DARKNESS WITH OUR LIGHT. THIS IS THE CALL OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO RISE AGAIN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HELLO, IOWA. I OWE YOU ALL SO MUCH. I WAS HERE LAST YEAR, AND ON THE WAY JUST THIS WEEK, I FOUND OUT THAT MY CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE ON THE STAGE IN THE FALL. SO THANK YOU, IOWA. I'M RUNNING TO SOLVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF OUR TIME, WHICH IS WHY IS DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT? HOW DID HE WIN MICHIGAN, IDAHO, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN? IF YOU TURN ON CABLE NEWS, YOU WILL GET A SERIES OF EXPLANATIONS. RUSSIAN, HILLARY CLINTON. I LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS AND THE NUMBERS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY. THE REASON DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT IS WE AUTOMATED 4 MILLIONN MANUFACTURING JOBS. HOW MANY KNOW SOMEONE THAT LOST THEIR JOB IN MANUFACTURING? UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE WORKERS WILL SPREAD TO RETAIL, CALL CENTERS, TRUCK DRIVERS THROUGH YOUR COMMUNITIES. HOW MANY KNOW THE STORES CLOSING IN IOWA? WHY ARE THE STORES ARE CLOSING? IT'S A ONE WORD ANSWER. AMAZON. THEY ARE SUCKING $20 BILLION OUT OF YOUR COMMUNITY. HOW MUCH DID AMAZON PAY IN TAXES LAST YEAR? THAT IS RIGHT. THE MOST COMMON JOB IN IOWA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IS WORKING AS A RETAIL CASHIER. THE AVERAGE RETAIL CASHIER IS A 39-YEAR-OLD WOMAN MAKING BETWEEN NINE DOLLARS AND $10 AN HOUR. I JUST WAS AT IOWA 80 IN DAVENPORT. THERE WERE 5000 PEOPLE THERE. IMAGINE TRUCKS THAT NEVER STOP. WE ARE IN THE GREATEST ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION AND IT BROUGHT US DONALD TRUMP. YOU'VE SEEN IT ON YORUUR FARMS AND MAINSTREETS. IT IS UP TO YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WHY ARE SO MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES COMING HERE? BECAUSE YOU HOLD THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN YOUR HANDS. LOOK AROUND RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE ABOUT 1200 IOWANS IN THIS ROOM. I'VE DONE THE MATH. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCHANY CALIFORNIANS EACH IOWAN IS WORTH? 1000 CALIFORNIANS. EACH OF YOU. I SEE 1.2 MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS HOW YOU START A REVOLUTION. WHERE DOES THE REVOLUTION LEAD? IF YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE HEARD. AN ASIAN MAN WANTS TO GIVE $1000 TO EVERYONE A MONTH. THAT'S TRUE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A GIMMICK, BUT THIS IS A DEEPLY AMERICAN IDEA. THOMAS PAYNE WAS FOR IT, MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS FIGHTING FOR IT THE DAY HE WAS ASSASSINATED AND ONE STATE HAS HAD A DIVIDEND FOR 40 YEARS WHERE EVERYONE GETS BETWEEN $1000 IN $2000 A YEAR AND WHAT STATE IS THAT? TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS RIGHT. IN ALASKA, THEY CALL IT THE OIL CHECK. NOW WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? IT WOULD GO RIGHT BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITIES. CAR REPAIRS, DAY CARE, LITTLE LEAGUE SIGN UP, IT WOULD REVITALIZE YOUR ECONOMIES AND CREATE 40,000 NEW JOBS. IT WOULD HELP RURAL AREAS WITH A PATH FORWARD BECAUSE WE KNOW RURAL AREAS ARE GETTING SUCKED DRY. THIS IS A VISION OF A TRICKLE OF ECONOMY. UNLIKE THE NONSENSE OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C., THIS WOULD WORK. IT IS UP TO YOU TO TAKE THE VISION FOR AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR US, THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE SOCIETY AND MAKE IT REAL. THAT IS WHY I'M HERE AND THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE HERE AND WE DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME. IF WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GETTING SMARTER, YOUR STORES CLOSING, SELF DRIVING TRUCKS HITTING THE HIGHWAYS AND WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. I'M ASKING THAT YOU TAKE THE VISION TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE OF DONALD TRUMP IS AN ASIAN MAN WHO LIKES MATH. LET'S MAKE AMERICA THINK HARDER. [APPLAUSE] (music) IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. THIS IS HISTORIC. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STANDING ON THIS STAGE. FIRST, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, I HOPE TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT. LET ME JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING EACH OF US TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK THE QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING WHO ARE WE, AND I THINK WE KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME FOR US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR US. WE FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE AND SO WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND WE KNOW ITS PROMISE AND WE KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. I WILL TELL YOU, I COME FROM A FAMILY OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVISTS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY MOTHER WAS TOUGH. SHE WAS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL, BUT IF YOU MET HER, YOU WOULD THINK SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A STRAIGHT FACE, MAYBE ONE HAND ON THE HIP AND SAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE YOU GO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT. WE MUST, IT IS CONTEXT. THIS IS A GUY WHO CAME IN ON A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ABOUT LOOKING BACKWARDS. THIS IS ABOUT A GUY WHO CAME IN AND HAD BEEN IN OFFICE, USING THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US, BUT WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE IS IN OUR HEART. WE KNOW WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUY WHAT HE IS TRYING TO SELL BECAUSE WE KNOW DUEDDE GOT TO GO. DUDE GOT TO GO. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT KNOWING WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US IN THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THAT IS WHAT I CALL THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY OF WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY, IT IS NEVER THROUGH A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT POLLS PUT US IN AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH OUR PERSONAL HEALTH, THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN, PARENTS. FOR SO MANY, CAN I GET A JOB, KEEP A JOB, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY, PAY OFF STUDENT LOANS? FOR SO MANY FAMILIES, CAN I HELP GET MY FAMILY MEMBER OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? OUR FARMERS, CAN I KEEP MY BUSINESS THRIVING? THIS MAN'S FRAGILE EGO THAT HAS PROMPTED TRADE POLICY BY TWEET. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME FOR US TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND PUT FOOD OVER YOUR TABLE. WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE A CLIMATE CRISIS AND TREAT IT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, AND A WOMAN WILL HAVE POWER OVER HER OWN BODY AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, ALL PEOPLE WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE AND COSTS WILL NOT BE THE BARRIER. WE WILL PAY OUR TEACHERS THEIR VALUE, UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY ARE HELPING TO RAISE OUR KIDS AND WE WILL FIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS A FIGHT NOT ONLY FOR OPTIMISM OF WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED I WHAT HAS BEEN, THIS IS A FIGHT NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF KNOWING THAT THIS IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN WE EVER HOPED IT COULD BE, AND WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS AND I PROMISE YOU WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE STAGE WASHINGTON GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. INSLEE: GOOD EVENING. I'M JAY INSLEE. THE JACKHAMMERING, BULLDOZER OPERATING, CONCRETE TRUCK DRIVING, CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHTING GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, AND I'M HERE TO SAY THIS ONE THING. IF YOU PUT ME ON THE DEBATE STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP, I WILL BEAT HIM LIKE A TWO DOLLAR MULE. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. NOW, OF COURSE WE DON'T DO THAT TO OUR ANIMALS. WE TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT AND THE REASON IS I HAVE NEVER MET A MULE LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND NEVER MET A MULE WHO IS A WHITE NATIONALIST. WE NEED TO REMOVE THIS GUY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I FEEL A KINSHIP WITH A SMALL AGRICULTURAL TOWN. FOR 46 YEARS, WE RAISED OUR BOYS IN A SMALL RED DISTRICT IN EASTERN WASHINGTON. I WON THREE OUT OF FOUR ELECTIONS THERE. I KNOW HOW TO WIN SMALL TOWNS AND IF I WIN, THE CREDIT PARTY IS GOING TO INVEST IN SMALL TOWNS AND ELECTIONS. I ONLY WON THREE OUT OF FOUR. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE FOURTH ELECTION. I WAS A FRESHMAN LEGISLATOR AND THE BILL CAME UP TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. I KNEW IF I VOTED TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS I WOULD LOSE MY SEAT, BUT I VOTED TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, I LOST MY SEAT AND I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THAT ONE SECOND. THAT WAS THE RIGHT VOTE THEN AND IT IS THE RIGHT VOTE NOW. NOW, I HAVE THE NRA ON THE RUN. WE HAVE A HISTORIC PLACE TO GATHER TONIGHT AND WE KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT AMERICA, AND I THINK YOU CAN CALL IT A MUSIC. IT IS A MUSIC OF DIVERSITY, OF THE MIDDLE CLASS, A MUSIC OF OPPORTUNITY. IN WASHINGTON STATE, WE ARE PLAYING THAT MUSIC. FIRST NET NEUTRALITY BILL IN THE UNITED THEY DO. WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ACROSS THIS NATION. SO WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND AS A RESULT OF DOING THESE THINGS, YOU GET THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE U.S. I KNOW THIS. WE HAVE A CHALLENGE OUT THERE THAT WILL MAKE ALL THESE OTHER VICTORIES MOOT IF WE DON'T FIGHT TOGETHER. HER NAME IS VIRGINA. , REGINA. SHE RUNS DRESS FOR SUCCESS IN DAVENPORT. SHE WAS THE VICTIM AND BECAME MUCH MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE. HER TEARS WERE JUST LIKE THE TEARS OF MARCIA MOSS, A WOMAN I MET IN AGOURA HILLS. PEOPLE IN MIAMI BEACH BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IF YOU GIVE ME THIS HIGH HONOR, I WILL MAKE DEFEATING CLIMATE CRISIS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT NEEDS TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. WE HAVE GOOD CANDIDATES IN THIS FIELD, BUT I BELIEVE I AM UNIQUE BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS MADE THIS STATEMENT THAT IT HAS TO BE THE TOP PARTY. MY PLAN TO DO SO IS BEING CALLED THE GOLD STANDARD. IT IS THE MOST ROBUST PLAN. IT BUILDS 8 MILLION GOOD UNION JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. I WILL MENTION ONE OTHER THING. IF WE ARE GOING TO BEAT CLIMATE CRISIS, WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY THE FILIBUSTER FROM MITCH MCCONNELL. WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HIM, AND I HAVE TO SAY, WE NEED BOLD ACTION ON GUNS, BOLD ACTION ON TEACHER PAY, BOLD ACTION ON GENDER PARITY, BOLD ACTION ON EQUAL PAY. THANKS A LOT. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, IOWAN DEMOCRATS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS WIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR VALUES, AND HERE'S AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR ME. NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE IN AMERICA, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BUILD A SECURE FUTURE FOR YOURSELF, YOUR FAMILY AND BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS ON YOUR SIDE. BUT FOR DECADES NOW IN RURAL AND SMALL-TOWN AMERICA, THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AND THAT IS WHY A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, I ROLLED OUT AN EXPANDED PLAN FOR RURAL AMERICA, AND HERE IS WHERE STARTS. IT STARTS WITH HEALTH CARE, THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS IN BUSINESS. A COMMUNITY LOSES ITS HOSPITAL, YOUNG FAMILIES CANNOT MOVE IN AND SENIORS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO LEAVE, SO HERE'S HOW I SEE THIS. WE START BY BEING WILLING TO FIGHT AGAINST HOSPITAL MERGERS THAT COST US OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS. WE RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMICS, ALL SMALL HOSPITALS OPERATE ON BEEN THIN MARGINS. THAT MEANS EVERYONE WHO COMES IN THE DOOR NEEDS TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH CARE. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO PUT IN THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR RURAL HOSPITALS AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS AND NURSES TO MAKE SURE MEDICAL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PART TWO OF THIS PLAN IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA. THAT IS HOW YOU PARTICIPATE IN A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. PART THREE, WE NEED A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR INDEPENDENT FARMERS. FARM PLANS FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN ABOUT BIG AG. WE NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO BREAK UP BIG AG AND SAY NO MORE SUCKING OUT THE DOLLAR OF OUR POCKET. I SUPPORT SUPPLY MANAGEMENT, AND I SAY IT IS TIME FOR A NEW POLICY, AN INNOVATIVE POLICY TO BRING IN EVERY SINGLE FARMER, MAKE THEM PART OF THE SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CRISIS, PUT THEM ON THE FRONT LINES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HELP TAKE CARE OF OUR LAND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND HELP US HAVE AN INHABITABLE PLANET FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. AND ONE MORE, TRADE WAR BY TWEET IS NOT WORKING FOR OUR FARMERS. I PROMISE YOU THIS. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, WHEN I NEGOTIATE A TRADE DEAL, THERE WILL BE INDEPENDENT FARMERS AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT. AND ONE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE. WHEN I TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMY, WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE, IT IS SO THE ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE. THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. WE NEED MORE POWER IN THE HANDS OF WORKERS. THAT MEANS MAKING IT EASIER TO JOIN A UNION. GIVE UNIONS MORE POWER WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE. IT IS TIME FOR A WEALTH TAX IN THIS COUNTRY. TWO CENTS FROM THE TOP ONE-TENTH OF ONE PERCENT AND WE CAN HAVE UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE, UNIVERSAL PRE-K, UNIVERSAL COLLEGE, $50 BILLION FOR HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND WE CAN CANCEL STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 95% OF THE FOLKS WHO'VE GOT IT. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF AN AMERICA WHERE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS BETTER AND BETTER FOR A THINNER AND THINNER SLICE AT THE TOP. 2020 IS OUR CHANCE. WE CAN MAKE THIS GOVERNMENT WORK FOR ALL OF AMERICA. LET'S DO THIS, DEMOCRATS. DREAM BIG, FIGHT HARD, LET'S WIN! [APPLAUSE] (music) FOLKS, YOUR PATIENCE EXCEEDS YOUR GOOD JUDGMENT. [LAUGHTER] THE GOOD NEWS IS I'M LAST. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. YOU HEARD FROM GOOD PEOPLE TONIGHT. YOU HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO SHARE ONE FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF, THAT THERE IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT IF WE KEEP DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING IT FOR APPLAUSE. PRESIDENTS CAN MOVE MARKETS, SEND MEN AND WOMEN TO WAR, THEY CAN MAKE PEACE, THEY CAN APPEAL TO OUR BETTER ANGELS, BUT THEY CAN ALSO UNLEASH THE UGLY SIDE OF SOCIETY, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHEN DONALD TRUMP , SINCE HE HAS COME PRESIDENT, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DONE. HE HAS UNLEASHED A CONSTANT BATTLE TAKING PLACE IN AMERICA. WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. WE HAVE BEEN HERE WHEN 3000 KLANSMEN IN 1925 WALKED DOWN THE STREET OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE MARCHED DOWN AND OVER 30 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO DECLARED KLAN MEMBERS. WHEN THERE WERE SIX OR SEVEN SENATORS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE FOUGHT BACK BECAUSE WE HAD PEOPLE THAT DECIDED THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE REASON I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS NOT THAT WE CAN'T OVERCOME. WE CAN OVERCOME. WHEN YOU SAW THOSE PEOPLE WALKING OUT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, THEIR CONTORTED FACES, ANGER, CHANTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE ACCOMPANIMENT BY RACISTS. THE FACT WAS IS THAT DAVID DUKE TALKED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE FOUND THE PRESIDENT WHO SAID AT THE TIME WHEN ASKED WHEN THAT YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED AND HE SAID WHAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS SAID. HE SAID THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. HE DID. THIS IS A REALITY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DONALD TRUMP OFFERS NO MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE HAS NO INTEREST IN UNIFYING THE COUNTRY. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THE PRESIDENCY HAS AWAKENED HIS CONSCIENCE IN ANY WAY. INSTEAD, HE HAS PUBLICLY AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY SPREAD HATE, RACISM AND DIVISION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS UP TO ALL OF US WHO HAVE TO DO WHAT OUR PRESIDENT CAN'T, STAND TOGETHER, STAND AGAINST HATE AND LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS. THIS IS WHITE NATIONALISM. THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACY. ASSAULT.EVERYTHING THAT MAKES , IT'S NOT ONLY OUR VALUES THAT'S UNDER ASSAULT. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA IS UNDER ASSAULT. LOOK AT THE ATTACKS ON THE FREE PRESS, THE LEGISLATURE. THESE ARE THE GUARDRAILS THAT HAVE DECIDED WE SETTLE LONG AGO AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE AMERICAN CREED HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE ARE CREATED EQUAL AND WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT THAT WE THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT, BUT EVERY SINGLE GENERATION HAS MOVED US CLOSER TO JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE DEAL. EVERY GENERATION HAS DONE IT, BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FACT WE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT ISN'T BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT. EVERY SINGLE GENERATION HAS DONE IT. THAT'S WHY IT'S NEVER GATHERED DUST IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, ALL THAT WE STAND FOR. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT. FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS AN ABERRATION, BUT EIGHT YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE CORE VALUES OF THIS NATION ARE STANDING IN THE WORLD. OUR OWN SENSE OF WHO WE ARE IS AT STAKE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES, UNITY OVER DIVISION, WE CHOOSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO STAND FOR WHAT WE ARE AS BECAUSE IF WE DO, WE CAN TAKE IT ALL BACK TOMORROW AND WE MUST. DONALD TRUMP IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. NOT A SINGLE THING CAN HAPPEN UNLESS WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. LET'S TAKE IT BACK. I REFUSE TO WAIT ANY LONGER. TAKE IT BACK NOW. THIS IS AMERICA. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. STAND UP, AMERICA. TAKE IT BACK. [APPLAUSE] (music) COMING UP THIS MORNING, WE WILL TALK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES WITH PATIENCE FOR AFFORDABLE DRUGS FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT DAVID MITCHELL , BE SURE TO WATCH C-SPAN'S \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL.\" LIVE AT 7:00 EASTERN THIS MORNING.

ON THE SOAPBOX. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. AND THRILLED. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHO WE ARE. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL HEARD GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. SO LET'S JUST GET STARTED. I ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES. I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS. BUT I'VE GOT SWEATY MINUTES. HEROD IS SPIRIT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING WHO ARE WE? AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. SO THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. AND FIGHT WE WILL. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR US. WE AS AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. AND FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEALS. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I AM A DAUGHTER OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE 1960'S. MY SISTER AND I, MAYA, WE JOKE WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING. ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND IN FACT MANY OF THE HEROES OF THAT MOVEMENT WERE THE LAWYERS WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREET TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY AND REMIND FOLKS OF THAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776 THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. WHICH IS WHAT INSPIRED ME TO WANT TO BECOME A LAWYER. SO WE ARE FIGHTERS AND WE ARE BORN OF FIGHTERS. I WAS RAISED ALSO BY A MOTHER. MY SISTER MAIA AND I - OUR MOTHER -SHE WAS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL. IF YOU EVER MET OUR MOTHER, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. AND SHE WAS FIERCE. SHE WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO WOULD SAY TO ME ALL THE TIME, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. YOUR LIFE SHOULD BE BASED ON SERVICE TO OTHERS, NOT SELF INTEREST. AND MY MOTHER WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME IN OUR HOUSE, IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING. OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A STRAIGHT FACE ONE HAND PROBABLY ON A HIP AND SHE WOULD SAY, WELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE YOU GO. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS CONTEXT. HERE IS A GUY WHO CAME INTO OFFICE ON A SLOGAN THAT WAS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHICH, OF COURSE, FOR MANY OF US WAS, AGAIN FOR WHOM? BUT IT IS BACKWARD THINKING. BACK TO WHAT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE FAIR HOUSING ACT? BEFORE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] AND HE CAME IN OFFICE MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES TO FOLKS. AND IN PARTICULAR WORKING PEOPLE. EVERYONE FROM FARMERS HERE IN IOWA TO AUTOWORKERS. CAME IN MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO HELP OUT WORKING PEOPLE. AND THEN WHAT DID HE DO? HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. THEN WHAT HAPPENS, ENGAGES IN THE SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY THAT WAS TRADE BY TWEET BORN OUT OF HIS FRAGILE EGO IN A WAY THAT WAS ABOUT UNILATERAL ACTION THAT HAS RESULTED IN FARMERS HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, SOYBEANS ROTTING IN BINS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AUTOWORKERS MAY BE OUT OF WORK BY THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY. I CALL IT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX. AND HERE'S THE THING. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO THIS OBVIOUSLY IS AN ELECTION. ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TURN THE PAGE. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. ALSO KNOWING THAT WE REJECT THE VOICE THAT HE HAS PROVIDED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT SOWING HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. WE REJECT THAT. IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS WHAT I CALL THE 3:00 A.M. THOUGHT. YOU KNOW THE THING THAT WAKES YOU UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US. WHEN WE WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THINKING THAT THOUGHT. IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOUR - FOR - THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC SOME POLLSTER PUT US IN. AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS. OUR PERSONAL HEALTH. THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OR PARENTS. FOR SO MANY OF, CAN I GET A JOB, KEEP A JOB, PAY THE BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. FOR OUR STUDENTS CAN I PAYOFF THOSE STUDENT LOANS? FOR SO MANY FAMILIES, CAN I HELP OUR FAMILY MEMBER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND THAT IS PART OF THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL FIGHT FOR THAT. AND OUR FIGHT IS BORN OUT OF THAT KNOWLEDGE. AND SO YES, WE MUST TURN THE PAGE AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN THAT. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE DUDE HAS GOT TO GO. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SO THE POINT THEN IS LET US ALSO , THINK ABOUT WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER. AND DOING THAT TOGETHER. AND WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE . THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE SAY, YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO HAVE ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WE SAY IT IS NOT OK AS OF TODAY IN AMERICA ALMOST HALF OF OUR FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHEN IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU'RE A MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A MARKET RATE FOR ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT. IT IS NOT OK THAT LAST YEAR IN OUR COUNTRY, 12 MILLION PEOPLE HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN OF ON AVERAGE $400 FROM THE PAYDAY LENDER AT AN INTEREST RATE OF OFTEN IN EXCESS OF 300%. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN IT I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN WE WIN THIS ELECTION, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE AS FOLLOWS. FOR FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN $100,000 PER YEAR, THEY WILL GET UP TO A $6,000 TAX CREDIT THAT YOU CAN TAKE HOME AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE FAMILIES GETTING THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH OR NOT. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEEPS PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT IS THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PAY TEACHERS THEIR VALUE. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE TEACHERS ON AVERAGE ARE PAID 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. I HAVE MET MORE TEACHERS HERE AND I WENT AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. OUR TEACHERS ARE COMING 94% OF THEM OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. HERE'S THE THING, THEY'RE ONLY TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS AND AUNTIES AND UNCLES. AND OUR TEACHERS. WE MUST PAY THEM THEIR VALUE. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PUT INTO PLACE THE FIRST IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IN IOWA, THAT IS $12,200 PER YEAR. $12,200 PER YEAR. IN MANY PLACES THAT IS A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. $12,200 PER YEAR. THAT IS A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. $12,200 PER YEAR. THAT IS PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DEBT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. - SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BARRIERS TO OUR KIDS COMING OUT OF SCHOOL AND ENJOYING A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PASSION. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. OUR BABIES, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY ARE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO HIDE IN A CLOSET OR CROUCH IN A CORNER IN THE EVENT THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL. THOSE CHILDREN OF OURS WHO COME HOME AT NIGHT AND ASK, WHY DID WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT DRILL? TO WHICH OF COURSE, OUR RESPONSE IS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO , HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH SUGGESTS YOU ARE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY, WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO AGREE, FIND IF YOU WANTED TO GO HUNTING BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [CROWD CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IF MITCH MCCONNELL DOESN'T CALL US BACK TO VOTE ON A BILL, THEN WHEN WE ARE ELECTED, I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO PULL THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON THIS AND PUT A BILL ON MY DESK FOR SIGNATURE. AND IF THEY DO NOT, I AM PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO PUT IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT, TO REQUIRE THE ATF TO TAKE LICENSES FROM GUN DEALERS WHO VIOLATE THE LAW, AND BY EXECUTIVE ACTION TO BAN THE IMPORTATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS INTO OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT OF EVERYONE, AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF JUST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL PUT IN PLACE, KNOWING THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEEPS PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT, A WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN WHICH I HAVE PROPOSED, WHICH WILL OFFER EVERYONE HEALTH CARE WITHOUT REGARD TO COST, PUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN CHECK. SO THERE WILL BE NO DEDUCTIBLES, NO CO-PAYS, YOU WILL STILL HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PLAN, AND EXPAND SERVICES AND BENEFITS. BECAUSE IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE KNOW THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE, A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. IT IS A MORAL ISSUE AND WE MUST , DO BETTER. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEEPS US UP AT NIGHT IS THE SECURITY OF OUR HOMELAND, AND WE NEED TO HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT UNDERSTANDS HER GREATEST PRIORITY IS CONCERNING HERSELF WITH THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR NATION, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WHO ON THE ISSUE OF THE FACT OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF AMERICAN AN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] I WILL SAY THIS, LISTEN. I KNOW A LOT OF US OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN WONDERING HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT, WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE BEEN THROWING OBJECTS AT THAT INANIMATE OBJECT CALLED THE TELEVISION, GOING TO THERAPY TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, BUT IN HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO REMIND ALL OF THE FRIENDS. IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION AND AS A PEOPLE IS THAT, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS, THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED, WE HAVE NOT REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS, WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. SO FIGHT WE WILL, AND FIGHT WE MUST, KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM, THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING WHAT CAN BE AND BELIEVING IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND THIS, THEREFORE, IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THANK YOU, IOWA, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, IOWA. SO PART OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THIS. TO GET THROUGH AND TURN THE NEXT PAGE, TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. I THINK IT WILL TAKE A PROSECUTOR TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE GOT A RAP SHEET, AND IT IS LONG. LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. A TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, TO THE POINT THAT 60 OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE U.S. PAID NO TAXES LAST YEAR. WHO HERE PAID NO TAXES LAST YEAR? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TRADE POLICY THAT IS RESULTING IN DIRECT HARM TO WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. LET'S TALK ABOUT A POLICY THAT IS ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES AND SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY, WHEN WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT? [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT A FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE, AND OUR FARMERS AND EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS IT, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, IT IS A CRISIS, IT IS CAUSED BY HUMAN BEHAVIORS WHICH CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE TO OUR LIFESTYLE, AND REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS, AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO IS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT. TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. HE TALKS ABOUT WIND TURBINES. HERE IN IOWA, YOU ARE A LEADER IN THIS. 40% OF IOWA'S ELECTRICITY COMES FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY. YOU ARE A MODEL. BUT WE HAVE A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SAYS WIND TURBINES CAUSE CANCER. I LOVE GOVERNOR INSLEE'S LINE. I GIVE HIM A HAT TIP. HE SAID, TURBINES DON'T CAUSE CANCER, THEY CAUSE JOBS. [LAUGHTER] SO WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST HIM. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW THE PUNDITS WILL TALK ABOUT AND COMPARE, AND I THINK OVERLY COMPARE 2016 TO 2020. 2020 WILL NOT BE 2016. 2020 WILL NOT BE 2016. THERE IS NOW, I CALL IT A RAP SHEET. THERE IS NOW A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO KNOW THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN HIM WERE BETRAYED, WHO KNOW THAT WE EXPECT THAT THE PERSON WHO OCCUPIES THAT MOST PRECIOUS SEAT, WHICH IS OUR GOVERNMENT, NOT HIS, THAT IS, WE ARE A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE, WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAS THIS MICROPHONE IN HER HAND, IT IS A VERY, VERY POWERFUL FORCE, AND MUST ALWAYS BE USED NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN BUT TO LIFT PEOPLE UP. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. MY TIME IS UP. THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF IT. CONGRESS IS INVESTED IN THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY. AMONG THEM IS THE AUTHORITY TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT PASSES THROUGH COMMERCE. FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE DONE THE LEGAL RESEARCH ON IT. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS STRONG. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. OUR POLICY AND MY PREPAREDNESS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IS JUST FRANKLY BECAUSE I AM FED UP. CONGRESS HAS DONE NOTHING. I MEAN EVEN AT THIS MOST LATEST TRAGEDY. WE MAY BRING PEOPLE BACK WE MAY DO SOMETHING. ALL THESE BABY STEPS. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THIS. AND WE KEEP HAVING TRAGEDY AFTER TRAGEDY. SOMEBODY ASKED ME, MAYBE THIS TRAGEDY WILL SPUR SOME ACTION. WELL, THIS TRAGEDY IS AS TRAGIC AS EACH ONE WE HAVE SEEN. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTION OVER MANY, MANY YEARS. SO YES, I'M PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. I BELIEVE AND I'M CONFIDENT IT WILL PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. LET ME TELL YOU THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH THAT QUESTION. AND IT IS BEING ASKED A LOT. IT BEGINS AND ENDS WITH A QUESTION AND THE ANSWER TO THAT, AS OPPOSED TO RECOGNIZING THE LONG HISTORY IN UNITED STATES OF THIS AS AN ISSUE, THE ISSUE OF HATE. I AS A PROSECUTOR HANDLED HATE CRIMES. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RUNNING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, I WAS PUBLISHING CRIME REPORTS EVERY YEAR. THIS IS NOT NEW IN AMERICA. HATE IS NOT NEW. HATE THAT TAKES THE FORM OF RACISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, ISLAMOPHOBIA IS NOT NEW IN OUR COUNTRY. AND I WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN A CONVERSATION THAT SIMPLIFIES THIS ISSUE WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE HISTORY, SPEAKING TRUTH ABOUT IT, AND RECOGNIZING IT HAPPENED BEFORE THIS GUY WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE IS CERTAINLY FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IF ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION, LET'S HAVE IT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. WHEN WE HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN POWAY TO THE SYNAGOGUE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE, TO WHAT HAPPENED IN EL PASO, WE SHOULD ALL BE HAVING A CONVERSATION AND PARTLY LOOKING IN THE MIRROR TO SAY WHERE HAVE WE BEEN ON THIS, AND WHAT ARE WE PREPARED TO DO. PART OF IT HAS TO BE, UNLIKE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND PRESIDENT HAVE DONE, I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS, THEY SHUT DOWN THE RESOURCES ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM. THEY JUST SHUT IT DOWN, IN TERMS OF PUTTING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT INTO IT AND ACKNOWLEDGING IT IS REAL AND IT MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT IT IS, DOMESTIC TERRORISM. SO IMMEDIATELY, I WOULD REFORM THAT PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE PRIORITY. ALSO IT IS ABOUT THE MICROPHONE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS. A PERCEPTION ABOUT AN ISSUE LIKE RACE. OR RELIGION. OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND THEN JUST GO DOWN THE LIST. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS USED THE VERY PRECIOUS TOOL OF THAT MICROPHONE IN MY OPINION ABOUT THE STYLING, THE POWER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE BEING IN IOWA. EACH TIME I COME, I REALLY DO , I GAIN A LOT FROM IT. I GAIN PERSPECTIVE FROM IT. WE HAVE OVER 65 STAFF IN IOWA. WE HAVE BEEN STAFFING UP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. I'M INTRODUCING MYSELF TO PEOPLE. IT WILL BE A PROCESS AND WITH EACH STEP THAT WE TAKE, WE ARE GAINING GROUND AND BUILDING MOMENTUM. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HAD , WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. I HAVE NO INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT IT. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IN PRISONS, THERE IS A LOT OF REFORM THAT IS NEEDED AND THAT RELATES EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE WORKED ON FOR YEARS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO END SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT MINORS AND WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO ON INCARCERATED WOMEN THAT I HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION ON INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE SHACKLED EVEN DURING PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. THERE IS LOTS TO DO ACROSS THE BOARD. ON THAT SUBJECT, WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS SUPPORTED , AND , SUPPORTED PRIVATE PRISONS. WE NEVER WANT TO BE IN THE BUSINESS OF HAVING UNITED STATES TAXPAYER DOLLARS GO TO AN INDUSTRY BY ITS VERY BUSINESS MODEL IS ABOUT PROFITING OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS INCLUDING WHAT I SAW IN FLORIDA. A PRIVATE DETENTION FA TILT THAT HOUSES 2700 CHILDREN WHICH MEANS THAT YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE GOING TO FUND THE PROFIT OF THE INCARCERATION OF CHILDREN. A NUMBER OF THINGS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS CONDUCTED TRADE POLICY BY TWEETS. RIGHT? HE CAME TO IOWA MAKING ALL SORTS OF PROMISES TO FARMERS. HE JUST CUT OFF A MARKET TO OUR FARMERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN CULTIVATING FOR WELL OVER A DECADE. NOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY. LET'S STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT TRADE BY DEFINITION MEANS THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PARTY. BECAUSE YOU'RE TRADING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. USUALLY THERE ARE A FEW PARTIES INVOLVED. WE HAVE TO CONDUCT TRADE POLICY IN A WAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE MANY RHODE ISLANDS AND FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN PLAY IN THAT. UNILATERAL. THAT IS TRADE POLICY IN A WAY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NEGOTIATION AND THE LEVERAGE THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. TRUE, TRADE POLICY FOR ME IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABOUT PROTECTING THE AMERICAN WORKERS AND HAVING THOSE AS OUR PRIORITIES. FOR THAT REASON, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF WHAT I CALL 2.0. I AM GOING TO SPEND MY TIME IN IOWA AND WORK ON EARNING THE SUPPORT OF EVERY IOWAAN AND MY AGENDA, WHICH I CALL THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA IS BORN OUT OF MY FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON AND THAT PEOPLE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS A PROBLEM-SOLVING PRESIDENT AND THE PROBLEMS ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP THEM UP AT NIGHT AND WAKE THEM UP IN THELED IN OF THE NIGHT. IT IS ABOUT HEALTHCARE, KEEPING A JOB. GETTING THROUGH THE THE END OF THE MONTH BEING ABLE TO PAY THE BILLS. IT IS ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND EDUCATION. ISSUES LIKE TRADE. THESE ARE MY PRIORITIES AND I KNOW THEY SPEAK TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF US REGARDLESS TO THE PARTY THAT IS REGISTERED TO VOTE. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE EPSTEIN CASE TO COMMENT ON THAT. I JUST HEARD ON THAT. ON THE ISSUE OF WAL-MART, YEAH, THEY SHOULD STOP SELLING GUNS. I DO BELIEVE THAT. IT IS JUST , WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS. LET'S START WITH THAT. WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE AS I SAID RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY THEY ARE SELLING THEM. IT IS NOT THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP SELLING THEM BUT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE CHECKS AND POLICIES ON ENTHUSIASM WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS. IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN BACKGROUND CHECKS, THEN FINE. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT. THAT'S WHY SAID THAT.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?463123-2\/senator-kamala-harris-iowa-state-fair","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Iowa State Fair.

THIS IS 45 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE THE GUEST SPEAKER. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I HAD DECIDED TO SUPPORT KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT. I WAS FIRST ATTRACTED TO SENATOR HARRIS BECAUSE AFTER FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP I FELT THERE WAS NOTHING OUR COUNTRY NEEDED MORE THAN RECONCILIATION AND HEALING. SHE STRUCK ME MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES AS A UNIFIER THAT COULD BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER RATHER THAN SPLIT IT FURTHER APART. I SAW HER HERE AT THE SOUTH CHURCH. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE WAITING IN THE SNOW TO SEE HER. I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER BOLD, THOUGHTFUL POLICY PROPOSALS ON A RANGE OF ISSUES, FROM RAISING TEACHER SALARIES TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER STRENGTH OF CHARACTER, HER TOUGHNESS, HER RESOLVE. I SAW IN HER NOT ONLY A FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO COULD PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT, AS HER CAMPAIGN LIKES TO SAY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS A TOUGH, DISCIPLINED, SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL NOT ONLY PROSECUTE THE CASE BUT WILL TRY TO CONVICT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ABANDONING OUR COUNTRY, THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR VALUES. [APPLAUSE] I AM A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AND I CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES BUT TO BE HONEST I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NUANCED POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THIS TIME. WE KNOW WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR. WE KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WE KNOW OUR COUNTRY IS IN PERIL. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN WIN, PURE AND SIMPLE. ELECTABILITY IS WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ABOUT AND I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS THE MOST ELECTABLE CANDIDATE. I BELIEVE SHE CAN INSPIRE AND TURN OUT THE BASE, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT MILLENIALS, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT PEOPLE OF COLOR, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT WOMEN, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT VOTERS IN THE HEARTLAND WHO FELT DISENFRANCHISED AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP ONLY TO BE STABBED IN THE BACK BY POLICIES THAT FAVOR THE RICH. PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, AND LISTEN TO THESE WORDS BECAUSE THIS IS CRITICAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER YOUR CANDIDATES, IN AN ELECTION WHERE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO WIN OVER MODERATE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE QUITE LITERALLY , BY THE DAILY IGNORANCE AND CRUELTY AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE INFLICTED ON OUR COUNTRY, KAMALA HARRIS CAN TURN OUT AND INSPIRE THOSE VOTERS, TOO. THAT IS WHERE THE ELECTION WILL BE WON OR LOST. I WANT TO SEE KAMALA HARRIS ON A DEBATE STAGE SQUARING OFF AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY FOR DECADES AND I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SUPPORTING AND GETTING TO KNOW MANY FINE CANDIDATES. BUT I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU I HAVE NEVER, EVER FELT MORE STRONGLY ABOUT A CANDIDATE THAN I DO THIS TIME. BECAUSE WINNING WAS NEVER, EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAT IT IS THIS TIME. KAMALA HARRIS CAN WIN. IF WE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO NOMINATE HER, SHE WILL. FRIENDS, MY CHOICE, AND I HOPE YOURS, FOR OUR PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU PUBLICLY, AND I HOPE I DO OFTEN ENOUGH PRIVATELY, FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR YOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND THOSE WHO REALLY TAKE THAT CALLING SERIOUSLY, WHETHER THEY ARE IN ELECTED OFFICE OR NOT, THEY CONTINUE TO SERVE. YOUR WORDS AND YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR ADVICE, YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT MEAN THE WORLD TO ME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] GREETINGS TO ALL OF THE ELECTIVES THAT ARE HERE, I DON'T HAVE THE LIST, OTHERWISE I WOULD READ ALL OF YOUR NAMES. BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THESE YEARS, THESE LAST FEW YEARS AS A DEMOCRAT IN ELECTED OFFICE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING FOR MANY REASONS, BUT INCLUDED IN THAT IS WE WHO HOLD ELECTED OFFICE, OUR FRIENDS AND FELLOW DEMOCRATS WHO OFTEN LOOK IN OUR EYES AND SEARCH OUR EYES TO BE CONVINCED THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE OK. [LAUGHTER] THEY WANT US TO ENSURE THEM AND EVEN WHEN WE ARE WEARY AND TIRED AND SET UP, WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND CONTINUE TO INSPIRE, AND THE WORK OF THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE WORK OF HAVING , HAVING BEEN ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THE WORK OF UPLIFTING THE SENATOR. I CONGRATULATE YOU, BECAUSE TRULY THE WORK OF THE PARTY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE LOCAL CHAPTERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THAT IS WHAT IS HOLDING US UP AS A PARTY , NATIONALLY, AND FRANKLY, AS A COUNTRY. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU. EACH OF YOU VOLUNTEERS YOUR TIME. YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK. YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. THERE IS SO MUCH ATTACKING OUR DEMOCRACY, INCLUDING OUR ELECTIONS PROCESS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO. THE WORK YOU DO IS KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE WORK YOU DO IS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAMES. BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK, THEIR LIVES ARE BETTER AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPROVED. SO THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THIS , I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION, AND JOE, YOU SAID IT SO WELL, THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS DEMOCRATS , IF CHILDREN EVER ASK YOU, WHAT IS THE WELL, THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, IT IS ALWAYS AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION. AT ITS CORE, I THINK ONE OF THE BASIC POINTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE IS WE REALLY ARE FOR THE PEOPLE. WE REALLY ARE. WE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE. WE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAVE POWER, BUT THE POWER WE KNOW IS IN THEM. WE ARE A PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS ABOUT LIFTING PEOPLE UP. WE ARE A PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL SYSTEMS TO GIVE EACH INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY AND RESPECT. WE ARE THE PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS. AND WE ARE THE PARTY WHO WRITE DOWN, I BELIEVE, IS FIGHTING NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS, BUT FIGHTING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THESE UNITED STATES. JOE, AS YOU SAID, ALL OF US HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE REPUBLICANS, COLLEAGUES, PEOPLE WE ADORE AND LOVE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARTY , I DO BELIEVE IT IS OUR BURDEN AND ARE CALLING TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, AND I KNOW WE ARE UP TO IT. THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK THE QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING, WHO ARE WE? I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT WE WILL. AS WE KNOW OVER THESE LAST 2.5 YEARS, IT EXTENDS BACK TO THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE BEEN DESPONDENT. WE HAVE BEEN UPSET. WE HAVE BEEN ANGRY, WE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RANGE OF EMOTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME THAT WE MUST HOLD ONTO IS THE CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING THAT WHEN WE FIGHT, WE WIN. HERE IS THE THING , WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PLACE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW, WE MUST REMEMBER AS OVERWHELMED, AS UPSET AS WE MUST FEEL, WE ARE ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD FIGHT. [LAUGHTER] IN FACT, NOTHING WE HAVE ACHIEVED BY WAY OF SUCCESS IN OUR DEMOCRACY, AND FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY, HAS COME TO US WITHOUT A GOOD FIGHT , NOTHING. WE WERE BORN OUT OF A FIGHT AS A NATION. LET'S REMEMBER THAT. SOMETIMES I REFLECT ON MANY OF THE WISE ONES BEFORE US AND I WILL PARAPHRASE, BUT CARETTA SCOTT KING FAMOUSLY SAID THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, WHICH IS THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND FREEDOM, SHE SAID THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS MUST BE FOUGHT AND WON WITH EACH ITERATION. I THINK SHE HAD TWO POINTS WHEN SHE SAID THAT. ONE IS IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF THIS FIGHT THAT WHATEVER GAINS WE MAKE, THEY WILL NOT BE PERMANENT. IT IS THE NATURE OF IT. THE SECOND POINT IS, UNDERSTANDING IT IS THE NATURE OF IT, DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED. DO NOT THROW UP OUR HANDS WHAT IT IS TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF IT. IF I WERE TO OVERSIMPLIFY IT, WHEN YOUR NAILS START GROWING, I DON'T SAY OH MY GOD, MY NAILS ARE GROWING, YOU JUST CUT THEM. [LAUGHTER] RIGHT? WE HAVE A TEST BEFORE US. WE ARE UP FOR IT. WE ARE UP FOR THIS. WE ARE UP TO THE TASK OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, AND AS A COUNTRY, AND AS A PEOPLE. WE ARE UP FOR THIS. SO LET'S JUST GET OUT THERE AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING HISTORICALLY HERE IN PORTSMOUTH. HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF MY OWN PERSONAL BACKGROUND. WE ARE NOT ONLY A NATION OF FIGHTERS, I WAS BORN TO FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WITH A WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I JOKED THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. OF THE MANY HEROES OF THAT GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THERE WERE LAWYERS, PEOPLE LIKE THURGOOD MARSHALL AND THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SKILL OF THE PROFESSION OF LAW, TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND DO THE WORK WE KNOW MUST CONSTANTLY BE DONE OF REMINDING PEOPLE OF THE PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. THEY WERE THE HEROES OF MY CHILDHOOD. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER. IT WAS A COMMUNITY OF FIGHTERS. MY MOTHER WAS ALSO EXTRAORDINARY. SHE RAISED ME AND MY SISTER. MY MOTHER WAS A SCIENTIST. ONE OF THE VERY FEW AT THE TIME, AND STILL, WOMEN OF COLOR IN SCIENCE. HER SPECIALTY WAS BREAST CANCER RESEARCH. MY MOTHER HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE , TO RAISE HER DAUGHTERS AND AND BREAST CANCER. I RIVER HER COMING HOME AND FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH RIGHTS. FIGHTERS, WE ARE ALL BORN OF A NATION, AND MANY OF US PARENTS, WHO ARE FIGHTERS. MY MOTHER, SHE WAS A TOUGH COOKIE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY TO US, YOU WILL BE JUDGED BASED ON THE LIVES THAT YOU TOUCH AND THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE. IT WILL NOT BE ABOUT SELF-SERVICE. IT IS THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE AND LIFT UP. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY DON'T YOU EVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY TO ME MANY TIMES, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS, MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. [LAUGHTER] SHE WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME IN OUR HOUSE COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYTHING , HER MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU , SHE WAS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL, BY THE WAY. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. SHE WOULD LOOK AT YOU IF YOU ARE COMPLAINING AND WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND MAYBE ONE HAND ON HER HIP AND SAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE ARE ALL HERE FOR A SIMILAR REASON, BY THE WAY, WE ARE NOT TO SIT , WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO SIT AT HOME AND COMPLAIN. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT, THIS ELECTION, WHAT IS BEFORE US IN 2020. JOE TALKED ABOUT IT. YOU WERE INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT IN THE WAY YOU CONTEXTUALIZED IT. WE HAVE A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HAS DEBASED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I STARTED MY CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT EARL WARREN ONCE RAN. THE SYMMETRY IN TERMS OF MY LIFE IS I ACTUALLY STARTED MY CAREER IN THE OFFICE OF A GREAT AMERICAN WHO, WHEN HE WAS THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDED THE DESEGREGATION OF AMERICA'S SCHOOLS WAS SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IF WE ARE GOING TO BE TRUE TO THE VALUES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT HE SAID IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS NOT BE 55 , 5-4, 6-3, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE UNANIMOUS UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDE THIS CASE. THE COMMITMENT HE PUT INTO IT TO ENSURE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY WOULD DECIDE TO DESEGREGATE CLASSROOMS AND UNITED STATES. THE SYMMETRY OF THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED. HE DID THAT, WHICH ALLOWED ME TO STAND IN FRONT OF YOU AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE AD STATES. , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I WAS 22 WHEN I STARTED THAT WORK. I LEARNED THAT WITH THE SWIPE OF MY PEN I COULD CHARGE SOMEONE WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OFFENSE, AND BECAUSE OF THE SWIPE OF MY PEN, THAT PERSON COULD BE ARRESTED, THEY COULD SIT IN JAIL FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS, THEY COULD LOSE TIME FROM WORK AND THEIR FAMILY MIGHT LOSE THEIR JOB, THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HIRE A LAWYER, THEY WOULD LOSE STANDING IN THEIR COMMUNITY, ALL BECAUSE OF THE SWIPE OF MY PEN. WEEKS LATER, I COULD DISMISS THE CHARGES BUT THEIR LIFE WOULD FOREVER BE CHANGED. I LEARNED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE THE POWER, THE POWER TO IMPACT REAL HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE HOLD THESE OFFICES. I WAS JUST A LOWLY DEPUTY DA. WE HAVE A PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HOLDS THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO DOES NOT FULLY, OR EVEN PARTIALLY, UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE POWER. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. HE GOES AROUND SWINGING WHAT HE THINKS IS HIS POWER, BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POWERFUL. WHEN YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POWERFUL, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE GREATEST MEASURE OF YOUR STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. THIS IS THE NATURE AND THE CHARACTER OF THE GUY WE HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN, OF COURSE, HE CAME INTO OFFICE ON A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. FOR SOME OF US, THAT REQUIRED A QUESTION, FOR WHOM? FOR ALL OF US, IT MAY CLEAR, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SOMETHING. OF COURSE, WE ALL ASKED, BACK TO WHAT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING ACTS RIGHT? BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BACK BEFORE TITLE IX? BACK BEFORE FEDERAL NUMERAL WAGE? WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. THE POINT THAT WE ALL KNOW, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ORGANIZED HERE TONIGHT, RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT TO WHAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT MANY MONTHS. WE ALL KNOW, NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT GOING BACK, BUT IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE ON THIS GUY. IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE. YES, JOE, IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP AND IT WILL TAKE A PROSECUTOR TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE WORKING WITH A PRETTY GOOD RAP SHEET. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ON THAT SHEET. HE CAME INTO OFFICE MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES TO WORKING PEOPLE. HE SAID I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU. I HAVE YOU. WHAT IF HE DO? HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA, SADDLING US WITH A $1.5 TRILLION DEFICIT. THEY PLAN ON PAYING FOR THAT BY CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. WHAT DID HE DO? HE CAME IN SAYING I AM GOING TO HELP YOU, I AM GOING TO BUILD UP INFRASTRUCTURE. REMEMBER INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK? I GUESS WE ALL JUST SLEPT THAT WEEK BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER] HE CAME IN SAYING HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HEALTH CARE AND THEN HE TRIED TO UNDO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND IF NOT FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN JOHN MCCAIN, IT WOULD HAVE HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] HE CAME IN TALKING ABOUT HE WAS GOING TO HELP WORKING PEOPLE, FROM FARMERS TO AUTOWORKERS, AND THEN PASSES SOME KIND OF TRADE POLICY, AS HE CAUSED IT, TRADE POLICY BY TWEET, UNILATERAL ACTION BORN OUT OF A FRAGILE EGO, THAT HAS RESULTED IN FARMERS AROUND THE COUNTRY , I AM SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN IOWA, FARMERS IN IOWA WHO ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOYBEANS ROTTING IN BINS. OVER THE LAST DECADE OR MORE THEY BUILT UP A MARKET TO SELL TO CHINA THAT HAS BEEN CUT OFF FROM THEM. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR AUTOWORKERS TO BE OUT OF A JOB BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE AMERICAN FAMILY IS EXPECTED TO PAY $1000 MORE PER YEAR FOR EVERYTHING FROM CHILDREN'S TOYS TO WASHING MACHINES. I CALL IT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHAT IS ON THAT RAP SHEET? WE CAN LOOK AT THE FACT THERE IS A POLICY ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES, SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY, IN FACT WHAT IT WAS WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THERE IS PLENTY TO PROSECUTE THAT CASE, INCLUDING, MOST RECENTLY, JUST THIS WEEK, WHEN GUESS WHAT REPUBLICANS, IF YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE TAKING MONEY FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING HIM AND BEING APOLOGISTS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE THAT ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE FACT HE HAS TAKEN THEIR FEDERAL DOLLARS, INCLUDING MONEY FROM MILITARY FAMILIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS TO PAY FOR HIS VANITY PROJECT CALLED A WALL, WHICH BY THE WAY, GUYS, WE'LL NEVER GET BUILT. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, AND IN SO DOING TURN THE PAGE. WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO ALL OF THE FRIENDS HERE IS THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN THAT. IT HAS TO BE MORE THAN THAT. HERE IS THE THING, EVEN IF NOVEMBER OF 2016 TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY, WE WOULD STILL BE A NATION INFLUX AND A WORLD INFLUX. WE WOULD STILL BE LOOKING AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE SEEING ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD, SHIFTING POPULATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WHERE THERE IS DROUGHT THERE WILL BE FAMINE AND PEOPLE WILL MOVE TO PLACES THEY HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN, THAT SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND PRAY TO A DIFFERENT GOD, WHICH WILL RESULT IN CONFLICT, WHICH WILL RESULT IN WAR. WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT A MOMENT IN TIME OR WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A NATION AND A WORLD OF AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION. WE ARE A NATION IN FLUX AND A WORLD IN FLUX, AND THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS WHAT WILL BE OUR STANDING? WHAT IS OUR STRENGTH? WHAT WILL BE OUR DEFINITION AND ROLE IN THIS WORLD? THESE QUESTIONS ARE THE QUESTIONS I BELIEVE THAT ARE BEFORE US. TO MAKE THE POINT VERY SIMPLE ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE, AS YOU KNOW I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND NEVADA. I WAS IN NEVADA ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I ENDED UP HAVING AN EVENT THAT WAS TOWARD MY END OF TIME THERE IN LAS VEGAS ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, AND I WAS MAKING A POINT , THE POINT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE. I GOT A LITTLE CASUAL. THE POINT IS OBVIOUS, DUDE HAS GOT TO GO. [LAUGHTER] AT WHICH POINT, BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT WAS A SATURDAY NET IN LAS VEGAS, THE WHOLE CROWD STARTS CHANTING DUDE GOTTA GO. DUDE GOTTA GO IS AN OBVIOUS POINT. THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS AS WE TURN THE PAGE ON THAT POINT, THE ISSUE BEFORE US AS LEADERS IS WHAT WE MUST DO TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT , I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN AND WE AS DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN. IT HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT DEBATABLE BUT DO REQUIRE US TO ADDRESS. JOE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS ERA WHERE WE HAVE A LEADER WHO USED HIS POWER, AND WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT, IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT SEWING HATE AND DIVISION. HAVING US POINT FINGERS AT EACH OTHER. I STILL REJECT THAT. THIS IS A MOMENT WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. INSTEAD OF SOME DEMOCRAT SUGGESTING THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MIDWEST YOU HAVE ONE CONVERSATION AND WHEN YOU ARE IN NEW ENGLAND YOU HAVE ANOTHER. WHEN YOU GO DOWN SOUTH THAT IS A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. WE ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IF WE START DOING THAT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MUST DO IN WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, I BELIEVE WE MUST DO THAT WITH A SPIRIT THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS AGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WE MUST KNOW THAT, AND FEEL THAT, AND LET THAT MOTIVATE OUR PRIORITIES. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS HOW I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE, I KNOW IT BASED ON EVERY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE BASED ON THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT., SOME PEOPLE REFER TO THAT AS THE WITCHING HOUR. WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU. SOMETIMES IN A COLD SWEAT. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY FOR WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS , OUR PERSONAL HEALTH, HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OR PARENTS, FOR SUMMARY AMERICANS, CAN I GET A JOB, CAN I PAY THE BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH, CAN I RETIRE WITH DIGNITY, CAN I PAY OFF MY STUDENT LOANS, CAN I HELP MY FAMILY NEVER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? FOR SO MANY SENIORS, CANNOT EITHER FILL MY REFRIGERATOR MY PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE I CANNOT DO BOTH? THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR ROLE AS DEMOCRATS, AND AS LEADERS, NOT ONLY THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM, LEADERS OF OUR PARTY, BUT AS LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WOULD REMIND US THAT ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS IS WHEN WE APPROACH THE FIGHT BEFORE US IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT POINT AND THEN FIGHTING FOR THE COMMONALITY. A LARGE PART OF MY PRIORITIES ARE BORN OUT OF THAT. WHEN FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THAT MIGHT REALLY BE THE BEST STARTING POINT. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT WAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF US IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND LET'S ADDRESS THOSE IN A WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN A WAY THAT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND AMERICA. KAMALA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OK. IN AMERICA TODAY, MOST HALF OF FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. IN AMERICA TODAY, AND 99% OF THE COUNTIES IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. PEOPLE TOOK OUT LOANS FROM PAYDAY LENDERS AT AN EXCESS OF 300%. WHILE THIS GUY IS WALKING AROUND CROWING ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEING GREAT, AND YOU ASK HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE SO-CALLED GREATNESS OF THIS ECONOMY OF YOURS AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET, THAT IS FINE IF YOU OWN STOCKS. 72% OF THE STOCKS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE OWNED BY THE TOP 10%. WE SAID DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEASURE? THE TALK ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. YES, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY AND I WILL TELL YOU, INDEED, PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AS DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. WE HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT AS A PARTY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. I AM A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, AS ARE SO MANY OF US. THERE ARE THREE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC SAFETY, PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGE WE FACE AS A NATION, WHICH INCLUDES THE CHALLENGE TO COMPETE WITH OUR FRIENDS AND FOES AROUND THE GLOBE, LET'S FOCUS ON INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND REMEMBERING THAT ONE OF THE SMARTEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND LET'S START WITH PAYING OUR TEACHERS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PUT IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, $13,500 PER YEAR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT 13,500 DOLLARS PER YEAR MEANS FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY? IT IS A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERIES. PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT INTO STUDENT LOANS. I WANT TO MAKE A FINE POINT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. I STRONGLY BELIEVE, AND AS DEMOCRATS WE BELIEVE, SHOULD JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE THAT A SOCIETY CAN EXTEND TOWARD ITS CHILDREN IS TO INVEST IN THEIR EDUCATION, AND BY EXTENSION, THEIR TEACHERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. LET'S AGREE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VALUE OF OURS AS DEMOCRATS THAT HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, AT NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE FEW WHO CAN AFFORD IT. GOING BACK TO THE THREE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, IF WE ARE TO HAVE A THRIVING DEMOCRACY AND A THRIVING REPUBLIC, PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH MUST BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES. YET TODAY IN AMERICA, 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. PEOPLE SAY TO ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOUR MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A CARE FOR ALL, NOWHERE TAKES PLACE? IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, I PROPOSE WE HAVE A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN THAT BRINGS COSTS DOWN, THE COVERS EVERYONE, INCLUDING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND, THIS IS A POINT OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN MIND AND OTHERS, THAT GIVES PEOPLE CHOICE, SO YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF A MEDICARE PUBLIC PLAN OR MEDICARE PRIVATE PLAN. BUT LET'S ALSO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE, THAT IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT FOR SO LONG HAS BEEN IMPEDED BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS PRESIDENT WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE BACK POCKET OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THE GOVERNMENT WILL FIGHT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT PRIVATE INTEREST AND PROFIT. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND WE DID A TOWN HALL RECENTLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ROLLED OUT OUR CLIMATE PLAN, I WILL TELL YOU, AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT WE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, HAVE CREATED THIS CLIMATE CRISIS AND WE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, CAN SOLVE IT. WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE IN OUR LIFESTYLES. BUT IN A WAY THAT CAN HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT. I HAVE TWO BABY NIECES. ONE IS 1.5 YEARS OLD AND THE OTHER IS 3. WHEN I LOOK IN THEIR EYES, WHEN I WATCH THEM PLAY AND THEN I THINK ABOUT THE U.N. REPORT AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR IN TELLING US, AS SCIENCE TELLS US, IF BY 12 YEARS BY NOW WE DO NOTHING, IT WILL BE IRREVERSIBLE. I DON'T LIKE TO BLAME REPUBLICANS, IT IS TOO EASY, RIGHT? BUT ON THIS ISSUE, GUYS, HAVING BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE 2.5 YEARS, THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP IS PROFOUND. I KID YOU NOT, I JOINED THE UNITED STATES SENATE 2.5 YEARS AGO, I WAS PART OF A HEARING IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WHERE THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE HEARING WAS TO DEBATE WHETHER SCIENCE SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF PUBLIC POLICY. [LAUGHTER] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AND THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR, WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT CHILDREN MUST BE ABLE TO DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND NOT BE IMPEDED BY TOXIC CHEMICALS. WE MUST STAND UP TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE, AS DEMOCRATS, THAT ONE OF OUR FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE NATIONAL SECURITY. WE WILL AGREE THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLES OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS TO CONCERN HERSELF , [APPLAUSE] WITH OUR NATION AND HOMELAND SECURITY, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FACT OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE OF THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, AND JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERRED TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES THE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR, THE RANGE GOES FROM ALL THAT WE MUST DO AROUND REFORM OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO PASSING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, TO PAYING WOMEN EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK, I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST. CONTINUING TO FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, NOT BEING SATISFIED UNTIL EVERYONE HAS EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. I COULD GO ON AND ON. BUT I WILL END MY POINT WITH THIS. OVER THE LAST 2.5 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN, YES, DESPONDENT. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THROWING OBJECTS AT THAT INANIMATE OBJECT CALLED A TV. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH. WE MUST, IN THIS MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION AND A PEOPLE IS THAT WE, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AT ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE DECLARATION, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776. WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED, AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AS DEMOCRATS. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. FIGHT, WE WILL. AND FIGHT, WE MUST. KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORED OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING AND HAVING FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY AND THIS IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. THANK YOU.

HELLO, WHAT IS UP? IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH A BUNCH OF INCREDIBLE DEMOCRATS. HELLO, EVERYBODY! [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COME ON, WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. OH, THANK YOU. HELLO, EVERYONE. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE AMERICAN LEADERS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR ALL YOU DO OVER SO MANY YEARS, ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE TO INSPIRE ALL OF US AROUND THE COUNTRY. I AM HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU IN PARTICULAR FOR SENDING JEANNE SHAHEEN AND MAGGIE HASSAN TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. NEW HAMPSHIRE KNOWS HOW TO ELECT SOME REALLY STRONG WOMEN. [LAUGHTER] SO, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, I THINK WE ALL KNOW, THIS IS A VERY PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WHILE WE ARE ALL HERE WORKING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOLFING. SO, JUST DO THAT SPLIT SCREEN. [LAUGHTER] LET US JUST TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS LEADING, NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS, BUT ON BEHALF OF ALL AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME , I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH, AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY, TO LOOK IN A MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING , WHO ARE WE? AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERING] SO, THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT DEMOCRATS, WE WILL. , AND FIGHT, DEMOCRATS, WE WILL. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR US. I KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DESPOND AND, OVERWHELMED, FRUSTRATED, ANGRY , BUT LET US REMEMBER, EVERY GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AS A NATION CAME OUT OF A GOOD FIGHT. WE ARE UP FOR A GOOD FIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I COME FROM A FAMILY OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE 1960'S. MY SISTER AND I JOKE THAT WE WERE SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF ADULTS THAT SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS IN CALLED JUSTICE. FIGHTING, FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY. FIGHTING FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I WAS RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO IS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL BUT IF YOU HAD EVER MET HER YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. AND SHE WAS TOUGH. SHE WOULD SAY , KAMALA, YOU ARE GOING TO BE JUDGED ON THE LIFE OF SERVICE YOU LIVE. NOT SELF-SERVICE. BUT SERVICE TO OTHERS. BUT SHE WAS TOUGH. SHE WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, COMPLAINING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A STRAIGHT FACE, LAY ONE HAND ON HER HIP, AND SHE'D SAY, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A SECOND. BECAUSE THAT IS CONTEXT. WE'VE GOT A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO CAMPAIGNED ON A SLOGAN ABOUT \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\" WHICH FOR MANY OF US REQUIRES A QUESTION AGAIN EXACTLY FROM WHOM, AND FOR ALL OF US MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SOMETHING. BACK TO WHAT EXACTLY, WE ASKED. BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BACK BEFORE THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT? BACK BACK BEFORE TITLE IX? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING BACK! [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] SEN. HARRIS: HE CAME INTO OFFICE PROMISING PEOPLE ARE WHOLE LOT OF STUFF. HE PROMISED WORKING PEOPLE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HELP THEM. HE SAID MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, I AM GOING TO HELP YOU OUT, BUT NOW IT IS IN A RECESSION. WE ARE LOOKING AT A RECESSION. THE ONLY THING HE HAS MANUFACTURED IS CHAOS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD NUMBER OF GLOBAL CRISES THAT THIS GUY HAS GOT US INTO, THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING HE CAN CLAIM TO BE MADE IN THE USA. [APPLAUSE] HE PROMISED PEOPLE HE WOULD GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE, AND THEN SPENT FULL-TIME TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND NOW HAS A BUNCH OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY TRYING TO THE PROTECTIONS WE CREATED AGAINST PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PROTECTIONS WE CREATED SO OUR 26-YEAR-OLDS COULD BE ON HEALTH COVERAGE. HE MADE ALL KINDS OF PROMISES. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO KEEP FOLKS SAFE. LET ME TELL YOU, I SERVE ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, I MEET WITH A REGULAR BASIS WITH MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THIS GUY HAS GOT US ONE TWEET AWAY FROM WAR. [APPLAUSE] SEN. HARRIS: A SO-CALLED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO EMBRACES DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRUE SIGN OF STRENGTH IS NOT BASED ON WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT IS BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY. LET'S TALK ABOUT GUN SAFETY. HE SAYS HE WILL PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEN HE COWERS IN THE FACE OF THE N.R.A., AND WE CAN THANK GOVERNOR SUNUNU FOR TAKING SOME HEAT APPARENTLY AND THINKING THAT IS THE WAY SOME LEADERS SHOULD LEAD. NO, THAT IS NOT THE WAY LEADERS SHOULD LEAD. THE WAY LEADERS LEAD IS TO PROTECT OUR BABIES, BE THEM ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THEN SAY TO THEM, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ENDURE THOSE DRILLS, WE WILL PROTECT YOU. WE WILL STAND STRONG AGAINST THE N.R.A. AND PASS GUN SAFETY LAWS INCLUDING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL PROTECT OUR BABIES. THAT IS WHAT LEADERS DO. SO, HERE'S THE THING. WE HAVE HAD TO ENDURE SOME POWERFUL FORCES FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE. A PRESIDENT WHO IS TRYING TO SOW HATE AMONG US. BY SAY, DEMOCRATS, IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020 LET'S REMEMBER A COUPLE OF THINGS,. ONE, LET'S KNOW WHAT OUR HEARTS AND WITH OUR SOULS AND LET IT FUEL US, THAT IN THE FACE OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DIVIDE, WE AS DEMOCRATS KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, NO MATTER YOUR AGE, YOUR GENDER, NO MATTER THE GOD YOU LOVE OR PRAY TO, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW IT. I CALL IT THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAS NOT STUFF THAT HAS BEEN WAITING ON YOU. WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHICS THE POLLS PUT US IN. AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY, THEIR ABILITY TO GET AN EDUCATION AND THRIVE, OUR ABILITY TO PAY BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. SO LET IT FUEL US IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020. AND LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IS THAT WE BY OUR NATURE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS, PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE, FIGHT TO GET FAIR. AND THIS, THEN, IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM, OF A FIGHT BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING AND HAVING FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A FIGHT NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS, THAT WE WILL WIN.

WE HAVE VISITORS FROM KENTUCKY, WASHINGTON, DC AND ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE. AND TEXAS. AND WE HAVE MISSOURI. MY NAME IS SHANNON MCDONALD AND I LIVE IN WEST LIBERTY AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE ON STAGE IN SUPPORT OF KAMALA HARRIS AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE CAUCUSING FOR HER THIS YEAR THE IOWA CAUCUSES. I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PLACE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO REPRESENTS BOTH ME, MY DAUGHTER, AND MY COMMUNITY. IT IS TIME WE GIVE BACK RESPECT, EQUITY, AND INTELLIGENCE AT THE TOP. [APPLAUSE] WHERE WE TREAT PEOPLE JUSTLY, NOT BASED ON THEIR RACE, RELIGION ORIENTATION. AS SHE SET ON THE DEBATE STAGE, JUSTICES ON THE BALLOT. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO ELECT SOMEONE WHO WILL DO JUST THAT. SHE IS MY CHOICE AND I WILL SHARE MY VOICE FOR HER NOW AND AT THE CAUCUSES AND I HOPE YOU WILL TOO. AFTER DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED I SAW MY COMMUNITY, MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY FELT LIKE THEY NO LONGER HAD A VOICE. MOST OF THIS WAS IN PART BY THE RHETORIC THAT WAS HAPPENING AND REPEALING FORWARD THINKING POLICIES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT US IN THE FIRST PLACE. I FEEL LIKE WE NEEDED A LEADER WHO WAS STRONG, SMART AND WILL STAND UP IN THE FACE OF INJUSTICE AND SHE WILL SPEAK FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, SHE EMBODIES TAKING A STAND FOR WHAT'S RIGHT. SHE'S A CANDIDATE WILL FIGHT FOR ME, FIGHT FOR YOU AND OUR COMMUNITY. SHE HAS SHOWN US SHE WILL GO AGAINST INJUSTICE, NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE, ALL THE PEOPLE. AND THAT SHE CAN WIN ANY DEBATE. SHE IS SMART, COMMITTED AND READY AND WILLING TO PUT IN THE HARD WORK THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REUNITE US AS A NATION AND PUT US BACK ON THE TOP OF THAT LEADERBOARD. MY ENTIRE FAMILY WILL BE CAUCUSING FOR HER THIS ELECTION AND WE HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US IN THAT. GIVE A GREAT MIDWESTERN WELCOME AND ALL THE OTHER STATES TO A FEARLESS FIGHTER, SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA AND OUR FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,, HARRIS. , , KAMALA HARRIS. [APPLAUSE] THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT THIS MOMENT THAT IS TRULY ABOUT A FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY AND WHEN YOU DO WHAT YOU DO, BY BEING HERE THIS EVENING FOR THANKSGIVING WEEK AND THE SUMMONING OF THE THINGS YOU CAN BE DOING, IT SHOULD REMIND US THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY THE MATTER WHO'S TRYING TO TEAR US APART HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PEOPLE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PEOPLE AND THAT POWER AND WE REMEMBER THE POWER IS TRULY IN THE PEOPLE AND WHEN WE DO AND WHAT YOU DO THE KIND OF THINGS WE ARE DOING, BE OUT THERE AND BE ACTIVE, IT'S A SIGN, IT'S A BAROMETER THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS HEALTHY AND ALIVE. LET'S REMEMBER THAT AND THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING PART OF IT. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A FEW OF MY THOUGHTS AND SOME OF MY PLANS AND I WILL PASS ON THE MICROPHONE. BUT TRULY I DO BELIEVE WE ARE IN A FIGHT. WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. I THINK WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR RULE OF LAW. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WE JUST ALL WATCH THIS WEEK OF HEARINGS AND ADJUSTED A BUNCH OF PRESS INTERVIEWS AND I EXPLAINED ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS THAT WE SHOULD ALL LEAVE WITH IT THE END OF THIS WEEK, A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, THAT THERE ARE REALLY GREAT PEOPLE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, CAREER PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I'M THE ONLY PERSON ON THE DEBATE STAGE RESERVES IN THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THERE ARE GREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THE SERVICE OF OUR NATION AND THEY WERE ON DISPLAY THIS WEEK. THE SECOND TAKE AWAY HIS THERE'S CLEARLY A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE OF FOOT. WHAT BECAME EXPOSED AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS IS WE NEED TO HAUL INTO CONGRESS IN HERE FROM ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE CLEARLY IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, BUT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF. AND THEN THERE IS RUDY WHO THINKS , I THINK RUDY NEEDS TO REMIND HE'S A LAWYER AND HAS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. [LAUGHTER] SO THERE IS A FIGHT IN FRONT OF US. A FIGHT FOR ALL THESE THINGS WE HOLD DEAR AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT MAKE US STRONG. WE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT WITH THAT. THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW ARE WE GOING TO WIN? BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT AND KNOW HOW TO WIN AND WE LIKE TO WIN. IT'S A WIN I BELIEVE, WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE. OF OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE RIGHT NOW IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN DONALD TRUMP. SO WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE AND KNOWING THAT, PREENED BACK YESTERDAY IS KNOCKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TOMORROW. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE GAINED SOME TRACTION IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US AND WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS. REMINDING PEOPLE THAT WITHIN THE BEAUTY OF THIS DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THEN WHAT SEPARATES US AND TO WIN, WE WILL NEED SOMEONE ON THAT DEBATE STAGE WHO CAN GO TOE TO TO AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER. [APPLAUSE] SO WE NEED TO WIN. WE NEED TO DO THIS IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE AND SO THIS IS A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE. AND AS MANY OF YOU MIGHT KNOW, I STARTED MY CAREER , MY SISTER AND I GREW UP AROUND FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR JUSTICE. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL MY MOM AND MY SISTER SAID WHAT YOU CAN IT DO IN YOUR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND I SAID I'VE DECIDED I'M TO BE A PROSECUTOR BECAUSE I WANT TO GO INSIDE OF A SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE WORK OF JUSTICE BUT HAS OFTEN DONE THE WORK OF INJUSTICE AND BE ABLE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE I CAN AFFECT REFORM BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE A VOICE FOR THE VULNERABLE. AND SO I STARTED MY CAREER, THE FIRST DAY WALKING INTO A COURTROOM SAYING FIVE WORDS, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT PHRASE FOR THE PEOPLE REALLY IN TWO WAYS I BELIEVE IS THE SYSTEM OF OUR JUSTICE. ONE, IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WE HAVE RIGHTLY SAID A HARM AGAINST ANYONE OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US AND IN THAT WAY WE SAY AND THEREFORE NO ONE SHOULD BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. FOR THE PEOPLE, IT MEANS ALL THE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE OR GENDER, REGARDLESS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY, REGARDLESS OF THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS. IT'S ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE AND SO I STARTED THIS CAREER IN A COURTROOM ON SPECIALIZING FOR YEARS ON TRYING TO GET , HELP WOMEN AND CHILDREN, KNOWING THEY DESERVE A VOICE THAT GAVE THEM STRENGTH AND DIGNITY WITHOUT JUDGMENT. FOR THE PEOPLE, I WAS ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND CREATED INITIATIVES THAT WERE ABOUT SAYING THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS A FANTASY THAT LED TO AMERICA'S SHAME OF MASS INCARCERATION AND SO I STARTED PROGRAMS THAT BECAME NATIONAL MODELS AROUND BRINGING JOBS TO PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL , ATTORNEY GENERAL CALIFORNIA AND THERE I TOOK ON THE FIVE BIG BANKS THE UNITED STATES WHO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY LENDING BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY THE COST , CAUSED FORECLOSURES RATHER COUNTRIES WHERE WORKING FAMILIES LOST THEIR HOMES AND IN THAT BATTLE BROUGHT $20 BILLION BACK TO THE STATE ARE REPRESENTED. AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TAKING ON JEFF SESSIONS AND BILL BARR AND BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THOSE WHO NEED TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND TELL THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT I STAND HERE AND PREPARE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN THERE IS A FATHER AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY WHO IS SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AFTER EVERYONE HAS GONE TO SLEEP AND HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW EVEN THOUGH HE IS WORKING TWO JOBS, HE CAN BARELY GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH AND HE KNOWS HE IS PAYING HIGHER TAXES THAN THE 400 RICHEST FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE THE LARGEST MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT WE'VE HAD IN GENERATIONS, WHICH IS HER FAMILY THAT MAKE LESS THAN $1000 YEAR THEY WILL GET A TAX CREDIT SO THEY CAN TAKE HOME AT $500 A MONTH. PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE YOU TO PAY FOR THAT, THAT'S REALLY SIMPLE. ON DAY ONE WE WILL REPEAL THAT TAX BILL. [APPLAUSE] WHEN IN AMERICA ON ANY GIVEN DAY THERE IS A MOM WHOSE CHILD HAS A FEVER THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL SO SHE GOES TO THE HOSPITAL AND SHE IS LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM BUT DOESN'T WANT TO WALK IN BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, SHE KNOWS IF SHE KNOWS IF YOU WALK THROUGH THOSE DOORS SHE WILL BE OUT OF POCKET. HEALTH CARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY WE NEED MEDICARE FOR ALL, NOT SOME, BUT ALL. I WILL TELL YOU MY PLAN IS A BIT DIFFERENT FOR MY FRIENDS ON THE DEBATE STAGE. YES I'M GOING TO BRING DOWN COSTS, I WILL GET RID OF CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES BUT I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES AND I WON'T TAKE AWAY YOUR CHOICE. I'VE HEARD FROM TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE IS CAN BE COVERED, I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, EXTENDING BENEFITS TO INCLUDE VISION AND HEARING AND DENTAL. THEY ARE JUST SO EXPENSIVE. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET. SO DOING ALL THAT BUT THE POINT BETWEEN MY PLAN A COUPLE OF FOLKS ON THE STAGE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO GET TO THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES, THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ANYTHING CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND THEY NEED TO COMPETE IN OUR SYSTEM BUT I WON'T TAKE AWAY YOUR CHOICE. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN IN AMERICA WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT TEACHERS, TEACHERS HERE IN IOWA AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO TRY AND GET THROUGH THE MONTH WHEN 94% OF THE TEACHERS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. WHEN TEACHERS ARE ASKED TO MAKE 11% LESS THAN OTHER EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. EDUCATION JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] I'M RUNNING TO PUT IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY FEDERAL INVESTMENT AND CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. WHICH NATIONALLY IS $13,500 A YEAR. THAT'S A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS OR GROCERY BILLS OR PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. I'M HERE TO SAY TO BETSY , BETSY DEVOS BY THE WAY, TEACHERS DON'T NEED A GUN. [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN OUR BABIES, I WAS RAISED IN A COMMUNITY TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE, I WAS RAISED IN A COMMUNITY TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY. SO WHEN OUR BABIES ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE ENTICE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL TO ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY ARE TAUGHT HOW TO HIDE IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOLS, JUSTICE FOR OUR CHILDREN. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE COURAGE IN LEADERSHIP TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY AND AM GOING TO GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS WHAT LEGISLATION ON MY DESK AND IF THEY DO NOT AND THIS IS A PRIORITIZATION, I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION A COPPERHEADS A BACKGROUND CHECK BEHIND THIS. [APPLAUSE] THERE HAVE BEEN POLICIES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN BABIES BEING PUTTING CAGES AND PARENTS SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES. JUSTICE FOR IMMIGRANTS IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN SO MANY WAYS THAT GO TO THE LIST. THE NEED TO REFORM A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHAT WE MUST DO IN TERMS OF FOCUSING ON THE VARIOUS SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, LEGISLATIVE AND STATES AROUND OUR COUNTRY PUTTING IN PLACE LAWS THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE POSITION FOR ASSISTING A WOMAN WITH EXERCISING THE CHOICE THAT SHE RIGHTLY HAS TO MAKE OVER HER OWN BODY. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE ALL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE ARE VERY MUCH FRONT AND CENTER AND AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION IN 2020. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, AND THIS IS HOW I FEEL DEEPLY, IS WHEN WE OVERCOME THESE VARIOUS INJUSTICES, I DO BELIEVE IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE THE PROTECTION , POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK AMERICA'S PROMISE. THAT WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO THAT IS THE AMERICA IC , I SEE. WHEN I'M RUNNING. AND I'M LITERALLY RUNNING. THAT'S WHAT I'M RUNNING TO. THAT IS WHAT I TRULY CAN SEE. SO THAT IS OUR GOAL AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I WILL JUST MAKE A FINAL POINT, WHICH IS , I'VE BEEN IN THE CAMPAIGN NOW OVER 10 MONTHS AND IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION THERE IS BEEN A CONVERSATION, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, BUT IT'S THE DONKEY IN THE ROOM, AND IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT ELECTABILITY. LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR A MOMENT. SO THE CONVERSATION GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF AMERICA IS READY FOR A WOMAN OF COLOR TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL I'M READY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE NEIGHBORS ARE READY. PEOPLE SAY MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR TURN, MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR TIME. I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, THIS IS NOT A NEW CONVERSATION FOR ME. IT'S A CONVERSATION I'VE HEARD IN EVERY CAMPAIGN I'VE HAD AND WON. [APPLAUSE] I SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME BUT TO SAY EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND IOWANS KNOW THIS, BECAUSE PARTICULARLY YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER, IN HAVING THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE EVEN WHEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE. HAVING THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED. I WILL TELL YOU A QUICK STORY. I'M BEEN A SHARE ONE STORY I'VE GOT WITCHES BEFORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I SPENT TIME IN IOWA, PARTICULARLY A WEEK BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S IN 2007. AND I WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR A CERTAIN SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND OF COURSE, WHATEVER WAS NEEDED. IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT FOR BOTH CAUCUSES AND THEY WENT TO THE HEADQUARTERS TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE. I SAID THERE'S A SENIOR RESIDENTIAL HOME IN DES MOINES, NO ONE HAS BEEN THERE YET. IT'S THE CORINTHIAN GUARDIANS , GARDENS SENIOR HOME. CAN YOU GO? AND I SAID OF COURSE. I STARTED KNOCKING ON DOORS AND INVARIABLY SOME LADY WOULD ASK AND SAY , ANSWER AND SAY COME ON IN, ARE YOU HUNGRY? [LAUGHTER] AND THEN I KNOCKED ON THIS ONE DOOR AND THE LADY ANSWERED THE DOOR AND SHE COULDN'T BEEN MORE THAN FIVE FEET, SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE ANSWERED THE DOOR IN THIS PERFECTLY COIFFED WIG AND PERFECT MAKEUP, THIS ELEGANT OUTFIT, I DON'T THINK SHE WAS EXPECTING ANYBODY. I SAID HI, I'M KAMALA HARRIS AND I'M HERE IN THE CAUCUS TOMORROW AND WILL YOU COME OUT AND JOIN AND SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM WIN. AND THEN I SAW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. THIS LADY IN ALL OF HER 85 PLUS YEARS AND WHAT SHE HAS EXPERIENCED AND WITNESSED IN TERMS OF INDIGNITY AND INJUSTICE. AT THIS STAGE OF HER LIFE, SHE WASN'T ABOUT TO VISIT ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT ON HERSELF. SO TO MYSELF I SAID I'M NOT LEAVING HERE AND I STAYED AND I TALKED WITH HER AS SHE TALKED MORE WITH ME AND OPENED THE DOOR A BIT MORE. AND GUESS WHO SHOWED UP AT THE CAUCUS THE NEXT NIGHT AND GUESS WHO WON? SO WHAT WE ARE REQUIRING IS FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY BELIEVE AND KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE. IN CANDOR WE ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS NOT 2007 OR 2008. WE HAVE GOT INTERVENING FACT WHICH IS THAT AWFUL NIGHT IN NOVEMBER OF 2016, IT'S AWFUL. AND IT LINGERS AND THERE WERE SO MANY WHO WORKED SO HARD. IT WAS JOSH OUT OF LOVE AND COUNTRY AND BELIEF THAT WE COLLECT A FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT AND SOME THE OTHER REASONS BELIEVED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HER. AND THEN EXPERIENCED THE GRIEF THAT MANY EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT. THAT IS AN INTERVENING FACT. I AM CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT CAMPAIGN WHO ARE SAYING TODAY MAYBE AMERICA IS NOT READY YET. I KNOW THAT. I AM REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO. I AM REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. BUT HERE IS THE THING. THERE IS NOTHING THAT OUR NATION HAS ACHIEVED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT PROGRESS, BE IT SOCIAL JUSTICE, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR FIGHT FOR EQUALITY, THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT PROGRESS THAT CAME WITHOUT A FIGHT. NOTHING. WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. WE LIKE A GOOD FIGHT. WE WERE BORN OUT OF A FIGHT, AND IT IS THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE THAT WE NEVER SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE US PERMISSION TO TELL US WHAT IS POSSIBLE. WE MAKE IT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE AND SO WHEN OTHERS CAN'T SEE IT AND IN PARTICULAR , WHEN OTHERS CAN SEE IT, IN PARTICULAR IOWA, YOU SEE IT AND YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN. IT IS THAT EXACT SPIRIT THAT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE AMERICA WE CAN SEE, THE AMERICA WE CAN SEE AND BELIEVE IN WHERE EVERYONE HAS HEALTH CARE, THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE TREAT OUR CHILDREN WITH THE RESPECT AND THE NURTURING THEY DESERVE SO THEY CAN GO TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND FEEL SAFE. THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE RESPECT IMMIGRANTS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. BY THE WAY, UNLESS YOU ARE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR AND CHESTER'S WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOU PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THIS IS OUR FIGHT NOW. IT'S IN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHERE WE KNOW THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB WHETHER ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND ULTIMATELY FOR ME IT IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THAT WHEN WE APPROACH A PERFECT STRANGER AND IN THEIR FACE WE SEE A NEIGHBOR. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE ARE FIGHTING FOR AND I BELIEVE WE WILL WIN. THANK YOU, GUYS. [APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS KEN JONES FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS. I DROVE UP HERE TO WORK FOR YOU, I'M WORKING OUT OF THE DAVENPORT OFFICE AND WHEN I'M DOING MY LITTLE TESTAMENT OF YM FOR YOU I TELL THEM ONE WORD, INSULIN. I'M AN INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETIC, A RETIRED TEACHER ON PENSION AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND I WANT YOU TO BE ELECTED SO YOU CAN GET IN THERE AND FIGHT FOR US. THE OTHER THING, I AM TIRED OF BEING THE ONLY PERSON ON FACEBOOK THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SELFIE WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU, KEN. THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY TRAVELING FOR THE CAMPAIGN, BUT THAT'S THE STRENGTH OF OUR CAMPAIGN. SUPPORTING THAT KIND OF WORK. INSULIN. EVERYBODY MIGHT KNOW THIS, ONE IN FOR DIABETES PATIENTS IN AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN. A VIAL OF INSULIN IN AMERICA CAN COST OVER $300. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED HOW MUCH IT COSTS IN CANADA. ABOUT $30. SO ONE SHOULD SIT BACK AND ASK HOW IS IT THAT AMERICAN DRUG COMPANIES ARE CHARGING AMERICANS MORE FOR THE SAME DRUG THEN THEY CHARGE FOR PATIENTS IN CANADA AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE GLOBE? HOW CAN THAT BE? IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IN THE POCKET OF THESE DRUG COMPANIES PER , COMPANIES. THEY STAND BY AND WATCH OUR OWN PEOPLE BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME DRUG BY AMERICAN COMPANIES. SO WHEN I SAY HEALTH CARE JUSTICES ON THE BALLOT, IT'S ABOUT MY MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO DO SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND DRUG PRICES. ANOTHER POINT OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN ME AND A FEW PEOPLE ON THAT STAGE. MINE IS A CAREER OF ACTUALLY WORKING ON THINGS AND GETTING THEM DONE. THERE ARE VERY FEW POP , VERY FEW TOPICS OF DISCUSSION ON WHICH I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY WORKED AND I DON'T MEAN GIVING A SPEECH OR SUBMITTED A BILL THAT MAY OR MAY NOT GET PAST. ACTUALLY WORKED ON IT. ON THIS I'VE TAKEN ON THE DRUG COMPANIES WHEN I WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE CAL , OF CALIFORNIA AND I WON. I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND I KNOW THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. SO MY PLAN ON THE ISSUE OF DRUG PRICES IS AS FOLLOWS. WE WILL SET DRUG PRICES BASED ON FAIR MARKET. SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE WILL DO IS VISIT THE WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE DOCUMENT, BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE WILL DO IS SET DRUG PRICES SO THAT AMERICAN CONSUMERS ARE CHARGED A PRICE FOR THE DRUG THAT IS THE AVERAGE PRICE BEING CHARGE AROUND THE GLOBE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE, INSULIN BEING AN EXAMPLE. THE OTHER THING IS THIS. IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE WITH THAT, I'M ALSO GOING TO DO THE NEXT THING WHICH IS THIS, A LOT OF DRUGS, PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, WAS BORN OUT OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THAT DRUG. YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO FOR ANY DRUG WHERE THEY FAIL TO PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES AND IF THE DRUG CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WHAT IS CALLED RND, I WILL SNATCH THEIR PATENT SO THAT WE WILL TAKE OVER. YES WE CAN DO THAT. YES WE CAN DO THAT. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT? I HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT. THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT THAT AS AN ISSUE AND IT JUST REPRESENTS FOR ME THE BIGGER ISSUE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE , SENIORS IN IOWA TAKING BUSES TO CANADA TO GET THEIR PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. SENIORS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE SPLITTING PILLS. THE DOCTOR HAS PRESCRIBED YOU TAKE THE WHOLE PILL AND PEOPLE ARE TAKING HALF OR A QUARTER TO EXTEND THE PRESCRIPTION WHICH IS RESULTING IN OBVIOUS OUTCOMES BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE. SO WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HEALTH CRISES BECAUSE MOST THINGS AROUND HEALTH CARE IF NOT GRADUALLY , PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY ARE SPLITTING THEIR PILL. SENIORS ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT FILLING THE REFRIGERATOR OR FILLING THEIR PRESCRIPTION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY FROM TC, WE DO NOT HAVE A VOTE IN CONGRESS AND WE'VE NEVER HAD AND SO WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH SO MANY OTHER CANDIDATES, WE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY PRETTY MUCH, WE'VE SEEN YOU AND SENIOR REP , IN CEDAR RAPIDS AND WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS WILL YOU SUPPORT D.C. STATEHOOD? ABSOLUTELY. AND HERE'S THE THING. I WENT TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY. LET ME TELL YOU I'M REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IT'S UNFAIR, STATE TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. I'M MY NAME IS SARAH, I'M A TEACHER ALSO WORKING ANOTHER JOB WITH A LOT OF MY COWORKERS AND I DO. I'M JUST TIRED OF WAKING UP A FEW TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SCARED TO GO TO SCHOOL. I'M TIRED OF MY STUDENTS COMING TO SCHOOL AND BEING AFRAID, BEING AFRAID IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS AT NIGHT AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND PLAY. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF TRUMP, BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY TO MITCH MCCONNELL SO THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY START TO CHANGE AND THERE ARE NO MORE SANDY HOOK'S AND COLUMBINE'S. SO WHAT EVERYONE HEARD IS WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND OUR NATION AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT. OUR KIDS ARE TRAUMATIZED. JUST DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHO'S IN THE ROOM, THE MAJORITY IN THIS ROOM ARE OVER THE AGE OF 20, BUT IF YOU TALK TO ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF 20 REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE, HIGH SCHOOL, MIDDLE, OR REALM ENTRY SCHOOLS, THEY HAVE THE ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILL ON A CONSISTENT BASIS WHERE LITERALLY, AND I WANT TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR EVERYBODY, WHERE LITERALLY THEY ARE TAUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IN TERMS OF HIDING IN A CLOSET, CROUCHING IN A CORNER. I WAS TALKING WITH ONE STUDENT, I SAID TELL ME WHAT IT'S LIKE. SHE SAID WE DO IT IN EVERY CLASS, BUT I KIND OF HOPE WHEN THE SHOOTER COMES I'M NOT IN THIS ONE CLASSROOM BECAUSE IT IS NEAR THE STAIRWELL AND SO I OFTEN THINK WHEN I'M IN THAT CLASS I HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE. I WOULD PREFER TO BE IN ANOTHER CLASSROOM BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG CLOSET IN THAT. SHE WENT ON TO SAY I LIKE WHAT THIS OTHER TEACHER OF MINE SAID BECAUSE SHE HAS A BUNGEE CORD SO SHE WILL KIND OF PUT THE FILE CABINET WITH A BUNGEE CORD AGAINST THE DOOR SO NOBODY CAN BREAK IN. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY I CANNOT TELL YOU THE NUMBER , USUALLY A CHILD BETWEEN EIGHT AND 10 WHO COMES UP TO ME AFTER AND WILL PULL MY JACKET LIKE IT'S A SECRET BETWEEN US AND WILL SAY I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE DRILLS TOO. I'VE MET ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS, INCLUDING TEACHERS AT EVERY LEVEL WHO DURING TEACHER ORIENTATION BEFORE CLASSES STARTED, A BIG PART OF THEIR ORIENTATION WAS BEING TAUGHT AND TRAINED ON HOW TO TACKLE A GUNMAN. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO TELL ME PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRAINED IS , THIS ONE TEACHER SAID I SHOULD KEEP RED LOLLIPOPS ON ME. SHE SAID FOR THE YOUNGEST KIDS WE NEED TO KEEP THEM QUIET. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO MITCH MCCONNELL AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WHO ARE FRANKLY FECKLESS. [APPLAUSE] IS THAT THESE BABIES, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COULD CARE LESS WHO THEIR PARENTS VOTED FOR IN THE LAST ELECTION. COULD CARE LAST , COULD CARE LESS. THOSE BULLETS CERTAINLY CARE LESS. AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE OPPONENTS IN THE RACE HAVE SAID SHE'S GONNA TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A REPUBLICAN WHO COMES IN AFTER. I WILL DEAL THE , I WILL DEAL WITH THAT IN EIGHT YEARS. WE NEED ACTION. WE NEED ACTION. [APPLAUSE] I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU, THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING IN THIS PROFESSION, PART OF MY PLAN ON EDUCATION, MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. I LOVE TEACHERS. THE BLESSING OF AN INCREDIBLE MOTHER AND FAMILY AND INCREDIBLE TEACHERS PUT ME ON THIS STAGE. AND MY FOCUS IS A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING THIS BUT ALSO I WILL MAKE SURE WE HAVE A NURSE AND SOCIAL WORKER IN EVERY SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] AND ALSO DOING ALL THE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO HONOR OUR TEACHERS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH IT IN SPITE OF ALL THE OBSTACLES IN YOUR WAY. SOME OF THE MOST NOBLE AND WONDERFUL HUMAN BEINGS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT HOUSING. WOULD YOU SHARE WITH US YOUR PLATFORM AND BEFORE YOU DO , ALL OF THEM ARE WAITING FOR THEIR PICTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT HOUSING AND I NEVER THOUGHT MY CITY WOULD BECOME UNAFFORDABLE BUT IT HAS AND IT HAS COST A LOT OF MONEY TO LIVE IN KANSAS CITY. THERE ARE REGIONS OF IOWA WITH THE SAME ISSUE, ALL OVER. IT IS SOMETHING WHERE THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS THE TOPIC, IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF , I PUT IT ON MY SHORT LIST OF THINGS WE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT. THE OTHER ONE IS MENTAL HEALTH. IT IS DRIVING ME BANANAS. ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WHICH WE RIGHTLY MUST HAVE, IT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THE BODY STARTS AT THE NECK DOWN. EVERYTHING WE NEED FROM THE NECK UP IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. PEOPLE ARE QUIETLY, SILENTLY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION, FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND WE ARE PUTTING NO RESOURCES INTO IT. IT IS AFFECTING EVERYONE FROM FARMERS TO VETERANS, TO CHILDREN. YOU TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE IS VIOLENCE, LET'S BE CLEAR, GROWING UP IN POVERTY IS TRAUMA INDUCING AND WHAT WE ARE DOING TO NOT , THAT IS A PART OF MY PLAN, AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I ACTUALLY JUST ROLLED OUT PART OF OUR POLICY TODAY WHICH IS ABOUT $100 BILLION INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT ALSO HAVING A PLAN FOR HOMELESSNESS THAT IS CONNECTED. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE, AND 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN AMERICA, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. ONE OF THE ISSUES ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THE FACT THAT IT IS AN OVERALL ISSUE, WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING. THIS BECOMES HIGHLIGHTED ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DIGNITY, MUCH LESS THE SECURITY OF ANYONE, LIKE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. IT COMES UP ONLY TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE, WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING. CHILDCARE IN MANY PLACES IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN COLLEGE TUITION. AFFORDABLE HOUSING, $100 BILLION TO PUT INTO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S ABOUT FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE WAGES TO AFFORD WHAT IS THERE BUT ALSO TO HAVE MORE SUPPLY. MY PLAN INCLUDES GREATER PARTNERSHIPS WITH BUILDING TRADES, UNIONS, SO PLUMBERS AND PIPE FITTERS AND CARPENTERS ARE BUILDING IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE SKILLS TO ACQUIRE TO TAKE THE JOB, BUILDING THE HOUSING IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TALKS ABOUT THIS STUFF BUT AS WITH EVERY POLICY THEY HAVE, IT IS SELF-SERVING. THEY TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, POLICIES THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS ARE ABOUT PUTTING MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF DEVELOPERS AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING THE MONEY IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT IS HOW I LOOK AT THE ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR RAISING IT. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS ATTENDED A HOUSE PARTY SUNDAY AT A RESIDENCE IN KNOXVILLE, IOWA. LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS AT 12:20 P.M.

AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, SO YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. CREATED BY CABLE IN 1979, C-SPAN IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY YOUR LOCAL CABLE OR SATELLITE PROVIDER. C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS WAS CAMPAIGNING THIS WEEKEND IN IOWA FOR THE DEMOCRATIC'S EVENTUAL NOMINATION. WE FOLLOWED HER AS WE , AS SHE SPOKE WITH VOTERS AT A HOUSE PARTY HOSTED AT THE RESIDENCE OF A COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR IN KNOXVILLE, IOWA. SHE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY. AS THE EVENT WAS ENDING, SHE TALKED WITH YOUNG VOTERS ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY AND GUN CONTROL. HELLO, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME. WE ARE HERE, SO WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU AND WELCOME TO SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. I AM THE MARION COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHAIR. AS YOU ALL KNOW, I RAN FOR OFFICE AND THEN RAN FOR SCHOOL BOARD AND FAILED, BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP IT UP. [APPLAUSE] MS FIELDS: I KNOW ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. WHEN I WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE, WE MOVED. OUR TOWN WAS WELL-KNOWN FOR GIRLS BASKETBALL, AND IN THE NEW TOWN THERE WAS NO GIRLS BASKETBALL. WE GOT 1000 SIGNATURES AND THE SCHOOL BOARD SAID, NO GIRLS BASKETBALL. WE HAD NO GIRLS SPORTS UNTIL AFTER TITLE IX. MY YOUNGER SISTER, EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER, SHE IS IN THE WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC HALL OF FAME. I DID NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I ALSO WAS A FARMER'S WIFE AND I WENT TO SIGN UP OUR FARM WITH THE USDA. USDA SAID YOU CAN'T SIGN IT UP. DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF YOUR NAME IS ON THE MORTGAGE. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE THAT YOU FARM WITH YOUR HUSBAND. YOU CANNOT SIGN UP YOUR FARM. ANOTHER DISCRIMINATION. I HAVE FOUGHT DISCRIMINATION MY WHOLE LIFE, AS A WOMAN, AS A FARMER. I THINK KAMALA HARRIS HAS ALSO HAD SOME OF THOSE EXPERIENCES. SHE WAS IN DESEGREGATION AND WAS BUSSED AND SHE FACED DISCRIMINATION. SHE HAS FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE, TOO. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. NOT FOR THE RICH, NOT FOR CALIFORNIA, IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT HER MESSAGES AND THAT'S WHY I INVITED HER TO MY HOME, SO YOU COULD HEAR HER MESSAGE. SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE LOUDEST, SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST ABRASIVE , [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ANN. WHAT A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. THIS IS WHAT YOU DO ALWAYS AND I KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU. SOME OF US LEAD IN ELECTED OFFICE AND THERE ARE LEADERS WHO ARE LEADERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO BY NATURE AND COMMITMENT. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE, AND I AM SO THANKFUL TO YOU FOR OPENING YOUR HOME ON THIS SUNDAY THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ON A SNOWY MORNING. THANK YOU. IF WE COULD PLEASE APPLAUD , [APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU ALL ON THIS MORNING. IT IS SUCH A WONDERFUL MORNING TO STAY HOME. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I AM GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF MY THOUGHTS AND SOME OF MY PLANS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ABOUT ANYTHING. I WILL START AT THE VERY BEGINNING. THIS ELECTION PRESENTS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE AT STAKE. THEY INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY, FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR RULE OF LAW, AND A FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. THINKING ABOUT THAT, AS ONE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHENEVER THERE IS A FIGHT, HOW ARE WE GOING TO WIN? I THINK TO WIN WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT THIS IS A MOMENT , WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BE LOUDER? KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN A FIGHT, THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THE REALITY IS THAT THE FIGHT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN DONALD TRUMP. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. THAT , IT IS OBVIOUS AND WE CAN GO ON AND I WILL TALK SOME ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE AND I THINK WE BELIEVE TO BE FAILING AND THE DAMAGE HE HAS DONE , BUT THIS IS ALSO A MOMENT THAT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT TURNING THE PAGE ON THAT, BUT A MOMENT WHERE WE MUST WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND DOING THAT ON A WAY THAT IS FOCUSED IN THE INVESTMENT OF THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. TO DO THAT AND TO WIN, I DON'T BELIEVE THE SOLUTION IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YESTERDAY CAN CURE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW. WE HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON GOING FORWARD, ON RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL OF OUR STUDENTS, THAT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKING PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GROW THEIR FAMILIES, TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING LAID OFF, THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES INTO THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSITION TO THE JOBS THAT MUST BE FILLED. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING, BUT I BELIEVE TO WIN, WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. ANN SAID PART OF THIS. LIKE IT OR NOT, THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US, AND THEY HAVE TAKEN HOLD TO SOME EXTENT. THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THAT. THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET US TO POINT ANGERS ON EACH OTHER AND TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO FIGHT AGAINST THAT IS TO DO IT WITH A SPIRIT OF KNOWING IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR SOULS THAT THE FACT IS, WITHIN THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND TO WIN, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS OUR NOMINEE WHO CAN STAND ON THAT STAGE AND GO TOE TO JOE WITH DONALD TRUMP , GO TOE TO TOE WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND I BELIEVE I AM THAT CANDIDATE. AS ANN SAID, THIS IS ABOUT A FIGHT, AS IT HAS BEEN MY ENTIRE CAREER, FOR THE PEOPLE. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I JOKE WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS SPENT THEIR FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR JUSTICE. AMONG THE HEROES OF THAT MOVEMENT WERE LAWYERS LIKE THURGOOD MARSHALL. I SAID I WANT TO DO THAT WORK, SO I DECIDED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I GRADUATED, MY MOM, WHO RAISED ME AND MY SISTER, SHE SAID, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN YOUR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE? I SAID I HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR. THE REASON IS BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT HAS OFTEN DONE JUSTICE AND OFTEN DONE INJUSTICE AND NEEDS TO BE REFORMED, SO I WANT TO GO ON THE INSIDE AND DO THAT WORK. I ALSO SAID I ALSO WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE A VOICE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND VOICELESS. I STARTED MY CAREER IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA, AN OFFICE ONCE LED BY EARL WARREN. FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I WALKED INTO A COURTROOM AND ALMOST EVERY DAY THEREAFTER, I SPOKE FIVE WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT PHRASE FOR THE PEOPLE I THINK REALLY CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. ONE, WE HAVE RIGHTLY SAID THAT A HARM AGAINST ANY ONE OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US. THEREFORE, NO ONE SHOULD BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. SECOND, FOR THE PEOPLE, TO ANN'S POINT, MEANS ALL THE PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF GENDER, RACE, WHERE THEY LIVE, THE PARTY WITH WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED, THE LANGUAGE OR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS. ALL THE PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE THAT FOR YEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER, I PROSECUTED CRIMES INVOLVING CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SAYING THAT THEY DESERVE A VOICE THAT GIVES THEM STRENGTH AND DIGNITY AND JUSTICE WITHOUT JUDGMENT. FOR THE PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS ELECTED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN FRANCISCO MEANT SAYING IT WAS A FAILED WAR ON DRUGS THAT LED TO AMERICA'S PROBLEM OF MASS INCARCERATION, SO I CREATED ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON GIVING JOBS TO PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. FOR THE PEOPLE, WHEN I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE I SERVE TWO TERMS, RUNNING THE SECOND LARGEST DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN UNITED STATES, SECOND ONLY TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, MEANT TAKING ON THE BIGGEST BANKS OF AMERICA WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES, WHICH RESULTED IN SO MANY HOMEOWNERS LOSING THEIR HOMES FROM FORECLOSURE. IT MEANT TAKING ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BIG OIL COMPANIES, AND WINNING. FOR THE PEOPLE, SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE ALMOST THREE YEARS, HAS MEANT TAKING ON JEFF SESSIONS, WILLIAM BARR, AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. AND FOR THE PEOPLE, THEN, I STAND BEFORE YOU FULLY PREPARED TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. SO THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. AND I DO BELIEVE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN IN AMERICA, IN ANY PLACE YOU CAN IMAGINE, THERE IS A DAD TONIGHT WILL BE SITTING AT HIS KITCHEN COUNTER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE IS GOING TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE IS WORKING TWO JOBS, HE IS PAYING MORE TAXES THAN THE 400 RICHEST FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY THAT FOR TOO LONG, THE RULES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT HAVE-NOTS WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE SO THAT FOR FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, THEY WILL RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO $6,000 A YEAR THEY CAN TAKE HOME UP TO $500 A MONTH. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THE TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANS THINKING ABOUT THE MOM WHO HAS A CHILD WHO HAS A FEVER THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. SHE CALLS 911 AND THEY SAY, TAKE THE CHILD TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SHE IS PAUSING, LOOKING AT THOSE SLIDING GLASS DOORS, BECAUSE SHE KNOWS EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH, SHE IS GOING TO BE OUT OF IT A $1000 TO $4000 DEDUCTIBLE. HEALTH INSURANCE IS ON THE BALLOT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE, ESPECIALLY IN THIS YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019, A NO-BRAINER THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE GOT IN THEIR BACK POCKET. [APPLAUSE] SO I HAVE GOT A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN, BUT MY PLAN IS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON THE DEBATE STAGE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLKS WHO HAVE A PLAN THAT, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, WILL NOT COVER ABOUT 10 MILLION PEOPLE. MY PLAN WILL COVER EVERYONE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND I AM GOING TO COVER VISION AND DENTAL AND HEARING AIDS. [APPLAUSE] ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY PLAN AND SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT GOING TO COVER THE 10 MILLION PEOPLE IS JUST THAT, MINE WILL COVER EVERYBODY. 10 MILLION PEOPLE, TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT, IS ABOUT 10 TIMES THE SIZE OF DELAWARE. ABOUT 100 TIMES THE SIZE OF SOUTH BEND, SO THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] ON THE OTHER HAND, MY PLAN IS DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS TRYING TO GET RID OF DAVID INSURANCE, BECAUSE , GET RID OF PRIVATE INSURANCE, BECAUSE I AM NOT TRYING TO DO THAT. WHEN I WAS TRAVELING, TOO MANY PEOPLE SAID, I WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE, BUT DON'T TAKE AWAY MY CHOICE BETWEEN HAVING A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PLAN. YOU WILL HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LAND, BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN AND HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR JACKING UP PRICES FOR SO MANY YEARS. UNDER MY PLAN, THEY CANNOT CHARGE CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND HAVE TO PLAY BY OUR GOALS, OR THEY DON'T PLAY AT ALL. IN AMERICA, WE HAVE TEACHERS, AND HERE IN IOWA, WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH. 94% OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PAY FOR SUPPLIES. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE ARE MAKING 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS, AUNTIES, AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM THEIR VALUE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FEDERAL INVESTING IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP, WHICH HERE IN IOWA IS $12,200. THAT'S A YEAR'S WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. OR A YEAR'S WORTH OF GROSERY BILLS. OR PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS OUR STUDENTS DON'T COME OUT AND JOIN A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PAFPLGS I'M HERE ALSO TO SAY TO BETSY DEVOS , IN CASE SHE'S LISTENING, TEACHERS DON'T NEED A GUN, THEY NEED A RAISE. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] AND SPEAKING OF OUR CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU. I GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY WERE CONSIDERED THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY. SO I SAY, WHEN IN AMERICA OUR BABIES, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY'RE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW TO HIDE IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THERE'S A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL, JUSTICE FOR OUR CHILDREN SON THE BALLOT. , IS ON THE BALLOT. SO I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY, LOOK, LEADERS HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO LEAD ON THIS. IT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SAY YOU'RE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY. I'M IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT I ALSO KNOW, HAVING LOOKED AT MORE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS THAN I CARE TO TELL YOU, HAVING EMBRACED MORE MOTHERS OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS THAN I CARE TO TELL YOU, THAT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY. INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, WELL, SOME PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE DISAGREE, THEY SAY KAMLA HARRIS SAYS IF THERE'S NO ACTION BY CONGRESS, SHE'LL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. I DID, AND I AM. THEY SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES IN OFFICE, A REPUBLICAN COMES IN OFFICE LATER AND CHANGES IT? WELL YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL DEAL WITH THAT IN EIGHT YEARS. WE NEED ACTION. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED ACTION. WHEN IN AMERICA WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE SILENTLY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION, FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE, FROM SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION AND AGREE THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS ON THE BALLOT AND WE MUST ACT. AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY, HAG DONE THIS WORK FOR A VERY LONG TIME, NO ONE IN OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE MADE TO SILENTLY SUFFER AND WE NEED TO BRING THIS ISSUE OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND GIVE PEOPLE THE RESOURCES THEY DESERVE, UNDERSTANDING THAT HEALTH CARE DOESN'T MEAN JUST FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND WE HAVE GOT TO TREAT WHAT IS PAINING AND CAUSING PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY TO SILENTLY SUFFER NEEDLESSLY. [APPLAUSE] AND I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT I DO BELIEVE JUSTICE SON THE BALLOT. AND JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT WHEN WE HAVE A CRIMINAL LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND I'M REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IN AMERICA, IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO, I'LL TELL YOU THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT ON ALL OF THESE AND SO MANY MORE ISSUES, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WHEN WE ADDRESS AND OVERCOME THESE VARIOUS INJUSTICES, I DO BELIEVE IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNLOCK THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. AND THAT'S THE AMERICA I SEE. THAT'S THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. I DO BELIEVE, AND I KNOW, AND THIS IS TRUE, IN PARTICULAR FOR THE PEOPLE OF IOWA, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE. AND TO FIGHT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT SPENDING TIME IN IOWA IS THAT IOWANS KNOW YOU NEVER SHOULD SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY'S PERMISSION TO TELL YOU WHAT'S POSSIBLE. YOU GOT TO SEE IT AND THEN YOU GOT TO JUST GO FOR IT. RIGHT? NOT WAITING TO TELL AND WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TELL YOU, OH, WE'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE DONE. NO, WE FIGHT FOR THOSE THINGS KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND GOING THERE. AND THAT, I THINK, IS WHAT IS REQUIRED OF US RIGHT NOW. IN FIGHTING FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE, BUT THERE ALSO IS SO MUCH TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE. AND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING AND BEING. AND THAT IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO RUN. AND I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE THAT SPIRIT AND APPROACH THAT BRINGS US TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY WINNING THIS CAMPAIGN SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. [APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS SHERRY, I'M THE VITES CHAIR. THERE'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER AND THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT I HAVE , I HAVE LIKE A THREE-POINT QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM? WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE MIDDLE TERM, AND WHAT WOULD YOU D IN THE LONG-TERM, TO BOTH SOLVE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, MIDDLE TERM PROBLEM AND THE LONG-TERM PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION? JUSTICE FOR IMMIGRANTS IS ON THE BALLOT. AND WHEN WE HAVE HAD POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES, AND SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND YOU KNOW, LISTEN, LET'S ALSO AGREE, IMMIGRANTS HAVE HELPED MAKE AMERICA. WHAT IT IS. YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST TALK TURKEY HERE. [LAUGHTER] UNLESS YOU'RE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOUR PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. SO , AND BY THE WAY. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO REMIND DONALD TRUMP SOME OF HIS CLOSEST RELATIVES ARE IMMIGRANTS TOO. [APPLAUSE] EXACTLY. SO ON THIS ISSUE, I START WITH A STATEMENT OF WHAT SHOULD BE OUR VALUES ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. AND THAT THE HORRIBLE DISSERVICE OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE HAS CAUSED WHOLE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE TO LIVE IN FEAR. OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AFTER HE WAS ELECTED FOR FEAR THAT WHEN THEY CAME HOME AFTER SCHOOL THEIR PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. THE NUMBER OF PEDIATRICIANS WHO REPORTED THERE WERE CANCELED OPPONENT , APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT INTERACTION WITH THE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS. ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS ON THIS WAS THE LATE, GREAT, JOHN MCCAIN. LINDSEY GRAHAM. HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS AS IT TURNS OUT. RIGHT? SO PART OF IT IS WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT WHO WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SHE IS PREPARED TO SIGN LEGISLATION THAT WILL IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP IN THE , SIT CERTAINSHIP. IN THE SHORT-TERM, WE NEED TO REINSTATE DACA PROTECTIONS FOR THE DREAMER. STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT. WE SAID TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM CAME TO THE COUNTRY BEFORE THEY COULD WALK OR TALK, IF YOU GIVE US INFORMATION ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR ARRIVAL IF YOU PROVE TO US YOU ARE LIVING A PRODUCTIVE LIFE, NOT COMMITTING ANY CRIMES, THEN WE WILL DEFER DEPORTATION, WE WON'T BETORT YOU. THAT'S WHAT DACA WAS. AND WE SAID IF YOU GIVE US THIS INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF, WE WILL NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH I.C.E. THIS PRESIDENT CAME IN AND BROKE AMERICA'S PROMISE TO THESE KIDS. WHO ARE LIVING IN FEAR RIGHT NOW. AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING THEM FROM BEING DEPORTED IS THAT THERE WAS A COURT ORDER SAYING YOU CAN'T. SO I WOULD REINSTATE DACA IMMEDIATELY. AND THEN MID AND LONG-TERM IT'S ABOUT PASSING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. ALSO SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE IF A WAY WE RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY AMERICA'S HISTORY BUT THAT THERE WILL BE GREAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR WHAT WE DO WHEN WE PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. THERE LIL WLS , THERE WILL ALSO BE, WE'LL BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO AND WHAT WE ARE IN TERMS OF OUR VALUES, THAT INCLUDE NOT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES. ON DAY ONE, I'LL SHUT DOWN THOSE PRIVATE DETENTION CENTERS. AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, IT WAS IN MIAMI, SINCE I WAS IN FLORIDA ANYWAY, I DROVE DOWN TO A PLACE CALLED HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA. IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA, THERE'S A PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITY THAT YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE PAYING FOR. A PRIVATE DETENTION FACILE TAI TY THAT AT LEAST THEN DID HOUSE 2,700 CHILDREN. AND LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITY, EBUSINESS MODEL, IS THAT CERTAIN HUMAN BEINGS ARE MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY OFF OF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS CALLED CHILDREN. AND OTHER, RIGHT. SO IMMEDIATELY, GOING TO SHUT THOSE DOWN. AND , THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. BUT WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] YOU TALKED ABOUT JUSTICE BEING ON THE BALLOT, I AGREE WITH THAT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO SO MANY PEOPLE AREN'T INCARCERATED THAT REALLY DON'T BELONG THERE? A NUMBER OF THINGS. I KNOW THIS SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE. IT'S PART OF WHY I WAME A PROSECUTOR. WE ENDED UP INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR WHAT WAS A HEALTH ISSUE. DRUG ADDICTION IS A HEALTH ISSUE, AND IT NEEDS TO BE TREATED AS SUCH. IT'S A DISEASE THAT NEEDS TO BE TREATED, NOT IN JAILS AND PRISON BUS THROUGH A PUBLIC HELL SYSTEM. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. I'M A PROPONENT OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. AND BY THE WAY, ALSO A PROPONENT OF SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED AND ARE NOW FELONS FOR LIFE AND NOW ARE LOOKING AT MANY STATES INCLUDING MY HOME STATE THAT'S LEGALIZED MARIJUANA AND IT'S NOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASH COW INDUSTRIES IN AMERICA, THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND NOW THEY'RE FELONS FOR LIFE AND CAN'T GET JOBS, LET'S EXPUNGE THEIR RECORDS AND PUT THEM FIRST IN LINE TO GET THE JOBS IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY. BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? THE ONLY DIFFERENCE , ACTUALLY THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING NOW, MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY? WHAT ARE THEY DOING? SELLING WEED. BEFORE THIS, WHAT WERE THOSE FOLKS DOING? SELLING WEED. IF YOU LOOK AT, WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB, EXPERIENCE NEEDED, THEY'VE GOT EXPERIENCE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? WE ALSO HAVE TO, ONE OF MY BIG AREAS OF FOCUS IS ALSO INCARCERATED WOMEN. WE HAVE STATES IN AMERICA THAT ARE SHACKLING WOMEN DURING CHILDBIRTH. PROFIT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, OUTRAGEOUS. SO IF YOU'VE EVER VISITED ANYONE WHO IS INCARCERATED, YOU'LL KNOW, IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO TALK TO THEM ON THE PHONE, THEY'RE CHARGED LIKE $1 A MINUTE FOR A PHONE CALL. VIDEO CONFERENCING IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT, I'LL USE AS AN EXAMPLE, INCARCERATED WOMEN. MOST OF THEM ARE MOMS. MOST ARE NOT IN FOR LIFE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM LOVE THEIR CHILDREN. AND EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM IS SET UP WORKS AGAINST THEM BONDING WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND EVENTUALLY REUNIFYING WITH THEIR CHILDREN. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE PLACE WOMEN SO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY, AND MEN, MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL TO WHERE THEIR INCARCERATED RELATIVE MAY BE. WE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. NOT TO MENTION THE MONEY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AROUND BAIL. I'VE BEEN A LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYING WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING IN JAIL FOR DAY, WEEKS, MONTHS, EVEN YEAR, WAITING TO GO TO TRIAL, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE MONEY TO PAY BAIL. MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY ARE OUT. THAT IS ON ITS FACE UNFAIR. THAT'S NOT ONLY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE, THAT'S AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. I'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET RID OF THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, DE, FOR-PROFIT DETENTION FACILITIES, THAT INCLUDES FOR-PROFIT PRISONS. WE NEED TO SHUT THOSE DOWN. THE MOTIVATION THERE IS NOT TO RUN PROGRAMS HELPING PEOPLE GET OUT EARLY, HELPING THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. YOU'RE MAKING MONEY BY HAVING PEOPLE IN YOUR JAIL. THOSE ARE SOME WAYS WE NEED TO REFORM THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE QUESTION BUT POINTS IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES. I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND THAT I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS THORRY SO I HOPE THIS NEWS REPORT WAS ACCURATE. OVER THE WEEKEND I READ THAT IN ADDITION TO THE WALL THAT MR. TRUMP IS TRYING TO BUILD WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS, THERE'S A PRIVATE CORPORATION BUILDING A SEPARATE WALL IN A FLOODPLAIN THAT OUR LAW WILL NOT PERMIT BUT SOMEHOW THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SYSTEM. SO THE QUESTION IS TWO-FOLD. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ENSURE A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE IN AMERICA, AND HOW WILL YOU DEAL WITH THIS, WHAT I SUSPECT IS MAYBE AN ILLEGAL EFFORT BY A PRIVATE CORPORATION TO SUPPORT TRUMP'S EFFORT TO BUILD A WALL? LET'S START WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATIONS WE'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE CORRUPT. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THAT CABINET, IT'S A CABINET OF SPECIAL INTERESTS. FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYONE THERE NEVER WAS DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SERVICE. I'VE ONLY HAD ONE CLIENT MY ENTIRE CAREER AND THAT'S BEEN THE PEOPLE. I HAVE NEVER WORKED FOR A CORPORATION, I'VE NEVER WORKED FOR A SPECIAL INTEREST. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CABINET AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE TO DO WORK IN THE PUBLIC TRUST FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD, AND THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE CLEARLY THERE FOR NOT PUBLIC SERVICE BUT SELF-SERVICE. MANY OF WHOM CAME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND AFTER THIS QUICK STINT ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH THEY HAVE HELPED PROFIT EVEN MORE BY DEREGULATING ENTIRE INDUSTRIES WHILE THEY'VE BEEN SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN OUR GOVERNMENT. AND SO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERN, I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF WHAT YOU SHARED BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS JUST ACROSS THE BORDER, I KNOW IT TO BE A SERIOUS CONCERN WHICH IS HOW MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING THIS PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY PROFIT VERSUS WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE BETSY DEVOS. SHE'S BECOME A KIND OF GOOD LAUGH LINE BUT LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT. THIS HER WHOLE FAMILY, THEIR WHOLE BUSINESS MODEL IS ABOUT TRYING TO PRIVATIZE EDUCATION. YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN SELLING OFF PUBLIC LANDS. THIS ADMINISTRATION. FOR DRILLING. YOU CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LIST AND SO YOUR CONCERN IS A LEGITIMATE ONE. ON THAT WALL, LOOK, THAT WALL IS NEVER GETTING BUILT AND MEXICO IS CERTAINLY NOT PAYING FOR IT. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF BUSH DUH I DON'T DOUBT THERE WOULD BE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE BENEFITING, I KNOW THAT THERE WERE REPORTS ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PREVIOUS CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE PRIVATE AND FOR-PROFIT PRISONS, YOU KNOW. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. AND YOU KNOW, DOESN'T , IT DOESN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE NEWS BUT THIS ISSUE OF THE PUBLIC TRUST IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOWING, YOU AND I KNOW, YOU HOLD THESE POSITIONS NOT FOR YOUR PERSONAL POWER. HUH HOLD THESE POSITIONS TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. THERE'S A VERY SACRED TRUST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE JOBS. OR SHOULD BE. THAN ADMINISTRATION ACROSS THE BOARD HAS VIOLATED THAT TRUST. ACROSS THE BOARD. WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE BUMS OUT. [LAUGHTER] YES, THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK IN MARION COUNTY, YOU WERE HERE IN AUGUST. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP FARMS LIKE OURS AND MARION COUNTY FARMERS, IOWA FARMERS, AMERICAN FARMERS, LEAD ON CLIMATE ACTION? [APPLAUSE] KAMALA. THAT'S SUCH A , I ACTUALLY JUST DID AN INTERVIEW EARLIER ABOUT THIS. FIRST OF ALL, I ENJOYED OUR LAST VISIT. IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF MY CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. FARMERS ARE EXPLICITLY IN MY PLAN. AS I WAS SAYING DURING THIS INTERVIEW THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT FARM, BY THE WAY, BACKGROUND. MY STATE, CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE A HUGE AGRICULTURAL , YOU MIGHT THINK OH, CALIFORNIA WHAT IS THAT, IT'S HOLLYWOOD. I HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH FARMERS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT FARMERS IS THAT BY YOUR VERY NATURE, YOU ARE SO INNOVATIVE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXEY OF SITTING BACK AND OH, THIS IS WHATEVER. HAVING OPINIONS. YOU'VE GOT TO GET STUFF DONE AND YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT. YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT TO WHATEVER NATURE PRESENTS YOU. AND IN THAT WAY, YOU ALSO ARE SO CLOSE TO IT THAT YOU KNOW MORE THAN MOST WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING. AND SO I LOOK VERY FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH FARMERS IN OUR PLAN FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A COUNTRY. IN DOING A BETTER JOB OF SUSTAINING THIS PLANET. AND THAT'S ABOUT THINGS LIKE COVER CROP, WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT INVESTING IN THE LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO TO PARTNER THERE AROUND DEVELOPING INNOVATIONS. BIOFUELS. THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THERE'S SUCH GREAT PROMISE THERE. AND FRANKLY, ANYBODY WHO IS IN POSITION OF HAVING AN OPINION ON THIS, SHOULD, AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT BRINGING FARMERS IN TO BE PART OF IT, NOT ONLY FOR IMPLEMENTING BUT DESIGNING THESE ISSUES. THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTING OUR FARMERS IN TERMS OF TRADE POLICY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN THERE AGAIN THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS. EVERYTHING FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND FARMERS IN IOWA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, DARELY FARMERS IN WISCONSIN. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN, TALK ABOUT A VIOLATION OF TRUST THERE TOO. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS WINTER DAY OUT IN, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY SAID I LIVE BACK IN THE 1950'S WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK. ON GRAVEL ROADS AND FARM. SO WE ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. YOU ARE ALL WELCOME TO STAY, WE HAVE MORE COFFEE, WE HAVE MORE PASTRIES AND TALK ABOUT IT AND TALK TO ALL THE ORGANIZERS. AND IF YOU WANT TO CAUCUS, I'M HOUR THEY'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE YOUR NAME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2019] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] OH, GREAT. KNOCKING ON DOORS IS ABOUT, IT'S WHY I SAY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS, THE ELECTION HAS TO BE ABOUT THE FUTURE. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT IF WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE NEXT 12 YEARS, OR MAYBE SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME. THIS IS LITERALLY ABOUT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. IT'S ABOUT CONSERVING NATURAL LAND, RIGHT? I'VE ACTUALLY DONE THE WORK. THERE ARE A LOT OF SUBJECTS WE CAN DISCUSS AND PEOPLE CAN GIVE A LOVELY PEACH ABOUT BUT I'VE DONE THE WORK. WHEN I WAS DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE DARK AGES, IN 2003 I WAS ELECTED, WHAT YEAR WERE YOU BORN? 2004. CAM LAMPLET BEFORE YOU WERE BORN! I CREATED AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE UNIT IN MY OFFICE TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND POOR COMMUNITIES, DUMPING GROUNDS FOR CHEMICALS, FOR POLLUTION. AND WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE POLLUTERS. I DEFENDED SOME OF THE TOUGHEST LAWS SAYING WE NEED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE BIG POLLUTERS NEED TO PAY A PENALTY FOR THIS. THIS IS NOT NATURALLY OCCURRING. THE HARM TO OUR ENVIRONMENT, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S NATURALLY HAPPENING. IT'S BECAUSE OF POLLUTION. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN POLLUTION. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT BIG TOBACCO AND WHAT THEY DID FOR YEARS? THEY KNEW WITH THEY WERE DOING WAS HARMFUL. THEY DID THE RESEARCH. THEY DID IT ANYWAY. BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY. A LOT OF THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH THE BIG OIL COMPANIES IS THEY ALSO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THEM. THAT'S ONE BIG AREA. ONE OF MY BIG AREAS OF FOCUS IS PUBLIC EDUCATION. I WANT YOU GUYS TO HAVE A SCHOOL WHERE WHEN YOU GO ALL THAT YOU WANT TO DO IS OPEN UP YOUR MIND TO THE WONDERS OF MATH AND ART AND SCIENCE, IT'S A HUGE ISSUE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. IT'S A BIG ISSUE HERE IN IOWA. TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE, INTEREST FREE LOANS, WHAT ENDS UP HAPPEN, YOU'LL END UP TAKING OUT A LOAN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON IT YOU END UP OWING MORE THAN YOU TOOK OUT IN A LOAN. I WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH, THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS, THAT'S NOT , I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR HELP. OK? THANK YOU. BUT I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. AND IT WAS EARLY. THE EARLY DIDN'T BOTHER ME IRK GOT UP EARLY. I'M NOT GOOD IN THE SNOW. SO WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS ONE HERE, I THOUGHT, OK, IT'S NOT SNOWING AND I'LL COME SEE YOU. I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. YOU HIT ALL THE SUBJECTS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A BIG EFFORT TO BE HERE. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. IT'S SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT. NORMALLY EDUCATION WOULD BE MY NUMBER ONE TOPIC BUT HOW CAN WE NOT CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT? HOW CAN WE NOT CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY? AND WE DO KNOW HOW TO DO I. WE DO KNOW HOW TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO HEAL. THERE'S BEEN SO MANY BIG CHALLENGES AS A NATION. REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN OFFICE. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO UNIFY AROUND THE COMMONALITY. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. IF WE THINK THAT WAY, WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT SO. YEAH. I'VE LIVE SOD MANY PLACES, KNOWN SO MANY CULTURES, I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING TO BE TRUE THAT WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN DIFFERENCES. I HAVE A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO COALITION BUILDING AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STILL BEST FRIENDS WITH MY BEST FRIEND FROM KINDERGARTEN. IT'S LIKE TRAVELING A WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN IN DIFFERENT CITIES, BUT STILL ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IS MY BEST FRIEND FROM KINDERGARTEN. THANK YOU FOR COME, GUYS. THANK YOU. HI! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOING TO VOLUNTEER DOWN THERE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM. IT'S ONE OF THOSE ISSUES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THE WAY TO REMEMBER , LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR. IF A PARENT IS PAYING A PERFECT STRANGER TO TRANSPORT A CHILD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, THROUGH AN ENTIRE FOREIGN COUNTRY, WHY WOULD A PARENT DO THAT? IT IS BECAUSE IF THEY STAY WHERE THEY ARE IT'S EVEN WORSE. BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVE, THEY SAGO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM. IT'S INHUMANE. THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE. THIS IS PART OF WHAT TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. OUR STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD IN LARGE PART HAS NOT BEEN DERIVED FROM THE MILITARY BUT THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY INCLUDING INVESTING HUMANITARIAN AID IN PLACES THAT NEED IT. AND ALSO ENCOURAGING THEIR DEMOCRACY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE, WE HAVE ABANDONED THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE. THERE IS SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING THE WORK HAPPENING THERE TOO. IT'S A BIG PART OF IT. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. PUBLIC EDUCATION IS ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES. MY TEACHER ATTENDED BYMY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION, ALMOST EVERYTHING I FEEL ABOUT PUBLIC EDUCATION HAS BEEN DUE TO MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH IS THAT I KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR TEACHERS. I KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HAVING A ROBUST ENVIRONMENT IN A CLASSROOM THAT INCLUDES HAVING A TEACHER, TEACHER'S AIDES, HAVING A NURSE IN THE SCHOOL, SOCIAL WORKER IN THE SCHOOL. I'M VERY CLEAR THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FAMILY THAT RAISED ME, IT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWED ME TO THEN BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. AND SO PUBLIC SESSION ONE OF MY HIGHEST AREAS OF FOCUS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT SALARIES, WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR RESOURCES IN CLASSROOM. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO BE SAFE. LET HER KNOW ALL THAT. THANK YOU. WE NEED TO , THESE THINGS ARE NONPARTISAN. SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT PARTISAN. NOT EVEN BIPARTISAN BUT NONPARTISAN. SO YOU KNOW, WE NEED LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THAT AND THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT IS ABOUT FIXING PROBLEMS. THAT'S PART OF WHY I'M RUNNING. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LONG DEBATE OR ANY DEBATE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, VIRTUES OF CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM. THEY WANT HEALTH CARE. WITHOUT WORRIES ABOUT HOW TO AFFORD I. THEY WANT TO PAY THEIR RENT. I HAVE A WHOLE INITIATIVE ABOUT AFFORDABLE RENT. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL WHERE THERE'S A NURSE AND THERE'S A SOCIAL WORKER. MY NIECE HAS CANESER, WHEN SHE WAS FIRST BEING TREATED SHE SAID I'M GETTING WONDERFUL CARE, HAVE WONDERFUL INSURANCE, DONE WORRY ABOUT ME. NOW AFTER ABOUT A YEAR SHE SAID I'M GETTING WONDERFUL CARE BUT THE BILLS HAVE STARTED COMING IN. HER INSURANCE COMPANY, THEY GAVE YOU THE WRONG DRUG, WE CAN'T PAY FOR THAT I DON'T CARE HOW THAT GETS FIXED, WHETHER IT'S YOUR PLAN OR ANY OF THE PLANS THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAGE BUT IT'S GOT TO BE FIXED. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THIS , OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF DICTATING WHAT DOCTORS CAN TREAT AND CANNOT TREAT. THEY CANNOT , EVERY SHOULD HAVE OPTIONS. THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT PROVIDING FULL COVERAGE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS A CANCER PATIENT. HOW OLD IS SHE? NO PROPERTY PROVIDING COVERAGE THEY SHOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING FULL COVERAGE FOR SOMEONE GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. WE THINK SHE'S GOING TO RECOVER, WE'RE HOPEFUL BUT WE'RE CONCERNED AND WE WATCH HER FIGHTING FOR HER HEALTH, NOT FOR HER ECONOMIC , WE WANT HER FIGHTING FOR HER HEALTH NOT HER ECONOMIC SURVIVE. , SURVIVAL.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?466837-1\/senator-kamala-harris-house-party-knoxville-iowa","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 presidential candidate, spoke with voters at a house party hosted at the residence of a county Democratic Party chair in Knoxville, Iowa.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DETROIT, I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH YOU BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I FELT BETTER IN THE LAST TEN DAYS THAN I HAVE IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS. DO YOU FEEL ME? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHY, I DECIDED TO JUMP ON ENDORSED JOE BIDEN. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE JOE KNOWS MICHIGAN. JOE CARES ABOUT MICHIGAN AND CARES ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MICHIGAN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW HEALTHCARE IS PERSONAL. RIGHT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AS A 29 -YEAR-OLD I BECAME A MEMBER IS KNOWN AS THE SANDWICH GENERATION BIT I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO GENERATIONS OF MY OWN FAMILY FROM WHOM I WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER. MY MOM WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER, MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A NEWBORN. THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNIQUE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THAT. I WAS ALSO FIGHTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING MY MOMS CHEMOTHERAPY. I HAVE COMMISERATED WITH JOE BIDEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE BRAIN TUMOR THAT KILLED MY MOTHER IS THE SAME ONE THAT TOOK BEAU BIDEN'S LIFE. I KNOW THAT HE AND BARACK OBAMA EXPANDED HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY ALMOST 700,000 MICHIGANDERS GOT HEALTHCARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF THAT IS NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH TO MANY OF US HERE IN MICHIGAN, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS. WHEN WE WERE ON THE ROPES, WHEN OUR AUTO INDUSTRY WAS STRUGGLING, WHO HAD OUR BACK? THAT'S RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN PAID THEY CAME TO THE RESCUE WHEN PEOPLE COUNTED AND WHAT PEOPLE SAID LET IT FAIL FAIL, THEY SAID NO, WE ARE IN BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS IMPORTANT. THEY HAD OUR BACKS AND TODAY I SAY LET'S HAVE JOE BIDEN'S BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN A POLITICAL DISCOURSE WHERE IT IS SO NASTY AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FRACTURE US AND DIVIDE US, BURN BRIDGES, BUILD WALLS, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT WE WON IN 2018 BY BIG NUMBERS BECAUSE WHY? WE SHOWED UP WE STAYED FOCUS ON THE DINNER TABLE ISSUES. WE SHOWED A RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE AND WE BUILT A COALITION. AS A DEMOCRAT I CAN SAY THIS, I AM PROUD OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THEIR NAMES ON THIS BALLOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE IS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IN EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHETHER IT WAS PETE BUTTIGIEG OR ELIZABETH WARREN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OR AMY KLOBUCHAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHETHER IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE I'M THINKING ABOUT. [LAUGHTER] HOLD ON, I'M GETTING THERE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN THOUGH IS HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A COALITION. I'M RIDING WITH BIDEN AND EVERYONE HAS A SEAT TOO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT TAKES COALITIONS TO WIN AND THIS CAMPAIGN LOOKS LIKE THIS COUNTRY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO INTRODUCE, EXHIBIT A, MY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS HERE TO JOIN US ALL AND TELL US WHY HE DECIDED TO JUMP IN, MY FRIEND THE PHENOMENAL SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (music)(music) [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT, HELLO EVERYBODY! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT DETROIT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON, EVERYBODY, BECAUSE THIS MORNING I MADE IT OFFICIAL, I AM HEREBY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON JOE'S TEAM BECAUSE JOE IS ON YOUR TEAM TEAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE WITH JOE BECAUSE JOE IS WITH ALL OF US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN I GET HERE TO DETROIT I FEEL LIKE I GOT DETROIT CRIED BECAUSE MY MOM WAS BORN RIGHT HERE IN THIS CITY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MY GRANDFATHER, MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN IN THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND WAS A UAW UNION WORKER AND I'M PROUD OF THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ... ... THIS IS THE PARTY OF CIVIL RIGHTS, OF VOTING RIGHTS, OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, OF WORKERS RIGHTS AND UNION AND SUPPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THE PARTY THAT BELIEVES THIS RADICAL CONCEPT , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF IT , IS CALLED SCIENCE BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. WE'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH NOW. OUR NATION WHICH EVERY GENERATION WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MORE PERFECT UNION ELECTED PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO RIP US APART. YOU LOOK AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HE DOESN'T TRY TO LIFT THEM UP, HE TRIES TO PARE THEM DOWN. IT SEEMS HE TAKES PLEASURE IN PUTTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS. WE GOT KNOCKED BACK AND KNOCKED DOWN FOUR YEARS AGO LIKE THIS HIGH SCHOOL WHO WAS VERY MASCOT IS THE PHOENIX [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR US AS A NATION TO RUN UP. WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, WE DON'T SHUT UP OR GIVE UP, WE STAND UP AND WE RISE UP. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS ONE MAN NOW READY TO GO TO THE ARENA WHO IS OUR BEST SHOT TO BE DONALD TRUMP HE IS THE BEST ONE TO HEAL THE SOUL OF AMERICA. HE IS THE BEST ONE TO STAND UP FOR ALL OF US IN AMERICA AND THAT PERSON'S NAME IS JOE BIDEN. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOME HELP, BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. [APPLAUSE] HELP ME NOW. HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE CAN'T PRAY THAT HE WINS OR HOPE THAT HE WINS AND WE CANNOT WISH THAT HE WINS. WE'VE GOT TO VOTE HIM IN. SO THIS IS ON ALL OF YOU. WE KNOW WHAT THE ANCESTORS SAID WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO PROGRESS. WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO TURN OUR ANGER INTO ACTION. THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO PROVIDE WHICH WAY DO WE GO DO WE GO TO THE LOW ROAD WHERE WE SEE THATTHE BETTER DAYS OF AMERICA DISAPPEAR UNDER THE SUN OR DO WE GO THE HIGHER ROAD AND PROCLAIM THAT WE ARE A NATION WHERE LIBERTY STILL REIGNS IN AND WHERE EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE AND WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ENDS THE NIGHTMARE. BRIAN STEVENSON SAID WHERE PEOPLE WORK HARD. YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY UNLESS YOU LOVE YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN. I WANT TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW ARE YOU READY TO WORK FOR JOE BIDEN BUT TOMORROW IT STARTS. I GO TO THE SENATE AND FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME MOMENTUM I SOMETIMES HAVE TO CALL IN TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE I KNOW JOE IS ABOUT TO COME ONTO THE STAGE BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON THAT IS A RISING STAR IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] LIGHTNING BRINGING THE LIGHT, ONE OF OUR POWERFUL PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN WINS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND SO ONE MORE VOICE, A VOICE OF CHANGE AND HOPE AND TOMORROW. A VOICE OF TODAY I BRING TO THE STAGE A GREAT SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] (music)(music) WHAT'S UP, DETROIT! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING] WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WORK WE ARE ABOUT TO DO FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO, EVERYBODY. MICHIGAN, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS GREAT STATE, IT IS THE MEASURE OF HOW AMERICA IS DOING AND WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE KIND OF FIGHT AND WORK THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS PUT INTO INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE JOE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THEY ARE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND HELP US TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DISILLUSION US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THE SYSTEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT EVER WORK FOR US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MATTER, POWERFUL FORCES THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO YOU YOU DON'T MATTER, SO DON'T PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK A DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY TO US DO NOT TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT THEY ARE A LOAN. LET'S SEE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT POWERTHEPOWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND WE WILL NOT BE CANCELED. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT SAYING WE KNOW WHAT MATTERS AND WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY AND YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WE KNOW IF WE STOP FIGHTING WE WILL NEVER GET THERE AND SO WE FIGHT. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION HAS BEEN ABOUT FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEAS. [CHEERING] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOE WE KNOW. I'M PROUD TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE IN JOE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO REFLECTIVE OF HIS PERSONALITY IS WHEN HE SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, BUT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE IS. HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS LIVED A LIFE OF INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OTHERS. SHE HAD MADE GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICES IN HIS LIFE. HE IS EXPERIENCED IN LIFE GREAT PAIN AND GLORY. HE UNDERSTANDS WHO PEOPLE ARE. I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T GET IT. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE. THE ONLY PEOPLE HE SEES ARE THE PEOPLE HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES. HE DOESN'T SEE THE PEOPLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO FEELS, WHO UNDERSTANDS, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN HE'S WORKING TWO JOBS AND HE KNOWS HE'S MISSING HIS SON'S BALLGAME. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND KNOWING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH WITH HER SICK CHILD IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POCKET MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR HER DEDUCTIBLE. NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE POWER TO SEE AND FEEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND BEEN LEFT UP TO PEOPLE. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I GOT TO KNOW JOE BEST THROUGH HIS SON. HOW THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING ACTIVITIES, SO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND JOE BIDEN STOOD WITH ME EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF STATE OF DELAWARE HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS HARD AS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. I GOT TO KNOW JOE THROUGHBO. IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS SON. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD. AND HE SHOWED COURAGE ALL THE TIME AND CONVICTION. HE SPOKE WITH SO MUCH LOVE ABOUT THE FATHER RAISED HIM INTO THE MAN HE WAS. I KNOW JOE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND MY FINAL POINT IS MICHIGAN, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. RACIAL JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. AND JOE BIDEN IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WITH THAT I INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] HELLO, DETROIT. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

THEY VOTE FOR US NORTH CAROLINA 19%, TEXAS, 40% MORE VOTERS. I CAN GO ON. BUT FOLKS, HE'S RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY.

IT'S A REFLECTION OF WHAT IS WRONG IN AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. [CHANTING] THERE IS ONE OTHER THING DONALD TRUMP TELLS GENERATED. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY OR AS A PEOPLE.

I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT HERE. HE IS A HELL OF A GUY AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU WE WORK SIDE-BY-SIDE TO SUPPORT THE CITY. THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN DETROIT LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MICHIGAN. DURINGDURING BEAT OBAMA BY AN ADMINISTRATION, WE LOST THE RESTORATION PROJECT AND INVESTED $2.5 BILLION TO HELP MITIGATE POLLUTION. PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES, HABITATS, THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF THE GREAT LAKES IN DECADES AND IT'S DELIVERED AN INCREDIBLE RESULT. REVITALIZATION FOR THE WATERFRONT ALL ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE DRAWING DRAWING INTO NEW BUSINESSES ANDIN THE NEWBUSINESSES AND THE TOURISM ACTIVITY LIKE FISHING AND BOATING ON THE LAKE. FOLKS, YOU ARE THE GREATEST SOURCE OF FRESH WATER AND ALL OF THE WORLD. I'M ACTUALLY DELIVERING FOR MICHIGAN. SO MANY MICHIGANDERS HAVE JOINED US IN THIS DYNAMIC POLITICIAN BUT FIGHT HAS ONLY EXCEEDED BY CHARACTER. THERE ARE SOME AMAZING WOMEN THAT ONE IN 2018 AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE REELECTED. I THINK WE'VE BEEN DELIVERED TO A MOVEMENT WHERE YOU CAN NOT ONLY DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. IF WE THINK BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH TO BUILD A FUTURE IN THIS NATION, MAKING HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, LOWERING DRUG PRICES AND ENSURING AND PROTECTING HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LIVE ON JUST MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. WE SHOULD BE BUILDING ON OBAMACARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. LEADING THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF OUR TIME AND THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE CLIMATE ACCORD AND I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS RE- JOIN THAT ACCORD AND SOME OF THE POLLUTERS IN THE UNITED STATES SAY IT'S TIME TO UP THE ANTE. WE ARE 15% OF THE WORLDS PROBLEMS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IF THEY DON'T, IT WON'T MATTER SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO DEMAND THE WHOLE WORLD COME WITH US TO ENSURE THE QUALITY SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON YOUR ZIP CODE. BY TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CALLED FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED. THERE IS 150,000 TEACHERS TODAY. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND COMPATIBLE WE WILL BE DOWN 2.5 MILLION EXCUSE ME, 300,000 BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2025. BAKING SURE IF WE DO THIS WE CAN SEND EVERY THREE, FOUR, 5-YEAR-OLD TO SCHOOL. REDUCING STUDENT AT BECAUSE IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN. ALL OF THOSE THAT ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE INCLUDING TEACHING THAT UP TO 50,000-DOLLAR REDUCTION AND TEACHING IN THEIR STUDENT DEBT. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHO WE HAVE TO BE. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD HAS TO CHANGE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS EMBRACED EVERY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT A JOKE. FROM PUTIN, WE'VE GOT TO REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES. I MEANT EVERY ONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO MAKE SURE MY JOB IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE SOLITARY ONE THAT WOULD TRADE PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES IF THEY COULD GUESS WHAT IT'S WE WILL HONOR THE COMMITMENT IF YOU PAY ME MORE MONEY. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ASIA WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AS WELL. THEY NEED US. [CHEERING] WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF SO MANY OF OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO ALSO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK BECAUSE LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA, YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND PLACE IN COMMUNITY AND THE OWN SELF-WORTH BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T THINK THEY CAN SAVE TO THEIR KIDS TODAY. GETTING CRUSHED. THE WORKING POOR ARE GETTING MORE POOR ON THE WAY UP. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL ABOUT DECENCY AND DIGNITY AND GIVING PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT. [CHEERING] I THOUGHT WHEN THEY CAME OUT CARRYING TORCHES CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE WHAT IT WAS LIKE A COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN I WROTE AN ARTICLE SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA AND WE REALLY ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IN ITS MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IT MEANS HAVING TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT DEFINE FOR ME BASED ON ETHNICITY AND GENDER, BASED ON RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. YOU CAN'T DO IT. WE ARE UNIQUE TO MOST UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON AN IDEA AND THEY ARE. IT DIVIDES US THE WAY THAT HE IS USING US TO SOW DIVISION OF ANGER. PRESIDENTS NOT ONLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT, THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO HEAL. [CHEERING] AND FOLKS, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS THAT ARE AIDING AND ABETTING BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE ARE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR WITH THE PARTY AND ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT IN FACT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE IS BY CRUSHING THE OTHER TEAM. FOLKS, WE CAN'T GET STUFF DONE IF WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO HEAL AND WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION OR ELSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO BE IN A JEOPARDY BEYOND WHAT IT IS NOW. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING AND OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY. LOOK AT THE WAY HE TALKS AND TREATS PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMONIZES PEOPLE AND RIDICULES PEOPLE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS. HE HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY AND ON OUR CHILDREN. THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTED WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE REPORTS IN SCHOOL OF KIDS MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR. SINGLING OUT EMIGRANTS FOR RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THIS MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TEACHERS TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IT ANY SURPRISE KIDS WOULD SAY THIS IS THE REPORT OF A STUDY DONE BY THE \"WASHINGTON POST,\" WHILE THE PRESIDENT. NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, WHETHER FOR GOOD OR BAD AND THE WORDS HE UTTERS HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT AND LOOK, FOLKS I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DONALD TRUMP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS READ ABOUT IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. [CHEERING] THE WORLD IS WATCHING LOOKING AT US INTO SAYING WHAT AND SAYING WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA. EMBRACE OUR ENEMIES, WALK AWAY FROM OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT SO THEY KNOW ONCE AGAIN THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED. THAT'S FOR OUR SECURITY ECONOMIC AS WELL AS SECURITY. FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE WATCHING AND IN THE YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS MOMENT AND SAY WHEN IT MATTERED MOST, WHAT DID THEY DO? DID IT SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY OR WERE THEY PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH FEAR IN THIS COUNTRY, SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IN FACT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS CALLED INTO QUESTION, WE NEED HONEST TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROVIDE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD TO BE SELF-EVIDENT AND FIGHT FOR THE NOTION THAT AMERICA HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD TO THIS NEW GENERATION. I VIEW MYSELF AS A BRIDGE, NOT AS ANYONE ELSE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE CANDIDACY IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAID I THAT I WANTED TO DO IT IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE DECLARATION AND THE CONSTITUTION WERE FIRST UNVEILED UNVEILED. ALTHOUGH WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SAVE EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENT AND MOVE THE ARK OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER. WE CAN'T LET IT SHUT DOWN. THE DAYS OF THE DIVISIVENESS ARE SOON GOING TO BE OVER. AND WHEN HE IS GONE WE WILL COME BACK WE ARE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK FROM ST. PATRICK'S DAY SO IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT I QUOTE HISTORY TEACHES US BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME IT RISES UP AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OPEN HISTORY RISE. WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE FAIL TO FAILED TO DO WHEN WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE AMERICANS CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND TRUTH OVER LIES. SO LET'S TAKE THIS BACK NOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. TAKE IT BACK. IT'S TIME. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] IT COMES OUT TO BE A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH WE HAVE ONE CANDIDATE STANDING UP TO THE WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT ELECTION.

BY THE WAY. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OUT THERE SUGGESTING THEY ARE SHOCKED AND APPALLED BY THIS, THEY SAW THE SAME INTELLIGENCE WE SAW. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY DID WHEN THEY SAW WHATEVER INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE REFERRING TO. THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION AS WELL. NOT JUST THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES, BY THE WAY. EVEN MORE BROADLY THAN THAT. WE TOOK THIS SERIOUSLY. WE HANDLED IT APPROPRIATELY. THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN SELLING SMALL ARMS TO PUT AMERICANS AT RISK THERE FOR 10 YEARS. WE'VE OBJECTED TO IT, TO YOUR POINT. WHEN I MEET WITH MY RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS I TALK TO THEM EACH TIME. STOP THIS. WE THINK WE HAVE A NOT PERFECT BUT SOMEWHAT OVERLAPPING OBJECTIVE IN AFGHANISTAN. IT'S ON THEIR DOORSTEP. WE KNOW THEY WERE ROUTED IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY HAVE AN OBJECTIVE THERE, TOO, TO REDUCE THE RISK OF TERRORISM THERE. SO, YES, MAYBE NOT EVERY TIME, BUT WITH GREAT FREQUENCY, WHEN I SPEAK TO MY RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS WE TALK ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT WE DON'T WANT THEM ENGAGED IN THIS. BUT IT'S , JUST SO EVERYBODY CAN , (music) THERE IS A MOVEMENT AT PLAY HERE AND THAT MOVEMENT DID NOT START A FEW WEEKS AGO. THAT MOVEMENT STARTED BEFORE EMMIT TILL. THAT MOVEMENT WAS ACTIVE AND AT PLAY DURING THE BEATING OF RODNEY KING. WE'RE PART OF A MOVEMENT THAT STARTED A LONG TIME AGO, AND THIS MOVEMENT WILL NOT BE DETERRED. (music) SO THE SPECIAL \"WASHINGTON POST\" LIVE WHICH IS A LIVE REPORTING OF MY PODCAST, I'M JOHN, OPINION WRITER FOR \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" AND MY GUEST IS RETURNING FOR THE FOURTH TIME TO THE PODCAST, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST MONTH, SENATOR HARRIS HAS CO-SPONSORED THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT, CO-AUTHORED THE BIPARTISAN HARRIS , HELPED INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION DENYING A TAX ON THE KAROLINA MUCHOVA AND HELP INTRODUCE THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT ACCOUNTABILITY DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. HARRIS IS THE FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN FRANCISCO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, MADE A RUN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, AND IS NOW TALKED ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL RUNNINGMATE FOR JOE BIDEN. RIGHT NOW, HARRIS IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE SENATE, IN THE SENATE DEBATE ON POLICE REFORM, AND SHE JOINS ME NOW. SENATOR HARRIS, WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE GET TO POLICE REFORM, WE HAVE TO GET TO INTELLIGENCE AND THE RUSSIA STORY OBTAINED BOUNTIES ON THE LIVES OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. YOU ATTENDED A BRIEFING REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS THAT RUSSIA WAS INVOLVED IN THIS. GIVEN WHAT YOU LEARNED, IS THE INTELLIGENCE , IS THE INTELLIGENCE IN DOUBT? I WOULD SAY THAT I, DURING THE COURSE OF MY THREE-PLUS YEARS OF BEING ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND, THEREFORE, IN REGULAR RECEIPT OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT THE THREATS TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND HOT SPOTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT I HAVE COME TO RESPECT, HIGHLY RESPECT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM, FOR THE DETAIL, AND THE PRECISION WITH WHICH THEY WORK AND THE ENORMITY OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH IS TO INFORM US AS POLICYMAKERS, TO INFORM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN A WAY WE CAN MAKE SMART DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION'S SECURITY. OK, GIVEN WHAT YOU LEARNED, IS IT CREDIBLE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS INTELLIGENCE, ABOUT THE RUSSIANS PAYING TALIBAN BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS? I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO SHARE WITH YOU CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT I WILL SAY THIS. IT IS WELL-KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD THAT PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO CONCERN HIMSELF OR HERSELF WITH THE WELL-BEING OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS WHO SACRIFICED AND ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES IN HONOR AND IN PROTECTION OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR SECURITY. AND IT WOULD BE , IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN AND EXPRESSES SOME LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT THEIR WELL-BEING. BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT WITH DONALD TRUMP IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. HE DOESN'T WANT , HE WANTS TO HAVE A MILITARY PARADE BUT THE REALITY IS, I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN, I'VE BEEN TO THESE HOT SPOTS, AND OUR FOLKS NEED A PRESIDENT AND A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO HAS THEIR BEST INTEREST AS HIS OR HER FIRST PRIORITY. WE JUST FRANKLY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP. SO GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND GIVEN THE BRIEFINGS YOU JUST ATTENDED, BUT ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT? IN MANY WAYS, I THINK THAT HE'S NOT , HE HAS NOT SHROUDED HIS TENURE AS PRESIDENT, PRIORITIZED WHAT'S IN THE PRESIDENTBEST INTEREST AND WELL-BEING. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS THE PANDEMIC. AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, DONALD TRUMP REFERRED TO IT AS A HOAX. HE SPENT FULL TIME TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT. HE'S ATTEMPTED TO MUZZLE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND TO DENY THE REALITIES OF THE HARM AND ALSO WHAT WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THE HARMS SUCH AS WEARING A MASK AND BASIC THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO STEM THE TIDE OF THIS VIRUS UNTIL WE GET A VACCINE. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT ON THE ISSUE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND THE FACT HE'S BEEN BASICALLY A SCIENCE DENIER. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FACTS, AGAIN, OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR, UNANIMOUS IN ITS FINDING OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT IN 2016. AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OR THE VERACITY OF THAT INFORMATION. SO WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES THAT TELL US THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT WELL EQUIPPED, IF AT ALL EQUIPPED, TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT TAKE ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA? I MEAN, THIS LATEST STORY ISN'T THE FIRST TIME RUSSIA HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT GOES COUNTER TO EITHER AMERICA'S INTERESTS OR THE INTERESTS OF THE NATO ALLIANCE. SO WHY WON'T HE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME OF THE EGREGIOUS THINGS THAT THEY'VE DONE? I CAN'T SPECULATE OR GET INTO THE MIND OF DONALD TRUMP. AND I THINK, FRANKLY, I'M TOO BUSY LOOKING AT WHAT HE'S DOING TO WORRY ABOUT HOW HE'S THINKING. THE FACT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS ACTIONS AND HIS CONDUCT, HE'S NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN ADVERSARY, A LONG-STANDING ADVERSARY, WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES AND CLEARLY INCAPABLE OF SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE RESPONSE THAT OUR COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE WHEN WE ARE ATACTED , ATTACKED IN ANY FORM. SENATOR, ARE YOU SURPRISED THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE SILENCE FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY? WELL, YOU KNOW, JONATHAN, I WAS ELECTED BITTERSWEET ON THE SAME EVENING AS DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED. SO I'VE ONLY KNOWN ONE SENATE AND THAT'S THE SENATE WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. AND IT HAS BEEN TROUBLING. IT HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF SADNESS AND FRUSTRATION TO SEE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE NOT STAND UP IN A WAY THAT I BELIEVE THEY WOULD IF PERHAPS DONALD TRUMP WEREN'T PRESIDENT. I DON'T , I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AT SOME POINT WE EACH CAN'T FEEL COMPELLED TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY. SO IT IS DEEPLY TROUBLING, AND WE NEED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES LIKE NATIONAL SECURITY THAT IT SHOULD BE NONPARTISAN. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC AND CRISIS WHERE ALMOST 130,000 LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST 100 DAYS THAT WE SHOULD ALL STAND UP AND LOOK AT THE NEED FOR OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT SEES THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING AND FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE POLITICAL PRIORITIES OR THREATS OF A PRESIDENT. SENATOR, LET'S TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS GOING TO BE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AND THAT WAS ON POLICE REFORM. SENATOR TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA WAS LEADING THE REPUBLICAN , LEADING THE REPUBLICAN EFFORT ON THEIR JUSTICE ACT. BUT YOU, ALONG WITH SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER AND SENATOR COREY BOOKER OF NEW JERSEY, YOU SIGNED A LETTER TO THE MAJORITY LEADER SAYING THE JUSTICE ACT WAS, QUOTE, IS NOT SALVAGEABLE. WHY , WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE LEGISLATION PROPOSED BY SENATOR SCOTT AND WHY WASN'T IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOU TO GET IN A ROOM AND NEGOTIATE A DEAL SINCE THERE IS PUBLIC SENTIMENT BEHIND DOING SOMETHING TO REFORM THE POLICE? RECALL THE CHRONOLOGY OF THIS. WHICH IS THAT SENATOR BOOKER AND I PROPOSED ON THE SENATE SIDE, ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS ON THE HOUSE SIDE, AND THEN IT WAS JOINED BY SENATE DEMOCRATS AND SENATE DEMOCRATS IN THE , DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE SIDE A BILL. WE CAME UP WITH A BILL CALLED THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT, WHICH WOULD DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT RELATES TO THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BREAK THE RULES AND BREAK THE LAW. NINE DAYS LATER, NINE DAYS LATER, THE REPUBLICANS SUBMIT THIS BILL THAT ESSENTIALLY DEALT WITH NOTHING IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY THAT WE DEALT WITH IN OUR BILL. IN OUR BILL, FOR EXAMPLE, WE BANNED CHOKEHOLDS AND KROTIC HOLD , KRAD I HAD HOLDS. NO-KNOCK WARRANTS. IF THAT WERE IN EFFECT, BRIE BRIE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. , BREONNA TAYLOR WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. AND WHEN AN OFFICER USES EXCESSIVE FORCE, THE QUESTION WOULD NOT BE, WAS THAT USE OF FORCE REASONABLE? BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN REASON AWAY ANYTHING. THE QUESTION IS, WAS THAT USE OF FORCE NECESSARY? WE DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF VARYERY SPECIFIC ISSUES. WE SAY THERE SHOULD BE PATTERN IN PRACTICE INVESTIGATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEY SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH SUBPOENA POWER SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE THEY HAVE THE TOOL TO DO THE INVESTIGATION. THE REPUBLICAN BILL, BY CONTRAST, DID NOT BAN CHOKEHOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS AND NO McKNOCK WARRANTS , NO-KNOCK WARRANTS IN DRUG CASES, INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND THE NEED FOR THOSE AND INSTEAD TALKS ABOUT A BUNCH OF STUDIES AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO HAVE CONVERSATION. LOOK, WE'RE GOING , WE'VE BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS FOR DECADES NOW. THIS IS A TIME TO ACT AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. PEOPLE WHO SEEMINGLY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHO HAVE BEEN MARCHING TOGETHER KNOWING WE CANNOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA AND WE NEED TO REFORM THIS SYSTEM IN TANGIBLE WAYS, NOT JUST GIVING IT LIP SERVICE, BUT ACTUALLY PUTTING SOME TEETH INTO THIS. WELL, SENATOR, BECAUSE POLICING ISN'T DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, IT'S BEEN DONE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL, YOU'RE MORE POWERFUL AS D.A. OF SAN FRANCISCO OR ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA THAN YOU ARE NOW AS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. IF YOU WERE EITHER OF THOSE POSITIONS RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT, WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU COULD DO SUBSTANTIVELY TO REFORM THE POLICE? WELL, IT'S A NUMBER OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. EVERYTHING THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO YOU IS ABOUT CREATING NATIONAL STANDARDS. AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY REGULATE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT ALSO CREATES A NATIONAL STANDARD TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL ACTIVISTS OR THE PROGRESSIVE PROSECUTORS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS WHO KNOW THAT'S WHERE THEY NEED TO GET AND THEY NEED , SOME MORE REINFORCEMENT TO ACTUALLY GET THEIR POLICIES TO THAT STANDARD. AND SO THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE MAJORITY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORK IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT DOESN'T ABSOLVE A NEED FOR NATIONAL STANDARDS TO, AGAIN, CREATE A STANDARD BY WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD BE MEASURED. SO SENATOR, THIS SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW REMINDS ME OF GUN CONTROL , THE GUN CONTROL ENVIRONMENT IN THE WAKE OF NEWTOWN WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE BETWEEN PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE AND YET NOTHING WAS DONE. I'M GETTING THE FEELING THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE HERE. ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS COULD BE AND IT MIGHT BE THE CASE TO FLIP THE SENATE, TO HAVE THE DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. AND I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM PENNSYLVANIA, FROM KATHRYN, AND SHE ASKS POINT BLANK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP FLIP THE SENATE? YEAH. SO KATHRYN, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE AS DEMOCRATS ARE NOT IN THE MAJORITY. AND IT IS REALLY BASIC ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AROUND CAPITOL HILL IN THE SENATE. IF YOU'RE IN THE MAJORITY, YOU GET TO WRITE THE RULES. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT BILLS ARE GOING TO COME UP FOR VOTES. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHO WILL END UP SERVING LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS ON THE FEDERAL COURTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POWER IN WHO HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. SO YOU ARE RIGHT. WE ARE NOW IN THE MINORITY, WHICH MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THESE THINGS. AND WE NEED TO FLIP THE SENATE SO WE CAN GET IN THE MAJORITY SO WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE THAT IS ABOUT MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM, SO THAT WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION UP FOR A VOTE THAT IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, SO WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION THAT IS ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE AROUND THE PASSAGE OF CREATING A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR IMMIGRANTS. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. HOW DO WE DO IT? WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE SENATE CANDIDATES WHO ARE GOING TO TURN RED STATES BLUE. I HAVE A LIST OF WHO THEY ARE. I HAVE BEEN HOSTING A LOT OF THE NEW CANDIDATES WHO ARE CHALLENGING INCURVENTS AS A WAY , INCUMBENTS AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE THEM BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE THAT THE NEW CANDIDATES ARE HAVING, THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING WITHOUT PLANNING FOR IT IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC SO THEY CAN'T TRAVEL. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEEK THEM OUT. BUT LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND ELECT JOE BIDEN PRESIDENT AND WE'VE GOT TO FLIP THE SENATE BECAUSE THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY SEE PROGRESS IN OUR COUNTRY. TOWO QUICK QUESTIONS. I KNOW YOU HAVE A HARD OUT AND HAVE TO GO. WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS STILL TRYING TO UNDO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC? JUST SPEAKS TO THE HEARTLESSNESS OF THE PROPOSAL AND PERSPECTIVE. FROM DAY ONE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THEY , AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO UNDO WHATEVER SUCCESS AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WAS ACHIEVED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. AND SO THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT REPEALING AND REPLACE. THERE'S BEEN NO PLAN WHATSOEVER FOR REPLACE. IT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET RID OF A PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVE THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. AND TO YOUR POINT, RIGHT NOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS BILL BARR AND THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY WIN, 23 MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND IT WILL ALSO, THEN, ALLOW THE BANS ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT WE HAD BEFORE. SO THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED NOW OVER 128,000 PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE HEARTLESSNESS, IT SPEAKS TO THE MOTIVATIONS THAT IS ABOUT POLITICAL GAIN AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY. FINAL QUESTION. SHAMALA WAS 19 WHEN SHE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM INDIA TO GET A DOCTORATE AT BERKLEY. SHE BECAME A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE DIED OF CANCER IN 2009, AND SHE WAS YOUR MOTHER. YOU WROTE IN YOUR BOOK, TRUTH BE HOLD, THAT YOU AND YOUR SISTER, MAYA, QUOTE, RARELY EARNED PRAISE FOR BEHAVIOR OR ACHIEVEMENTS THAT WERE EXPECTED. SO FINAL QUESTION TO YOU, SENATOR. WHAT WOULD SHE SAY ABOUT ALL THE TALK THAT HER DAUGHTER COULD BE TAPPED TO BE JOE BIDEN'S RUNNINGMATE AND POSSIBLY THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS , AND I, THEREFORE, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU INSTEAD OF LOOKING TO THE THING OVER THERE BECAUSE THE THING IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION. AND RIGHT NOW MY FOCUS, THEREFORE, IS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO AROUND ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS, IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT, ECONOMIC IMPACT. MY FOCUS IS PASSING THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT. THESE ARE THE THINGS FRONT AND CENTER. THESE ARE THE THINGS CAUSING PEOPLE TOO STAND IN BREAD LINES AND MARCHING IN THE STREET. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON. AND MY MOTHER WAS VERY PRACTICAL. YOU'VE NOT MET A MORE PRACTICAL PERSON IN YOUR LIFE. SHE WAS A FIGHTER AND SHE WAS PRACTICAL. AND SHE WOULD SAY, BABY, JUST FOCUS ON WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AS THE NEXT THING, WHATEVER THAT'S MEANT TO BE, WILL COME.

HER STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND MANY PARTICULARS, BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT IN THE ESSENTIALS. SHE HAS WORKED HARD, SHE HAS NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE, AND SHE HAS EARNED EACH AND EVERY OF THE ACCOLADES AND ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SHE HAS GAINED, MANY OF THEM OFTEN IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES THAT OTHERS PUT IN HER WAY, BUT NEVER QUIT. THIS MORNING, ALL ACROSS THE NATION, LITTLE GIRLS WOKE UP, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS, WHO SO OFTEN FEEL OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, BUT TODAY , TODAY, JUST MAYBE, THEY ARE SEEING THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A NEW WAY, AS THE STUFF OF PRESIDENTS AND VICE PRESIDENTS. IN HER CAMPAIGN IN THE PRIMARY, KAMALA OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA, THE MOMS AND DADS AWAKE LATE AT NIGHT IN THEIR KITCHENS, WORRIED, SCARED, UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO SIMPLY MAKE IT. GROWING UP IN SCRANTON IN CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I SAW THAT STRUGGLE WITH MY FAMILY AS WELL AS HE KAMALA SAW IT WITH HERS AS WELL. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING THAT STRUGGLE AS WE SPEAK, ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY JOBS LOST. KAMALA AND I BOTH KNOW JUST GIVE ME A SHOT, A FAIR SHOT. A SHOT AT MAKING IT. AND IT WILL BE THE WORK OF OUR ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THEY GET A FAIR SHOT. WORKING FAMILIES NEED SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE IN THIS NATION, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE PRESIDENT NOW ON THEIR SIDE. THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN A BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. IT IS GOING TO BE GRATIFYING TO SEE THE STRONG, ENTHUSIASTIC REACTION TO SENATOR HARRIS AS OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT COMES FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT IS ALREADY OCCURRING. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ALL IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS, ALL BACKGROUNDS. EVENTS, WE ARE PREDICTABLE AND SOME OF THEM. IT COMES FROM ALL OTHER EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE AND HIS ALLIES. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. YOU COULD HAVE SET YOUR WATCH IS TO IT. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY STARTED HIS ATTACKS, CALLING KAMALA NASTY, WHINING ABOUT SHE IS MEAN TO HER APPOINTEES. IT IS NO SURPRISE, BECAUSE WHINING IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES BEST, BETTER THAN ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. IS ANYONE SURPRISED DONALD TRUMP AS A PROBLEM WITH A STRONG WOMAN OR WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD? LET'S BE CLEAR. IF YOU ARE A WORKING PERSON WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL HAVE A JOB TO GO TO, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR MORTGAGE, YOUR RENT, WORRIED ABOUT THE POISON IN THE AIR YOU BREATHE, THE WATER YOU DRINK, WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS, YOUR RIGHTS TO BASIC DIGNITY, WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK BY THIS ADMINISTRATION, KAMALA HARRIS HAS HAD YOUR BACK, AND NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE HER BACK. SHE IS GOING TO STAND WITH ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR HER. ON JANUARY 20, 2021, WE WILL WATCH SENATOR HARRIS RAISE HER RIGHT HAND AND SWEAR THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO SERVE AS THE SECOND HIGHEST OFFICE IN AMERICA, IN THIS LAND. AND THEN WE WILL GET TO WORK FIXING THE MESS THAT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE CREATED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND MODELING OF TERRORISTS AND THUGS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT ONLY WILL AMERICA DIG ITSELF OUT OF HIS HOLD A PUT US IN, WE WILL BUILD BACK. WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. KAMALA HARRIS IS IN COURT , DONALD IS IN COURT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH HEALTH CARE. I 165,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND CLIMBING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COVID-19, AND STILL MONTHS LATER, NO REAL LEADERSHIP OR PLAN FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOW TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. NO REAL HELP FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO FILL THE VACUUM OF LEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. NO REAL HELP FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FRONT-LINE WORKERS HOLDING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MAKING PROMISES THAT IN THE END WILL DEFUND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM WHILE INSISTING THAT THIS VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR. THE JOE BIDEN KAMALA HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF COVID-19 AND TURNED THE CORNER ON THIS PANDEMIC. MASKING, CLEAR SCIENCE-BASED GUIDANCE, DRAMATICALLY SCALING UP TESTING, GETTING STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES SAFELY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WILLING TO LEAD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. NOT AS THIS PRESIDENT SAYS, IT IS NOT MY FAULT. THE GOVERNORS SHOULD THANK ME MORE. AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, GIVE ME A BREAK. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS, 16 MILLION STILL OUT OF WORK. DONALD TRUMP IS ON TRACK TO BREAK ANOTHER RECORD, ON TRACK TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH THE WORST JOBS RECORD OF ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY, BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK, MEETING FACE-TO-FACE WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN A CRISIS TO GET AMERICANS THE RELIEF THEY NEED AND DESERVE, DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE GOLF COURSE. IF I TOLD YOU THIS THREE YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS BEING CRAZY. HE HAS NOT EVEN MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME, IT APPEARS. WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE. WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, ALL WE HEAR IS THE WORD HOAX. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MEET THE CLIMATE CRISIS, PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND ALONG THE WAY, WE WILL DELIVER ONE WORD, JOBS. GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP SEEKS ONLY TO INFLAME IT WITH THIS POLITICS OF RACIST RHETORIC AND APPEALS TO THE VISION. TODAY IS NOT ONLY THE DAY I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE OF THE PARTY, IT IS ALSO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SEE THOSE NEO-NAZIS AND THOSE KLANSMEN, WHITE SUPREMACISTS COMING OUT OF FIELDS CARRYING LIGHTED TORCHES, FACES CONTORTED, BULGING VEINS, POURING INTO THE STREETS OF HISTORIC AMERICAN CITIES SPEWING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BIO WE HEARD IN HITLER'S GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT TO SEE A VIOLENT CLASH ENSUE BETWEEN THOSE CELEBRATING HATE AND THOSE STANDING AGAINST IT? IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR ALL OF US AS A COUNTRY, FOR ME, A CALL TO ACTION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY AT SILENCE IS COMPLICITY, NOT ORIGINAL TO HIM, BUT HE BELIEVED IT. I KNEW I COULD NOT STAND BY AND LET DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO WENT ON TO SAY WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE HIM CONTINUE TO ATTACK EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA. I KNEW WE WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO RUN. I AM PROUD NOW TO HAVE SENATOR HARRIS AT MY SIDE IN THAT BATTLE , BECAUSE SHE SHARES THE SAME INTENSITY I DO. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE. THE QUESTION IS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO ANSWER, WHO ARE WE AS A NATION? WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE? YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE BARRIERS WE PLACE ON OUR OWN IMAGINATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING AMERICANS CANNOT ACHIEVE WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE KAMALA AS WE BOTH BELIEVE WE CAN DIVIDE AMERICA SIMPLY IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. POSSIBILITIES, THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT SETS THIS NATION APART IS THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, THE ABILITY FOR EVERYONE, AND WE MEAN EVERYONE TO GO AS FAR A DREAM AS BIG AS HARD WORK AND THEIR GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. WHEN I AGREED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RUNNING MATE, HE ASKED ME A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED KAMALA. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME, HE ASKED WHAT I WANTED, MOST IMPORTANTLY? I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM BEFORE HE MADE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT IS WHAT I ASKED KAMALA. I ASKED HER TO BE THE LAST VOICE OF THE ROOM, TO ALWAYS TELL ME THE TRUTH, AND SHE WILL. CHALLENGE MY ASSUMPTIONS IF SHE DISAGREES. ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE WAY WE MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME AT MY HOME TODAY WITH KAMALA AND DOUG, AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THANK THEM PUBLICLY FOR AGREEING TO JOIN AND TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH JILL AND ME. DOUG, YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BARRIER BREAKER YOURSELF IN THIS JOB YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE ON. AMERICA'S FIRST SECOND GENTLEMAN , AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY, I WANT TO THANK ELLEN AND COAL AS WELL. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DOUG'S MOM AND DAD, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET OUR KIDS TOGETHER TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS COMING. MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ABOUT THE AGE OF THEIR CHILDREN. I GOT TO SPEAK TO THEM. MY CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY AFFAIR, EVERY CAMPAIGN I HAVE RUN, SO I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU. YOU ARE ALL HONORARY BIDENS. HERE IS THE BEST PART. YOU HAVE BEEN AN HONORARY BIDENS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I CAME FIRST TO KNOW WHO KAMALA THROUGH OUR SON BEAU BIDEN. THEY WERE FRIENDS. THEY SERVED AS ATTORNEYS GENERAL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY TOOK ON THE SAME BIG FIGHTS TOGETHER. KAMALA IN CALIFORNIA, BO IN DELAWARE. BIG FIGHTS THAT HELP CHANGE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH BEAU RESPECTED KAMALA AND HER WORK. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME AS I MADE THIS DECISION. NOW WE NEED TO GET TO WORK PULLING THIS NATION OUT OF THESE CRISES WE FIND OURSELVES IN. ENDING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, UNITING THIS NATION, AND WINNING THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME YOUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS . THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JOE. AS I SAID WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. AFTER THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRIMARY IN HISTORY, THE COUNTRY RECEIVED A RESOUNDING MESSAGE THAT JOE WAS THE PERSON TO LEAD US FORWARD, AND I AM SO PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU, AND I DO SO MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE HEROIC AND AMBITIOUS WOMEN BEFORE ME WHOSE SACRIFICE, DETERMINATION, AND RESILIENCE MAKES MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY EVEN POSSIBLE. THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT, OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. WE ARE REALLY , REALLY , REELING FROM THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PLUNGED US INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MORAL RECKONING WITH RACISM AND SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE THAT HAS BROUGHT A NEW COALITION OF CONSCIENCE TO THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRY DEMANDING CHANGE. AMERICA IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, YET WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, A PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE, BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FAILED GOVERNMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE. IN JUST 83 DAYS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHOOSE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO, JOE, DR. BIDEN, THANK YOU FOR THE TRUST YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. JILL, I KNOW YOU WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY, AND MY HUSBAND DOUG AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL TO BECOME A PART OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. EVER SINCE I RECEIVED JO'S CALL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING, YES, ABOUT THE FIRST BIDEN I REALLY CAME TO KNOW, AND THAT OF COURSE IS JO'S BELOVED SON BEAU. IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BEAU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WORKING TOGETHER TO WIN BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS FROM THE BIG BANKS OF THE NATION THAT WERE FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEAU BIDEN, I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT BEAU WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO INSPIRED PEOPLE TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF THEMSELVES. HE REALLY WAS THE BEST OF US. WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOVE THAT THEY SHARED WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF THE LOVE BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON. AND BEAU TALKED ABOUT HOW JOE WOULD SPEND EVERY DAY WRITING THE RAILS FROM WILMINGTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SO HE COULD MAKE BREAKFAST FOR HIS KIDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME TO TUCK THEM IN BED EACH NIGHT. ALL OF THIS SO TWO LITTLE BOYS: I JUST LOST THEIR MOM AND SISTER IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT WOULD KNOW THAT THE WORLD WAS STILL TURNING, AND THAT IS HOW I CAME TO KNOW JOE. HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH IS NEVER TO THINK ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HE IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER ASKED, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME, AND INSTEAD ASKS, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU? IS EMPATHY, HIS COMPUTER , HIS EMPATHY, AND HIS COMPASSION, AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR OTHERS IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON THIS TICKET. JOE AND I, YES, WE ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR AMERICA TO GET TO KNOW MY HUSBAND DOUG AND OUR AMAZING KIDS, BECAUSE WHETHER I AM CHEERING IN THE BLEACHERS AT A SWIM MEET WERE SETTING UP A COLLEGE ROOM DOOR OR HELPING MY GODDAUGHTER PREPARE FOR MY SCHOOL , FOR HER SCHOOL DEBATE OR BUILDING LEGOS WITH MY GODSON OR HUGGING MY TWO BABY NIECES OR COOKING DINNER, SUNDAY DINNER, MY FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TITLES OVER MY CAREER, AND CERTAINLY VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE GREAT, BUT MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE THAT MEANS THE MOST. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY CAME FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WORLD TO ARRIVE IN AMERICA. ONE FROM INDIA, AND THE OTHER FROM JAMAICA IN SEARCH OF A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, BUT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S, AND THAT IS HOW THEY MET, AS STUDENTS IN THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TODAY. I WAS PART OF IT. MY PARENTS WOULD BRING ME TO PROTESTS STRAPPED TIGHTLY IN MY STROLLER, AND MY MOTHER RAISED MY SISTER MAIA AND ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS UP TO US AND EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO KEEP ON MARCHING. SHE WOULD TELL US, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS, DO SOMETHING. SO I DID SOMETHING. I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MAKING REAL THE WORDS CARVED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. ADD 30 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREATHED DEEP AND UTTERED THE PHRASE THAT WOULD TRULY GUIDE MY CAREER AND THE REST OF MY CAREER, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, THAT IS WHO I HAVE REPRESENTED AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS WHO NEEDED HELP, THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO I VOTE FOR IS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN I TOOK ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAFFIC AND GUNS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO LIFT HAVE FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHERE I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE ARE WHO JOE AND I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PRESENTED MY FAIR SHARE OF ARGUMENTS IN COURT, THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE IS OPEN AND SHUT. JUST LOOK AT THEY HAVE GOTTEN US. MORE THAN 16 MILLION OUT OF WORK , MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL, A CRISIS OF PROPERTY, HOMELESSNESS INFLICTING BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE MOST. A CRISIS OF HUNGER INFLICTING ONE IN A FIVE MOTHERS WHO HAVE CHILDREN'S WHO ARE HUNGRY, AND TRAGICALLY, MORE THAN A 165,000 LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT. MANY WITH LOVED ONES WHO NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT HEALTH CRISIS. IT WAS CALLED EBOLA, AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEN? BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN DID THEIR JOBS. ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIE, TWO. THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. COMPARE THAT TO THE MOMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, TRUMP PUSHED MIRACLE CURES TO SELL ON FOX NEWS. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE FLATTENING THE CURVES, HE SAID THE VIRUS WOULD JUST, PROOF , POOF, GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN BACK OF HER BUSINESS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN. THIS VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A REASON IT HAS HIT AMERICA WORSE THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS , TRUMP'S FAILURE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE START. HIS REFUSAL TO GET TESTING UP AND RUNNING, AND FLIP-FLOPPING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. IT IS DELUSIONAL BELIEF THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE EXPERTS. ALL OF THAT IS REASON, THE RECENT THAT AN AMERICAN DIES OF COVID-19 EVERY 80 SECONDS. IT IS WHY COUNTLESS BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IT IS WHY THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS OVER WHEN AND HOW TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS ARE CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN AND ANGRY ABOUT CHILDCARE AND TO SAFETY OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL, WHETHER THEY WILL BE IN DANGER IF THEY GO OR FALL BEHIND IF THEY DO NOT. TRUMP IS ALSO THE REASON IT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED. HE INHERITED THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN HISTORY FROM BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN, AND THEN, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF TRUMPS FAILURES , TRUMP'S FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OUT OF ALL OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT HAS TRIPLED AS OF TODAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ELECT THE GUY WHO JUST IS NOT UP FOR THE JOB. OUR COUNTRY ENDS UP IN TATTERS, AND SO DOES OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP OR MIKE PENCE, IT IS ABOUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY BACK BETTER. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION, BRING BRACK , BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO EVERYONE HAS THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINALLY OFFERED CAREGIVERS THE DIGNITY, THE RESPECT, AND THE PAY THEY DESERVE. WE WILL PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY, WROTE OUT SYSTEMIC , ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PASS A JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO JOE. IT IS LIKE YOU GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, WHY HE HELPED REAUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RESTORE UNEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWS. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN THE ONGOING STORY OF AMERICA'S MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS THE ONLY, AS THE ONLY WAY SERVED ALONGSIDE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND HAS CHOSEN THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. BUT AS JOE ALWAYS POINTS OUT, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. I WILL ADMIT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I HAVE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WHENEVER I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR DOUBT, WHENEVER I HAVE HAD MY OWN DOUBTS, I THINK OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING YOUR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS, THE TRUCK DRIVERS AND WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, IN FACTORIES, FARMS WORKING THERE, PUTTING YOUR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE TO UP US GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, THE WOMEN AND STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS , THE DREAMERS AND IMMIGRANTS WHO KNOW THAT FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER, THE LGBTQ AMERICANS WHO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS LOVE, PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE AND COLOR AND GREAT YOU FINALLY DECLARING IN ONE VOICE, BLACK LIVES MATTER . ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY , THIS COUNTRY, A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS HEARING UP , GROWING UP HEARING THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE AND CHANTS OF HOPE ON WHICH I WAS RAISED, SOME STRAPPED INTO STROLLERS OF THEIR OWN. IT IS A SONG YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. TO EVERYONE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GREAT. YOU ARE THE HEROES OF OUR TIME, AND YOU ARE THE REASON. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY CLOSER TO REALIZING IT'S GREAT PROMISE. TO DO IT, WE WILL NEED TO WORK, ORGANIZE AND VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED MORE THAN A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. WE NEED A MANDATE THAT PROVES THE PAST FOUR YEARS ARE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. JOE LIKES TO SAY THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT, AND IT IS TRUE. WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, Q KNEW WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. TOGETHER WITH YOUR HELP, IT IS A BATTLE WE WILL WIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER JOE ASKED ME TO DO. NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SAME. VISIT JOB, JOEBIDEN.COM. ELECTING JOE BIDEN IS JUST THE START OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE BUT DECIDED RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU, THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

VISIT NCICAP.ORG] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2020] GOOD AFTERNOON. ON THE EVE OF THE 57TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON, I WILL SPEAK ABOUT RECENT EVENTS IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA COAST TOMORROW , AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN. THE STORM WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH TEXAS, LOUISIANA, AND THE GULF COAST, AND MOST OF ALL, WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. WE ARE A NATION AT ITS BEST LOVES, PROTECTS, AND HELPS FELLOW AMERICANS. TODAY, WE SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION. WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STAY SAFE. JOE AND I PLEDGE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THOSE WHO NEED HELP FROM NEIGHBORS, STRANGERS, AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT THROUGH, TO RESTORE YOUR LIVES AND COMMUNITY. WE ALSO SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF YET ANOTHER BLACK MAN SHOT BY POLICE. JACOB BLAKE SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. SEVEN TIMES, IN THE BACK, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN PUT IT, THE SHOTS FIRED AT MR. BLAKE PIERCED THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS SICKENING TO WATCH. IT IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT MUST END. THANKFULLY, HE IS ALIVE TODAY BUT HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WHEN HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILY AS THEY ENDURE THE ORDEAL THAT IS TRAGICALLY COMMON IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE AND I SPOKE WITH THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ARE AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, EVEN AS THEY SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEIR SON, THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED TO END THE VIOLENCE AND HEAL OUR NATION. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FAR TOO MANY MOTHERS AND FATHERS. YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR NO ONE WITH MORE COURAGE, MORE CHARACTER, AND MORE MORAL CLARITY. PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AND EXHAUSTED. AFTER THE MURDERS OF RIHANNA, AND SO MANY OTHERS, IT IS NO WONDER PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. I SUPPORT THEM. WE MUST ALWAYS DEFEND PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THEM WITH LOOTING AND COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER, WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE WILL NOT LET VIGILANTES AND EXTREMISTS DERAIL THE PATH TO JUSTICE. HERE IS MY PROMISE TO THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND THOSE WHO STAND WITH THEM. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE, IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ALL GREW UP CITING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE BUT NOW, WE MUST GIVE REAL MEETING , MEANING TO HIS WORDS. ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE, FOR ALL. JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE LIFE OF A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS FULLY HUMAN. WE HAVE YET TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM AND BROADER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE WILL ONLY COME CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARD BUILDING A PERFECT UNION BUT THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD. EVEN AS THEY WE HAVE A RECKONING WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE, WE MUST ALSO CONFRONT ANOTHER CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS TORN APART SO MANY LIVES. WE CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR ALLOW OURSELVES TO SUCCUMB TO THEM. NEARLY 6 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS. 180,000 LIVES LOST. MORE THAN 50 MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR ALONE. WE NEED TO SEE AND HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. HOPING FOOD BANKS HAVE SOMETHING LEFT WHEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE 50-YEAR-OLD STORE MANAGER WHO HAS BEEN LAID OFF AND KNOWS HE CANNOT PAY THE RENT AND THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. MOTHERS AND FATHERS STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT, WORKING FROM HOME, WHILE HELPING THEIR KIDS WITH ONLINE CLASSES. TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY. THE NURSE, GETTING READY FOR HER AFTERNOON SHIFT, GIVEN SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH IN RECENT MONTHS, WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE SHE COULD BEAR TO WITNESS. THE FAMILY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR MOTHER. COULD NOT EVEN VISIT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF HER LIFE. THE ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE AT WHICH BLACKS AND LATINOS AND INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE CONTRACTING AND DYING OF COVID-19. THAT IS THE REALITY NOW. A REALITY COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THIS WEEK'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR I'D ABOUT THE CHALLENGE WE WERE FACING AND HOW TO TACKLE THEM, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SOOTH DONALD TRUMP'S EGO. TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. HERE'S THE THING. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HIM. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BY THAT MEASURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENCY. HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THE PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY A STAND TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED AT THE MOST BASIC JOB OF THE UNITED STATES. HE FAILED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. TRUMP SHOWED THAT WE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION WOULD CALL A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE DANGER A PANDEMIC WOULD PROPOSE FOR AMERICAN LIVES, FOR THE DEVASTATION IT WOULD DO TO OUR , TO OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM FOR GENERATIONS. FOR THE CHAOS THAT WOULD UPEND OUR DAILY LIVES, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL. HE NEVER APPRECIATED A PRESIDENT SWEARS AN OATH BEFORE GOD AND COUNTRY TO PROTECT AMERICA AGAINST THREATS SEEN AND UNSEEN. IT IS HIS DUTY, IT IS HIS OBLIGATION TO PROTECT US. AND YET HE HAS FAILED, MISERABLY. HERE IS THE THING. DONALD TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE IS NOTHING NEW. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON FULL DISPLAY. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, IT BECAME DEADLY. THAT IS WHEN THE THREAT OF A VIRUS THAT WOULD ENDANGER THE WORLD FIRST EMERGED. TRUMP DISMISSED THE THREAT, BUT JOE BIDEN SOUNDS THE ALARM. IT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A PATTERN THAT PERSISTS TO THIS DAY. TRUMP TELLING US NOT TO WORRY, THAT THE VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR, THAT A MIRACLE IS COMING. JOE BIDEN SAYING WE NEED A PLAN, IN NATIONAL STRATEGY, A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD , WILLING TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OUR NATION, FOR OUR CHILDREN. TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. JOE BIDEN RELEASED HIS FIRST PLAN IN MARCH. AND HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS RELENTLESS. YOU CANNOT STOP IT WITH A TWEET. YOU CANNOT CREATE A DISTRACTION AND HOPE IT WILL GO AWAY. IT DOES NOT GO AWAY. BY ITS NATURE, IT PANDEMIC IS UNFORGIVING. IF YOU GET IT WRONG AT THE BEGINNING, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CATASTROPHIC. IT IS VERY HARD TO CATCH UP AND YOU DO NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT IT WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. THEN HE GOT IT WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. HERE IS WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN SO UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS. HE WAS ON FIXATING , FIXING THE PROBLEM. HE SAID IT WOULD HURT THE MARKET AND HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. THAT MATTERED TO HIM MORE THAN SAVING AMERICAN LIVES. RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE NEEDED DONALD TRUMP TO BE TOUGH ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, HE CAVED. ON JANUARY 24, HE PRAISED THE PIT , THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID CHINA HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO DETAIN THE CORONAVIRUS. THE UNITED STATES GREATLY AND , APPRECIATES THEIR EFFORTS AND TRANSPARENCY AND IT WILL ALL END WELL. THEY BLOCKED PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS FROM OUR CDC INNING ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP STOOD IDLY BY AND IT WAS A DEADLY DECISION. DONALD TRUMP FROZE. HE WAS SCARED. AND HE WAS PETTY AND FIGMENT IT , AND VINDICTIVE. HE TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT HIS JOB TO GIVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS. HE SAYS, \"RESPIRATORS, VENTILATORS, ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, TRY GETTING IT YOURSELVES.\" ON THAT DAY WE HAVE , TODAY, WE HAVE NEARLY 6 MILLION. EVEN NOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL NOT ACT. THE TRAGEDY IN ALL OF THIS IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. JUST LOOK AROUND. IT IS NOT LIKE THIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. ALL WE NEEDED, GUYS, ALL WE NEEDED WAS A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. ONE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN. WILLING TO LEAD. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, HAVE A PLAN. DO THEIR JOBS. JOE BIDEN WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. HE HAS GOT A NATIONAL STRATEGY. HE IS MORE THAN READY TO LEAD. EVERY MONTH SINCE MARCH, AS THE PANDEMIC HAS UNFOLDED, JOE BIDEN HAS UPDATED STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES AND HE HAS DONE IT BASED ON WHAT EVERY SCIENTIST, EXPERT, AND ECONOMIST SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING. JOE BIDEN WILL PUT A PLAN INTO EFFECT ON DAY ONE, DEPLOY RAPID TESTS WITH IMMEDIATE RESULTS, MAKE SURE TREATMENTS AND ULTIMATELY, A VACCINE, REACH ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHICH HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. MANUFACTURER THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED AND MAKE THEM RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA SO WE ARE NEVER AGAIN AT THE MERCY OF CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. JOE AND I WILL MAKE SURE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE OPEN AND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND NOT SILENCE THE EXPERTS SO PUBLIC GETS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. AND PUT IN PLACE A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE. IT IS NOT A BURDEN TO PROTECT EACH OTHER. HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT JOE IS, HE KNOWS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT ALL OF THIS DEATH. BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN HAD A PROGRAM CALLED PROTECT. THE PROGRAM TRACKED EMERGING DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. TRUMP CUT IT. THEY CREATED THAT TEAM IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, DEDICATING THEM TO THE WORK IN BIO DEFENSE. THEY IMPLEMENTED STANZEL , STANDARDS TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL. DONALD TRUMP IS ERASING THEM. BEFORE THE VIRUS HIT, TRUMP MADE US VULNERABLE. HE FAILED TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AS IT CONTINUES, HE IS MAKING IT WORSE EVERY DAY. JUST THIS WEEK, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SAID A CUT TO SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THE ONE TRUMP IS PROPOSING WOULD END DISABILITY BENEFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND ALL BENEFITS WITHIN THREE YEARS. LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. IF DONALD TRUMP'S EXTREME PROPOSAL GOES INTO EFFECT, THE CHECKS THAT AMERICAN SENIORS ARE RELYING ON, THAT YOU RELY ON, TO PAY YOUR BILLS, TO BUYER MEDICINE, TO LIVE, WILL STOP COMING. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY IN THIS CRISIS, IT IS UNTHINKABLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEALTH CRISIS MADE WORSE BY HIS OWN ACTIONS, DONALD TRUMP IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO THROW OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INCLUDING PROTECTIONS IT PROVIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE COVID-19, INSURERS COULD DENY YOU COVERAGE FOR TREATING ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT TELL YOU ANY OF THIS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TONIGHT. WE ALL KNOW HE IS NOT CHANGING. THE PRESIDENT HE HAS BEEN IS THE PRESIDENT HE WILL BE. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND PUT AMERICA ON A BETTER PATH FORWARD. LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS AND FOLLOW THE BEST MEDICAL GUIDANCE TO KEEP US AND KEEP FAMILIES SAFE. ONE WHERE WE TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST SYSTEMS AND TRADITIONS OF OPPRESSION. ONE WHERE WE STOP FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE AND DIVISION AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT EACH ONE OF US DESERVES. AS JOE BIDEN SAID, WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK. I BELIEVE AMERICA WILL CHOOSE THE LIGHT. THANK YOU. TODAY ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE WASHINGTON POST SITS DOWN WITHOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY , CONWAY TO DISCUSS THE RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND OTHER ISSUES.

WE'VE HAD THIS MONUMENT IS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH OUR BELOVED SENATOR, SOON TO BE VICE PRESIDENT. AND, REALLY SPEAKING ABOUT HOW WE STAND ON THIS PRECIPICE OF OPPORTUNITY AND CHANGE IT FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL BE IMPACTFUL FOR OUR NATION. HOW DO WE RALLY THOSE BEFORE US? WE HAVE GREAT CONVERSATION. NOW WE WILL MOVE INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. I'M JOANNE. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 1945. MY WORK IN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY TO THE ECONOMY FOR OUR NEIGHBORS, TO REALLY RELY ON OUR NEIGHBORS KNOWLEDGE AND ASSETS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITIES WE ALL DESIRE TO LIVE IN. I'M GOING TO ALLOW US TO ENJOY AND CONTINUE THE WORK FOR WISCONSIN NEEDS THE ENERGY. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT ALL THAT WE ARE, THAT WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH, NOW , I TALKED ABOUT THE SUNRISE. YOU DON'T SEE THE SUN, IT IS STILL THERE. WE ARE NOW LEADING INTO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO HEAR US AND PROVIDE AN ACTIONABLE PLATFORM WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD WITH. I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS MOMENT. I'M THANKFUL FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK ALL THESE LEADERS. I WANT TO START WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE WORK YOU HAVE BEEN DOING DURING THESE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES AROUND THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING HERE IN WISCONSIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS GROUP OF BUSINESS LEADERS TOGETHER THIS AFTERNOON. WE'VE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. IT IS ACTUALLY A DISCUSSION THAT CONTINUES , A DISCUSSION I'VE BEEN HAVING THROUGHOUT MY VISITS TODAY IN MILWAUKEE. IT IS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK. AND THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LEADERSHIP TO TAP INTO THAT DIGNITY IN A WAY THAT WE GROW CAPACITY. THAT'S ABOUT CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, CAPACITY OF COMMUNITY, AND ULTIMATELY ABOUT GROWING THE CAPACITY OF OUR COUNTRY TO BE STRONG AND TO BE HEALTHY. WE HAVE HAD AN EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SAFE COMMUNITIES, WE MUST INVEST IN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE HEARTBEAT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES, THAT ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS IS, THEY ARE NOT ONLY LEADERS IN BUSINESS, THEY ARE CIVIC LEADERS. THEY HIRE LOCALLY, THEY UNDERSTAND THE JEWELS THAT EXIST WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THE NEED TO THEN ENCOURAGE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED, INCLUDING POINTING OUT THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC, COVID, IT HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR IN MANY WAYS. ONE WAY WE TALKED ABOUT IN PARTICULAR IS HIGHLIGHTING THE DISPARITIES IN TECHNOLOGY BASED ON RACE. THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT FAMILIES NOW ARE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL VIRTUALLY, AND WHETHER THAT FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND, WHETHER THAT FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY WORKS, THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE CAPACITY OF THE CHILDREN OF THAT FAMILY TO ACTUALLY SURVIVE THROUGH THIS MOMENT, MUCH LESS THRIVE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS, MEANING HAVING OUR GOVERNMENT, AS OUR PRIORITY, IT IS PART OF JOE BIDEN AND MY PRIORITY, INVESTING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INVESTING NOT ONLY THROUGH THE WORK WE WILL DO THAT IS ABOUT ACCESS TO CAPITAL THROUGH SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, PUTTING MONEY INTO OPPORTUNITY ZONES IS ONE PART OF IT BUT $150 BILLION IN NEW CAPITAL IN OPPORTUNITIES AROUND INVESTING IN PRIVATE VENTURE CAPITAL AS WELL AS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO. THIS IS ABOUT AN INVESTMENT IN NOT ONLY THOSE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES, BUT IN OUR COUNTRY, UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF WEALTH, INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH, COME ABOUT THROUGH THAT KIND OF FOCUS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY BANKS. DURING THE COURSE OF THIS CRISIS, UP TO 90% OF MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PPP. IN LARGE PART, BECAUSE UNLIKE HOW DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE WEALTHY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING EVERY DAY AND TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF SOMETHING LIKE THE PPP. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE TAX CREDITS PERMANENT AND DOING THAT, THROUGH DOING THAT, INCREASING FUNDING TO AS MUCH AS $5 BILLION ANNUALLY PROVIDE CREDIT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT BENEFIT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME AREAS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD THIS AFTERNOON. IT IS ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF A PLEDGE THAT JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF ARE MAKING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING HERE IN MILWAUKEE, THAT WE SEE YOU, WE UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT YOU ARE IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF COMMUNITIES, AND WE SEE THE BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO INVEST IN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS. SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE THANKFUL FOR THIS, FOR THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO TOOK TIME OUT OF YOUR DAYS. TODAY IS LABOR DAY, OF COURSE. SO, PART OF THE WORK WE HAVE BEEN DOING TODAY IS TO HONOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LABOR, INCLUDING, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THE PRIDE MILWAUKEE AND MANY OF US HAVE IN ORGANIZED LABOR. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND WHAT WE MUST DO TO ALWAYS SUPPORT THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN, TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND HAVE ALL OF THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT COME WITH A HARD DAY'S WORK AND THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WITH THAT, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I WILL PASS THE MICROPHONE TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS IS THE SENATOR'S VERY FIRST TRIP SO WE ARE EXCITED THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW CRUCIAL WISCONSIN AND MILWAUKEE WILL BE IN THE ELECTION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO HAVE LEADERS THAT CARE, WHO WILL SHOW UP AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS HERE AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE'S RECENT DECISION TO CANCEL ALL TRADES RELATED TO RACE, THAT IS UNFORTUNATE AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MANY DISPARITIES IN MILWAUKEE AND WISCONSIN AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE DONALD TRUMP WON'T RESPOND TO THAT CRISIS. WE ARE PROUD AND LUCKY TO HAVE SENATOR, SOON TO BE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WITH US TODAY.

It is a joy t o be with you. Um, I was out out side, and it was, um, seren aded, um, by the roar, and it reminded me of all of the m arching bands. There are p art of t he Jule of ou r HBC us e. Um, but I looked at those those s tudents, and I said to them What I saw t hat I sa w a collect ion of young leaders. And when I look at them, I see the future of our count ry, and that inspires me to talk to know that our future is bright. So t hank you for hosting us tod ay. Um, so I jus t wanna just before w e get into the conversat ion. And this is a g roup of very, um in formed, um, leaders. An d I'm r eally lookin g forward to a c andid conversa tion ab out what's happe ning here in Miami. Um, bu t as an extensio n of what's happe nin g in our co untry as it relates to all peopl e, but with a particular emph asis on what's happening with t he Afr ican American black community here in Miami and in Fl orida. Because I am here o n behalf o f myself an d Joe Biden, Um, to e listen and learn to e nsure that the work th at we are doing and and inte nd to di o um, is relevant to the p eople of this community. A nd it is about lif ting them up an d and s eeing and hea ring th em. Um, in t he process of doing that, Um, bu t I ju st want to start b y somethi ng some news that just br ok e recently. Um, it 's regarding a book that Bob Wo odwar d wr ote, and here' s the thing. S o basically, what we are hearing i s that on Jan. 28th, the president and the president were informed about the imminence and the dangers of Cove in 19 January 28th, on February 7th, the president of the United States, who has the unique and very important and special responsibility of concerning himself with keeping the American people safe, was in a conversation where he told, and we've heard that conversation. It's not the conversation we've heard. I t sa id that C ove it was dea dly. Stuf f sa id th at it is airb orne. This is t he sam e man, Donald Trump, who f or days, week s, if not months there a fter call ed it a hoax d ismissed the seriousness of it to t he point that he suggested p eople should n ot wear m asks. He knew it was airborn e, that people woul d breathe i t. You know, Joe Biden said it Well, he sa id, Well, I guess we no w know he kn ow s how to read. He kn ew the facts of it . 5% potential leth al ity. He narrated al l that in that conversation in Fe bruary. In Ja nuary, he ha d al l this informat ion. Yet he held rallies. He su ggested t hat toe we ar a mask is a sign o f weakness as oppose d to a sign o f strength. This is the presiden t of the United State s. So we continue to h ave examples of th e fact that this is a n individual who is not concerne d about the health , safety and well being o f the American people, an d it's frankly engaged in a record to regard of t he lives and th e health and well being of the peo ple of our countr y. I fi nd it so outrage ous and here we are in this c ommunity talking about the number of deaths , talking about the number of people who have contrac ted the virus talking about the n umber of peo ple who have become unemplo yed ar e standing or in food line s who are begging of their gove rnment that we will extend unemp loyment benefits because of a pandemic that r esulted in econo mic disaster of a measure comp ared to t he Great Depressio n. And the command er i n chief of the Un ited States of Americ a was in possession of this i nformation that long ago, b ut conducted hims elf the way he did. Th ere are so many re asons why Joe Bi d en needs to be elected president of the United State s. And if those r easons did no t make it clear why, this cert ainly does so with that, Um, I I beli eve that right no w it is th e leaders in this room and so many others who ar e caring in their he arts and their souls and their minds and on their shou lders, the responsibil ity of knowing what r eally leadership i n our country looks like. And that's th e spirit w ith which we are gathe red today to talk about what really lea dership looks like. And really leaders hip is always gonna be a bout leaders ha ving th e c ourage to speak the truth, even when it is diff icul t to speak much less difficult to hear, but s peaking thos e t ruths with th e intention o f creating the solu tions that the peop le deserve And so I am honored to be with this group of lea ders. And, um, I t hank you fo r the opportunity to listen t o you and Thio and Thio h ere y ou and with that I'm going Thio, pass the microphone back to Mayor Waga r Thio, get this conve rsation started. Thank y ou. Thank you. Senator Harri s, Um, having the cour age to speak the tru th. That's w hat we'r e here today for him . We're going t o start. The way it 's gonna work is I' ll introduce all of you and say a little bit, but you'll leave it to you to introduce yo urself and make your rem arks. And today we'll start with Mr Eric Knowles, a dear friend of mine for many years who leads the Miami Dade Chamber of Commerce and has been doing great things in our business community over the years. Mr. Knowles, please have the floor. Thank you. First of all, it's an hono r toe fi rst be h ere, sitting in this room with you. Se nator, sitting with m y leader, Con gresswoma n Frederica Wilson, wi th you, Mayo r with you, Dr Audrey would you, Pastor Thomas and my brother Rube n Roberts . With the CPI, this truly i s an honor. I am the president o f the Miami C hamber of Commerce, founded in 19 74 beca use of the lack of opportuni ty and the disp arities that were happening in 1974 t hat can here i n 2020. I talk a bout disparities with Dade Co unty, Miami Da de County with M iami Dade County publ ic schools, where b lack busi nesses received less than 2% of county contrac ts of school boar d contracts. W hen we talk about the pande mic and we talk about Geo rge Floyd, we talk about the perfect stor m that the rest of the world fi nally opened their ey es to, and the oni on was peeled back off the systemic rac ism th at has p lagued the black commu nity since Plymouth R ock, as they say, l anded on us. And here we are, and I talked. I go ba ck to Day Co unty Public's Day County, a nd we ta lk abou t a disparity stu dy that ha sn't happened because of the lack of informati on that was n't gathered . And but we k no w the re is a disparit y. We know there that there is a systemi c issues in t he policies tha t keep us from advancin g so to me . It's about how do we move past th at? And we definitel y can mo ve past that with the per son that sits in the W hite House right now. It should be r emove d for d erelicti on of duty, and I reall y mean that he's incompetent . He's not a lead er, h e's a bul ly. And we nee d Thio ev erything that we can do to get you and vi ce president Biden elec ted. I stand here w ith you to help make that happen. What I see, what we need to do. Obviously, a ccess to c apital has always been a problem i n the black community. Wh en the pandemic hit technical a ssi stance, a lot of the black busin esses did not have their books. Or, as we say, th ey're b a ck of t he house in o rder. And th ey still don't have the back of the ho use in order, um, to provide the techni cal assi stance to prov ide the informat ion that they needed to access the P P P access, the e ideal o r the even the state emergency fund. We still have those problems with our businesses t hat cann ot fill out the pap erwork, not had a proper inf ormation to fill ou t t he paperwork. Some of the thin gs that I see that we can do to help move this f orward . I talk about a mento r prot ege programs Me ntor Pr otege is where l arge corporation s are made t o par ticipate an d bring in smaller co rporation Uh, that are ha ve been in business, bu t n eed that leg up to help them move up and and t o scale. So Jackson Hospital he re, my did a mentor Protege prog ram. You cannot build a hospital or do the hospital or do constructio n in the h ospital unless you are active. C ertified. So what Jackso n Hospital did they did. The y had a 1.2 or $2 billion b ond project in which they were b uilding new ho spitals, renovating the ex ist ing Jackson. But they they mad e it a mentor protege pro gram. T hey had two major contract ors, but they b rought in five proteges. So n ow those proteges, three of them ha ppen to be m embers of the chamber. Now they have g on e through the process of doing h ospital work, and now they are quali fied and can d o this. The other t hing. I want to t alk about this P threes. Pub lic p rivate partnerships policies should be put in place, both federally statewide and local. If it is a P three project that it has to have a mentor protege program. So to me, how do we move the needle, those air? Some of the answers that I have all of our business is hurting here in Miami Dade County, restaurants are closed. Rest, um and you in our community, Ah , lot of our business es are barbers hops, beauty sal ons, uh, se rvice type busi nesses. And the other thing I want to talk about is the five year loo k back on felo ns. F elons c ould not access the P P P program becau se of the five year look back that eith er needs to be remov ed or reduced to a mini mum maximum of two years. And I sa y, two years, the se air business es, men and women who h ave served their tim e and now they've come out and the y cannot. They were not able to access P P p money. They ha ve employees. They have been ru nning their busine sses for a number of yea rs, and they can 't access that those, um , monies that we re there to supp ort them. The last th ing I'll say i n terms of ca pital, we know that the problem t hat happened the first round all t he larg e banks d id not pay attention to the small businesses so we n eed to make sure if there , uh for my understandin g, there's still about $130 billi on still l eft fro m t he South. So I'm no t sure whe re that is. We need to make su re that th ose businesses in our, um, are a codes zip cod es. I'm sorry, are have access to these monies, and that's perspective on it at this moment and again. Thank you for coming and sharing your time with us. Thank you, Mr Knowles . Oh, raised a lot of very important po ints, and I have taken notes. T heatrics s to cap ital piece. I couldn't agree with you more. So Joe and I have a pl an. That's about it. Aziz. Mayor Wagar talked about build back bet ter. All right . And a nd that's the theme of it. Um, but when you b reak down what tha t means it includes a i s that ar e about helping small bus ine sses, help ing to encourage entrepreneur ship and doing that underst anding One of the best ways to d o it is to provide acc ess to capital for commun ities that ha ve historically been denie d ac cess capita l intentionally or just through neglect. So part of our plan is billion an d that's gonna be new capital for small busin esses with an emphasis on community dev elopment, financial i nstituti on s, CDF ey es to you r point. The P p P. Ove rlooked the last number I saw . 90% of minority and wo men owned businesses did not get a b enefit from t he P p. P be cau se to your point they don' t have t he relationshi ps wit h the big banks so that t he fancy banker c alls up Mr Smith and says, Yo, but this thing i s about to come dow n. I've got all the p aperwo rk filled out for you . You just need to sign it a nd you'll be in line. Um, to your point about the beauty salon, the barber. Look, I have a beauty salon, b ut they want me to fill out all these documents a bout my ven dors. Well, I get my I get m y products at the b eauty supply store, so that's n ot gonna That's not the way I do business. So how am I gonna be able to actually help that I, as a small business owner, nee d? And so Joe and I have ta lked extensively about t his in terms of what we need t o do one in terms of recovery from co vid an d and lifting ba ck up our sm all businesses. Um, b ut also what we need t o do m oving forward to invest in the natural entrepreneurship that exists in our communities th at needs to be cultiv ated and supported in every way throu gh mentorship . And so that 's part of how we have are d esigning it, that as part of the fe deral support, there would be tha t kind of mentorship tha t you described. Um , but it a lso would be about encouraging priva te equity to do greate r investme nt in our communities an d to put a fine point on ho w many people wou ld be impacted by t his discussion that yo u and I are having. It is estim ated that 50% of American workers either work for a sm all bu sin ess or r un a small busines s. So we 're talking abo ut a lot of folks. Um, and so I appreci ate th at We are also looking at what w e need to do to bu ild back up comm unity around issues like h omeownership. Rig ht, Which we all know, Um, and you look at i t here in Flor ida, in Miami and so many places in our country with the hist ory of redlining, the hist ory o f black familie s being excluded from th e government, op port unities from the G I, Bill g oing on righ t to have that leg up for homeownership. And part of our plan is a $15,000 credit for families for down payment and closing costs. Because, of course, homeownership is part of intergenerational wealth, and I'll let the conversation continue. But there are more things to discover Thank you so much, Mayor . L et me just say, First of all, congratulati ons, Thio, Senator Kamala Ha rris and Pres ident Vice Presiden t Joe Biden o n their quest to become the next lead ers of ou r great nation On behal f of the students , the faculty staff and a board o f trustees wa y welcome you. T hank yo u for visiting us. And I'm really elate d t hat you e njoyed the roar, t he band, And believe it or not, the y are new. We ju st I j ust st arted that that prog ram and, u h, t hey I mean, they're really go od. They are. They're doi ng a pheno mena l job. And thes e air students, um, again, who like so many others, we're not really sure college was the of us know tha t th is this t his the situ ation we're in, we didn't have to b e he re. Eyes is t he reality. And so this past aca demic year was c ertainly unlike any in our history as the novel c oronavir us pandem ic impacted our world in unprecedented w ays and especially right here in our own cou ntry. Back i n early March, the pan demic force so ma ny colleges and universit ies to pivot and to make drastic c hanges in our traditional m odalities of deliver ing instructio ns. And I think all of us know that many of these uni versities, even the mos t wealthy wealthiest of our institutio ns, are fil ling that impact. So can you imagi ne what our h bcu zehr feeling lik e? One of the t hings th at we quickly discover ed as we made this trans ition an d that was the di gital div ide was even more pro nounced. Uh, when we had to qui ckly move from again the traditional method of teaching to th e, uh, the online instr uctions, we re alized that there were s o many of our stu dents who didn't eve n have comput ers. And we quickly had to make arra ngements with technolog y company in our com munity i n order to get device s for s o many of our students. So I thi nk we all know th at the pan demic has really impact ed us in w ays beyo nd what we could ev en phantom and as I indicated before , we didn't have to be here. So F lor ida Me morial has be en around 4 41 years p roviding, uh, education al access wi th so many undes erving students, 90% of o ur students, our gen eration, lo w income stud ents. And th at means tha t we open up opportunities for these st udents wi ll be able to com e into our university. T hey come in, man y of them not prep are d for college. But bu t through the hig h, the h igh touch and the nurturing en vironment tha t we right to our students , we see t hem evolve and t hey become co nfident in thei r abilities to exc el in This univ ersity has produc ed many doctors, la wyers, judges, uh, bus iness owners all over this country and have done phe nom enal work and continue to d o pheno menal work. So I'm ve ry proud of what we 're doing here at our univers ity. So when you think abo ut hbc u se, uh, again, we comprise 3 3% of educat ional institutions. Bu t yet we're producing a bout 80% of the gra dua tes in our nation. And we ar e Th ese are your futu re workfo rce. Uh, i s your fu ture workforce deve lopm ent? And so we're educating our stud ents on o ne what it means to be highly competi tive. How to create yo ur own business, t hat one o f those here is 33 goals is to one. Make su re that when I graduate that ther e would get the top notch gradua te p rograms. Number two. They will be prepared with the skill s necessary to compet e in a global marketp lace or number three. T hey become entrepren eur s. And that' s what we're putting programs in p lace now to really hel p our young men. Women think about ec onomics. U h, the other thin g that I want to quickly talk about is just the injustice. Not only are we looking at a health disparity and pandemic, but there's also a racial one. When you think about the racial unrest that is occurring in our nation, the divide that is happening in our nation these, uh, racia l issu es that have litera lly devast ated our n ation from ec onomic inj ustice. The he althcare, injustice and t he list goes on and on and on because we know th at the pandemic i tself has really, uh impacted us i n in disproportionate ways . And I think some took advantage. Take advantage of that because they think, Oh, it doesn 't m atter is re ally imp acting only blac k people or brown people. Well, you got to think a bout the fact that, like Eric talked about it, has caus ed thousand s of business es clo sed. It has caused millio ns to be unemp loyed today. And th at means that they have no eco nomy, no economics com ing in. So of course, that impacts t hem trying t o go to scho ol. And so when y ou think about, ah, small in stitutions like us we re litera lly working on a shoestring budget, we 're pulling out everything we can to ma ke sure we keep ou r young men a nd young wome n in s chool so that the y can complete on compete , uh, for op portunities in our nation. Um, so Fl orida memor ials committ ed to those thin gs, and and s o I'm looking forward to whatever we can dio to make sure that we help continue to move our country and make our country better. Thank you. Dr Har d. Uh uh. I am a proud graduate of a n HB CU, and, um, I couldn't agree with you more . It is th e place w here we nurt ur e young people to see who the y are and their role as part of le adership of our nation and whateve r pr o fession they choose. Um S O and J oe and I have talked extensively about what we need to do their for to support our HBC us e as part of just t he treasur e of our nati on on DSO that includes $70 billion that would be dedicated. Take invest i n in a ll of the teaching progra ms, inclu ding the res earch work that happens at HBC use, which will have a pr ofound impact on just how we are addressing the African Am erican pop ulation in science and health in a number o f things . In additio n, we will, for famili es that have an in come of less t han $125,000 create tu ition free for those st udents who are going to publi c schools and HBC us e, including privat e HBCU. Thank you. In addition beca use, as you and I know , a lot of our HB CU students deci de to take on the, you know, maybe inspired by the divine nine an d their relation ship t o that just in relation to the hi story of H PCs. Decide to take on a profession of service whic h often does not pay as well as is if they go into the priv ate sector and do other things. So for those students who come out and have job, 100 and 25,00 0 stude nt loan debt will a lso be forgi ven . Um, on th en, also free to y our col lege because we kno w that for so many o f our s tudents who may not atte nd an HBCU , maybe the fa mily members w e want to su pport our yo ung people fo r whatever they pursue by way of education after high school, program or an apprenticeshi p or something of that natu re, and we wanna make sure that we suppor t them in that qu est. So thank you. I app reciate . Thanks. Well, we're looking forward t o that plan, um, as a as a granddau ghter of a woman wh o went to an HBCU and raised me up an d is the sister of a brother who wen t to a very prou d HBCU. T his is exciting news. I'm very good. Thank you for all the ha rd work you're doing, Doct or Hardwick. Next, we have Past or Rhonda Thomas. She's a powerh ouse wo man and she's been was ordained in 2006 and she's faci litate s powerful confe rences for women youth across Florida, Georgia and the Baham as. Pastor Thomas, the fl oor is yo urs and welcome. Thank you. G ood afternoon. I do wa nt to start by firs t sa ying than k you. I g uess I'm gonna prophetically s peak Vice President P aris. Um, than k you for being the example and g iving b lack wom en hope, bei ng the exampl e of given b lac k girls h ope, um, you st and out in a way like no othe r. And we appreciate you on all th at you' ve done. And we know the plan that you have and the pla n that God has given you. I stan d in the 24 way as a pastor . My husb and and I are other , um, founders about ministry, which is not that far from here fo r over 3 0 years. And th en I stand as the first black woman to se rve as exe cutive director for faith in Florida, wh ich we are a statewide organiza tio n where we org anized mul ti faith multi racial clergy a roun d ra cial and eco nomic justice. My d aug hter is a gr aduate of HBCU, S he Florida A and M University. Um, when she went there, I had no idea that she would be considered ah, hero. She serves as and I see you nurse at Jackson Hospital from March his Covi c patien ts. My younger bro ther came out of retire ment as a paramedi c to get on the fr ont lin e, who now serve s as a hero, and th en my nephew, who is a firefighter. So th at's three from my immediate family who still on the front line, fighting to help oth ers for an ad ministra tion that fai led us in Miam i in partic ular. We ll, I'm born and raised, seen the good, the ba d and the ug ly, but a city tha t I love? Um, not ju st the pastor , but the this adm ini stration, unfo rtun ately, fail ed communiti es who has often fe lt left out from th e beginning or befo re the pa ndemic ac tuall y hit. Um, the work that I d o is to encou rage and bring forth ah, beloved commu ni ty what we will all fee l a se nse of be longing. Um, unfortu nately, we h ave been faile d on every level. Whether is those who experienced unemployment and when those that that affects the black chur ch because tha t's the way we surv ive, rega rdless of t he size of the church, and o ur church is st ill hav e not opened . I have taught more cle rgy how toe klik, zoom and that has been an ex per ien ce starting with my so, but it's bee n a failure on ev ery level. Um, my job alon g faith in Florida w e have provided in Miami Dade County myself has del ive red every person that is incar cerated, PPE and and th e correction officers. Thus every cou nty jail in Dade County, beca use they lack the basics of w hat all of us needed, wh ich was mask and a ha nd san itizer. And then the prison sta rt cal ling beca use it's, um, wom en. The wom en prison i n Homest ea d, out o f 668 women 600 w as tested positive with cove rt 19 th is very district. We provided every hi gh school and ever y st udent and teacher mas s. So when our s chools open, our youn g pe opl e, we'll have mass and hand sani tizer. The d ay tha t my daughter called t o say, Ah, wh ole family died a nd t he only person that was lef t that surv ived was th e 11 year old s on. The gr and parents die d. Both pare nts died. It's a s ystem that f ailed us. Ma ny did not have he alth ca re when she called to say th at the hospita l mall was so fu ll. It' s a system that f elled us as b lack people w hen they'r e trying to force our Children t o go to school . It's a system. It's a con sistent failing and eve n the church itself who is n ot open, w ho can not give the counseling. In the 8 2 parents w ere lit erally turn ing families d own becaus e we c an't host a funeral. It's a sy stem t hat has fa iled us on ever y level. I don't know if you have the answers to this fell syst em, but we need the answ ers. We need ho pe . We need to know that thi s too shal l pass. Tha t's my remark s for now, Pas tor, Um ri ght, thes e air those mom ents where we must walk by fa ith. An d, you know, w e do have some of the answer s. So Joe Bid en and I have made a c ommitment t hat we will one listen t o the scientists an d embrace the trut h of the th e natur e of this public h ealth pandemic and do what the scien tists have said from the beginn ing is ne c essary. We need a national plan for testing and we need to implement it An implemen tation of a national plan for co ntact traci ng the implementat ion of a nat ional plan for mak ing sure all people ha ve access to treatment. I star ted a have a b ill that is p ar t of our national plan t hat is about racial racial disp arities task force, which would be put i n place immediately t o do the a nalysis of wh ere the racial disparit ies a re so that when we 're talki ng about the distri bution o f resource is w e a re guided by the princi ples of equity, knowing th at not everyone starts from the same place, and we wa nt everyone to en d up in the s ame place with eq ual access . And, u m, our plan is also abo ut God wil ling as soon as we get a sa fe and effective vacc ine, a national plan for ho w that is going to be distr ibuted, understand ing that the re is a big differe nce between having a vaccine and folks get tin g vaccinated. So you are rig ht. The sys tem has failed so many people, the 190,000 souls, m ost of whom did no t have a burial so many of whom I know here in Florida, I thi nk 40% of the people who have died were in seein g you were s eniors whose families could not be with them i n their fina l da ys of l ife. Um, that our country is grieving. T he loss of jobs, the loss of life, t he los s of normalcy, the loss of consistency and in many cases, the loss of hope. And Joe and I talked abou t tha t al l the time . And it m ust W e need l eadership that sees an d recognizes the suffer ing and has p rompted then to be guided by tr uth and fact and not wh at is in their political self inte rest, which is what we have seen in D onald Trump. So thank you. Thank you for sh aring that and a nd and to your fami ly, yo ur daug hter. Thank th em, please. Mh m. Than k you. Next step. We have Mr Rub in Roberts, the curren t president of the Miam i David chap t er of the NAACP. Mr. Roberts, the floor is yours. Que ? H ell o? Can you hear me? First of all, I wo uld like to say t hank yo u for a llowing me to have this oppo rt unity t o speak to you about issue s that are pertinent to our community. I am deeply honor ed an d privileged to be h ere with you a nd the es teemed Panel ists, all of whom I've had some experie nce with. So you d efinitel y chosen. Well, I want to shar e with you the concerns about what's going on from the people perspective in Miami D ad e County. One of the issues that we have is definitel y an economic issue. So you had a lot of essential work ers, people who worked in restau rants. P eople wor k on the front lin es who were one paycheck away from bei ng homeless. That exists. But now they' re mu ltiple paychecks witho ut being able to pay for housing. So this is a ma jor issue for u s. Thank y ou. We're thankful fo r the moratoriums that have b een that have been put in place to he lp people to stay in their homes while they're there. But we know that th ere is goi ng to become a day of r eckonin g when all of those passed two bil ls are due. And so I'm wanting to hear ho w What's the p lan to address t hose issues for those fo lks who were in that situation, whose Children are depen dent on them to have, you know, th e shelter and housi ng? And to be fa ir, we're very g rateful as well for the food sharing progr ams, beca use most of these folks who are not b ringing in an y income coul d not feed the ir famil ies had it not been f or the fo od sharing program s. So we' re grateful fo r that. Want to h ear about the plans for those types of things as well? In addition to economics in terms of the the the families. There's also the bu sin es s com ponent to it. And s o for years you he ar peopl e sa ying that we'd love to have a s eat a t the ta ble. Well, we would lo ve to be invi ted to the party. I just was on t he zoom last night, and a g entleman menti oned that it's not enough just to be invited to th e party. We have to be ask ed to dance a swell. So I would love to see what that looks like in terms off How we partici pating, not just at sitting at the t able of g oing to the part y, but how are we being inte ractive in t erms of our dan ce? One o f the thin gs I would e ncourag e you to do you and Mr Bi den Vice Presid ent Bi den is to lead by exa mple by making sure that if your c ampaign your hiring bla ck vend ors, eve ry state, every city , ever y coun ty, make sure that there' s a commit ment and budgetary ite ms where y ou will be hiring black vendors, bl ack people hire bla ck peopl e. If you do tha t, you will pa ssed on those d ollars. Those res ource is where tho se families who are in need can definitel y benefit from. So that' s something I would encour age you guys to do the oth er thing. I think t hat there's a mi ssing element that th at's no t been spoken up a lot where almost 20 0,000 dea ths. So all of us in s ome way due to K ofi relat ed d eaths have been impacted by c ove rt. And so one of the things th at we're really not talking abo ut is the PTSD an d the mental healt h pea ce. And so the federal government has deeply cu t ment al heal th programs and things of that na ture and one of the things that we need to look at . It's how do we address these issues for the parent s who were str esse d out and full of anxiety because they don't know wha t tomo rrow hose. They don 't know how lon g this is gonn a la st. Parents who want to send their kid s to college, par ents who wants to se nd their kids to s chool, parents who don't kno w how they're go ing to make ends meet going on in the future. Those men tal heal th issues are riel. We hav e to ad dress those issu es not onl y from the parental standp oint or the c ommunity standpo int, but f or the workforce standp oint as well. Peop le are going to be as king folks that c ome toe w ork as normal without even addr essing or having anyth ing in place for them to process what they've experienced in ter ms of a loss of a love d one, a significant person in your fa mil y, loss of property , loss of whatever it is that you have lost, how to deal wi th the exa mple of the anxiety, our workforce, our, our educational system is gonna be deeply i mpacted by those mental health is sues that we defini tely need to address. So I encou rage you toe h ave some sort of answer fo r that because w e don't know when this end is gonna ha ppen. An d the uncertainty Israel. I was pl eased to hear abo ut the programs that yo u have in place about hig her education and mak ing sure the first two years of college is free. I'd like to see you c ome up with a pl an to to forgive studen t loan s for tho se who have been ou t of school for a whil e, but struggle becaus e you have a s egment of the popu lat ion who can't even pu rc hase thei r first hom e. They have a ni ce job, but they're s o i ndebted in term s of the ir student loans, they ca n't even purch ase their fir st home. So we nee d t o mak e a wa y for those folk s to be able to pay into the system through their tax es by paying, payin g for thos e home s. And we need to have som e sort of fo rgiveness on t hat. The other t hing I heard that you menti oned I thought was so very imp ortant. We need to save our HBCU wer e with one of the best presidents oven hb cu right here today. And this institutio n has grown by leaps and bounds under his leadership, a nd it will continue to g row, I'm certa in . But onl y not only do we ne ed, um, for th ose dollars availabl e fo r stud ents, bu t we need also de velopmenta l dollars so that the y can buil d more dormitori es. The y can Bill mawr, uh , facilities for, uh, their their student s. We also need in addition to those re search dol lars that you spoke of, we need dollar s that air coming f rom Samsa and Na yda wh ere they are intentionally reaching out t o hbc use bla ck peop le and in the areas o f behavioral health and sci ences are the m ost researc hed people in the world . And so who better to lead those res earch? Uh, then an hbcu. So in additi on to th ose do llars as you give dollars, neither Sampson an d such seeks out those dollars should be. Some of those dollars s hould be earmarked where they' re going to be working with an HBCU. I would love to see unde r your administ rati on that y ou deve lop a council with these HBCU pre sidents and work with them to help the m to get more involved in research and to g e t more involved in to having ev idence base d programming or st udies at their institutions. Cha llenges. You can't afford to have the latest information because you just you're just on the strength shoe st ring budget. So we need to r esolve th at issue as much as possi ble. And finally, so cial justice. Well, Soci al Ju stice an d Howard S ocial justice. I k now there's not muc h you can do in terms of wow, hel ping u h, to solve the problem of of people who ha ve hatred in their h earts to see other people ma y be di fferent from t hem a s human. And that 's a major probl em that we have right now. The basic f eeling, uh, or the ba sic of being re cognized as h uman. I often s ay w hen they see us as human, the y'll tr eat us as hu man, and I think tha t since the adve nt of George Floyd an d so many other incidents tha t we 've seen, b ut shows th at they're not shying away fro m th is. The violence in your state , they're still hanging s that a re unsolved. I mean , the lynchings that are unsolved. That happened recently. S o I I want to s ay this in the term s o f in terms of police reform, in terms of anyone tha t does business with the f ederal government. If they ar e hate based o r hate related, the y should not b e eligible to do business with. We need tr acking systems in place for those rogue offi cers. I believ e that the majority of our police officers doing well, but those that one or 2% of whatever the per centages, uh, they have a disregard for lif e, lib er ty, peopl e of diff erent background bl ack people, pe ople o f color. T hose peopl e need to hav e their l aw lic ense revoke d. The process is t here for that to happ en on state levels. Bu t it's not follow ing, and I think that the federal government should intervene on that level as well to make sure that w henever you have an o fficer that i s charg ed with th ese heinous crimes, that they're due pro cess is f ollowed all the way up into l ooking at not only getting them prosecu ted, but mak ing sure that they're n ot able to serve in that role of someone who was s worn to p rotect and ser ve because they'r e not, they don't T hey d on't ha ve that honor. And s o they should not be in that p osition. And finally housing, Uh, we've b een pri ced out here in South Florida. You have a wo rkforce. You have a labor force that can't afford to live within 20 mi les of w here they work. So peo ple have to travel co mmute from one county to the next in order for th em to survive where, uh , wrench and mortgage s, maybe a little bi t cheaper fe deral governmen t programs like yo u said , th e down paym ent assistance p rograms. But not only that, we n eed to find s ome other way of of assisting di fferent loca l municipal ities and counties to ensure that there are pla ces for low inco me housing in c ities like Miami. The is sue t hat we've had an d we continue to have, is that wage s have stayed s tagnan t for over 3 0 40 years. If you loo k at what the teacher make s now coming out of college today versus where they were making comin g out of college 30 y ears ago, you may see a very small , incremental gro wth. But at t he same time, the cost of living and the cost of everythin g else has grown expon entially. And so the se are the challenges that we face. And this is so mething that we rea lly need to look into and see how we can resolve these issues with stagn ant wages and the ever inc reasing co st of ever ything else that we need to have. Those ar e the questions that I h ave and and comments and also ag ain, I think that you ar e, uh, suc h a great role model for my niece. I don't have a da ughter, but I hav e nieces. I am from the Bahamas. Um, m y mother's American. S o for all of the Ca ribbean, all of the aspirin, we de finitely app reciate you an d what y ou represent and w hat you bring to this ticket. And we encour age you to continue to do the good work and be th at shining star th at you've shown yourse lf to be. I've see n you and those, uh , those thos e Senat e h earings and I mean, you made me proud eve ry time. So I I'm gonna cont inue to encourage you to do the same. And I'm looking forward. Thio, What's happenin g after Nove mber? I'm l ooking forward for what's to come . Right. Thank you, Mr Roberts. fo r all that you hav e highlight ed. The re's a lot there. I 'm not gonna at tempt at this moment to unpa ck it all. But I have taken ext ensive notes and I lo ok forward to us con tinuing this conve rsation and following up becau se not only have you identif ied the p roblems, but you also are offerin g great ide as for solutions. So I wa nna make sure that I follow up with yo u. Um, I w ill talk about o ne of the m any things you talk ed about. Just a za point o f em phasis about what's at stake in this el ection, and that is t he future of health care in America . So President Barack Obam a, to gether with V ice President Joe B iden, did what was probabl y one of the most i nnovative and substantial pu blic policy reforms that w e've seen in modern history. With th e creation of the Affordable Care Act, i t r eformed substa ntially how we do healthcar e delivery and who has access to it in our coun try. Donald Trump h as Bill Bar in co urt right now attempting to get r id of the Affor dab le Care Act. The Af fordab le C are Act created access to over 20 million p eople who o therwise did not have it. It allowed, you kn ow, we ta lk about our students and the and the the conc ern that young p eople are coming out of high school and college ri ght now that they m ay not have jobs. One of the things, the aff ordable care act, it is said that up to 26 years old , you could be on your p arents co verage. We talk about longstandin g health di sparities in terms of race, and we know tha t c ove it praise on peop le with pre existin g conditions. An d for us, that's about diabe tes. It's about high b lood pressure. I t's about asthma, all of that. If th ey are s uccessful in tr ying to get r id of the afford able ca re act, it means that it will come back a s a policy that if you have a pre existing co ndition, you could be denied cover age. Understand tha t cove it. W e sti ll don't rea lly know the long term health im pact to the human body if you are on e of those over six million people w ho contracted the virus b ut through God's grace lived things l ike lung scarring, which g oing forward would be consider ed potentially a pre existing condi tion for which you cou ld be denied coverage if Donald Trump has h is way. Joe Biden , on the oth er hand, no t only would keep the affordable care act intac t, but has as a ma jor priority that we would expand cov erage under the Affordab le Care Act, including men tal health care. Because you couldn 't be. I couldn't agree with you more the undiagnosed a nd therefore u ntreated trauma that people were experiencin g before this pandemic. I've longed wo rked on this i ssu e in terms of t he Children grow ing up in poverty, which, by the w ay, povert y i s trau ma inducing. Growing up in communitie s where there high rates o f violence be cause of p overty, tha t is trauma ind uci ng. Our Children ar e not being d iagnosed and t herefore not treated. We have, as a publ ic health care system, long been under some, s ome miscon stru ed notion that health car e means ad dressing the body from the neck dow n instead of un during. We also need health ca re from the neck up right. You recogn ize somebody if they broke th eir arm and say, Oh, can I sign you r cast? Can I open the door for you? But we don't do that in terms of mental health car e, So Joe and I have talked exten sively about it and this is one of o ur priorities, but I do want t o connect it to als o this election and what's at stake in th e n ext 54 days. As if Do nald Trump has his wa y, Ther e could be at least 2 0 million people who almo st immediat ely will lose th eir coverage, including all those folks with preexisting condi tions, m uch less what we could do to expand cove rage, including an emphasis on mental health c are. So let's follow u p on all of th e other points that you made. But I do want to thank everybody for the time and for the thought and for the continuin g conv ersation th at we will have an d I'll turn it back t o the m ayo r. Well, thank you, Senator Harris, whi ch was Were those your concludi ng remarks? Or would you like t o take us out with some concludi ng remar ks before I think everyone for their t ime this aftern oon. My conc luding remarks are that everyth ing that has been mentioned here, this is about, and the reason that w e're doing this is that the American peo ple des erve to be see n and heard, a nd if the ir government is gonna be at all rele vant to their li ves, it i s b ec ause we do this in response to their needs. And th e thing ab out Joe Biden is that he und ersta nds that the expr ession of strength of a human being an d of a leader is not measured by who you beat down . It's measured by who you lift u p, especially in times of cri sis like this o ne. And so that is a lar ge part of what moti vates us to be here and toe work as hard as we possibly can over the next 54 days. Florida last data register is October 5th, Um , early voting. We'll start, um, sometime in Octobe r. I don't have the date in front of me. Um, we encou rage everyo ne to vote ear ly as early as the law allows yo u to do. Um, and I will re mind folks that t here are all kind s of obstacles. We know t hat here in Flo rida and throu ghout our country that have be en put in the wa y of trying to get black f olks not to vote students n ot to vote N ative American , our indi genous brothers and sisters not to vote thos e obstacles ai r p resent, and we're gonna have toe work around the m. We're gonna have to surmou nt them. But le t's be pr epared th at there ar e a lot of folks who h ave so much at st ake and the rea son that we nee d to vote is, of course, abo ut honoring the ancest ors, in cluding the most recent John Lewis , who shed his blo od on that Edmund Pettus Bridge. But the othe r reason we ne ed to vote is this. I enc ourage people to sit back and ask, Why are they putti ng so many obstacles in the way of my ability to vote? Why a re they doing this? From the d ays of requiring folks to count how ma ny jellybeans were in tha t jar to qualified to express their voice through their v ote? Why are they doing this? And I think the answer is very clear beca use they k now when we vote, things change . And there in l ies our power, which we should never let anyone take from us. So this is my concluding remarks toe all of the friends and family in Miami Dade and in Florida. Let's never let anybody take our power from us. We have too much to do, and our country is worth this fight that is in front of us. So with that, I thank you all, all of you for being here and mayor. I'll pass it over to you and thank you. Thank you. Senator Harris. Uh, future vice president of the United States of America. I wanna thank everybody that's been here with us today, and I want to summarize sort of very quickly what we've heard. We've heard access to capital economic recovery. We've heard aid to HBC use. We've heard recognizing the value of higher education. There's a system that has failed us. People are losing their families and their lives in a situation that did not have to be. We need access to health care that must continue. So what I've heard is that the Biden Harris administration has a plan for all of this. They have a plan for a system that has failed us. We want to be invited to the party, but we also want to be able to be asked to dance. So we would like to be led by someone and a team, an administration that has the courage to speak the truth for the benefit of all of us in this country. So on behalf of myself, who was the daughter of a strong woman and a strong black woman who was trying to raise two little strong black women, I thank you. I thank you on behalf of our community and Miami, Florida. Thank you for being with us today. Thank you. To all of our Panelists, Congressman Wilson. Thank you for your wise comments and all of your leadership all these years. We appreciate you. Thank you to everyone who's been watching this evening. Remember the last day to register to vote Is October 5th playing your vote. And thanks for joining us today, everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much.

VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, PARTICIPATED IN A CONVERSATION WITH LATINO LEADERS IN PHILADELPHIA. AFTERWARDS, SHE SHARED THE TOPICS DISCUSSED, INCLUDING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TREATMENT OF PUERTO RICO FOLLOWING HURRICANE MARIA IN 2017. SO I HEAR THIS AFTERNOON WAS COMMUNITY LEADERS, NATIONAL LEADERS, A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY THINGS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF PUERTO RICO, THE STATE OF AFFAIRS OF PUERTO RICO, AND WHAT A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO DOING TO INVEST IN THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO. AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES PEOPLE'S VOICES MUST BE HEARD AND RESPECTED. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO GOING TO BE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES AND THE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND EXASPERATED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL BE OUR INTENTION AS AN ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES IN A WAY THAT'S MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WE SAY WE ARE, WHICH IS A DEMOCRACY THAT'S COMMITTED TO EQUALITY AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. SO THE CONVERSATION WE HAD RANGED FROM THAT, TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE CULTURE AND THE ARTS. SO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING WE ARE IN, AND A COMMITMENT THAT A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE TWO THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT OF THE ARTS, AND SUPPORTING CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THIS ONE, THAT GIVE SUPPORT TO THE YOUTH OF THE COMMUNITY, UNDERSTANDING THEIR CAPACITY, AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR POTENTIAL WHEN WE INVEST IN THEIR ABILITY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND HIGHLIGHT THE CULTURES FROM WHICH THEY COME.

COMPOUNDED NOW WITH COVID, AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT FOR THE ISLAND, IN TERMS OF THE ISLAND IMPACT AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. FRANKLY, THE SUFFERING THAT IS TAKING PLACE THERE. IT IS ALSO INEXCUSABLE THE WAY THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HAS TREATED PUERTO RICO. WE REMEMBER WHEN HE WENT AFTER THE HURRICANE AND THREW PAPER TOWELS AT PEOPLE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DENIED THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO THE DIGNITY THEY DESERVE. IT HAS DENIED THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. IT HAS BEEN AN ADMINISTRATION THAT DENIED THE PEOPLE OF ORDER RICO TH , PUERTO RICO THE POWER THEY DESERVE TO HAVE, IN TERMS OF THEIR VOICE AND THE WAY THAT THEY LIVE, THE WAY THAT THEIR CHILDREN LIVE AND WILL LIVE GOING FORWARD. IN A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, WE INTENT TO RESPECT THEIR VOICE, CULTURE, AND HISTORY.

LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE MAYOR OF DETROIT WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT. IN MARCH, WHEN WE GOT HAMMERED WITH COVID, WE WERE LOSING 50 PEOPLE A DAY. WE NEEDED TEST KITS TO TEST THE FOLKS AT NURSING HOMES TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES WERE SICK AND WHY THEY WERE DYING. WHEN THE HOSPITAL WORKERS AND NURSES NEEDED GOWNS AND MASKS BECAUSE THEY WERE GETTING SICK AND DYING, WHEN PEOPLE WERE PACKED ON GURNEYS IN THE HALLWAY. WE TURNS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR HELP AND LEADERSHIP, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID? I'M NOT A SHIPPING CLERK. IT IS NOT MY JOB. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT IN 2009, WHEN GM AND FCA WERE ABOUT TO CLOSE DOWN IN BANKRUPTCY AND IF BARACK OBAMA HAD SAID, IT'S NOT MY JOB. WE WOULD NOT HAVE 5000 JOBS AT THE FCA PLANT COMING DOWN THE STREET, 2000 MORE JOBS IF THE GM , AT THE GM PLANT WITH THE NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND TRUCKS. WHEN WE WERE IN BANKRUPTCY AND JOE BIDEN WAS HERE OVER AND OVER, AND WHEN I SHOWED HIM THAT A THIRD OF THE BUSES IN THE CITY WERE BROKEN DOWN, PEOPLE COULDN'T GET TO WORK, HE DIDN'T SAY, IT'S NOT MY JOB. HE CAME FORTH WITH A PLAN THAT GOT US THOSE BUSES AND HE CAME OUT HIMSELF TO SEE THEM DELIVERED. THAT'S HOW MUCH HE CARED ABOUT US. WHEN I SAID TO HIM, WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK BUT SO MANY OF OUR TALENTED WORKERS ARE BEING HELD BACK BY A CRIMINAL CONVICTION, WE HAVE TO GIVE FOLKS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME A SECOND CHANCE, HE, ALONG WITH LABOR SECRETARY TOM PEREZ, GOT US A GRANT. WE WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE DETROIT DETENTION CENTER AND FOLKS WHO ARE ABOUT TO PUT FINISH THEIR PRISON SENTENCES, WE TRAINED THEM TO BE FORKLIFT OPERATORS AND COOKS IN RESTAURANTS, AND WE LITERALLY TOOK THEM WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF PRISON ON FRIDAY INTO A JOB ON MONDAY BECAUSE JOE BIDEN CARES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM A SENATOR WHO IS NOT FROM DETROIT BUT HAS DETROIT IN HER HEART. WHEN SHE WAS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO, SHE STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED BACK ON TRACK TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED AND GIVE THEM A PATH RIGHT BACK INTO THE WORKPLACE TO SAY, YOU HAVE THAT SECOND CHANCE. SHE DID NOT DO THIS WHEN IT WAS POLITICALLY POPULAR. SHE DID IT IN 2004. BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND SO IN 42 DAYS WE GET A CHANCE TO CHANGE THIS, AND GET AN ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON THAT IS ON DETROIT'S SIDE. SO PLEASE, VOTE EARLY. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS ABOUT TO DO IT SHORTLY. REQUEST YOUR BALLOTS. DETROIT, I BELIEVE, IS GOING TO DECIDE THE ELECTION IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT BIG. LET'S ALL GET OUT AND WORK. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, EVERYONE. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE WELL HERE. , SEE YOU ALL HERE. I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT BEING THE PLACEHOLDERS FOR ABOUT 10,000 MORE OF YOU AROUND MICHIGAN. BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS TO WIN THIS. YOU ARE HERE TODAY TO WITNESS OUR TEAM, OUR EFFORTS, AND ALL THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY RECEIVE THE LEADERSHIP THAT OUR DEMOCRACY HAS OUTLINED. IN DETROIT, WE ARE TOUGH. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT US ALL THE TIME AND SAY WE DON'T TAKE NO MESS. WE IN CONGRESS, WHEN I GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AN ISSUE, THEY SAY, YOU KNOW SHE IS FROM DETROIT. BUT WE HAVE SUCH A REPUTATION. WE ARE THE COMEBACK KID. WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. AND THEN WE SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, WE HAVE MORE TO COME. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME TO DETROIT AN AMAZING WOMAN, A WOMAN THAT IS OUR KIND OF PEOPLE. SHE IS A FIGHTER. SHE IS A PERSON WHO HAS NOT GIVEN UP. SHE IS A PERSON WHO HAS COMPASSION. AND I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME A POLITICIAN WITHOUT PASSION IS A CRIMINAL. WE ARE SEEING THAT BEING PLAYED OUT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW WE HER COMPASSION, HER ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, HER INTELLIGENCE, HER ABILITY TO COMPREHEND THE MOVEMENT, THE PROCESS OF LAW. WE KNOW THAT SHE RESPECTS DIVERSITY. SHE HAS PRODUCED MY DIVERSITY THE AMERICAN DREAM. SHE BRINGS TO THE TABLE THINGS WE OFTEN WISH WE HAD RIGHT NOW IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, MICHIGAN. WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO LAST TIME. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. THE BALL IS IN OUR COURT. SO, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I GRIEVED WHEN JOHN LEWIS DIED. BUT JOHN LEWIS SAID KEEP FIGHTING, DON'T GIVE UP. SO, INSTEAD OF US GRIEVING, THE WAY WE FIGHT IS WITH OUR VOTE. WE LOST AN AMAZING WOMAN IN THE NOTORIOUS RBG. BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT US TO GRIEVE. SHE WANTED US TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT. SO WE, WHEN WE LOOK AT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CRIMINAL REFORM AND LOOK AT THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SHED, THE TEARS WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. BUT VOTING WILL. WE HAVE TO VOTE BECAUSE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW, WITH ALL OF THE SPIRIT AND THE HARDSHIPS AND THE SUCCESS AND ALL OF THE INVESTMENT THAT HAS BEEN PLACED IN ME BY THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL FROM THE EAST SIDE OF DETROIT, GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL, KNOWING WHAT IT MEANS TO COME FROM NOTHING AND WORK YOUR WAY THERE, I STAND HERE WITH A VOICE OF DETROIT TO WELCOME OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PLEASE RISE TO YOUR FEET AS WE WELCOME SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS! (music) IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE WITH YOU GUYS. I LOVE DETROIT.

YOU ARE MY FRIEND. YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE LEADER NOT ONLY IN MICHIGAN, BUT NATIONALLY. AND YES, WE HAVE TO REELECT GARY PETERS TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE! GARY IS MY SEAT MATE IN THE SENATE.

WHO IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID FOR THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK? HE TALKS ABOUT THE YOUTH AND THE CHILDREN AND THE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A VITAL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. HE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED TO GROW THE ECONOMY. SO PLEASE, DETROIT AND MICHIGAN, SEND GARY PETERS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [APPLAUSE] SENATE. APPLAUSE FISH APPLAUSE FISH MAYOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME AND THE WORK YOU DO EVERY DAY. I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING BACK ON TRACK, I KNOW YOU DID THE SAME TYPE OF WORK IN DETROIT.

I HAVE WATCHED YOU ON TV. [LAUGHTER] I AM SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. AND ALWAYS, YOU HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL VOICES AND KNOW THE STRENGTH OF YOUR VOICES ALWAYS. WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE SINGING. YOUR VOICES ARE SO POWERFUL, AND YOURS ARE THE VOICES OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE, AND ALWAYS USE THEM IN A WAY THAT OWNS THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU FOR GRACING ME THIS EVENING WITH YOUR PRESENCE. DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR. [APPLAUSE] I AM IN MICHIGAN, AGAIN. LEFT HER [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE I LOVE BEING IN MICHIGAN AND YOU KNOW, DETROIT, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOMETOWN OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, SO MUCH. THERE IS SO MUCH HERE, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME FROM DETROIT, SO MANY WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER AND THE LEADERSHIP OF WHO WE ARE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS ABOUT DETROIT THAT IS NOT ONLY A MEASURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT'S EXCELLENCE BUT ALSO AS A MEASURE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION. AND SO JOE AND I FEEL A PARTICULAR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO BE HERE AND TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN WAS HERE LAST , WEEK, WE WILL KEEP COMING BACK. BECAUSE SO GOES MICHIGAN GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED. AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN MICHIGAN, AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 130 CASES OF CODED WHEN I KNOW THAT WE HAVE , MOURNED THE LOSS OF OVER 7000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. I LOOK AT THAT AND WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS DONE TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS, WHAT IT HAS DONE TO PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE COLLECTIVELY WE ARE MOURNING AND GRIEVING THE LOSS OF LIFE. THE LOSS OF JOBS. THE LOSS OF NORMALCY. THE LOSS OF CONSISTENCY. AND WE HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP IN 42 DAYS AND MICHIGAN WILL BE VOTING IN 48 HOURS. ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL CHART THE COURSE OF THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN A VERY DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE WAY. AND SO I REFERENCE THE PANDEMIC AS TESTAMENT TO THAT POINT. WE HAVE A CHOICE ON ONE HAND OF THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO, AS WE NOW KNOW NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD US ABOUT A CONVERSATION THEY HAD WITH HIM, BUT BECAUSE BOB WOODWARD RECORDED THE CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHEN IN EARLY FEBRUARY IT BECAME CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN BRIEFED IN JANUARY AND TALKED IN FEBRUARY ABOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE, HIS KNOWLEDGE, THAT THIS VIRUS COULD KILL HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IT IS AIRBORNE. HE UNDERSTOOD IT SO WELL HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CATCHING SOMETHING IN THE AIR AND CATCHING SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE. JOE BIDEN WAS FUNNY, HE SAID, AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW THE GUY CAN READ. CLEARLY, HE GOT A BRIEFING. BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVING MISSED KNOWLEDGE, , HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE, ALSO POSSESSING THE TITLE AND MY DUTY TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THEREBY HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCERN HIMSELF AS A FIRST PRIORITY AND WITH THE SAFETY AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, HE WENT ON TO CALL THIS VIRUS A HOAX. WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD DISMISS WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WERE TELLING US. TO THIS DAY, WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW THE MARKER, THE SAD, AWFUL MARKER OF 200,000 LIVES THAT HAVE PERISHED IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. ALMOST 7 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. AND TO THIS DAY, WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO IS HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASK BECAUSE YOU SEE HE HAS CONVINCED EVERYONE, THAT YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK AND YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T. MAKING VALUE JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH NOT DYING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE DESERVE BETTER. [APPLAUSE] WE DESERVE AT HER. WE DESERVE BETTER. AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING, YOU COUPLE THAT WHICH IS ENOUGH, WITH THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BOY BILL BARR ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC POLICY REFORMS IN MODERN HISTORY. CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, AND IT IS CALLED THE \"AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.\" THE \"AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,\" ALSO KNOWN AS \"OBAMACARE.\" WHAT DID IT DO? IT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE AND COVERAGE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. IT SAID, IT'S NOT RIGHT TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, LIKE DIABETES, LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FROM HAVING COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAID, YOU CAN NO LONGER BAN OR PROHIBIT SOMEONE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FROM HAVING THAT KIND OF ACCESS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG LEADERS MIGHT GO INTO A JOB WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL, THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, EVEN THOUGH THEY NEED IT. SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS' COVERAGE UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID ALL OF THAT, AND YET, IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS IN COURT, TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. CHECK THAT OUT. IN THE MIDST OF A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAVELY SICK HAVE MEDICAL CARE. AND ACCESS TO CARE, WITHOUT BEING BURDENED WITH WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD IT, HE IS IN COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. AND THE DETAILS ON THIS MATTER, BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS HE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT LET'S PUT IT IN , THE CONTEXT OF IF HE WINS. IF HE WINS THE ELECTION, AND IF HE WINS THE CASE, IF HE WINS THE CASE, THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AN AMERICA WHEREIN AT LEAST US OF TODAY, 7 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE, IN ADDITION TO THOSE FROM BEFORE, A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THAT IS CALLED THEY CONTRACTED THE COVID VIRUS. WHERE PHYSICIANS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE ARE THINGS LIKE LUNG-SCARRING THAT MAY COME FROM THAT, OTHER UNKNOWN LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE IF HE WINS THIS ELECTION, WINS BEST THAT CASE, IN ADDITION TO OUR PARENTS, OUR GRANDPARENTS, OUR NEIGHBORS AND , THE PEOPLE WE LOVE WHO MAY HAVE DIABETES, WHO MAY HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, THE PEOPLE WE KNOW WHO MAY HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND THANK GOD THEY'VE LIVED , MAY BE DENIED COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE AT PLAY IN THIS ELECTION. SO I AM HERE IN DETROIT ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AT MYSELF. TO HONOR THE FACT THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WILL HAVE A GRAVE CONSEQUENCE AND IMPACT TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND THE CITY OF DETROIT. AND AS A MESSENGER OF THESE POINTS, I WANTED TO BE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I BELIEVE WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR VOTE, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT A PATH TOWARDS VICTORY IN THIS ELECTION RUNS STRAIGHT THROUGH MICHIGAN. SO I AM HERE TO SPEAK WITH YOU , BECAUSE YOU POSSESS AN ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION IN THIS ELECTION THAT COULD IMPACT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M HERE TO ALSO REMIND US, THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE , THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN THE WAY OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. YOU CAN LOOK AT HISTORY, WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW WHY JOHN LEWIS SHED HIS GOD ON THE EDMUND , SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE JUST CELEBRATED WEEKS AGO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. BECAUSE THOSE SUFFRAGETTES FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN TO VOTE. BUT NOTE, WHICH IS MORE THAN A FOOTNOTE, BLACK WOMEN COULDN'T VOTE UNTIL 1965. WE KNOW THAT HISTORY, WE KNOW THE HISTORY THAT IN 2013, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. WHEREIN, ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE LAWS TO TRY AND SUPPRESS, OR PREVENT BLOCK PEOPLE FROM VOTING. STUDENTS FROM VOTING, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FROM VOTING. THE EFFORT WAS SO OBVIOUS, THAT AS AN EXAMPLE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE COURT OF APPEAL WHEN THEY REVIEWED WHAT THAT STATE DID, SAID THAT THE STATE DID IT WITH, QUOTE, \"SURGICAL PRECISION\" TO PREVENT BLACK FOLKS FROM VOTING. 2013, SHALL BE THE HOLDER , SHELBY V. HOLDER, THAT CASE. 2016, I SERVED ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD. RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN, WITH AN INTENT TO CAUSE THE AMERICAN PAPER TO DISTRUST ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PILLARS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHICH IS OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. AND BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE BEING TOLD, THAT THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. SO DETROIT, I THINK ALL OF THIS BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TO PREVENT US FROM VOTING? WHY ARE THEY GOING THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? AND THE ANSWER IS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] SO LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER, THAT IS THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THROUGH OUR VOTE, FROM US. WE MUST VOTE, AND WE MUST VOTE EARLY. IN 48 HOURS, YOU CAN START VOTING HERE IN MICHIGAN. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU VOTE EARLY YOU CAN REMIND FOLKS ALSO , THAT THEY HAVE 40 DAYS TO VOTE. WE'RE ASKING FOLKS TO MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, LIKE PULL OUT YOUR CALENDAR AND MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE THAT THAT IS THE DAY YOU'RE , GOING TO VOTE. YOU CAN EVEN HAVE A CEREMONY ABOUT IT, HAVE A PARTY ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT. BUT LET'S MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. ON SO MANY ISSUES, AND YOU HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. TO VOTE JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO WILL RESTORE THE DIGNITY, THE STANDING, AND THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK AT US, EACH ONE OF US, THEY WILL LOOK IN HER EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM, IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT, WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THE PISTONS' BACKYARD, WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT WITH THE DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATOR AND THE MAYOR. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE WERE COMMITTED OVER THOSE 42 DAYS TO DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKING SURE WE VOTE AND EVERYONE WE KNOW VOTES AND IN THAT WAY, FIGHTS FOR THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE. THANK YOU, DETROIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

EXPECT TO HEAR MORE OF THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS. THIS IS THE HEADLINE FROM A VETERAN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER IN THE WASHINGTON POST. \"DEMOCRATS PLAN TO MAKE THE SUPREME COURT FIGHT ABOUT SAVING THE ACA.\" DEMOCRATS HAVE AN OBVIOUS HYPOCRISY ARGUMENT THEY CAN MAKE AGAINST MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , GOOD AFTERNOON. ON FRIDAY MORNING, I ATTENDED THE MEMORIAL SERVICE OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN IN OUR HISTORY TO LIE IN STATE. I SAT A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HER FLAG DRAPED CASKET TO PAY MY RESPECTS. IT WAS SOMBER AND IT WAS PERSONAL. AND IT WAS AN EXTRA ORDINARY MOMENT FOR ME, AS I AM SURE IT WAS FOR YOU AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO FELT A CONNECTION WITH THE GREAT ARE BG , RBG. IT WAS SAD BECAUSE WE LOST A GIANT NOT ONLY OF THE COURT BUT OF AMERICAN LIFE. IT WAS A CELEBRATION. FEW PEOPLE IN OUR HISTORY HAVE DONE MORE TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAN RUTH BADER GINSBURG DID AS A LAWYER, ADVOCATE, AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND IT WAS AN INSPIRATION AND A CALL TO EACH OF US, FOR EACH OF US TO BE BETTER, TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, AND STAY COMMITTED TO WHAT MOTIVATED JUSTICE GINSBURG THE MOST, THAT PHRASE ETCHED IN THE MARBLE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT \"EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW.\" JUSTICE GINSBURG CAME TO HER VIEW OF THE LAW NOT FROM A TEXTBOOK BUT FROM LIFE. HER OWN LIFE. SHE OFTEN TOLD THE STORY OF HOW SHE HAD PERSONALLY FELT THE STING OF DISCRIMINATION AS A WOMAN, AS THE MOTHER OF A YOUNG CHILD TRYING TO FIND WORK, AND SO SHE COMMITTED HER LIFE STEP-BY-STEP, CASE-BY-CASE, LAW BY LAW, TO TEAR DOWN THE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF SO MANY, AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN. NOW, WE ARE ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF FINDING HER REPLACEMENT ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. OF COURSE, IT IS HARD TO SAY THOSE WORDS. IN TRUTH, RUTH BADER GINSBURG CANNOT BE REPLACED. SHE WAS AND ORIGINAL, A ONE-OF-A-KIND , SHE WAS AN ORIGINAL, A ONE-OF-A-KIND. SHE COMBINED A STEEL SPINE WITH AN ABILITY TO EXTEND AN OPEN HAND, NEVER A CLOSED FIST. SHE DEMONSTRATED YOU COULD BOTH HOLD FIRM TO YOUR PRINCIPLES AND STILL HEAR THOSE WITH WHOM YOU DISAGREE. THAT IS A LESSON THAT SHOULD BE RINGING IN OUR EARS, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING ANY OF THE LESSONS FROM JUSTICE GINSBURG. ALREADY, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY HAVE CHOSEN TO IGNORE JUSTICE GINSBURG'S FINAL WISH TO HOLD OFF THE NOMINATION TO REPLACE HER UNTIL AFTER THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS CHOSEN. I WISH, BY THE WAY, SHARED BY , A WISH, BY THE WAY, SHARED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND, LOOK, IT IS NOT COMPLICATED. THE VOTERS WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THEIR PRESIDENT BEFORE THE SENATE VOTES ON A NOMINEE. AND THAT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IN FACT, MY SENSE IS THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE TOLD. WE ARE NOT EVEN DEBATING , THIS IS IMPORTANT , WE ARE NOT EVEN DEBATING WHETHER THE SENATE SHOULD HOLD HEARINGS ON A NOMINEE IN AN ELECTION YEAR. WE ARE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION YEAR. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION. AN ONGOING ELECTION. ALMOST ONE MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. AND MORE WILL VOTE THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK AND, IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, ALL AMERICANS WILL HAVE VOTED. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY DO NOT CARE. THEY JUST WANT TO JAM THIS NOMINATION THROUGH AS FAST AS THEY CAN. IT IS CALLED RAW POWER. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE ABOUT TO LEARN SOMETHING. THEY MAY THINK THAT IT IS THEY WHO HAVE THE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT THEY DO NOT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE POWER. YOU HAVE THE POWER. AND YOU CAN MAKE IT VERY CLEAR, VERY SOON, HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING CUT OUT OF THIS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION PROCESS. EVEN WORSE, THOSE , EVEN WORSE, BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY , EVEN WORSE THAN BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY IGNORING JUSTICE GINSBURG'S FINAL WISH IS TO SELECT A NOMINEE WHO WILL UNDO HORROR , UNDO HER LIFE'S WORK. IT WILL IMPACT OUR LIVES IN THREE CRITICAL WAYS. THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL GET A JUSTICE WHO WILL GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. JUST DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, THE COURT WILL HEAR A CASE THAT COULD STRIKE DOWN THE AFFORDABLE ITS ENTIRETY. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FOR 20 MILLION AMERICANS. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TOSS OUT THE RULE THAT SAYS CHILDREN CAN BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' HEALTH CARE UP TO THE AGE OF 26. ALL OF THAT WILL HURT THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE COME TO RELY ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND WHAT IS ESPECIALLY OFFENSIVE ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE UP TO IS THIS , GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TAKE US BACKWARD TO A TIME WHERE YOU COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE FOR HER HEALTH CARE THAN YOU COULD CHARGE A MAN JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN. GETTING HER TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL TAKE US BACKWARD TO A TIME WHEN PREGNANCY COULD BE CONSIDERED A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD TAKE AWAY BIRTH CONTROL AND CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE FOR WOMEN. GET THIS , THIS RELENTLESS OBSESSION WITH OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS DRIVEN ENTIRELY BY A BLIND GREED TOWARD , A BLIND READ TOWARD , BLIND RAGE TOWARD PRESIDENT OBAMA AT A TIME WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM THE RAVAGES OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS TAKEN OVER 200,000 LIVES. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD WELL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. IN SHORT, THERE ARE FEW THINGS THEY COULD DO THAT COULD BE MORE OFFENSIVE TO THE LEGACY AND LIFE OF JUSTICE GINSBURG THEN TO RETURN US TO THE FULL-SCALE POLICIES OF DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE THE WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT THAT IS WHAT OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL DO. AND OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS AWAY THE NOMINEE GETS THE SUPPORT OF THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, I DEFENDED YOUR RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. AS SENATOR, I VOTED TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE, BUT NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOMINATED JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT AND WE KNOW WHERE JUDGE STANDS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. JUDGE BARRETT ON RECORD OPPOSING THE DECISION THAT UPHELD THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS RECENTLY AS 2017, SHE SPECIFICALLY ATTACKED THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S OPINION IN AN ARTICLE WHERE SHE SAID \"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS PUSHED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BEYOND ITS PLAUSIBLE MEANING TO SAVE THE STATUTE.\" IF NOTHING ELSE, THE VOTERS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY AND JUDGE MERRICK WILL OVERTURN , AND JUDGE BARRETT WILL OVERTURN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND THEY WILL NOT STOP THERE. THEY HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE AND RESTRICT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. JUDGE BARRETT HAS A LONG RECORD OF OPPOSING ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THERE IS NO OTHER ISSUE THAT SO DISRESPECTS AND DISHONORS THE WORK OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S LIFE THAN UNDOING THE SEMINAL DECISION AND THE COURT , IN THE COURT'S HISTORY THAT MADE IT CLEAR A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. BUT THAT IS WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY AND JUDGE BARRETT ARE. SO, LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE WE ARE. LET'S VOTE FOR HEALTH CARE. VOTE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. VOTE AS IF YOUR LIFE, YOUR CHOICE, DEPENDS ON IT, BECAUSE IT DOES. MAKE IT CLEAR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EVERY REPUBLICAN SENATOR THAT IF THEY ARE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF YOUR HEALTH CARE, YOU WILL BE JUST AS DETERMINED TO VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE. SECOND. VOTE AS IF YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE DEPENDS ON IT, BECAUSE IT DOES. IN 2013, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN SHELL V HOLDER GUTTED THE HEART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. , IN SHELBY VERSUS HOLDER GUTTED THE HEART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AFTER, STATES ENACTED DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AND TARGETED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND STUDENTS. JUSTICE GINSBURG WROTE THAT THE DECISION WAS LIKE \"THROWING AWAY YOUR UMBRELLA IN A RAINSTORM.\" RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, A VOTER SUPPRESSION LAW WAS DESCRIBED BY A FEDERAL COURT IS HAVING TARGETED AFRICAN-AMERICANS , COURT AS HAVING TARGETED AFRICAN-AMERICANS WITH ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISION TO DENY US THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SURGICAL PRECISION. AFTER THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA VOTED TO GRANT FORMERLY INCARCERATED CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO VOTE, REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS RECENTLY ENACTED A MODERN-DAY POLL TAX TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THOSE CITIZENS TO EXERCISE THAT VERY RIGHT IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION. AND THIS MODERN-DAY POLL TAX WAS UPHELD BY THE 11TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF JUDGES APPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMP. BUT, YOU SEE, HERE'S THE THING , HE KNOWS HE CANNOT WIN IF THE PEOPLE VOTE. DONALD TRUMP IS WEAK, SO HE IS THROWING UP EVERY ROADBLOCK HE CAN TO TRY AND SUPPRESS THE VOTE, AND WE THE PEOPLE CANNOT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. THIRD, WHAT IS IT STEAK , WHAT IS AT STAKE. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING, TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES, AND DISMANTLE SYSTEMIC RACISM. THAT IS AT STAKE TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, COURTS CAN DETERMINE YOUR ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING WAGE, RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, OR COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR YOUR RIGHTS AT WORK. WITH AN EXTRA VOTE ON THE COURT, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS PARTY WILL CONTINUE THEIR ATTACK ON LAWS THAT KEEPS OUR AIR CLEAN AND FOOD AND WATER SAFE AND ATTACKS ANY LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DIVIDE US AND IGNORE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL PLAGUES OUR SOCIETY. THERE DECISIONS COULD FAIL TO HOLD , THEIR DECISIONS COULD FAIL TO HOLD THE ACTORS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACCOUNTABLE. VICTIMS OF BRUTALITY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT MIGHT BE LESS SUCCESSFUL TO SUCCEED IN CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS. THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT WOULD UPEND JUSTICE GINSBURG'S LIFE'S WORK TO UPHOLD BASIC LIBERTIES OF ALL AMERICANS. REGARDLESS OF RACE, GENDER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, OR ECONOMIC STATION. YES, SHE WAS PART OF OUR CULTURE. YES, WE WEAR THOSE NOTORIOUS BUIG T-SHIRTS WITH A LOT OF PRIDE, BUT SINCE SHE PASSED, THERE ARE PARENTS REMINDING CHILDREN THAT SHE HELPED THEIR LIVES IN CONCRETE YET IMMEASURABLE WAYS. BECAUSE OF HER, THEY COULD GET A JOB OF THEIR DREAMS, FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY FOR THEIR WORK, MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE, SERVE THE COUNTRY THEY LOVE, AND ENJOY THE FULL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENSHIP THAT THEY DESERVE FREE OF DISCRIMINATION. AND THAT LEGACY, HER BELIEF IN ALL OF US, IS AT STAKE. THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, AFFECTS EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE AND EVERY PART OF , AND EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT ALL AT ONCE WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL LAST GENERATIONS. AND ALL OVER THE NATION IN CRISIS AND AT A CROSSROADS, THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, OUR RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE, A CRISIS WITH THE NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT. SO, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT IT FEELS SOMETIMES LIKE THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH FOR US TO TAKE, TOO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY TO TAKE. AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE. THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL TIRED. THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOUR FIGHT DOES NOT MATTER. BUT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP AND WE WILL NOT GIVE IN. WE WILL NOT LET THE INFECTION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INJECTED INTO THE PRESIDENCY AND INTO CONGRESS, THAT HAS PARALYZED OUR POLITICS AND PITTED AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER, SPREAD TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN THE PRESIDENCY OR THE SENATE OR THE SUPREME COURT. THIS ELECTION AS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. , IS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. AND AS JOE BIDEN HAS SAID FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THIS RACE, IT IS ABOUT THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WHO WE WANT TO BE. AND THAT IS WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAID GOODBYE TO JUSTICE GINSBERG. SHE UNDERSTOOD THE SOUL OF OUR NATION AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF EACH OF US AND THAT BELIEF IS ESPECIALLY RESONANT AT A PLACE LIKE SHAW UNIVERSITY, ONE OF OUR NATION'S FIRST BLACK LANDMARKS OF PEOPLE MOURN INTO BONDAGE AND BRUTALITY STOOD ON , BORN INTO BONDAGE AND BRUTALITY STOOD ON THIS GROUND AS SCHOLARS. I STAND HERE, AT THE COUNTRY'S FIRST UNIVERSITY HALL BUILT TO EDUCATE BLACK WOMEN IN AMERICA, A CENTURY LATER AND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE GREENSBORO SITTON, ELLA BAKER AND FELLOW STUDENTS , SIT IN, ELLA BAKER AND FELLOW STUDENTS STARTED THE COMMITTEE. I STAND HERE ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND WITH ALL OF YOU AS THE NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I STAND WITH JOE BIDEN, WHO WILL BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I STAND WITH CAL CUNNINGHAM, WHO WILL BE THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND I STAND WITH THEM AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO LIKE JUSTICE GINSBURG TRULY BELIEVES IN EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. MAY GOD BLESS JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?476306-1\/senator-kamala-harris-remarks-supreme-court","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke in Raleigh, North Carolina, on the importance of the Supreme Court.","Source":"476306-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

[HONKING] RIDIN' WITH BIDEN, ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IT HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THIS COMMUNITY. WHENEVER THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN HIT NATIONALLY, LAS VEGAS GETS THE WORST OFWORSE OF IT. WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY THAT MORE HOTELS AND AIRLINES ARE LAYING OFF PEOPLE.

BUT BECAUSE OF HIS LEADERSHIP, WE ARE GETTING THROUGH THIS, AND NOW HE IS TAKING TIME TO BE WITH US TODAY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. [HONKING] THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL OR BRINGING BACK OUR JOBS. IT IS ABOUT GIVING OUR ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES THE PAY THAT THEY DESERVE AND THE PROTECTIONS THEY NEED TO BE ON THE FRONTLINES FOR US. IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND NOT A BROKEN DOWN WALL THAT WON'T KEEP PEOPLE OUT ANYWAY. IT IS ABOUT HONORING THE PEOPLE WE LOST, TAKING ACTION AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE, NOT JUST GIVING THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. [HONKING] AND THE ELECTION IS ABOUT CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE, BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PRETEND LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST. [HONKING] AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM, NOT GIVING MARCHING ORDERS TO WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS. [HONKING] THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LEADERS TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN, BACK WHEN THERE WERE ENOUGH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TO FIT ON ONE STAGE. I KNOW JOE BIDEN, AND JOE BIDEN KNOWS US. HE HAS THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE, THE BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE, AND THE STRENGTH OF CONVICTION TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER. HE HAS A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE VIRUS AND RESTORE OUR ECONOMY. HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SUFFER PERSONAL HARDSHIPS, AND HAS EMPATHY FOR THOSE OF US WHO GO THROUGH IT, TOO.

I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WELCOME HER, GIVE HER A WARM, WARM WELCOME, BECAUSE SHE IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF DYNAMIC, EXCITING PARTNER THAT JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO GET THIS DONE, BOTH IN THE ELECTION AND IN THE GOVERNMENT. SHE HAS NEVER HESITATED TO TAKE ON POWERFUL PEOPLE OR POWERFUL INTERESTS. SHE IS WICKED SMART, DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE, AND HAS PROVEN TO BE A FORCE IN THE SENATE. SHE COMES FROM CALIFORNIA, AND WE ARE CLOSE BY, SO NEVADA IS LIKE HER FIRST COUSIN. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. SHE IS ALREADY MAKING HISTORY. SHE IS GOING TO BE AN OUTSTANDING VICE PRESIDENT. SHE IS A FRIEND OF OURS, SHE IS A GREAT PARTNER TO JOE BIDEN. GIVE HER A WARM WELCOME, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. [HONKING] IT IS SO GOOD TO BE WITH YOU ALL. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND ALL THAT YOU DO. WHAT A FIGHTER YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. OH, WOW. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE SO MANY INCREDIBLE LEADERS THIS AFTERNOON WHO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE BEGINNING, AND WE WILL COUNT ON THEM TO LEAD US THROUGH THESE NEXT 32 DAYS OF VICTORY. I WANT TO THANK THEM. SHELBY PARKS, OUR FIELD ORGANIZER. THE STATE GOVERNOR. [HONKING] I WAS JUST HANGING OUT WITH HIM BEHIND THE STAGE. OF COURSE, OR CONGRESSWOMAN FOR ALL SHE DOES. SHE IS A FIGHTER. GOVERNOR JACKY ROSEN. THEY WERE GOING TO BE HERE, BUT THEY WANTED TO STAY IN D.C. THEY ARE FIGHTING HOME TO BRING , THEY ARE FIGHTING TO BRING HOME RELIEF TO NEVADA. THEY ARE FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE CARE OF AMERICA. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US TODAY. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. ALL RIGHT , IS THIS WORKING? THERE WE GO. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE, AND WE HAVE 36 DAYS TO GET THIS DONE AND WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE. HERE IS THE THING. THIS CAMPAIGN, OUR CAMPAIGN, AS JOE SAID, IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT, WHEN JOE TALKS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR WORKING PEOPLE, ED IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR GOOD UNION JOBS, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING TO PRESERVE OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND RENEWING PRODUCTIONS UNDER DACA. THERE IS SO MUCH ON THE LINE IN THIS ELECTION. AND THERE IS NOT A THING WE CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED. NOT A THING WE CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED. WE ARE HERE FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, SAYING YES, WE CAN GET CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND POLICING REFORM. YES, WE CAN DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BRING HEALTH CARE TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. [HONKING] THESE ARE THE THINGS ON THE LINE IN THIS ELECTION, AND WE HAVE 32 DAYS TO GET IT DONE. AND I DON'T NEED TO TELL MY COUSINS IN NEVADA , [HONKING] , ABOUT THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING WITH THE WORK WE ARE DOING. THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING, WHEN WE KNOW HERE IN NEVADA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. WHERE THERE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF AN ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE SERIOUSLY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THEN DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT WORKING PEOPLE. BUT WE SEE THE CHANGE COMING. BUT WE KNOW IT WILL NOT COME WITHOUT OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS FIGHT. WE HAVE A VISION OF THE FUTURE. OUR CAMPAIGN, AND THE WORK, THE HARD WORK, THE SACRIFICE WE WILL MAKE OVER THE NEXT 32 DAYS, IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE. AND THAT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN FIGHTING AGAINST SOMETHING. IT IS ABOUT THE FIGHT WE ARE IN FOR SOMETHING, FOR THE PEOPLE, ALL THE PEOPLE. [HONKING] THAT IS WHAT OUR FIGHT IS ABOUT. AND THE THING ABOUT IT , AND THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW YOU MEASURE STRENGTH. SOME PEOPLE SAY, LOOK AT MY MUSCLES. YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY, BUT THE THING I LOVE ABOUT JOE, HE COULD ALSO SAY, YEAH, LOOK AT MY MUSCLES , THE THING ABOUT JOE, HE UNDERSTANDS THE GREATEST STRENGTH THAT ANY OF US, THAT ANY HUMAN BEING HAS, IS DISPLAYED WHEN WE LIFT UP THE CONDITION OF OTHER PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE. [HONKING] THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AND THEREFORE, THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE IS KNOWING THAT WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER, WHEN WE ARE JOINED, WHEN WE ARE UNIFIED, WHEN WE DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRY TO DIVIDE US AND TURN ON EACH OTHER, WE ARE STRONG AND IN SPITE OF ALL WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING, FOLKS, DON'T LET ANYBODY MAKE YOU FEEL ALONE. DON'T LET ANY CIRCUMSTANCE MAKE YOU FEEL ISOLATED, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. [CARS HONKING] BUT TO ACHIEVE THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING, WE HAVE TO VOTE. WE GOT TO VOTE. SO, WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO? HONK IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE EARLY. [LAUGHTER] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE BY MAIL. [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO AND VOTE. [CARS HONKING] [LAUGHTER] AND HERE IS THE THING. NONE OF US ARE IMMUNE. WE HAVE BEEN READING IT. WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME POWERFUL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO VOTE. DID YOU GUYS SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS YESTERDAY? THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF TEXAS BASICALLY STARTED GETTING RID OF THE DROP BOXES IN TEXAS. YEAH, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. SO, HERE IS THE THING. THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THE RIGHT TO VOTE, WAS A HARD-FOUGHT AND HARD WON RIGHT. IN FACT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS I ATTENDED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK WAS TO WALK ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN ALABAMA WITH THE NOW GREAT ANCESTOR JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THAT BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS WHEN WE VOTE. JUST LAST MONTH, WE CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, WHEN THOSE SUFFRAGETTES, THOSE POWERFUL WOMEN, MARCHED AND FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN IN AMERICA TO VOTE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1965 THAT BLACK WOMEN COULD VOTE. [HONKING] SO WE KNOW THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO AND WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. BUT THIS IS THE HISTORY OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. OUR RIGHT TO VOTE WAS A HARD-FOUGHT AND WON RIGHTS WHICH WE WILL NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE FROM US. BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE OBSTACLES AROUND THE COUNTRY BEING PUT IN OUR WAY. WE KNOW THERE ARE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO SUGGEST YOU CANNOT TRUST THE PROCESS, TRYING TO SUGGEST IT IS RIGGED OR THIS OR THAT, BUT WE KNOW BETTER. WE KNOW BETTER. AND HERE'S THE THING I WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT. AT SOME POINT IN ADDITION TO VOTING, IT HAS TO BE ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS. AND IN ADDITION TO VOTING, IT HAS TO BE ABOUT KNOWING WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO ASK, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE? JUST SIT BACK AND ASK THAT. WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE GOING THROUGH SUCH DIFFICULTY TO TRY AND MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE? HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. [HONKING] THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS GET BETTER. SO, NEVADA, NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE YOUR POWER. WE WILL NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER. WE WILL USE OUR POWER. WE WILL VOTE. WE KNOW OUR VOTE IS OUR VOICE. WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND WE KNOW WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, IN THIS FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND IT IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY. KNOWING WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THANK YOU, NEVADA. THANK YOU.

I THINK PITTS WAS UNDISCIPLINED, AND THE DO NOT THINK THAT HARRIS WAS STRONG ENOUGH ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT SHE COULD'VE BEEN. PENCE LIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD TO THE NEGATIVE WHEN HE KNEW THAT OUT OF 50 JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THAT NOT ONE HAS BEEN BLOCKED, AS HARRIS POINTED OUT. I DO NOT THINK THAT SHE WAS FORCEFUL IN THE FACT THAT WHEN HE ASKED HER A QUESTION ABOUT PACKING THE COURT, SHE SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUT THAT HE WAS NOT THERE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS, BUT RESPOND TO THE MODERATOR. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERATOR, I THINKS THAT SHE DID A POOR JOB WHEN IT COMES TO MODERATOR. (music) THANK YOU ALSO MUCH. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS VANESSA MONTES CAR SURVEY , I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARD-WORKING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY MOTHER IS NO LONGER HERE, BUT VERY PRESENT IN MY HEART. SHE TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF HARD WORK AND A SACRIFICE. SHE TAUGHT ME TO BE A WOMAN OF FAITH AND LOVE ABOVE ALL. I GREW UP IN PHOENIX ARIZONA. DUE TO THE IMMENSE SACRIFICE OF MY PARENTS HARD WORK, I WAS ABLE TO ATTEND A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, AND I AM UP PROUD GRADUATE OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER. I OWN SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. INCLUDING LEGENDS EVENT CENTER. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR VENUES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IF YOU TOLD ME EARLIER THIS YEAR, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT I WOULD BE STANDING FOR YOU, INTRODUCING YOU TO THE FUTURE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT. THIS HAS BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR MANY OF US. IN MY INDUSTRY, THE EVENTS BUSINESS, WE HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HARD. MY BUSINESS WAS SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE ONLY STARTED HOSTING SMALL EVENTS IN RECENT WEEKS. AFRAID FOR MY FAMILIES LIVELIHOOD, IT WAS A SACRIFICE THAT WE MADE TO KEEP OUR FRIENDS, BUT IT WASN'T EASY. WHILE BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS BENEFITED FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND LOANS, MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY, WAS LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES. OUR RESTAURANTS, OUR CLOTHING STORES, OUR TECH COMPANIES, WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS CITY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE IN PLACES WHERE OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS CELEBRATE MAJOR MILESTONES AND SPEND THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PLACE WHERE HARD WORK, ALONG WITH TALENT AND INNOVATION, CAN COME TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND HELP US BUILD BETTER LIVES. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN SENATOR HARRIS UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HARD WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MY BUSINESS IS MORE THAN JUST WHERE I WORK. IT IS PART OF WHO I AM. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE MEASURE HOW GOOD OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BY HOW WELL OUR WORKERS ARE DOING, WHETHER THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP AND WHETHER THEIR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. AND WHETHER THEIR KIDS HAVE A BETTER LIFE AHEAD OF THEM. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO HELP US BUILD BACK BETTER. WE KNOW WHAT'S WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP , WHAT WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP. NO PLAN FOR COVID-19 AND NO PLAN TO HELP US SAFELY REOPEN OUR BUSINESSES. AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, WE KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED EARLY VOTING STARTED YESTERDAY IN ARIZONA. I SAW PEOPLE LINED UP BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED TO BE THE FIRST AMONG TO CASTE THEIR BALLOTS. THIS CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. I AM GOING TO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. TO MAKE SURE MY VOTE IS COUNTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS, I AM VOTING NOT JUST FOR ME, I AM VOTING FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY, FOR MY SIX BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND FOR THEIR FUTURE. FOR MY FELLOW LATINOS PARENT , LATINOS. I HAVE FAITH THAT WE WILL ELECT THE LEADERS THAT WILL RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AS MR. BIDEN SAYS , [SPEAKING SPANISH] TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY GREAT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TWO STRONG AND OUTSTANDING LEADERS, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HI, EVERYBODY. WHERE IS VANESSA? THANK YOU, VANESSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF LABOR. EARLIER, JOE AND I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT THE INDIAN VETERANS NATIONAL MEMORIAL AND TAKE TRIBUTE TO THE AID OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM. WE WERE JOINED BY CINDY MCCAIN, A LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOE'S, AND SOMEONE I ADMIRE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO SERVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN IN THE SENATE AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AMERICAN. HE WAS A PATRIOT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND CINDY IS SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] AND SHE IS DOING IT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT JOE AND I WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT SHE AND JOHN DID, AND THAT IS PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. SO WE THANK CITY , CINDY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE IN ARIZONA TODAY. LATER, WE WILL TALK WITH WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD AND DOING EVERYTHING RIGHTS, BUT STILL STRUGGLING TO GET BY. THEY ARE WHO I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE. THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, WILL AFFECT EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES. THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY LAST GENERATIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. OUR NATION IS AT A CROSSROADS. JUST THINK, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, A RECKONING ON RACIAL JUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT IS BATTERING OUR COASTLINES AND SETTING THE WEST ON FIRE, AND THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE HANGS ON TOP OF IT ALL. BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ALONG WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS, HE IS TRYING TO JAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. WHO WILL RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FROM AS MANY AS 2.8 MILLION ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. TWO POINT EIGHT ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHILE THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BRING THE VIRUS TO OUR SHORES, HIS RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THE WAY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN IN NORMA'S , ENORMOUS. HIS REFUSAL TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS IS WHAT HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON OUR ECONOMY. I KNOW FOLKS ARE HURTING BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS THE THING. JOE HAS HAD A PLAN FOR COVID AT LEAST SINCE MARCH. HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, HE KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS AND THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL. JOE KNOWS THESE THINGS. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. EVEN WHEN JOE DID NOT HAVE THE BRIEFINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAD , MIKE PENCE HAD , JOE NEWBY BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THAT THIS COULD BE SERIOUS AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, WE WILL CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND SAVE LIVES AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. JOE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESTORES THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND EASES THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES. AND ABOVE ALL, JOE WILL BE A RESIDENT WHO UNITES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT, OLD AND YOUNG, FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND RACES TO MEET THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. I PLAN ON BEING RIGHT BY HIS SIDE AND , [APPLAUSE] , AND WE WILL BE REDDY ON DAY ONE. , READY ON DAY ONE. HERE IS THE THING, ARIZONA. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE HAVE ONLY 26 DAYS LET'S NOT WAKE UP THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION WISHING WE HAD DONE MORE. LET'S ORGANIZE AND VOTE IN NUMBERS NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. LET'S SEND MARK KELLY TO THE SENATE. [APPLAUSE] VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT REALLY DOES. YESTERDAY, ARIZONA, VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WERE SHIPPED TO HOMES ACROSS THIS STATE AND EARLY VOTING HAS STARTED, INCLUDING AT THE NEW MCDOWELL SQUARE VOTING CENTER ABOUT A MILE FROM HERE. SO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO VOTE IN ARIZONA. YOU CAN VOTE BY MAIL, YOU CAN DROP OFF YOUR BALLOT AT A DROPBOX, YOU CAN VOTE EARLY IN PERSON, OR YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON ON ELECTION DAY. TO LEARN MORE, GO TO IWIL LVOTE.COM\/AZ. MAKE A PLAN. TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO DO THE SAME. ARIZONA'S FUTURE, AMERICA'S FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS. SO LET'S ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE GREAT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU, KAMALA. THANK YOU, VANESSA. WE MET BACKSTAGE AND THE FIRST INSTANT WE HAD WAS TO HUG EACH OTHER , NO, WE HAVE TO STAY 12 FEET APART. I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO RUBEN AND DANIEL FOR BEING HERE. BIG DEAL, MAN. I NOTICE , THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A POSTMAN'S HOLIDAY, COMING TO HEAR ANOTHER POLITICIAN SPEAK. AND PUTTING ON A TIE WHEN HE SHOWS UP WITHOUT A TIE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT AND COO OF THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL. WHERE ARE YOU? IS IN HERE OR IS HE IN HIS OFFICE? I WANT TO THANK HIM. ALSO, THE PRESIDENT OF LOCAL 1912. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, WE SAID, NOT A JOKE, IT WAS COINCIDENTAL, SHE SAID, I LOVE THE CARPENTERS, THE FIRST OUTFIT THAT ENDORSED ME WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE CARPENTERS. I SAID, I REMEMBER A GUY, PRESIDENT OF THE CARPENTERS UNION FROM DELAWARE, A 350-YEAR-OLD CITY, WAS THE FIRST WANT TO ENDORSE ME AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN WITH THEM MICHAEL CAREER. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FRIEND, WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER A LONG TIME. 520,000 CARPENTERS, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE ARMY TO HAVE BEHIND YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE MY FULL CAREER AND I HOPE YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD YOURS AS WELL. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN SCRANTON, THE CARPENTERS BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE AND WE ARE GOING HOME TOGETHER. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. PEOPLE WHO SHAPED THE SKYLINES, WHO BUILT THE FOUNDATIONS WE RELY ON, THE CARPENTERS. LABOR BROUGHT ME TO DANCE AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I'VE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE OF LABOR. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. I REALLY MEAN IT. I GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THIS, BUT IT IS TRUE. YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE SPINE OF AMERICA. YOU ARE THE ONES YOU BUILD THE COUNTRY, NOT WALL STREET AND CEO'S, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE BUILD IT AGAIN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER FOR REAL. KAMALA AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, BUT THE SENATOR HAD A HECK OF A NIGHT LAST NIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME CREDIT FOR KNOWING HOW TO PICK A VICE PRESIDENT. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER. SHE IS LIKE A YOUNGER SISTER. REMARKABLE CHARACTER AND VISION. ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE. ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE, NOT HER, ALWAYS. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. KEMAL AND I ARE ABOUT TO KICK OFF A TOUR VISITING BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY. SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, THEY ARE BUSTING THEIR NEXT, THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE JOBS THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATE ENTITIES. THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOUND ITSELF HAVING TO GO THROUGH REAL CHALLENGING TIMES. THE CONGRESSMAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN MOST PEOPLE KNOW. LIKE CHEF SOLANA, THE CHEF OWNS TWO RESTAURANTS IN PHOENIX. ONE, SHE HAD , SHE HAD TO CLOSE ONE OF THEM DOWN. SHE IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP THE OTHER ONE AFLOAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE VISITING IT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. IT ISN'T EASY. THE LOAN THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE BACK IN THE SPRING BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION PASSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE HELPS FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE IS SCRAPING BY, TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR HER 10 EMPLOYEES, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR DECADES. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE IS FACING A TERMINAL DISEASE. SHE HAD TO CANCEL HER OWN HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER FINISHING A ROUND OF TREATMENT TO RECENTLY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT IS DEVASTATING. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH. I THINK YOU ALL ARE. I KNOW I AM BECAUSE I KNOW WE KNOW IT DID NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. IF THEY HAD JUST DONE WHAT YOU PASSED, JUST MOVED FORWARD. HER STORY IS INCREASINGLY A COMMON STORY OF ARIZONA WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. TOO MANY ARE FACING HARD TIMES NOW. THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE IT IS ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. ALL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN HE COULD NOT FIND WORK WHEN COLD DIED , COAL DIED. HE HAD TO TAKE US UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT EVER HAS TO TAKE TO SAY, I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO ST. PAUL'S, THAT HAS LOST HIS JOB, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US TO OUR GRANDPA'S HOUSE, ME AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER AND MY MOM WHO WAS SHORTLY GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR MY DAD, SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN HAVE DONE THE SAME THING, HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND SAY, I HAVE TO ASK A FAVOR. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRIDE IT COST HIM. CAN YOU TAKE THEIR OF THEM , CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR A YEAR? I WILL BE BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB, ENOUGH TO GET US AN APARTMENT IN DELAWARE, HE ENDED UP THEN GETTING A GOOD JOB, A DECENT JOB MANAGING A CAR DEALERSHIP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. HE SAID, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I EXPECT THEM TO AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. AMERICA DESERVES A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE AMERICA , WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. WHO SEES WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE, WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOUR PROSPERITY, YOUR DREAM, YOUR AMERICAN DREAM. YOU ARE FACING REAL CHALLENGES AND THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATES THEM. WHO IGNORES YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY IT, I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, THE PRESIDENT LOOKS DOWN ON US. WHO THINKS THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, YOU ARE A LOSER, A SUCKER. THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH CINDY. MY SON PASSED AWAY NOW COMING ON FIVE YEARS, IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY, WON THE BRONZE STAR, HE VOLUNTEERED, HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE HAD TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. I PROMISE YOU, HE WAS NOT A LOSER, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE, LIKE ALL THE VETERANS WE MET WITH THIS AFTERNOON ALONGSIDE CINDY MCCAIN, ARE PATRIOTS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. JOHN MCCAIN, WHO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING ME TO DO HIS EULOGY, WE USED TO ARGUE, WE WERE LIKE BROTHERS, WE WOULD FIGHT LIKE HELL, BUT WE ALWAYS ENDED UP TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW IT USED TO BE. IT USED TO BE THAT WAY ACROSS THE BOARD. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SAY ANYTHING TO DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISTAKES HE MAKES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, HE RECENTLY SAID , I ASKED WHERE HE GOT THE COVID, HE SAID, I PROBABLY GOT IT FROM BLUE STAR PARENTS, PEOPLE WHO LOST A CHILD IN BATTLE. HE SAID, THEY LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO ME AND HUGGED ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO. LOOK. WE HAVE PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC LEADERSHIP. 210,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. WE LOSE MORE EVERY DAY. 6000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN LOST. 6000, DON. , GONE. 200 , 220,000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. 122,000 JOBS IN ARIZONA STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. NINE TIMES MORE ARIZONANS ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT EACH WEEK THEN BEFORE THE CRISIS HIT. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING, SCHOOLS ARE NOT BACK TO NORMAL. DONALD TRUMP CAN'T FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. THE HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACTS, THE SECOND BIG PACKAGE, TO GET PEOPLE ON THEIR FEET AGAIN. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND MITCH MCCONNELL DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. A LOT OF CITIES AND STATES ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. OUR FOUNDERS WERE SMART, THE REASON WHY THEY PUT THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THEY DID IS SO CONGRESS, THE SENATE, THE HOUSE GOOD DEFICIT SPEND TO COMPENSATE FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUT OF A HOLE. TRUMP IS SPENDING MORE TIME , I HAVE BEEN CALLING ON THIS FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS , HE SHOULD GET OUT OF HIS BUNKER AND OUT OF THE SAND TRAP OF HIS GOLF COURSES , NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. I HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. HE NEVER ONE SINGLE TIME TRY TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO GET A SETTLEMENT. NOT ONCE. YOU CAN'T NAME ME A PRESIDENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANY OF YOU THAT REFUSED TO DEAL THAT WAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. BUT THE LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ON HIS WATCH. ON TUESDAY, THE CONGRESS , I'M SURE YOU WERE NOT SURPRISED BY IT , ON TUESDAY, HE ANNOUNCED HE IS WALKING AWAY FROM NEGOTIATIONS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR WORKING THE WEALTHY. IF THIS WAS NOT SO TRUE, IT WOULD SOUND SO BIZARRE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FORGOTTEN THE PEOPLE THAT HE SAID HE IS FIGHTING FOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FOR WHERE I GREW IN SCRANTON. I NOTE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT THE WORKING CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I MEASURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WITH WHAT FAMILIES ARE TALKING ABOUT, SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLES. ABOUT HAVING A DECENT JOB AND BENEFITS. ABOUT KEEPING THE SMALL BUSINESS DREAM ALIVE. ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING. NEW TIRES. WE HAVE TO WAIT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEM. WE CANNOT DO IT. WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER THAT SHE CANNOT GO BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE WE CANNOT BORROW MONEY ANYMORE. WE HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY. INCLUDING HERE IN ARIZONA. WHO WORRIED ABOUT IF THEY CAN PAY THIS MONTH'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT. 20 MILLION. LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET THROWN OUT INDUSTRY IF THEY CANNOT PAY THE RENT. THESE GUYS PROVIDED FOR ALL OF THAT. NOTHING. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE. MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT JOEY, YOUR JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN ABOUT YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT IS WHAT KAMALA AND I ARE FOCUSING ON. TO SAY TO OUR KIDS, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN SAFELY AND STRONGLY. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO GET , WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER. YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS DONE SHOW, BUT THAT WAS THE PAST. IF WE CANNOT BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, WE ARE DEAD. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY THAT DEPENDS ON A CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT WAS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME, BUT I MADE A MAJOR SPEECH THAT I WORKED ON REALLY HARD IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO. I TALKED ABOUT IN LINCOLN TERMS, THAT WE HAVE TO BRING AMERICA TOGETHER. WE CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I'M RUNNING WITH A PROUD DEMOCRAT, WITH A CAPITAL D. BY WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, NOT A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK HARD FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. I PROMISE YOU. LOOK AMERICA. THE FACT IS, THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. FOR EVERYBODY. DOCTORS WHO VOTED FOR. AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH. ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS, AND DO NOTE THAT POWER IS? THE LITTLE STICKER THAT YOU HAVE ON. THE POWER TO VOTE. YOU CAN STILL REGISTER HERE IN ARIZONA TO VOTE. EARLY VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ARIZONANS VOTE BY MAIL. THOSE BALLOTS START TO ARRIVE AT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. KAMALA AND I ARE SAYING THAT THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY, AND NOT RISK DELAYS. TURN THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. YOUR VOICE CAN OVERCOME CORRECT AND YOUR VOICE THROUGH YOUR VOTE, CAN OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SETTING UP? THE ARGUMENT THAT THESE VOTES ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENS TODAY WITH THE FBI. THE FBI ARRESTED A GROUP OF MILITIAMEN. THEY HAD PLANNED AND PLANNED TO GO IN AND KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN. REMEMBER THOSE GUYS WOULD BE ASSAULT RIFLES STANDING IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS? THE PRESIDENT SAYING THINGS IN MY DEBATE WITH THEM, TO THE PROUD BOYS, AND ALL WHITE THE PREMISES GROUP, STANDS DOWN AND STAND READY? THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. WE CANNOT JUST WIN BY A VOTE. WE HAVE TO ALL TURN OUT. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN'T BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BREASTS. , WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. AT OUR BEST, WE ARE THAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS NOT A PROSAIC THING. THE FACT IS, AMERICANS NEVER FAIL. WHEN STANDING UP TOGETHER. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS, WAR AND ECONOMIC, STRONGER THAN WE WENT INTO THE CRISIS. FOLKS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES AT HOME AND IN THE WORLD THAN I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG TIME. I WORK WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. I MEAN IT. WE HAVE A CHANCE. TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE OUR COUNTRY, BUT TO CHANGE THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE WEST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO US. , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO U.S.. IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT A POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWING US. THAT EXAMPLE IS BEING TRASH AROUND THE WORLD. AS THE SENATOR SAID LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE, IT IS TRUE. 17 MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD 'S ASKS WHAT LEADERS THEY ADMIRE AND TRUST THE MOST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? MORE PEOPLE TRUSTED THE LEADER OF CHINA AND PUTIN OF RUSSIA RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS PROFOUND SECURITY AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. LET'S NOT QUIT FOLKS. THERE IS NO QUITTING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER QUIT, AND IF WE NEED YOU TO STAND UP AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE NEED YOU NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU EVERYBODY. (music) MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT WE ARE ALL LIVING AN EXAMPLE GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GIVE US WHAT YOU GET.

TO SAY THANK YOU. LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL EVERYBODY HERE, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WHO WATCHED THE DEBATE? [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD TWO, I GUESS. I REALLY MEANT THAT TOWN HALL. DID YOU ALL SEE JOE BIDEN AND THAT TOWN HALL? WASN'T A SPECTACULAR? IN THIS ELECTION, FOLKS HAVE GOT TWO CHOICES. I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN THOSE TOWN HALLS LAST WEEK REALLY MADE CLEAR THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHOICES BEING MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO IS DEDICATED TO BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS THAT HE AND PRESIDENT BLOCK , PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA CREATED WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE, AN INITIATIVE BORN OUT OF THE BELIEF THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. IT IS JUST NOT RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, THAT THEY GET DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE AN INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS WE DON'T COVER IT. THEY GOT RID OF THAT BAN, AND SAID NO LONGER CAN YOU DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IF YOU HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR WORKING PEOPLE HIS ENTIRE LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO, RIGHT NOW WITH BILL BARR IS IN THE UNITED STATES OF RECORD TRYING TO SUE AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT , IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, TRYING TO SUE AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY WILL GET RID OF HEALTH CARE FOR 20 MILLION PEOPLE. THEY WILL LOSE THE PROTECTIONS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN NEED COVERAGE IF THEY HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT IS SHAMEFUL. THERE IS A CLEAR CONTRAST HERE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN SAYING TAXES WILL NOT BE RAISED ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 PER YEAR. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO PASSED TAX BREAKS FOR THE 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. IN FLORIDA, YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE HURTING. PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. ONE IN EIGHT FLORIDIANS IS DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS. IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW, ONE IN FIVE FLORIDIANS IS DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS BEING UNABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT IN SEPTEMBER. YET, DONALD TRUMP WOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS OK. HIS MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY IS BASED ON THE STOCK MARKET. OUR MEASURE IS BASED ON HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW YOU DOING? WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALL WEARING MASKS. THE REASON I'M NOT WEARING ONE AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE I AM THIS FAR AWAY FROM HER BODY. WHY ARE WE WEARING MASKS? WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS INFORMED ON JANUARY 28 THAT IT WAS LETHAL AND KILLED FIVE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS THE FLU. HE WAS INFORMED IT COULD HURT CHILDREN. HE WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS CONTAGIOUS AND AIR BOUND. HE STOOD AT RALLIES, STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND HE DID NOT TELL YOU WHAT HE KNEW. IMAGINE IF YOU KNEW ON JANUARY 20 WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28, AND WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE OR BEEN ABLE TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, CHECK YOUR CHILDREN, KNOWING THAT IT WOULD BE INEVITABLE THAT THERE WOULD BE A TIME THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO STAY HOME FROM WORK AND MAYBE YOU COULD PLAN FOR THAT INSTEAD, HE HELD ONTO THAT INFORMATION, HE COVERED IT UP. AND HE TOLD THE PEOPLE, US, WE THE PEOPLE, YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK, ANOTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN STANCE WITH THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE. HE KNOWS THAT THIS ELECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE PEOPLE. WHAT IS AHEAD OF US IS A FIGHT KNOWING THAT WE DON'T WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FULL TIME TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AGAINST US. WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW, STANDING IN THE RAIN, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS AND WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN THE STRENGTH OF OUR PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY BASED ON OUR LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. HERE IN FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME OF THE GREAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, SOME OF THE MAYORS. I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT SOME OTHER FOLKS ELECTED IN FLORIDA. I AM NOT GOING TO MENTION ANY NAMES. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUGGEST TO YOU THAT YOU CAN'T TRUST OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT VOTING AND SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THERE IS SOMETHING THAT LACKS INTEGRITY ABOUT OUR SYSTEM. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT YOUR POWER TO VOTE, CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT HOW TO VOTE. WE ARE SMARTER THAN THAT AND WE KNOW THE POWER THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE VOTE. SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO SIT GET ANOTHER THAT WE HAVE TO VOTE TO HONOR ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS, LIKE THE LATE, GREAT JOHN LEWIS. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO VOTE , WE JUST HONOR TO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, ALL OF THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO VOTE. WE ALSO FIGHT FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT BLACK WOMEN DID NOT GET TO VOTE UNTIL 1965. WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THIS. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THEN I'M GOING TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO GET OUT THE RAIN. AND PLEASE GET BACK IN YOUR CARS. I WILL TALK LOUDER. HERE'S THE THING. ALL THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO PUT ROADBLOCKS IN, THEY HAVE BEEN PICKING UP THE DROP BOXES SO PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING WHERE THE DROPBOX IS. YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND ASK, WHY ARE THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? HERE IS THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, WE WENT , WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN! THEY KNOW THAT WE VOTE FOR JUSTICE, WE VOTE FOR FAIRNESS. JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. CLIMATE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AT STAKE AND WE KNOW OUR POWER. THAT IS WHY WE WILL VOTE EVERY DAY UNTIL ELECTION DAY AND GET THIS THING DONE. THANK YOU.

MAYOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LAST WEEK. IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE CAME. WE RE-CREATED THE SCHEDULE TO BE WITH YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. NOT JUST A LEADER HERE IN ASHEVILLE, BUT NORTH CAROLINA AND THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] THE CHANCELLOR WHO IS HERE AND WHO GAVE ME SUCH A WONDERFUL AND WARM WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO IN NURTURING AND GROWING THE MINDS OF OUR INCREDIBLE FUTURE AND CURRENT LEADERS. [APPLAUSE] TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA GENERAL ASSEMBLY, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE THE CHIEF OF THE EASTERN , CHEROKEE INDIANS. I WANT TO THANK HIM. I WANT TO THANK COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND CITY COUNCILS, SHERIFF QUINTON MILLER AND ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I AM GOING TO MOVE THIS SO I CAN SEE YOU GUYS. 13 DAYS TO GO. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE, SISTERS AND BROTHERS. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW EVERYONE HERE, AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY IS PREPARED TO DO. AS JOE BIDEN SAYS, FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS ABOUT KNOWING WE DESERVE MORE AND WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE COVID STRUCK. IN MANY WAYS, I THOUGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC OF BEING AN ACCELERATOR. IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE AND HAS MADE IT WORSE. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS VIRUS. WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WERE INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF COVID-19. THEY WERE INFORMED. FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO KILL PEOPLE THAN THE FLU. THEY WERE INFORMED IT COULD HARM CHILDREN. INFORMED IT IS AIRBORNE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE FAMILIES OF ASHEVILLE, THE FAMILIES OF NORTH CAROLINA COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT INFORMATION ON THAT DATE? TO PREPARE? B IT TO STOCK UP ON TOILET PAPER, OR TO PLAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN $1000 IN SAVINGS? WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE KNOWING THAT IT IS PREDICTABLE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK FOR A WHILE. SADLY, WE STILL HAVE SO MANY WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE SICK LEAVE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. HE DID NOT TELL US. THEY SAT ON THAT INFORMATION. THEY COVERED IT UP. INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES STUCK , WHOSE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE SAT ON THIS INFORMATION AND SUGGESTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IF YOU DO. NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE OVER 220,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM HAVE FAMILIES, AND THEY COULD NOT SEE THEM, HOLD THEIR HANDS, TOUCH THEM IN THEIR LAST DAYS ON THIS EARTH. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OVER 8 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS. HAVING UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING WHAT DOCTORS ARE TELLING US HIS LUNG SCARRING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, YOU'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR , IT IS STRANGER THAN FICTION. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT EXPRESSION? WE ARE LIVING IT. WE ARE LIVING IT, SISTER. WHAT ARE WE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC? DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR ARE IN THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE HAPPEN. THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, IT IS ESTIMATED AT LEAST 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR COVERAGE. THERE IS THIS WEIRD THING , A COUPLE , BUT THE THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS GOT THIS WEIRD OBSESSION WITH WANTING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN CREATED. IT IS THIS WEIRD OBSESSION, RIGHT? IF HE IS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, REMEMBER, IT LAID IN PLACE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS DIABETES, ASTHMA, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION CALLED COVID AND THEY ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. THAT ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH THAT HE IS INCAPABLE OF BEING A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PROTECT THE WELL-BEING AND HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY HE HAS GOT TO GO. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION, THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR. OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAD TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. MANY OF WHOM DID NOT HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE, DID NOT HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IN, WHAT I CALL, AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS , BY THE WAY, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION SEASON, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION YEAR, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ELECTION THAT IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE VOTED AND THE ELECTION WILL BE OVER IN 13 DAYS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE WHO WILL BE THERE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHO WILL FILL A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND. [APPLAUSE] YET, THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THIS NOMINATION. I SERVED ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY PUBLICLY, I WILL OPPOSE HER CONFIRMATION. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. IT INCLUDES THE ILLEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS, THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE. THAT INCLUDES THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEY ARE PUSHING THIS THING THROUGH. THERE IS A BILL SITTING ON THE DESK THAT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 150 DAYS CALLED THE HEROES ACT THAT WOULD BRING RELIEF TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING. IN FOOD LINES FOR HOURS. THE ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IN AMERICA WHO IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 AS BEING HUNGRY, WHO NEED AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. SNAP BENEFITS. WE USED TO CALL IT FOOD STAMPS. IT IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE PUSHING THROUGH THIS NOMINATION INSTEAD OF SENATE REPUBLICANS SAYING A VOTE ON THAT BILL. INCLUDING ONE SENATOR FROM THIS STATE. [BOOING] YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO WAS ONE OF THE CREATORS AND REASONS WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO WILL MAKE A COMMITMENT , HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU, NORTH CAROLINA AND THE PUBLIC, THAT HE WILL EXPAND COVERAGE. SHE WILL EXPAND HEALTH. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HE IS SAYING HE WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE, UNDERSTANDING FOR TOO LONG WE ARE PRETENDING HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT A BODY THAT STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN, THE BODY STARTS FROM THE NECK UP, THAT IS METAL HEALTH CARE. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GET RID OF IT. WE HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS, WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY BASED ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% IN THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. JOE BIDEN SAYS I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE FIRST HOME BUYERS GET A TAX CREDIT TO HELP THEM WITH DOWN PAYMENTS AND CLOSING COSTS, KNOWING HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS TO CREATE WEALTH AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH SUPPORTING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF AMERICA AND WE WILL TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN THE HIGHEST NEED COMMUNITIES WITH THE LOWEST TAX BASE BECAUSE THE CHILDREN OF THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A GOD-GIVEN CAPACITY TO BE NURTURED AND THRIVE, BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP WHO PUT BETSY DEVOS IN OFFICE. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS BEEN REJECTING SCIENCE FROM DAY ONE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS CLIMATE CRISIS WHICH IS THREATENING OUR EXISTENCE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS VIRUS. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO EMBRACES SCIENCE WHO WILL BE A LEADER WHO SAYS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS MUST GUIDE THE POLICY DECISIONS WE MAKE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT LITERALLY THREATEN THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE VERY CLEAR CHOICES HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DO BELIEVE THE OUTCOME OF THIS RACE WILL, IN MANY WAYS, BE DECIDED BY YOU. NORTH CAROLINA. IT WILL BE. [APPLAUSE] IN THAT WAY, THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS YOU ARE MAKING WILL IMPACT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN THAT WAY, WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO VOTE, AND VOTE EARLY, IS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAME, BUT WHOSE LIVES WILL FOREVER BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I AM HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA 13 DAYS BEFORE THIS ELECTION TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ALL HAVE ALREADY DONE AND WHAT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO DO. THIS ISSUE BEFORE US OF WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH FIXING THE PROBLEMS, BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH RESTORING , IN OUR COUNTRY, WHAT WE KNOW TO BE OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. UNITY, BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER, REJECTING THESE NOTIONS OF FEAR, HATE AND DIVISION. DOING WHAT WE KNOW WE HAVE HAD THE CAPACITY AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO TO REGAIN OUR STANDING IN A WAY WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR NATION. ALL OF THIS IS AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. JOE AND I ARE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OURS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS PROBABLY BUILT ONE OF THE BROADEST COALITIONS OF ANY CAMPAIGN IN RECENT HISTORY. WE HAVE GOT THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ALL RACES. [APPLAUSE] WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO STRENGTHEN OUR NATION, TO TAKE BACK THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US AND ALL OF US BEING A PART OF WHERE WE GO AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO. I WANT TO THANK YOU, ASHEVILLE FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AND HAVE ANY REGRETS. MY LAST POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT US, THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK IN OUR EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? HERE IS THE THING, WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THIS PARKING LOT IN ASHEVILLE WITH THE MAYOR AND ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED, WE MADE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS HAD STEAK, HOW WE REMINDED PEOPLE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, AND WE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THANK YOU ALL.

ONE TOPIC AMONG MANY FROM LAST NIGHTS DEBATE AND TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION THE CANDIDATES AND WHERE THEY GO FROM HERE WE WILL GO BACK TO JOHN. WHAT'S UP ATLANTA? I'M SO HAPPY TO BE BACK. HEY EVERYBODY. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR RICK HART? WHERE IS HE? WHERE DID HE GO? HE WAS SO GOOD. HE IS SO GOOD. HE IS THE HEAD OF , THERE YOU ARE. RICK IS THE HEAD OF THE GEORGIA STUDENTS FOR BIDEN COCHAIR AND I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND HE SAYS THAT OFTEN, HE UNDERSTANDS HIS LONG LIFE OF SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE BUT HE IS ALWAYS UPLIFTING THOSE WHO ARE THE EMERGING LEADERS AND RICK HART IS ONE OF THEM SO CAN WE GIVE IT UP FOR RICK VICK IS THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY TAKING ON THEIR ROLE IN LEADERSHIP KNOWING THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH JUICE , AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I CAME BACK TO ATLANTA. I LOVE ATLANTA. THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I WAS ON THE STAGE OF MOREHOUSE IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR AND YOU KNOW COMING TO ATLANTA ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE BLACK AND HOLD ELECTED OFFICE AND AMERICA COMING TO ATLANTA IS LIKE COMING BACK TO THE WOMB. IT REALLY IS. IT IS BECAUSE ATLANTA REPRESENTS SO MUCH ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. ATLANTA REPRESENTS THE HOPES AND DREAMS AND THE FIGHT TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. ATLANTA IS A PLACE THAT HAS. LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN NATIONAL LEADERS AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT HOPE WILL FUEL THE FIGHT. IT WILL BE WHAT GROUNDS US IN KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE GOT TO JUST ORGANIZE THE FOLKS AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZE THAT NOTHING WE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED AS A NATION BY WAY OF PROGRESS CAME WITHOUT A FIGHT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE FOR THE NEXT 11 DAYS, GEORGE, A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. WE KNOW THAT AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY WILL ALWAYS BE AS STRONG AS WE THE PEOPLE ARE IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THOSE IDEALS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IN A FIGHT FOR THE IDEALS AND IN THE FIGHT FOR THE DIGNITY, AND A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS AT STAKE. WE ARE DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC AND WE ARE DEALING WITH IT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT AND CRISES THAT ARE OCCURRING AT ONE TIME IN OUR NATION. WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN 200, OVER 220,000 AMERICANS LOSE THEIR LIVES IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY IN THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH COULDN'T EVEN BE WITH THEIR FAMILY, WITH PEOPLE THEY LOVE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 8.5 MILLION FOLKS WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND THANKFULLY HAVE LIVED THAT ARE LOOKING AT UNTOLD LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC WE HAVE A DONALD TRUMP WHO THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD WE KNOW NEW BACK ON JANUARY 28, HE KNEW THE DEAL ABOUT COVID. HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT IT CAN KILL PEOPLE, THAT IT IS FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO KILL AS THE FLU. HE KNEW IT WAS AIRBORNE. HE KNEW IT COULD HARM CHILDREN AND HE SAT ON THAT INFORMATION AND HE DID NOT TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD YOU KNOWN WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28? HOW FOLKS MIGHT HAVE PREPARED, HOW FOLKS MIGHT HAVE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE GOT TO BUY SOME EXTRA TOILET PAPER AT THE VERY LEAST BUT ALSO THE FACT IS THAT EVEN IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA DURING THE PANDEMIC FOLKS WERE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO TRY TO PAY THE BILLS AND PAY THE RENT SO IN OUR AMERICA NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND HE SAID ON THIS INFORMATION AND THEN HAVE THE GALL, HAD THE NERVE TO SAY IT WAS A HOAX TO MUZZLE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS TO SUGGEST THAT HEAT KEEPS THE LEDGER AND YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WORE A MASK AND YOU ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK AND NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE. NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE. AND HE IS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WITH HIS TOY BILL BARR TRYING TO SUE GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET'S STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS MAN BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE WHEN HE QUESTIONED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SO WEIRDLY OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA CREATED. THINK ABOUT THAT. WE DON'T NEED PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE SESSIONS. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? SO HE IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH BROUGHT HEALTH COVERAGE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS, COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, LUPUS? AND HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE THING THAT BROUGHT KAREN DIGNITY TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS DONALD TRUMP HAS GOT TO GO. GOT TO GO. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE CRISES, THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ARE LOOKING AT FAMILIES THAT ARE GETTING UP AT THE OF DAWN TO DRIVE AND SIT IN THEIR CAR IN A FOOD LINE FOR HOURS PRAYING THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE END OF THE LINE BEFORE THE FOOD RUNS OUT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IN AMERICA ARE DESCRIBING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS HUNGRY. WE ARE IN A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA AND AGAIN ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS LET ME TELL YOU HOW I MEASURE THE ECONOMY AND HOW WELL IT IS DOING. I MEASURE THE GREATNESS OF THE ECONOMY BASED ON HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW WERE WORKING PEOPLE DOING WHEN WORKING PEOPLE AND WORKING FAMILIES ARE DOING WELL IN THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WHICH IS WHY JOE BIDEN AND I ARE SAYING TAXES WILL NOT BE RAISED ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $40,000 YEAR. WE ARE SAYING THAT WE KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS THAT WE ACHIEVE ACCESS TO ECONOMIC HEALTH AND INTERGENERATIONAL PROSPERITY IS HOMEOWNERSHIP SO WE WILL HAVE A 15,000-DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS TO HELP YOU WITH DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COST TO BUY A HOME. WE UNDERSTAND WORKING FAMILIES NEED CHILDCARE BUT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. THAT IS OUR MESSAGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WHEN WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING WELL. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO MEASURES HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING BASED ON THE STOCK MARKET, WHO MEASURES HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING BASED ON HOW RICH PEOPLE ARE DOING, WHO IS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS IS TO PASS A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. I WILL TELL YOU JOE BIDEN AND I WILL MAKE IT ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES TO GET RID OF THAT TAX BILL AND DO WHAT WE KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE, TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND AN ECONOMIC HEALTH CRISIS BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION. A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE COURAGE TO USE THE TERM AND SPEAK THOSE WORDS BLACK LIVES MATTER. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO REFUSES AND WILL NEVER SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THEN HAS THE GALL TO STAND ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN THE LAST DEBATE IN FRONT OF 70 MILLION AMERICANS AND WOULD NOT CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACIST. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME, THEY SAY WELL SENATOR HARRIS AND BY THE WAY CENTER , SENATOR IS NOT ALL MIGHT BIRTH CERTIFICATES, LOVE. THEY SAY ARE YOU SAYING YOU THINK HE'S A RACIST? YES. YES. BECAUSE YOU SEE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S SOME RANDOM ONE-OFF. WE HAVE SEEN THAT PATTERN GOING BACK AND QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF ROCCO PALMA AND GOING BACK TO CHARLOTTESVILLE WHEN PEOPLE WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA WHERE A WOMAN WAS KILLED AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KNEE ON WEARING SWASTIKAS CARRYING TIKI TORCHES AND THROWING OUT ANTI-SEMITIC AND RACIST SLURS AND DONALD TRUMP SAYS THEY ARE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO REFERS TO MEXICANS AS RAPIST AND CRIMINALS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO MADE IT ONE OF HIS FIRST POLICY INITIATIVES AT BAM ON MUSLIMS ENTERING OUR COUNTRY. AND THEN STOOD ON THAT STAGE AND WOULD NOT CONDEMN NONE WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID WELL THEY SHOULD STAND BACK AND STAND BY. THIS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF WHO WE BELIEVE WE ARE AS A NATION. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO ACKNOWLEDGED AS SYSTEMIC RACISM, WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IS THE HISTORY OF AMERICA AND USES THAT HOLY PULPIT AND THAT MICROPHONE IN A WAY THAT SPEAKS WITH AN INTENTION TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES AND BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMICS, A GRAPPLING IN THE NEED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA BUT I WAS WORN IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW. THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN BURNING BECAUSE OF THOSE WILDFIRES. CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON THE GULF STATES HAVE BEEN BATTERED. PEOPLE IN THE MIDWEST FARMERS LOSING CROPS BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO EMBRACE SCIENCE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HURTING PEOPLE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IN A WAY WE. JOBS BY INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTING IN BUILDING RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT'S ABOUT JOBS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEM FOR MENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES. HE KNOWS THAT OF ALL OF THE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN AMERICA WITH POOR AIR QUALITY, 70% OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. JOE BIDEN KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN FLINT. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO SCIENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO RECENTLY WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REPORT WAS SOMETIMES WE SAY IN THESE FIRES WAS HAPPENING AND THE SCIENTISTS SAY THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DRASTIC CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE IN THESE WILDFIRES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN RESPONSE? HE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT? SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHAT WE SEE IS THE LINE ON THAT ISSUE IN THE FIRST ISSUE, AN INABILITY TO EMBRACE THE FACT, AN INABILITY TO EMBRACE EXPERTS IN INABILITY TO EMBRACE INTELLIGENCE, AN INABILITY TO BE COMPETENT, AN INABILITY TO DO THE JOB OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES WHOSE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. YOU ALL KNOW IN ATLANTA HELPS ME WHEN I RAN FOR SENATE AND I AM NOW THE ONLY BLACK WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, ONLY THE SECOND IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I'VE BEEN THERE NOW FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. THE SENATE IS SO IMPORTANT ON ALL THESE ISSUES. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE. THAT SENATORS THAT WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT ADVISE AND CONSENT ON WHO SITS ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. ONE OF THE REASONS I BECAME A LAWYER IS BECAUSE I WAS INSPIRED BY THURGOOD MARSHALL AND CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, RIGHT? THEY ARE THE ONES WHO FOUGHT FOR BROWN ECO-BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO FOUGHT FOR SILVA WRITES AND WHO SITS ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES SOMEONE IN THE SENATE WITH ADVISE AND CONSENT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER HE GOES THROUGH. RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING THAT BATTLE IN FULL WITH THIS ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN TO TRY TO FILL THE SEAT OF THE GREAT RUTH BADER GINSBURG WHILE PEOPLE ARE IN AN ELECTION AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY LET US DECIDE WHO WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT AND LET THAT PERSON DECIDE WHO FILLS THAT SEAT. THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS WHERE THERE WILL BE A DECISION ON WHETHER WE PUT ON THE FLOOR AT DELL THAT MY BROTHER CORY BOOKER FROM NEW JERSEY AND I WROTE CALLED THE JUSTICE AND POLICING ACT. A BILL THAT SAYS LIKE JOE BIDEN AND I SAY WE SHOULD BAN CHOKEHOLD AND CAROTID HOLDS BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I WERE THE CASE IN THE BILL THAT SAYS LET'S HAVE A NATIONAL REGISTRY FOR PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE CAN'T HAVE FOLKS GET FIRED ONE PLACE AND NOT GET HIRED SOMEPLACE ELSE. WE NEED TO HAVE A NATIONAL STANDARD FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT IN SOME PLACES WHEN THEIR SUCCESSIVE USE OF FORCE THE QUESTION ASKED IS WAS A REASONABLE WHEN WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN REASON AWAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. THE MORE FAIR AND JUST QUESTION TO ASK IS WHAT IS NECESSARY? WE NEED TO CHANGE THE STANDARD. THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS IF THEY GET MADE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE WILL MAKE THEM IT ALSO GETS MADE IN THE SENATE. THAT RINGS ME TO GROW WOOL WARNOCK AND JOHN OCTET. YOU'VE GOT TO SEND THEM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SEND THEM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND LET THEM REPRESENT GEORGIA ON ALL THESE ISSUES. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW THOSE SENATE SEATS, THOSE ARE SIX-YEAR TERMS. THINK ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR YOUR LIFE AND FOR YOUR CHILDREN'S LIVES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SIX YEARS. THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN GET DONE EITHER FOR GOOD OR FOR KNOTS. THE SENATE IS SO IMPORTANT SO I'M HERE ATLANTA, GEORGIA TO ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I KNOW YOU ARE READY KNOW HOW TO DO SO WELL WHICH IS TO ORGANIZE, WHICH IS TO TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AND TO REMIND PEOPLE ON THE ISSUE OF VOTING THAT WE HAVE GOT SO MANY REASONS. ONE HAS TO DO WITH AGAIN ATLANTA. IT HAS TO DO WITH JOHN LEWIS. IT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHED BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. SO VOTING IS ABOUT HONORING THOSE ANCESTORS, HONORING WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR AND WHAT THEY SACRIFICED FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. VOTING, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE. EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED, EVERYTHING THAT AFFECTS OUR LIVES AND VOTING ALSO IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. BECAUSE HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT THAT. I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF A LOT OF TIME ALL OVER I'VE BEEN IN FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND I WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA THIS WEEKEND I WILL BE IN OHIO TOMORROW BUT THINK ABOUT IT FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. EVER SINCE AND EVEN BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN 2013 AT WHOLE LOT OF REALLY POWERFUL PEOPLE INCLUDING IN THIS STATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNOR STACY. A WHOLE LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SUPPRESS OUR VOTE, HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PURGE THE VOTER ROLLS, HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT THE PROCESS, TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT. YOU CAN FILL OUT YOUR BALLOT IN PUT IT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND THEN YOU NEED TO PUT IT IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT SIGNED, TRYING TO CONFUSE US AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE POST OFFICE? LIKE THE POST MAN IN THE POST-WOMAN? THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. WE HAVE TO DO SOME POINTS IT BACK AND THINK WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? I THINK THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE WE WIN. SO I'M HERE TO SAY ATLANTA LETS NOT LET ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. WE KNOW THE POWER OF OUR BOYS. WE KNOW AT ELECTION TIME THE POWER OF OUR BOYS IS EXPRESSING OUR VOTE AND WE ARE GOING TO LET ANYBODY TAKE US OUT. WE ARE PRESENT, WE ARE POWERFUL, WE ARE ACTIVE AND WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE AND WE HONOR OUR ANCESTORS EVERY DAY. SO MY LAST POINT IS THIS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT TIME AND THE THING WE ARE OWING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM THERE WAS THIS ONE PARTICULAR AFTERNOON WE WERE HANGING OUT AT MOREHOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT. WE WILL TELL THEM WE ORGANIZED AND WE TALKED TO HER NEIGHBORS AND THEIR FRIENDS AND HER RELATIVES. WE WILL TELL THEM WE HELPED PEOPLE GET TO THE POLLS. WE WILL TELL THEM WE MADE SURE EVERYONE WE KNOW GOT TO THEIR COUNTY OFFICE TO VOTE. WE'LL TELL THAN WE STOOD UP AND WE FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE FOUGHT FOR THE IDEA BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WE KNOW OUR POWER. THANK YOU ATLANTA. .. [BACKGROUND SOUNDS].

STREAM OR ON AT C-SPAN.ORG OR LISTEN ON THE C-SPAN RADIO APP. YOUR PLACE FOR AN UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, ROBIN, FOR HOSTING ME TODAY, AND FOR THE WARM WELCOME. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A DEAR, DEAR FRIEND. AND SOMEBODY WHO IS A NATIONAL LEADER. WE ARE ALL THINKING OF HER THIS MORNING. THANK YOU ALL. AND EVERYBODY FROM YOUR CAR, YOUR HOME, WE ARE ALL TOGETHER. STANDING SIX FEET APART AND WEARING A MASK. LET'S ALWAYS REMEMBER, LET'S ALWAYS REMEMBER WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AND WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN AND WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WESO, I KNOW THIS IS NOT HOW WE USUALLY DO CHURCH, BUT IT IS A REMINDER, PASTOR, THAT FAITH ALWAYS FINDS ITS WAY, AND WE NEED TO ALWAYS FEEL THE GRACE OF GOD AND TO BE IN CHURCH, EVEN IF IT IS IN OUR CAR OR AT HOME. SO THAT IS WHAT WE DO. AND DON'T WE ALL ESPECIALLY NEED CHURCH RIGHT NOW? THE FEELING OF TOGETHERNESS THAT COMES FROM BEING A PART OF A COMMUNITY, A PLACE WHERE WE CAN EXPRESS OUR FIDELITY TO ONE ANOTHER AND OUR SERVICE TO ALL GOD'S CHILDREN. FOR ME, CHURCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND A PLACE FOR REFLECTION, A PLACE TO STUDY THE TEACHINGS OF OUR LORD AND A PLACE TO FEEL GROUNDED IN A WORLD THAT FEELS INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. AND, NEEDLESS TO SAY, HERE IN 2020, THE WORLD IS PLENTY COMPLEX, FROM THE PANDEMIC, TO THE RECESSION, TO HISTORIC WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. OF COURSE, THE LONG-OVERDUE RECOGNITION , RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. AND THINGS CERTAINLY ARE NOT EASY.RIGHT NOW SO MANY OF US ARE CARRYING BURDENS THAT ARE SEEN AND UNSEEN BY OTHERS. SO MANY OF US ARE SPENDING TIME IN REFLECTION AND PRAYER THESE DAYS. AND IN MY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD, I USUALLY ASK FOR STRENGTH AND PROTECTION AND GUIDANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND THIS IS A TIME, INDEED, TO DRAW ON THE VALUES OF OUR FAITH , LOVINGKINDNESS, HONESTY, AND TRUTH, NOT ONLY AS INDIVIDUALS BUT AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A COUNTRY. WHEN HE STILL WAS A DOCTORAL STUDENT AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING TOLD A GROUP OF PARISHIONERS \"THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT, THROUGH OUR SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, WE HAVE MADE THE WORLD A NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT, THROUGH OUR MORAL AND SPIRITUAL GENIUS, WE HAVE FAILED TO MAKE IT A BROTHERHOOD.\" SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT. WITH ALL THE CALLOUSNESS AND CRUELTY WE HAVE RECENTLY SEEN AROUND US, WOULD ANYONE DENY THAT DR. KING'S WORDS RING TRUE TODAY? WHEN BABIES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHERS, WHEN WE DESECRATE THE PLANET THAT GOD HAS ENTRUSTED TO US, WHEN, IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, WE ALLOW MILLIONS OF CHILDREN TO GO HUNGRY. WHEN WE FEAR FOR THE LIVES OF OUR BLACK BABIES AS THEY GROW SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. WE ARE ALL IN A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, AND ESPECIALLY EVERY COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK WHAT THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND A LAST FEW YEARS HAVE TAUGHT US IS THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HEED THE TEACHINGS OF DR. KING. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING OUR WORLD A BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD, THEN OUR FAITH CANNOT REMAIN JUST A MATTER OF PERSONAL SUSTENANCE. IT CANNOT BE ONLY ABOUT OUR PERSONAL NEEDS. OUR FAITH MUST PRESENT A CHALLENGE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE LIVE AMONG ENTRY OTHERS. OUR FAITH, AND I WAS RAISED THIS WAY, MUST BE A VERB. WE MUST LIVE IT IN OUR ACTIONS. GOD IS NOT GOING TO PUT IT IN YOUR LAP. SO THAT IS THE KIND OF FAITH I WAS TAUGHT EARLY ON, PASTOR, AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER SITTING WITH MY SISTER MAIA AND OUR , IN OUR SUNDAY BEST AND PRAISING THE WORD AND OUR LORD, BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE LEFT CHURCH WE WERE EXPECTED TO LIVE AND PUT IN ACTION THE TEACHINGS. AND MY EARLIEST MEMORIES OF THE BIBLE'S TEACHING WERE OF A LOVING GOD, I GOT WHO ASKS US TO STAND UP AND SERVE FOR OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED , THE LEAST OF THESE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOMS OF POWER, BUT BELONG IN THOSE ROOMS. OUR LOVING GOD WANTS US TO SPEAK UP FOR THE VOICELESS, CARE FOR THE NEEDY, AND SEEK JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED. HE ASKS US TO SEE EACH OTHER AS HE SEES US. IN FACT, IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES, WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE GREETING IS NOT PLEASED TO MEET YOU. THE GREETING IS ICU. ICU. , I SEE YOU. I DO BELIEVE GOD WANTS FOR US TO SEE EACH OTHER AND AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE OUR FAITH. AND EVEN IN THIS MOMENT OF TRIAL AND TESTING, AS I LOOK OUT AT THIS CONGREGATION, I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE RISING TO THIS MOMENT. I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE FILLED WITH STRENGTH AND WITH PURPOSE , HEALTH CARE WORKERS, TEACHERS. PEOPLE WHO KNOW IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS REAL LEADERS STEP UP AND FIGURE OUT THEIR PLACE TO SUPPORT AND TO HELP OTHERS. WE MUST LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR NEIGHBORS , UNDERSTANDING, THEN, , AND UNDERSTANDING, THEN, THAT IF WE ARE TO LIVE GOD'S PURPOSE FOR US, WE MUST SEE THAT PERSON ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND IN THEIR FACE, SEE A NEIGHBOR. SO, LET US REJOICE IN THE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS WHO, LIVING THAT WORD, SWARMED TO AIRPORTS TO PROTEST THE BAN AGAINST OUR MUSLIM BROTHERS AND SISTERS. LET US CELEBRATE WITH PEOPLE OF ALL RACES WHO TOOK TO THE STREETS TO SAY, YES, BLACK LIVES MATTER. IF PEOPLE, WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS WHEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE AND OBAMACARE AND HAVE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY SAYING, SEE MY CHILD AND UNDERSTAND TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR IS TO LOVE MY CHILD AND UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHT TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THIS IS HOW PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP AND SPEAKING OUT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. AND SO, YES, AS DR. KING SAID, OUR MORAL GENIUS MAY BE LAGGING BEHIND OUR SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, NDS, WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BUILD THAT BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD, TO BUILD THAT COMMUNITY, AND YET WE WILL GET THERE. WE ARE GETTING THERE. AND WE WILL GET THERE. SO LONG AS WE KEEP WORKING AND FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS WE HOLD DEAR, BORN OUT OF OUR FAITH, SO LONG AS WE KEEP REJECTING THE FORCES THAT WOULD DIVIDE US, AND SO LONG AS WE KEEP DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY, AND DRAWING CLOSER TOGETHER, EVEN FROM A DISTANCE. AND SO LONG AS WE KEEP HOLDING ON TO OUR FAITH. SO THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR WELCOMING ME TODAY. PASTOR, THANK YOU, AND THE FIRST FAMILY, FOR ALL THE LOVE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AND THIS COMMUNITY, AND THANK YOU , EVERYONE, FOR YOUR PRAYERS. I FEEL THEM EVERY DAY. GOD BLESS.

Senator Harris talked about the struggles of Americans through the coronavirus pandemic, and said she believes the U.S. could emerge from the situation stronger with the right leadership. Her visit to the church was part of a four-stop swing through the Detroit-area with just more than a week left before Election Day. She and her 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were seeking to shore up support at the polls from voters in Michigan, which supported President Trump in the 2016 election by a margin of just more than 10,000 votes.","Source":"477350-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

THANK YOU ALL FOR THE TIME AND ENERGY AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND PEOPLE SAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION? I SAID LOOK, HERE IS WHAT I TRULY BELIEVE. WE HAVE TAKEN A BATTERING. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, OVER THESE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. OUR DEMOCRACY , THE , THE SHINGLES HAVE FALLEN OUT A BIT. THE HOUSE IS STILL STANDING. I DO BELIEVE OUR DEMOCRACY WILL ALWAYS BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS AND PREPAREDNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. [APPLAUSE] AND FIGHT WE WILL BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT I AM LOOKING AT. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF FOLKS OVER THERE , BECAUSE WE HAD TO SOCIALLY DISTANT, WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER THERE TOO. I HAVE BEEN GOING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THESE LAST 10 DAYS OR SO, VISITING WITH FOLKS EARLY VOTING IN HERE IN NEVADA, UNTIL FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30. LET'S MAKE SURE EVERYONE VOTES AND VOTE EARLY. GET IT DONE AND GET IT IN. PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINE AND THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY. IT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY AND WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR IT. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. AND LOOK, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AT LEAST FOUR CRAZIES THAT ARE HAPPENING ALL AT THIS E-FOUR CRISES , FOUR CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. A PANDEMIC HAS CREATED MASS CASUALTY WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 225,000 AMERICANS WHO JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE DIED. MANY OF WHOM WERE WITHOUT A LOVED ONE NEXT TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS. MANY OF WHOM , THE FAMILY WAS HOPING AT LEAST THEY COULD FACE TIME OR SEE EACH OTHER VIRTUALLY FOR THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH. PEOPLE ARE MOURNING. OVER 8.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS WITH UNKNOWN LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. THE THING IS IS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW NEW BACK , WE KNOW KNEW BACK ON JANUARY 28 IT IS LEGAL, 5 , IT IS LETHAL, FIVE TIMES AS DEADLY AS THE FLU, THAT IT CAN HARM YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT IT IS AIRBORNE AND THEY SAT ON THE INFORMATION AND HAD THE GA,L, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAT ON THAT INFORMATION AND CALLED IT A HOAX. CAN YOU GUYS IMAGINE IF YOU HAD KNOWN , IF PARENTS HAD KNOWN, IF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAD KNOWN, IF TEACHERS HAD KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT JANUARY 28 , WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN. LET'S NOT FORGET BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, FOLKS WERE HURTING. EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS WERE HURTING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PAY. THE BILLS IN THE AMERICA JOE BIDEN AND I BELIEVE IN, PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE WERE HURTING ALREADY. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY WAS STRUGGLING TO HAVE MAYBE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? NOT TO MENTION BUY TOILET PAPER? RIGHT? AND THEY SAT ON THIS INFORMATION. AND NOW, IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BOY, BILL BARR, OR IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT , ARE IN THE UNITED STATE SUPREME COURT. I VOTED NO ON THAT CONFIRMATION BY THE WAY. THEY ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW SUING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS, THAT SAID PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT BE DENIED ACCESS TO COVERAGE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, CANCER, LUPUS. DO YOU KNOW OVER ONE MILLION NEVADANS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? THEY ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND IT JUST , IT IS A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO THIS PERSON IS. THIS PRESIDENT WHO IN THE MIDST OF THE KIND OF SUFFERING WE ARE SEEING HAS , IS CONTINUING WITH THIS VERY WEIRD OBSESSION HE HAS HAD SINCE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT TO UNDO WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA CREATED. IT IS A WEIRD OBSESSION BY THE WAY. WE DO NOT NEED A PRESIDENT WITH WEIRD OBSESSIONS. LET'S MOVE BEYOND THAT THING TOO. RIGHT? WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHERE OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IN NEVADA, ONE IN SEVEN FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. I SAW NUMBERS THAT ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IS DESCRIBING THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS BEING HUNGRY. IN NEVADA, WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS WERE FINDING IT DIFFICULT , THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY RENT. IN NEVADA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESSES AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE, ALMOST HALF OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE RUNS OR WORKS FOR A SMALL BUSINESS. . THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION IS PROFOUND. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP , EVEN IN THE LAST DEBATE HE IS TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER. WHAT IS HE SAYING? ROUNDING THE CORNER WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE AGAIN AND A CLEAR DIFFERENCE ON ALL THESE ISSUES. ON PUBLIC HEALTH, JOE BIDEN IS SAYING LET'S EXPAND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BARACK OBAMA AND I BROUGHT INTO BEING. LET'S BRING DOWN MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO AGE 60. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS AND JOB PRICES. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP, MENTAL HEALTH CARE. LET'S EXTEND THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ON THE ECONOMY, JOE BIDEN SAYS, YOU WANT TO ASK ME ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, TELL ME HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. JOE BIDEN SAYS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. AND YES, WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, WE ALSO KNOW THAT IS THE MINIMUM AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF INNOVATION AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTING IN GOOD UNION PAYING JOBS TO BUILD UP A MIDDLE-CLASS IN AMERICA. , BUILD UP THE MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA. THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO WHEN ASKED HOW IS THE ECONOMY DOING, HE ASKED HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? HOW ARE WHICH PEOPLE DOING? HE PASSES AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. JOE BIDEN AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND INVEST IN THAT MONEY IN WORKING PEOPLE IN AMERICA. PUT THAT MONEY INTO BUILDING UP OUR SKILLS, PUT THAT MONEY INTO SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN REOPEN AND REHIRE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A LONG, OVERDUE RECKONING ON THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO KNOWS AND HAS LEARNED AND STUDIED AMERICA'S HISTORY AND HAS THEREFORE THE COURAGE TO SAY, BLACK LIVES MATTER. [APPLAUSE] A TERM DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER USE. WILL NEVER USE. JOE BIDEN SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS IN LET US DEAL WITH THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP, WHERE WE KNOW BLACK FAMILIES OWN 1\/10 OF THE WEALTH OF OTHER FAMILIES. LET'S DO WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, UNDERSTANDING BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE OR FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDCARE THAN OTHER WOMEN. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE ARE GOING TO REFORM THESE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND IN SO DOING WE WILL DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE RECORDS OF PEOPLE CONVICTED OF MARIJUANA OFFENSES. WE WILL SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS BECAUSE THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS HUMAN BEINGS MAKING MONEY OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO REFORM POLICING TO ACQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW. AT FOR THAT REASON, WE WILL BAN CAROTID HOLD'S AND CHOKEHOLDS, BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY, AND WE WILL REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND CREATING A NATIONAL SYSTEM AROUND TRACKING THOSE WHO WROTE THE LAW SO THEY WON'T GET FIRED IN ONE PLACE, AND HIRED IN ANOTHER. [APPLAUSE] ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, REMEMBER, AT THE LAST DEBATE, FOR THIS MOST RECENT ONE, REFUSED TO CONDEMN THE WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP, AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID, STAND BACK AND STAND BY. THAT ON THE HEELS OF WAY BACK WHEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A PATTERN , ON THE ISSUE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE AMERICANS WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED AT THAT . AND ON THE OTHERS, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, AND HE HAD CALLED SAY FIND PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, TO CALL MEXICANS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS, HAD ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS A MUSLIM BAND. AND YOU SEE THIS ON THIS LIST IS VERY CLEAR CONTRAST, ANOTHER OF THOSE ISSUES BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT IS OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR A JOE BIDEN THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, GENDER, AGE, OR THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US, AND IT IS TIME TO END A SUPPOSEDLY TO WHO IS SPENDING FULL TIME TRYING TO SEW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. WE WANT A UNIFIER. THAT IS WHY WE WANT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE LIST OF CRISES, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL RENO, THE CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU GUYS KNOW IT, YOU GUYS ARE LIVING IT. WE ARE SEEING WILDFIRES THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST. I HAVE VISITED MANY OF THEM. I HAVE VISITED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD TO BE EVACUATED. I HAVE VISITED WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. WE SEE IT IN THE GULF COAST STATES, STORMS THAT ARE BATTERING WHOLE COMMUNITIES, IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED THE FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. AND JOE BIDEN SAYS, WE HAVE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO SCIENCE, AND DO IT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, AND PUT TIMELINES IN PLACE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON THIS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND JOE SAYS, I ALSO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MOMENT TO SAVE OUR PLANET, WHICH ALSO WILL ALLOW US, IF WE ARE SERIOUS, TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, RENEWABLE ENERGY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SAVE OUR PLANET, SAVE WATER, SAVE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. JOE SEES THIS IS ABOUT LETTING UP THE ECONOMY AND JOBS AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. HE GETS ASKED BY SOME JOURNALIST ABOUT THE WILDFIRES, AND THE JOURNALIST ASKS SOMETHING LIKE, THE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE CAUSING THIS TO HAPPEN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPONDS TO THE QUESTION BY SAYING SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS. [LAUGHTER] SCIENCE KNOWS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE KNOW. AND WE KNOW IT IS TIME TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AND STOP PLAYING INTO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS YOU HAVE BEEN COURTING SINCE YOU CAME INTO OFFICE. SO THESE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW, AND THERE ARE CLEAR CHOICES. THERE ARE CLEAR CHOICES, AND WE HAVE IN OUR POWER THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE COURSE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER. THIS BRINGS ME TO NEVADA, AND WHY I WILL KEEP COMING BACK. YOU GUYS KNOW. IT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE. NEVADA IS GOING TO HELP DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE. YOU ARE. AND IN THAT WAY, YOUR VOTE IS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET, PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAME. BUT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE SO POWERFUL IN YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT, YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND ONE THING THAT HAS BECOME CLEAR IS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY, IS MY VOTE GOING TO MATTER, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? THERE ARE THREE REASONS. ONE IS TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] THIS YEAR WE LOST THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT OF BLACK AMERICANS TO VOTE. HE SHED HIS BLOOD. THE OTHER THING ABOUT JOHN LE WS, , JOHN LEWIS TO SHOW UP AND SAY, MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS A CORE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SAY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IMMIGRATION AND CREATE A PATHWAY AND STOP DEMONIZING IMMIGRANTS IN AMERICA. JOHN LEWIS, HE AND SO MANY OTHERS SHED THAT BLOOD. WE SHOULD HONOR THAT SACRIFICE. THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATE IT, THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE BADASS SUFFRAGETTES. THERE ARE CHILDREN HERE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S OK, THE MOMS SAID IT WAS OK. ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO MARCHED, WHO COULDN'T HEAR NO, WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. AND WE MUST BE TRUE TO HISTORY AND THE FACTS, THAT BLACK WOMEN WERE NOT ABLE TO VOTE UNTIL 1965. SO LET'S REMEMBER THAT, BUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS IS AN IMPORTANT REASON TO VOTE. TWO, EVERYTHING THAT IS AT STAKE. WE WENT THROUGH THE LIST, AND THERE IS SO MUCH MORE. SOME SAY THAT I VOTED AGAINST HER, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN , I VOTED AGAINST HER, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING. WE ARE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT ELECTION SEASON OR ELECTION YEAR. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VOT , HAVE VOTED. I THINK THE LAST NUMBER I SAW WAS 50 MILLION PEOPLE HAD VOTED WHEN THE CONFIRMATION WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING, LET US CHOOSE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND LET THAT PERSON CHOOSE WHO WILL FILL A LIFETIME SEAT ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND, THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY THE GREAT RUTH BADER GINSBURG. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. RUTH BADER GINSBURG, WE ALWAYS SHOULD SPEAK HER NAME. WHAT SHE DID, I THINK THERE WAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER SIZE AND HER FORCE. WHAT SHE DID FOR EQUALITY AND WOMEN. AND NOW, THERE IS SOMEONE ON THE COURT WHO MANY OF US OPPOSED ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE HAS A TRACK RECORD THAT IT MAKES IT CLEAR SHE WAS TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. KEEP IN MIND, IN SO DOING, IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AMONG THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT, OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BEING PROTECTED. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WILL BE AT STAKE? FREE BIRTH CONTROL. FREE MAMMOGRAMS. FREE CANCER SCREENINGS. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF THAT IS AT STAKE, NOT TO MENTION A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. SO WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS. WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AT HERE IS THE THIRD REASON IT 'S IMPORTANCE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF , AND HERE'S THE THIRD REASON IS T IS IMPORTANT TO VOTE. THE SUPREME COURT TOOK OUT THE TEETH OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND ALL MUST IMMEDIATELY AFTER, TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN LAWS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, PEOPLE OF COLOR AND STUDENTS. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA REVIEWED WHAT THEY DID, THEY SAID THE STATE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED THE LAW WITH SURGICAL PROVISION , SURGICAL PRECISION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BLACK VOTERS IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA TO VOTE. MY POINT IS THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASK A QUESTION, WHICH IS, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT VOTING? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT WE CAN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM? WHY ARE THEY MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE? THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE. AND ONE MUST ASK, WHY ARE THEY GOING THROUGH SUCH AN EFFORT? HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. [APPLAUSE] THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. IT IS OUR POWER TO STAND IN THOSE LINES AS LONG AS NECESSARY. WE WILL BRING OUR FRIENDS WITH US AND HAVE A GOOD OLD TIME. BUT WE KNOW OUR POWER, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO EXERCISE THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THAT COMES WITH ELECTION TIME, THROUGH OUR VOTE. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE, AND WE KNOW THE SHOULDERS WE STAND UPON, THAT CAME GENERATIONS BEFORE US, THAT WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS. [APPLAUSE] MY LAST POINT IS THIS. YEARS FROM NOW, BECAUSE THIS MOMENT WILL HAVE PASSED, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK AT US, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM THAT WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY AT THE AMPHITHEATER IN RENO WITH KAMALA AND ALL OUR FRIENDS, WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM WE TEXTED AND CALLED AND EMAILED EVERYONE WE KNEW, REPEATEDLY UNTIL THEY GOT SICK OF US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD COME BACK TO US EVENTUALLY, BUT WE DID WHATEVER WAS NECESSARY TO REMIND PEOPLE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE, TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR POWER, AND TO REMIND THEM THAT OURS IS A COUNTRY WE ARE FIGHTING FOR BECAUSE WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, RENO, AND THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE EVERYTHING YOU DO. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN ARIZONA. YOU GUYS MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU GUYS WILL ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. YOU WILL DO THAT. [HORNS HONKING] I WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR HOSTING THIS. THE STUDENTS, THE CONGRESSMAN, THERE YOU ARE. CONGRESSWOMAN ANN KIRKPATRICK. GABBY GIFFORD AND MARK KELLY. [HORNS HONKING] LET'S GET THIS DONE. HERE'S THE THING. FIRST OF ALL, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LATE GREAT JOHN MCCAIN, I WAS THINKING LET'S START WITH SOME STRAIGHT TALK. THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT MY VALUES. LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I AM A PROUD PATRIOTIC AMERICAN. I LOVE MY COUNTRY. [HORNS HONKING] OUR VALUES REFLECT THE VALUES OF AMERICA. OUR VALUES TELL US WE HAVE WITNESSED THE WORST, THE BIGGEST DISASTER OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. OUR VALUES TELL US THAT. OUR VALUES TELL US THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A MOMENT WHERE OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN OUR COUNTRY. OVER 8.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED A VIRUS. WHEN WE GOT THE INFORMATION, WE HAVE KNOWN HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT A FEW OF THE THINGS WE KNOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR CRISES HAPPENING AT ONCE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC THAT LIKE I SAID, HAS CAUSED OVER 225,000 AMERICANS TO DIE. MANY OF WHOM DIED WITHOUT ANY FAMILY MEMBERS BEING ABLE TO BE WITH THEM TO HOLD HER HAND, TO LOOK IN THEIR EYES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE VIRUS. OVER 8.5 MILLION AMERICANS WHO NOW HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE OF VIRUS. THE TRAGEDY OF IT IS THIS. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. IT LITERALLY DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THANKS TO A FELLOW BY THEM , NAME OF BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PANDEMIC. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL KILL PEOPLE. HE WAS TOLD IT IS FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL HURT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT WAS AIRBORNE. AND HE SAT ON THE INFORMATION. HE DID NOT TELL YOU. CAN YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, AS A WORKING PERSON IF ON JANUARY 28, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO? TO PLAN? TO PREPARE? KNOWING THAT EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, SO MANY AMERICANS WERE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE? KNOWING THAT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, MOST AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE MORE THAN $1000 LIFE SAVINGS? WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO PREPARE? WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE TO PREPARE YOUR CHILDREN FOR THE FACT THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL TOO BACK-TO-SCHOOL? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IF YOU RUN A SMALL BUSINESS? TO PUT IN PLACE PROVISIONS FOR THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF BUSINESS FOR MONTHS? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO BUY SOME EXTRA TOILET PAPER? [HORNS HONKING] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LIED TO BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO HAS AS HIS HIGHEST RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ON THAT COUNT, DONALD TRUMP FAILED. HE FAILED US. [HORNS HONKING] HE FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HERE'S THE THING. YOU KNOW THIS. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION ON THIS MATTER. YOU SEE, ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. WHO IS SAYING THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE OF THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD. JOE BIDEN WHO TOGETHER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE. WHO SAID WE PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HONK IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WITH DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH BREAST CANCER. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] JOE SAID WE WILL PROTECT YOU AND THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. JOE SAYS IF WE WIN, WE'RE GOING TO GET IN THERE AND EXPAND COVERAGE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING DOWN ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE TO AGE 60. WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PREMIUMS. JOE SAYS WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE BODY DOESN'T JUST START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. THE CHOICE BEFORE US IN SIX DAYS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO TOGETHER WITH HIS BOY BILL BARR ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOW SUING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IF THEY HAVE THEIR WAY, OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE COVERAGE AND THE BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE OVER. LET'S UNDERSTAND, PART OF WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID IS IT SAID FOR WOMEN, FREE MAMMOGRAMS FOR ALL PEOPLE, FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR CANCER. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THAT. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. NOT TO MENTION WHAT THEY DID TO RAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BECAUSE OF THEIR AGENDA TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I VOTED NO. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] IT WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING THE SAME THING. FROM THE TIME DONALD TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE THROUGH THE TIME HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE, HE HAS HAD THIS WEIRD OBSESSION WITH TRYING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN CREATED. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? WE DON'T NEED PRESIDENTS WITH WEIRD OBSESSIONS. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO END. DO YOU AGREE? [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IS BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN 10 HOUSEHOLDS ARE DESCRIBING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE COVERING THAT ENOUGH. I SEE NUMBERS ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS BEING HUNGRY. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS IS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING RENT OR WERE UNABLE TO PAY RENT LAST MONTH. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN FOUR BUSINESSES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, THEN YOU NEED TO TELL ME. HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMY, THEN WE WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 PER YEAR. WE WILL ALSO CUT TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING PEOPLE. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT NO WORKING FAMILY PAYS MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. WE WILL HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS. UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THE WAY AND ACCESS FOR MOST FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING THAT IS INTERGENERATIONAL. THAT'S HOW JOE BIDEN THINKS ABOUT THE ECONOMY. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP, WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, DONALD TRUMP ASKS HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? DONALD TRUMP ASKS HOW HER RICH PEOPLE DOING? DONALD TRUMP, AS HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. CREATING A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT FOR ALL OF US. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, WHEN JOE AND I ARE ELECTED, WE ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT IS ABOUT THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF JOBS. WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY INTO AN INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT WILL DO THAT WILL NOT ONLY SAVE OUR PLANET, BUT CREATE JOBS. WILL PUT THAT MONEY TO RELIEVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ANY KID COMING FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $105,000 AND ASSURE THEY GO TO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE FOR FREE. THAT IS WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] ON THAT NOTE, JOE BIDEN KNOWS AMERICANS HISTORY. HE KNOWS OUR HISTORY AS A COUNTRY. HE HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT IT. JOE BIDEN HAS THE ABILITY TO SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER. [HORNS HONKING] DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER SPEAK THOSE WORDS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN AMERICA. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT COVID AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM ERIE IT JOE BIDEN KNOWS OUR INDIGENOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN AMERICA. JOE BIDEN SAYS PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AND UNDERSTAND, A REAL LEADER WILL ADDRESS THE TRUTH AND SPEAK THE TRUTH IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT PROMOTING EQUALITY AND EQUITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WAS ON THE DEBATE STAGE AT THE FIRST DEBATE AND REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS. THEN DOUBLE DOWN SAYING STAND BACK AND STAND BY. DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS SHOWN A PATTERN FROM THE FIRST DAYS HE WAS RUNNING AND QUESTIONED THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. DONALD TRUMP, WHO WENT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS WERE PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED, AND ON THE OTHER, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS AND CARRYING TIKI TORCHES SPEWING ANTI-SEMITIC AND RACIAL SLURS, DONALD TRUMP SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON EACH SIDE. HE CAME INTO OFFICE TALKING ABOUT MEXICANS AS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS TO PASS A MUSLIM BAN. THERE IS A REAL CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE JOE BIDEN AND I UNDERSTAND AMERICA DESERVE SO MUCH MORE. WE WANT A LEADER WHO IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO SO HATE AND INDECISION. WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF ANY HUMAN BEING IS NOT ABOUT WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU LIFT UP. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADER JOE IS. THE CRISES WE ARE FACING, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ARIZONA THIS, IT INCLUDES A CLIMATE CRISIS. THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN BURNING. THESE WILDFIRES, AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE GONE , I AM FROM CALIFORNIA. I HAVE VISITED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. MY BROTHER IS A FIREFIGHTER. I HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION. THE DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION IN OUR GULF COAST STATES BECAUSE OF THE STORM THAT IS WIPED OUT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. IN THE MIDWEST, FARMERS HAVE LOST WHOLE SEASONS OF CROPS BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS. JOE BIDEN SAYS LET'S DEAL WITH THIS. LET'S FACE FACTS, LET'S EMBRACE SCIENCE. LET US DO IT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND ALSO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO SET TIME LIMITS. NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO SET GOALS THAT INCLUDE AN INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND YES WHAT, THAT'S ABOUT JOBS. MILLIONS OF JOBS. [HORNS HONKING] ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES, SOMEONE ASKED HIM SAYING SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE WILDFIRES. WILL YOU ADDRESS THAT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HIS UTTER ELOQUENCE SAYS SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REFERRED TO SCIENCE AS A PERSON. [LAUGHTER] [HORNS HONKING] 1 WEEK , WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO EMBRACES FACT AND DEALS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH A THREAT THAT IS THE GREATEST TO US AS A SPECIES. THESE ARE THE THREATS AND CRISES WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THEM. IT BRINGS ME TO WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ACROSS AMERICA. A PROCESS THAT WILL END IN SIX DAYS. THAT IS THE SELECTION. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT EVERYTHING IS IN EACH OF OUR HANDS. IN TERMS OF THE POWER WE POSSESS THROUGH OUR VOTE AND OUR ACTION TO DETERMINE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [HORNS HONKING] PEOPLE ASK, THEY SAY DOES IT MATTER IF I VOTE? WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I WILL TELL YOU TUCSON, I MENTIONED THREE THINGS IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION. NUMBER ONE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO VOTE TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. ALL OF THIS PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT, WHO MARCHED, FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. THIS YEAR, WE LOST GREAT JOHN LEWIS, A GREAT AMERICAN WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE TOGETHER WITH SO MANY OTHERS. JOHN LEWIS WAS SUCH A FIGHTER FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. HE UNDERSTOOD THE ONGOING FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS NOT ONLY DID HE SHED BLOOD FIGHTING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO VOTE IN THE SOUTH AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY, IT WAS JOHN LEWIS WHO WAS ALWAYS AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE SAYING THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS A FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS A FIGHT FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS FOR EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. IT IS ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS. THOSE WHO SACRIFICED SO MUCH. IT'S ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS KNOWING THAT THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATED THE PASSAGE OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT WHICH GAVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. [HORNS HONKING] HONORING THE SUFFRAGETTES WHO WERE MARCHING AND FIGHTING AND SAYING WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED, WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. HONORING THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS STEAK. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. YOU GO DOWN THE LIST. EVERYTHING THAT IMPACTS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY. FROM HEALTH CARE TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS THAT KIND OF APPROACH THAT HAS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA AND MADE US STRONG WHEN WE HAVE BEEN STRONG. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WHEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT EMBRACES THE FACT THAT WE ARE A NATION BUILT IN LARGE PART BY IMMIGRANTS AND WE MUST CREATE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND HONOR AMERICA'S PARTNERSHIP TO THE DREAMERS AND RENEW DACA. [HORNS HONKING] EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WHETHER WE ARE GOING STAKE. WHETHER WE WILL EMBRACE SCIENCE AND DEAL CHANGE IN CLIMATE. WHETHER WE CARE ABOUT OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD AND WHETHER WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NEVER TAKE THE WORD FOREIGN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. , INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE VOTE TO HONOR ANCESTORS, VOTE BECAUSE WE KNOW SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. AND HERE IS THE THIRD REASON I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO VOTE, AND IT IS THIS. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER. I HAVE BEEN IN FLORIDA, MICHIGAN, OHIO, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA. I'M GOING TO HEAD TO TEXAS AND I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF POWERFUL FOLKS TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OTHER FOLKS ABOUT AND IN 2013, THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RIGHT AFTER THERE WERE A COUPLE STATES THAT PUT INTO PLACE LAWS THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT LAWS PURGING THE VOTER ROLLS AND WE HAVE PEOPLE IN POWERFUL POSITIONS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO OPENLY ENCOURAGED SUPPRESSION OF THE VOTE. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT CONFUSING. YOU GOTTA FILL OUT THIS ENVELOPE AND PUT IT OUT ON THAT ENVELOPE. PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE PULLING AWAY FROM BOXES TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT, SHUTTING DOWN POLLING SITES AND WE HAVE TO ASK , WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO CONFUSE US? WHY IS THE PRESIDENT MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE? AND HERE IS THE ANSWER, BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER, THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY NOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY NOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. AND SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. OURS IS THE POWER, SO USE OUR VOICES, AND AT ELECTION TIME, THAT MEANS OUR VOTE AND LET'S NOT LET ANYONE TAKE IT FROM US. BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING, OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO. AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE OF US VOTING TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND THEN MY FINAL POINT IS THIS THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL ASK US WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WHAT WE DID. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM HOW WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS ONE AFTERNOON. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM THAT WE ORGANIZED FOR US, THAT WE LEAD OUR NEIGHBORS FRIENDS, COWORKERS AND FAMILY KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. HE REMINDED THEM OF THE SACRIFICES OF THE ANCESTORS, WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE POWER. YES, HAVE BEEN IN A PANDEMIC WHERE THERE IS SOME ISOLATION GOING ON BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE, WE REMINDED THEM THEY ARE NOT ALONE, WE REMINDED THEM DON'T LET ANYBODY MAKE YOU FEEL SMALL. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE KNEW WE WERE A COMMUNITY. WE KNEW THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION IS BASED ON OUR UNITY. WE WILL TELL THEM WE FOUGHT KNOWING THAT WE ALL, REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE LIVED, WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE KNEW WE HAD SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND WE WOULD NOT LET ANYONE DIVIDE ASSASSINATION. WE WOULD NOT LET ANYONE BREAK OUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR STRENGTH AND HUMANITY AND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. AND WE WILL TELL THEM THAT'S HOW WE ELECT TO JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, TO SOME. , TUCSON. THANK YOU.

This is not a fig ht against an ything. This is a joyf ul figh t f or what we know can be unburdened by wh at h as been . That's what's before us. That is what is before us, Ph oenix And I'll te ll you in th e in the spirit of t he late, great John McCa in, I'm he re t o also engage in a little straight talk because I'll tell you, you kno w, for ex ample, you know there's b een there 's been a lo t of talk from the current occu pant of the White House a bout my values. Well, let me just tell you, in the sp irit of John McCai n, I am a proud, pa triotic American. It was ve ry c lear thinking about th e values we as Americans s hare when it comes to knowing tha t the c ommander in chief of the Un ited State s of Ameri ca should ha ve as his f irst priority the health a nd well bein g of the American p eople . I am clear in u nderstand ing. T his is the gr eatest failure of any p reside ntial administratio n we h ave ever witnessed as a country. A nd I kno w that w e are all prep ared to stan d for the democracy o f our country and to stand f or thi s country we love, and the ch allenges are there great. We are facing right n ow probably fou r crises that ha ve converged at one time because of this pandemic, we're loo king at a public healt h crisis. Th at is w hat I've been calling on e of the greatest ma ss c asualty events we have ex perien ced designation since World War two. W e're look ing at over 225,000 people who have died in just the las t several months, many of whom, beca use of the nature of this pa ndemic, were with out the ir family members for their last m in utes and hours on this eart h. We're looking a t a public health c risis where a virus has infected ov er 8.5 million Americans who are going to f ace unknown long term h ealth consequences , including w hat? Including what doctors are telling us lung sca rring and thin gs of that nature. And I bri ng t his up and thes e numbers up beca use I think it is real ly important for us to unde rstand it didn't h ave to be thi s bad. It did n ot h ave to be this ba d, thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward. We know that the pre sident of the Unit ed Sta tes and the vice pre sident of the Un ited Sta tes were info rmed about the natur e of th is pandemic . Back on Jan uary 28th. The y were informed that it was five times as lethal as deadly as the fl u. The y w ere informed it could h urt peop le of every ag e. They were in formed that it w as airborne. Bu t wha t did th ey do with t his informa tion? They set o n it. Th ey covered it up. T hey did not tell the American people. Instead, the president of the United St ates said i t was a hoax. A nd then most recently, just i n the last coupl e of days at the gall to say We're round ing the corner on it. Bu t Phoenix, can you im agine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th? How s erious this waas, What you as a parent , what you is a wor king pers on? What you is a s mall business own er or someone who works for a small bus iness. You was a tea cher what you migh t have done if you ha d known on January 28th, you know, bec ause e ven before this pandemic, you k now, Donald Trump wa s walking around talkin g about how the eco nomy is gre at. The economy is great, right? But the f act is that in Am erica, even bef ore the pandemi c, far to o many families h ad to work two a nd three j obs toe, put fo od on the tab le and pay the ren t. A nd let me ju st tell you something in Joe Biden and my American, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay th e rent and put food o n the tab le. Even befor e thi s, we were looking at the fa ct that the average Ameri can family had less than $1000 i n savings . But how people would have prepared shoot how people would have bought a little bit mor e toilet paper. Have we k now n what this was all gonn a be and Lysol. But I make lig ht of it bec ause the reality i s they k new and the y did not tell the people bec ause they put politics in front o ff the priorities of th e American p eople. And so we ar e now in this pub lic health pan demic, but it is even wor se than them covering i t up. You do know that t he president of the U nited States with h is boy Bill bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now, suing to ge t rid of the A ffo rdable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic. The Aff ordable Care Act, which was brought tow u s by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden a nd brought hea lth care to over 2 0 million people who d id not have it protected people w ith preexisting conditions so that they could not be denied cov erage based on a pre existin g condition. Hunk. If you know som ebody who ha s diabe tes, ho nk if you love s omebody who has high blood pressur e hunk. If you know some body w ith breas t cancer hu nk, if you know somebod y with Lupus wi th all right and they'r e tryi ng to get rid of it, you know, in part of it, I just hav e to say, You know, e ven when he w as running for office , it was clear that the man just had this ver y weird obsession with try ing to g et rid of whatever B arack Obama and J oe Biden created. An d this is just a extension of that. B ut here's the thing. P hoenix We do n't really want preside nts who have wei rd obsessions , do we? No, Joe Bide n is saying. Instead of trying to get r id of t he Affordable Ca re act, Joe and I are saying no, let's expand cove rage. Let's exp and covera ge understanding. We need to brin g down Medic are eligibility to age 60. Let's expand co verage in ter ms of bringing down th e cost of presc ription drugs bringing down the cost of premiums. Let's e xpand coverage underst anding. When we're talking about health car e, the body j ust just start from the neck down. It is also the neck up , and w e need to ha ve mental healt h care available f or everyone who needs it. There is a clear contra st, a clear choi ce in this elect ion about w here we go from here, a public h ealth cri sis and economic crisis. We are lookin g at an economic crisis t hat i s being compared to the Great De pression. Over 30 mi llion Americans in just the l ast several months fi led for un empl oyment insuran ce. Here in Arizon a, one out of 10 fami lies is describing their household is having been hungr y. We're not talk ing enough about t hat. I've seen numbe rs that one in five mothe rs is de scribing h er Children. Under th e age of 12. We are in the midst of, ah, hunger crisis in Amer ica. Here in Ar izona, one in n ine families co uld not pay th ei r rent. Are are w orried about being abl e to p ay their rent next mo nth. Here in Arizona, one in four small busin esses have gone ou t of busin ess, and t here is a clear con trast because on the one hand you have Joe Bi de n who, when ask ed, How do you think the economy is doing? Joe Biden will say, Well, tell me how worki ng people a re doing. T ell me how working fami lies are doing Joe Biden, who says You want t o talk to me about the e conomy? Th en let's talk about what we n eed to do because we are not going to r aise taxes on anyone maki ng less than $400, 000 a year, we ar e going to increase middl e cla ss tax cuts. We are going to ensure tha t families working fami lies do not pay more t han 7% of their i ncome in child care. We know that the p ath Thio interge nerational weal th with so many fami lies includes hom eownership. S o first time home buyers will get a $15,000 tax credit for a down payment and c losi ng costs. That's how Joe thin ks about the ec onomy. On the other hand, y ou ha ve Donald Trump who, when ask ed, How's the economy doi ng? You know what he says a lmost every time. Well , how' s the stock market doin g? How a re rich peop le doing ? Which is why one of his fi rst orde rs of business was to pas s a tax cut be nefiting the t op 1% and t he biggest c orporations in A merica, t o the point tha t we will be faced w ith a $ 2 trillio n deficit. Wel l, let me tell you , if we do what we need to d o in these next six day s, Joe Biden and I are ab out t o get rid of that t ax cut on invest that money in w orking families . Invest that mo ney in building up our infrast ructur e, building back up our roads and bridges, buil ding back up what we need to do around ren ewa ble e ne rgies. And that's gonna be ab out millions o f jobs bec ause we know when you i nvest in the American worker in American families, we as an econom y will always do well, n o, there's a clear choice in th is election. The cr ises that we are confronting include a long ov erdue reckoni ng on racial injustic e in America. And you have Joe Bi den, who is informed ab out America's histor y and has the courage to spe ak trut h and say the phrase b lack liv es matter tha t Joe Biden wh o understands it, may be dif ficult to hear. Bu t we've got to confr ont racial disparities in Ame rica in our health care system, in our ec onomy, in our education systems, Joe s ays. We n eed to deal with small businesses s o many minority and wome n owned small busine sses who have gon e out of business. And so we will invest $150 billion in low interest loans and access to cap ital for those bus inesses. Joe k nows we need to deal wi th the crim inal justice system. It must be r eformed and do t hat a nd do it in a way t hat is about gett ing rid of private prisons. Getti ng ri d of cash bail, wh ich is an ec ono mic justice issue a s much a s it is a criminal justic e issue d e criminalizing mar ijuana expunging expunging the recor ds of people who have been convicted for marijua na offens es. Joe Biden knows w e have to deal w ith policing, and we have to hold any body accou ntable who bre aks the law. And so we will put in place a ban on chokeholds and c arotid ho lds. George Floy d would be alive today if t hat were the case. We will say there needs to be a na tional registr y for police offic ers who break the law because you c an't just do it in on e place and then get fired and move to anot her place and get h ired. That's not right. Joe Biden has the co urage to speak these t ruths in a way that is about bringi ng folks together and f ixing the problems we kno w exist. On the other hand, y ou have the curre nt president of the Unit ed States who went o n a deb ate stage de bate before last, refused to condemn white s upremacists and then double do wn, sayin g, Stand back and st and by a nd be clear. This is a patt ern. This i s the fellow who ran fo r office p artly on a camp aign theory to su ggest that t he first b lack president o f the United S tates was an illegiti mate pre sident of the U nited States. This is the same person. Th ere's a patter n here. Phoenix who o n the on the tra gedy of what happened in Charlot tesville re member that pe ople were pea cefully protesti ng racial injus tice. Th ere was a yo ung woman wh o was killed in that prote st. And on the other side there were ne o Nazis we aring swasti kas, carrying tiki torc hes, hurli ng racial and anti Semit ic slur s and the commander in chie f. So the re were fi ne people on both sides, a person w ho cam e into office calling Mexicans rapist s and cri minals. Ah, person who came in the off ice in one of his first o rders of busines s was institute a Muslim ban. We des erve so much more. Let me tell you , Joe, in his h eart in h is soul, is runnin g, knowing th at we mu st bring our country tog ether and give digni ty toe all pe ople. Joe kno ws it is time. T hio. End this this attempt Thi o spew hat e and divisi on among us. It is time to end trying to get Americans to turn on e ach other. Jo e know s the rial sign of someon e's strength is not based on who you beat down. It's b ased on who you lift up. They 're really, really choices in this electi on. Let's deal with so mething that all of us on t he West Coast and in this area of the wor ld und erstand quite well. And it is that we are in the midst of a cri sis in terms o f our cl imate, and it poses a thr eat. Tow us as a species and we must acknowl edge th e science and deal with i t. You've got J oe who says I see what's happen ing. I see that you have the West Coa st, my home state of Califo rnia, Oregon. W ashington called all the fires, the wildfires, devastat ing e ntire commu nities or havi ng to be evac uated. I hav e met with families that have been evacu ated. I have met wit h firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burni ng. M y brother. In laws of firefighter, the devastati on is profound. Y ou go to th e Gulf Coast state s. In fact, right now what is it? Zeta is hitting Lou isi ana. It's the fifth named storm t his ye ar, I say, named be cause the y don't name a small storm. It's serio us what it's doing in terms of hurt ing the livelihood and well bei ng of families in the Mi dwest fl oods, to the poi nt that farmers in that area of our co untry h ave lost a w hole season of crop s. We ha ve to take this se riously, J oe says. We have to deal with the s cie nce, bu t we have to s ee th e o pportunity, and the cri sis is, w ell, one. The clock is tickin g on this, and we need to act with a se nse of urgency and put in pla ce goals l ike Net zer o emissi ons by 2050. W e need to underst and that we have to have ah, prot ection of land and open sp aces. W e need t o under sta nd that an i nvestment in renewable ene rgies is also about an i nvestme nt in job s and investment in the appren ticeship programs of our bu ilding trad es and the carpenters and plumbers and the electri cian's don't understa nds what leadership looks like on this. O n the other hand, you ha ve the current preside nt of the U nited States who we nt approach ed by journ alists and that th e journalis t said somet hing like, You kno w, these wildfires th at happened in Cal ifornia And the scientists are saying, You know, that t he science tells us that these extreme weath er condition s are a very big factor and what's g oing o n? And do you know that the presid ent of the Un ited States of A merica responded? The commander in chi ef of the United States of America, He's supp osed to be a world wide leader, responded when asking that when being asked that question. Science does n't know as though science is a pers on. Wel l, Mr Pre sident, sc ience does. No, it is time we take this issue ser iously. So, yeah, so the stakes ar e high, The stak es are high . Pho enix and y ou in thi s s tate. The re ason I 'm here, t he r eason I was h ere with Joe last ti me I was in Tucson ea rli er today. The reason I'm h ere is to thank yo u, because I d o believe you all are going to make a rea lly sta tement about who we truly a re as a country yo u are. Arizona has a well earned reputation for wanting truth talkers. Straight talkers. Ar izona has a long s tanding reputation for No. B s just get the job d one. A rizona unders tands tha t. Come to me, talk ing about issues t hat are the is sues I deal with. They keep me up in the mi ddle of the ni ght that have me sitting at my ki tchen table trying t o figure it all out. Th at's wh at Arizona de mands off its leaders. And in th is election, that is what is at stake . Joe and I are v ery proud of the fact tha t in this campaign we have built one of the broadest coali tions you've ever seen. We' ve got, of course, Dem ocrats. But w e've got Re publicans. Cindy McCain, Jeff Flake, Independence Peop le of all back grounds coming together , understandi ng what is at stake. And the issues are y es, the four thin gs we've already ta lked about it so much more. It's abou t putting. It's about pu tting Resource is into our public e ducation system. We wil l triple teacher s Title one funding. It's about figh ting for civ il rig hts, including L G B T. Q. Rights. It i s about immedia tely putting a pathway t o citizensh ip and renewing protec tions for our dreamer s under DACA. There is so much at stake. And I do believe be cau se of who you are, you wi ll make a dif ference n ot only in term s of who w ins, but you will make a difference in ter ms of saying who we a re. And s o here's t he thing y ou know p eople, then ask. Well, I don't know if I shou ld vote or doesn't matter. W hy should I vote? Peop le ask these questions often, r ight? I'm sure all o f us ha ve been asked the quest ion. I think ther e are three reas ons people shoul d vote. One is toe ho nor. The ancestors ho nor the ancestors. Y ou kno w, th is year we l ost a great American hero. Congressman Jo hn Lewis. John Lewis shed his blo od fighting good trouble. She d his blood o n the Edmund P ettus Bridge for the r ight for fo lks to vote righ t for the ri ght for black A mericans to vote. When b lack Amer icans were being denied the right to vote , John Lewis unders tood that was a ci vil rights issue. That was an issu e about a statement o f who we are a s a coun try. Whic h i s why, and John Lewis's life. He also was one of the first in line to fight f or marriage equal ity. Why Joh n Lewis was one of the first in lin e to fight for immi grant rig hts because he u nderstood this is a bout civil rights, and he pa id a price for that by s hedding his blood. So le t's honor the ances tors. Let's honor the anc estors. When we j ust this year cele brated the 1\/100 a nniversary of the 19th Ame ndment, let's honor th ose suffragettes who in their w hite marched and shouted and fought and dared any one to tell them they were less than equal. And let's also speaking truth. Rememb er history that black women, how ever, were not allowed t o vote until 1965. But let's honor the ancestors understa nding it is our resp onsibility . Thio, take on w hat they fought for us to have as a righ t and to follow th rough with that Numb er two. Let' s vote. Because of ev erything we ha ve discussed, tha t is its st ake. There wa s so much that impac ts us every d ay that is at stake in this el ection. And here's my thi rd poi nt about voti ng. You k now , I'm tr aveling the cou ntr y. I've been in Ge or gia, B een in F lorida, No rth Carolina , Ohio . Um, I've been eve rywhere. I' m gonna be going to Tex as. U m, so you know, in 20 13 the United St ates Su preme Co urt gutted the Vo ting Ri ghts Act. R ight? Okay. It's called Shelby V. Holder. They took out the abi lity of the Justice Depart ment toe, enforce t he need for fair voting laws, and immed iately therea fter i n 2013 almost two do zen states pu t in place laws that wer e designed to make it di fficult for fol ks to vote. T hey purged the rolls in and and and t hey focused on bl ack voters, vo ter s of color studen ts, our indig enous broth ers and sisters, r ight? And s. So mu ch so that in North Ca roli na, a court of appeal re viewed the cas e an d said th at t hey passe d a law with quote surg ical precision to preve nt black peopl e from voting. Th at's how ba d it's been. N ot to mention t he president, United States, that that first debate got up on a stage in front o f 70 million A mericans and i n my opinion, open ly encour aged a suppression o f the vote and all of the st ates that are trying to m ake it co nfusing. I mean, states w here you gotta fill ou t t he ballot and pu t it in one en velope, and then you' re supposed to put on another envelope. In some st ate s wher e you gotta have been a third person, sign the envelope, you know, States that air picking up the drop boxes so that people can't find it easy to drop off their ballots states that air closing down polling places, the messing with the post off the post office, the post office postal workers are like the best, nicest people you could ever meet. They're messing with the post office. And so you gotta ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so confusing and difficult for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. And so let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our voice at election time through our vote because the power is with the people. And you know, when people say, Well, what do you think about what's gonna happen the day after the election? Here's what I say. America's democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. So my last point is this. This moment will pass, and years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others they're gonna look in our eyes. Each one of us and they will ask us. Where were you that moment And what we are all going to be able to tell them? It's so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did way will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized folks. We help people get to the polls. We reminded people to vote early. We texted and we called. And we emailed to the point that people got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. We did everything that was necessary to remind each other that we are not alone, that we are in this together, that we each have the power and that we love our country and are prepared to fight for its ideals. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you, Phoenix. So she No way E yeah. Yeah,","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477474-1\/senator-harris-biden-campaign-event-phoenix-arizona","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke at a Biden campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona.","Source":"477474-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

YOU ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION. LET ME THINK THE WORKERS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THAT VIDEO AND OUR PANELISTS. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THEM IN A FEW MOMENTS. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY WE LIVE IN CRAZY TIMES. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THIS TERRIBLE PANDEMIC. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND INCOME. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SO MANY THINGS. TONIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO BE ASKING, HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, HALF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK. THE BILLIONAIRES ARE DOING WELL. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? HOW DOES IT HAPPEN IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY, WE HAVE MILLIONS OF WORKERS EARNING STARVATION WAGES. YOU JUST HEARD THAT ON THE VIDEO. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ON $10 AN HOUR. YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR RENT. YOU CAN'T FEED YOUR KIDS OR TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OUR NATION, IS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH NOT TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO ALL PEOPLE AS A HUMAN RIGHT? WE'RE SPENDING TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE THAN ANY OTHER NATION. 90 MILLION ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT TODAY IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, BECOMES REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE REFUSED TO PASS A COVID EMERGENCY RELIEF BILL. ALL ACROSS AMERICA, FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING IN AMERICA TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES. THEY DON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY GET SICK BECAUSE THEY LOST HEALTH INSURANCE. WHAT TONIGHT IS ABOUT IS HEARING FROM WORKERS, FROM KAMALA HARRIS ABOUT HER PLAN AND JOE BIDEN'S PLAN ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE HURTING TODAY. SO AGAIN, IN THE MIDST OF EVERYTHING GOING ON, WE TALKED ABOUT TRUMP AND WHAT CRAZY THING HE MAY HAVE SAID YESTERDAY OR TODAY, WE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC POLICIES WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IN DESPERATE ECONOMIC CONDITION. I THINK WHAT WE WILL HEAR TONIGHT IS WHY WE NEED TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING ABOUT WHY WE NEED TO END THE ABSURDITY OF WOMEN MAKING $.80 ON THE DOLLAR. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PAID EQUALLY FOR THE WORK THEY ARE DOING. THE ABSURDITY OF SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK AND CAN AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE. THE UNCERTAINTY OF SO MANY YOUNG KIDS NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE WITHOUT FALLING IN DEBT. TONIGHT WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMIC PAIN SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE EXPERIENCING. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW IN THIS GREAT NATION WITH A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, A DEMOCRATIC SENATE, WE ARE FINALLY GOING TO STAND UP TO POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS, DEAL WITH INEQUALITY, AND CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL. WITH THAT, IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE A FRIEND OF MINE. A FELLOW SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE LEADING VOICES IN THE U.S. SENATE AND SOMEBODY I KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT. PLEASE WELCOME KAMALA HARRIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU. YOU ARE AMAZING. BERNIE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY LEADER. ONE MARK OF A GREAT LEADER IS SOMEONE WHO REQUIRES THE COUNTRY , TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK, IS IT DOING EVERYTHING IT IS CAPABLE OF? BERNIE IS SOMEONE THAT HAS CHALLENGED EVERY PREMISE AND REQUIRED PEOPLE THAT ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE TO DEFEND THE PREMISE WHICH HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF THEIR OPINIONS FOR A LIFETIME. IN MANY WAYS WHEN HE DOES THAT, ONE SEES THE PREMISE IS FLAWED. BERNIE HAS BEEN SOMEONE, LOOK AT THAT MISCHIEVOUS GRIN. [LAUGHTER] HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. THE THING ABOUT YOU, BERNIE, YOU DECIDED TO DO IT FROM INSIDE THE SYSTEM. AND TO CHALLENGE EVERYONE FROM INSIDE. I DO BELIEVE ON THAT DEBATE TO STAGE YOU AND I SHARED FOR ALMOST A YEAR IN THE PRIMARY, THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE DEBATES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA IF NOT FOR A DISCUSSION THAT YOU STARTED AND THE WAY YOU CHALLENGED THE STATUS QUO. AND OUR THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PREPARED FOR AND WHAT THEY WANT. IN FRONT OF ALL OUR FRIENDS COME I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO. YOU REALLY ARE A TREASURE. THANK YOU. NOW FOR THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. WHAT I DID WANT TO SAY, WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SENATE, WE GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAVE PRIVATE MEETINGS. WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY, I HAVE SEEN KAMALA HARRIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. I'VE SEEN THE PASSION AND DECENCY SHE EXPRESSES AND A WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR PEOPLE TODAY THEY DO NOT HAVE A VOICE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU DO. I THINK IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE TALKED ABOUT TRUMP'S CRAZINESS. WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT WHAT OUR AGENDA IS. IF YOU GET ELECTED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO HELP THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE LIVING IN ECONOMIC DESPERATION. I APPRECIATE YOU FRAMING IT THAT WAY. ENOUGH ABOUT THAT GUY. LET'S MOVE ON. FIRST OF ALL, WE CANNOT OVERLOOK THE BIG THING IN FRONT OF US, THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE ECONOMY AND WORKING PEOPLE. IN SO MANY WAYS, THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR, MEANING IT HAS, FOR FOLKS THAT ARE DOING BADLY, THEY ARE DOING WORSE. IT HAS BEEN A MAGNIFIER ON THE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE LONG EXISTED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INEQUITY, THE INJUSTICE AND IMMORALITY OF NOT PAYING ALL WORKERS SICK LEAVE. NOT GIVING PAID SICK LEAVE OR FAMILY LEAVE TO ALL WORKERS. THE INJUSTICE OF THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN A WAY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME PEOPLE HAVE REALIZED, IF THAT WORKER DOES NOT HAVE SICK LEAVE, IT WILL IMPACT ME. HOWEVER WE GET THERE, WE GET THERE. LET THIS BE A MOMENT OF RECKONING. THAT IS PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN FOUGHT. JOE AND I ARE COMMITTED TO PAID SICK LEAVE AND FAMILY LEAVE. WE HAVE TO. IT IS MORALLY WRONG. HERE'S THE THING ALSO. WE TALK ABOUT PREMISES, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WORKING PEOPLE HAVE ETHICS. THEY TAKE THEIR WORK SERIOUSLY. THEY TAKE PRIDE IN THE WORK THEY DO. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE DIGNITY. THAT COMES WITH WORKING A HARD DAY. THAT INCLUDES WHEN THEY GET SICK BEING ABLE TO STAY HOME. WHEN THEY HAVE A PARENT OR CHILD THAT NEED ATTENTION, BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR THEM. KNOWING THEY ARE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT IS A NECESSITY. THEY WILL GET BACK TO WORK WHEN THEY CAN. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT, WE SEE THIS ACROSS THE BOARD, EVEN WHEN WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SNAP BENEFITS. FOOD STAMPS. PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. AND THEN THERE'S A SUGGESTION WE'VE HEARD, IF YOU EXTEND, THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY. THERE'S ALSO THIS UGLY PREMISE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE LOW INCOME CHOOSE TO BE THAT WAY. OR DON'T HAVE THE SAME ETHICS AS EVERYONE ELSE, OR ARE IRRESPONSIBLE. THIS IS PART OF WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE WAY WE HAVE ECONOMIC POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND MORAL ON A GLOBAL SCALE. WITHIN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS ABOUT TREATING WORKERS WITH DIGNITY. MINIMUM WAGE. PAY EQUITY. IT IS STILL THE CASE WOMEN ARE NOT PAID THE SAME AMOUNT AS MEN FOR THE SAME WORK. WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT BLACK WOMEN, NATIVE WOMEN, THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN MORE STARK. LET'S LOOK AT WHEN WE INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR, ONE IN THREE WOMEN WILL BENEFIT. FOUR IN 10 BLACK WORKERS WILL BENEFIT. RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGES ABOUT THE FLOOR, NOT THE CEILING. IT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE THIS THING FORWARD AND PAY PEOPLE THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK. NO FAMILY SHOULD PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. AGAIN, THIS IS ABOUT ADDRESSING, THE HYPOCRISY OF IT ALL. WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT FAMILIES. EVERY PERSON RUNNING FOR OFFICE WILL TALK ABOUT, THEY ARE A FAMILY PERSON. FAMILIES NEED ASSISTANCE PAYING FOR CHILD CARE, WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP ACROSS THE BOARD. WAGES HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT. WHEN WE SEE IN MANY PLACES, WE ARE LOOKING AT CHILDCARE DESERTS OR CHILDCARE BEING MORE EXPENSIVE THAN COLLEGE. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. EVERYONE BENEFITS. EVERYONE. WHEN ANY FAMILY HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THE ESSENTIAL NEED OF THE CHILDREN IN THEIR HOME AND, EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS THAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN UNIVERSAL PRE-K. AGAIN, THE STUDIES ARE CLEAR. HUMAN EXPERIENCE TELLS YOU, WHEN THE YOUNGEST HAVE THAT. NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKE CARE. EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR THE YOUNGEST, THEY HAVE A LEG UP. PEOPLE THAT COME FROM WEALTHY FAMILIES HAVE RESOURCES TO DO THAT ANYWAY. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. THEY HAVE EQUAL CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE, WHATEVER THEIR DREAMS ARE. THEY DON'T HAVE EQUAL RESOURCES. THAT IS THE POINT OF EQUITY. I KNOW YOU HAVE HEARD IN CALIFORNIA ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. FROM A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY, THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WHAT IDEA DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ANYBODY TO GET A HIGHER EDUCATION? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH THE LEVEL OF STUDENT DEBT TODAY? ANY STUDENT FROM A FAMILY MAKING LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR CAN ATTEND A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY FOR FREE, INCLUDING A PRIVATE H VCU. IN ADDITION, SO MANY OF OUR BRIGHT MINDS COME OUT OF COLLEGE WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THEY WANT TO PURSUE A PROFESSION THAT IS ONE OF SERVICE, PUBLIC SERVICE. AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED FOR ANYONE THAT GOES TO A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR, WE WILL ERASE THEIR DEBT. AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT TO DO TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS, ENCOURAGING BRIGHT MINDS TO PURSUE AND EDUCATION TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND CONTRIBUTE. IT IS ALSO WHAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO TO CREATE ECONOMIC STIMULUS. WE ARE LOOKING AT, WHEN WE GET RID OF THAT STUDENT LOAN DEBT, THAT GIVES THOSE STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT WE ARE GOING TO GIVE A TAX CREDIT TO FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS FOR A DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS. CAN YOU IMAGINE, THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS OUT OF COLLEGE WITH DEBT, THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN BUY A HOME. THEY ARE QUESTIONING IF THEY CAN HAVE CHILDREN. AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO CREATE A MORE PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT, IF WE RELIEVE THEM OF THAT DEBT IF THEY GO INTO JOBS THAT DON'T PAY MORE THAN $125,000. YOU'RE COUNTING, I SUSPECT. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. I JUST WANT TO SUMMARIZE FOR ALL OF THE VIEWERS, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE DISCUSSED IT ENOUGH. YOU HEARD KAMALA OUTLINE THE BIDEN ECONOMIC PROPOSAL FOR WORKING FAMILIES. THIS IS NO SMALL THING. RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS AN INCREASE FOR 40 MILLION WORKERS. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE. MAKING PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE FOR FAMILIES UNDER 125 THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CANCELING STUDENT DEBT. UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE AND PRE-K FOR THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLDS. THIS IS A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR THE WORKING FAMILIES AND LITTLE CHILDREN. WHEN WE GO TO VOTE, I KNOW WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TRUMP ALL THE TIME. THAT'S FINE. IT IS ANOTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TODAY THAT ARE HURTING. I WANT TO THANK KAMALA FOR HER GRANT , GREAT CAMPAIGN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER. I THINK YOU. ALL RIGHT. LET ME NOW INTRODUCE SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT NEED MUCH OF AN INTRODUCTION. MARY KAY HENRY IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES UNION. ONE OF THE LARGE AND GREAT UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS A UNION THAT HAS HELPED LEAD THE WAY TO FIGHT FOR 15. IT BELIEVES IN MEDICARE FOR ALL. IT IS A UNION THAT BELIEVES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. IMMIGRATION REFORM. ONE OF THE GREAT UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. THE MICROPHONE IS YOURS. VERY K: THANK YOU. I'M SO PROUD TO JOIN YOU WITH THE 2 MILLION MEMBERS FIGHTING FOR 15 IN THE UNION. YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE IN 2016 BY TAKING UP THE $15 DEMAND THAT WE BEGAN WITH SO MANY YEARS AGO. HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PASSING THE $15 MINIMUM WAGE WHEN WE ELECT JOE BIDEN. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE LISTENING TODAY. YOU AND I KNOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY RUNNING. WE TREAT THE SICK, WE CARE FOR OUR ELDERS. WE CLEAN AND PROTECT PUBLIC SPACES. AND YET ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE COMPLETELY FED UP WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE HAD IT WITH POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK COMMUNITIES. THE COVID CRISIS AND ECONOMIC DEPRESSION THAT FOLLOWED. IN EACH OF THESE CRISES, TOGETHER WITH THE CLIMATE RICES, HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL. IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT OF THESE CRISES AND ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST. AND ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR. YOU AND I SEE THE VERY PEOPLE FIGHTING BACK EVERY DAY WITH HOPE AND DETERMINATION. WE HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT WE REFUSED TO RETURN TO NORMAL. NORMAL NEVER WORKED FOR US. WE ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND PROGRESSIVE CHAMPIONS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT THAT ARE GOING TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE US FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE THRILLED FIVE DAYS OUT THE JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA SUPPORT 15 AND THE RIGHT FOR ALL WORKING PEOPLE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN UNIONS NO MATTER WHAT JOB THEY DO. ONE THING I DID NOT GET INTO IS THE FACT JOE BIDEN BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE NEED TO GROW THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WORKERS TO JOIN UNIONS. WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR ORDINARY WORKERS? THE PROPOSAL WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT IS 3 MILLION CAREGIVING JOBS. SOME IN ELDER CARE THAT WE ARE PROUD TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC WORKERS IN MAKING JOBS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN VALUED. THEY WERE PAID SUBMINIMUM WAGES AND EXCLUDED FROM OVERTIME AND SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE OF A RACIST COMPROMISE IN THE 1930'S. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE BLACK AND BROWN AND IMMIGRANT WOMEN GET INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION. THAT IS A PROPOSAL FROM JOE BIDEN TO INVEST IN A CAREGIVING ECONOMY. THAT WILL HAVE IMPACT FOR JOBS LIKE FAST FOOD AND AIRPORT WORKERS ALL ACROSS THE SERVICE SECTOR IN THE U.S. THAT IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING IN HOW WE WILL IMAGINE GROWING THE ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE. SO UNDERPAID NURSING HOME WORKERS, LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO SPEAK LATER, WILL GET THE PPE THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO JOIN IN A UNION AND BARGAIN WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE PROTECTED ON THE JOB. AIRPORT WORKERS AND FAST FOOD WORKERS LIKE CHRIS WILL GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO BARGAIN A BETTER LIFE WITH THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS THAT ARE EARNING RECORD PROFITS, BUT PAYING POVERTY WAGES TO THEIR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I JUST THINK WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ELECTING CHAMPIONS WE WILL NEED TO STAY IN THE STREETS AND CONTINUE TO PRESS OUR MOVEMENT TO MAKE THE BOLDEST CHANGE POSSIBLE IN THIS ECONOMY. ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE ALL IN TO ELECT CANDIDATES LIKE BIDEN AND HARRIS. WE ARE NOT STOPPING UNTIL WE WIN 15 IN A UNION FOR THE 64 MILLION WORKERS ACROSS THE U.S. THAT DESERVE AN EQUAL SHOT AT A BETTER LIFE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A CHAMPION IN THIS MOVEMENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU WHEN YOUR 2 MILLION MEMBERS, WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT WORKERS IN AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY AFTER THE SELECTION , ONCE DEMOCRATS CONTROLLED THE SENATE AND WHITE HOUSE. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY TO PROTECT WORKING PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU DO. IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE AN AWARD-WINNING ORGANIZER AND AUTHOR AND A LEADING VOICE IN THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT. SHE HOLDS MANY TITLES AND IS JOINING US AS THE SENIOR ADVISOR OF CARE IN ACTION. SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE AGE OF DIGNITY, PUSHING FOR THE CHANGE IN AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR SANDERS, FOR HOSTING THIS IMPORTANT EVENT. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR VOICE AND LEADERSHIP ON BEHALF OF WORKERS. WE ORGANIZE SO WOMEN OF COLOR CAN BE POWERFUL IN POLITICS AND WE FIGHT FOR POLICIES THAT LIFT UP OUR NATION. MOSTLY BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN THAT WORKS IN OUR HOMES AS NANNIES, HOUSECLEANERS, AND TO ALL THE DOMESTIC WORKERS AND CAREGIVERS THAT MAY BE WATCHING TONIGHT, WE SEE YOU AND WE HONOR THE ESSENTIAL WORK YOU DO TO CARE FOR THE FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING YOUR OWN. BEFORE THERE WAS A PANDEMIC, THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF LOW-WAGE WORK IN AMERICA. MILLIONS OF WORKERS WORKED HARD AND COULD NOT PAY THE BILLS, AS THE SENATOR SAID. HOME CARE WORKERS LIKE SUSIE ARE DOING WORK THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL AND YET MOST EARNED POVERTY WAGES WITHOUT JOB SECURITY OR ACCESS TO A SAFETY NET. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOCK UP ON GROCERIES OR TAKE A SICK DAY BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER DO THOSE THINGS. 82% OF DOMESTIC WORKERS DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE PAID SICK DAY. 90% LOSS THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN MARCH. THOSE THAT CONTINUE TO WORK AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS DID SO WITHOUT PPE, HAZARD PAY, WITHOUT ACCESS TO TESTING OR TREATMENT AND MANY LOST THEIR LIVES. THAT IS WHY WE ARE FIGHTING AND ORGANIZING AS IF OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. BECAUSE THEY DO. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ONGOING, DRAWNOUT, FULL-BLOWN DEPRESSION FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS AND ALL KINDS OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS AND A VERY DIFFERENT PATH. IMAGINE A FUTURE OF WORK WHERE OUR VOICES ARE HEARD AND OUR WORK IS VALUED. WHERE WE CAN TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE DO AND OFFER CHILDREN OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OUR HEALTH AND THE PEOPLE WE LOVE AND HAVE THE TIME TO SHARE IN THE MOMENTS OF LIFE THAT REALLY MATTER. THIS IS ALL POSSIBLE IN AMERICA. BEGINNING WITH RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, WINNING A BILL OF RIGHTS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS, AND A CARE THAT SUPPORTS CHILDCARE AND PAID LEAVE FOR ALL WORKERS. THE WORKERS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE READY. THE PEOPLE ARE ON OUR SIDE. THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED TO EVERYONE HOW LOW-WAGE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL, HOW ESSENTIAL THEY ARE TO OUR SAFETY, OUR HEALTH, AND OUR WELL-BEING, AND WITH ALL OF YOU, WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT FOR WORKING PEOPLE LIKE THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN. WE ARE GOING TO VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WHEN WORKERS ORGANIZE, WE CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE AND WE ARE DOING IT NOW. SEN SANDERS: WELL SAID. THANK YOU. FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK YOU DO REPRESENTING SOME OF THE MOST DEPRESSED AND EXPLOITED WORKERS , OH PRESSED , OPRESSED AND EXPLOITED WORKERS IN OUR COUNTRY. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS WITH THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT DAY OF ACTION. AN ATTORNEY WHO ADVOCATES FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IMPROVING WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. HOW BADLY THAT I DO YOUR LAST NAME? THANK YOU, SENATOR SANDERS. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU AND THE WORKER ACTIVISTS TONIGHT. I WORK ON MINIMUM WAGE AND HOUR FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE, IT HAS BEEN $7.25 AN HOUR FOR THE LONGEST STRETCH IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE IT WAS FIRST ADOPTED IN 1938. IT HAS BEEN FROZEN. THE OTHER SIDE IS THE OTHER SIDE IS , MEANWHILE THE BOTTOM HALF OF US OWN JUST 1%. AS YOU MENTIONED, SENATOR, NEARLY HALF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE ZERO SAVINGS TO FALL BACK ON. LITERALLY ZERO. SHOCKING. EIGHT YEARS AGO, FAST FOOD WORKERS IN NEW YORK CITY WENT ON STRIKE. THEY WALKED OUT AND DEMANDED $15 AN HOUR. THEY WERE DISMISSED IF PEOPLE REMEMBER BY PUNDITS. THEY WERE TOLD THEIR DEMAND WAS PIE IN THE SKY AND IT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. SO WHERE ARE WE NOW EIGHT YEARS LATER? SEVEN STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR. STATES WITH BIG POPULATIONS. CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT, ILLINOIS, MARYLAND. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? RIGHT NOW, ONE THIRD OF WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE COVERED BY A LAW THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE $15 AN HOUR. THIS MOVEMENT HAS RAISED THE WAGE FOR ONE THIRD OF THIS COUNTRY'S WORKFORCE. EVEN MORE, STATES AND CITIES HAVE PASSED MINIMUM WAGE LAWS JUST THIS YEAR. 24 STATES AND 48 CITIES RAISE THEIR MINIMUM WAGES, THE MOST EVER. THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE WE DEMANDED IT. WORKERS STOOD UP, OFTEN FACING REPERCUSSIONS. AND IN THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS MOST OF US HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED . WE NEED A LIVING WAGE FOR EVERYONE. WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FOLLOW THESE STATES AND CITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION , LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. NOBODY THINKS , I INTRODUCED THE MINIMUM WAGE BILL IN THE SENATE AND IF DEMOCRATS GAIN CONTROL OF THAT SENATE, THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DO. HOW MANY YEARS SHOULD IT TAKE IN YOUR JUDGMENT FOR US TO GO FROM $7.25 TO $15? THE DEMAND FOR $15 AN HOUR WAS RAISED YEARS AGO. THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP. THE REASON WE HAVE SO MUCH GROUND TO CATCH UP ON IS BECAUSE OUR MINIMUM WAGE HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR SO LONG. SO I WOULD JUST SAY, I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER IN MIND RIGHT NOW, I WOULD SAY IT SHOULD BE , WE HAVE A LOT OF GROUND TO MAKE IT VERY QUICKLY. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND LET ME REPEAT. WORKERS IN NEW YORK CITY, VERY BRAVE PEOPLE MARCHING, THAT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS FIVE YEARS AGO, SINCE THAT POINT, INFLATION HAS TAKEN PLACE. IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE THAT $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM-WAGE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU AND THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT PROJECT ACTION DO. OUR NEXT GUEST IS A CNA WHO HAS WORKED FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. HE LIVES AND WORKS IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA. DURING THE PANDEMIC HE HAS FOUGHT FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND RESIDENTS AT HIS NURSING HOME. HE IS A DELEGATE OF HIS LOCAL SEIU HEALTH CARE PENNSYLVANIA. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS EVENING, GREAT TO BE JOINING ALONGSIDE YOU WITH YOUR FIGHT TO ENSURE BENEFITS FOR EVERYONE AND EQUAL PAY. THIS INCIDENT, THIS PANDEMIC, HAS BEEN LIKE THE GREAT EQUALIZER ESPECIALLY WITHIN MY LINE OF WORK. WE HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION IN NURSING HOMES. WE HAVE FOUGHT TO GUARANTEE PAID SICK TIME, JOB SECURITY, WHEN PEOPLE LEFT FOR BEING SICK, SEIU ALSO PROVIDED PPE AS WELL AS PROTECTION FOR THE HAZARD PAY THAT SO MANY OF US DESPERATELY NEEDED. OUR RESIDENTS WENT THROUGH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. THIS IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING I EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ON TOP OF LOSING RESIDENTS. MY MOTHER ALSO CONTRACTED COVID-19, BECAME VERY ILL, HAD TO BE VENTILATED, NOW HAS RETURNED TO GOOD HEALTH. I SAW IN MY SHOP THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE NONMEDICAL, MEANING NOT NURSING ASSISTANCE, ALL ON THEIR NORMALCY TO MAKE SURE THE FACILITY WAS PROPERLY CLEANED. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MAKING AFFORDABLE WAGES. I AM VERY LUCKY. I HAVE WORKED AS LONG AS I HAVE, I HAVE BEEN PAID PRETTY WELL. PEOPLE THAT WORK UNDER ME, THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS SUCH AS THE HOUSEKEEPING, WE HAD HOUSEKEEPERS THAT WENT FOR TWO MONTHS WITH NO WEEKENDS OFF. THEY JUST WORK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO. IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO JOIN THEM AND TO FIGHT FOR THEM. I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THE FIGHT FOR HAVING EVERYONE BEING ABLE TO JOIN A UNION FOR THE BENEFITS NOT JUST FOR THE WAGE INCREASES, BUT THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I KNOW THERE ARE HEALTH-CARE WORKERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO SEE DOCTORS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FIGHT. THANK YOU NOT ONLY FOR THE WORK YOU AND YOUR COWORKERS TO, BUT I THINK IT SHOULD MAKE US RETHINK WHAT WE CALL CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT WORK IN AMERICA. I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING OF WORK THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT. AND IN THIS MOMENT, MORE DANGEROUS, THEN WORKERS IN A NURSING HOME WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO DEAL WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE FRIGHTENED, PROVIDING THEM THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AS A NATION, WE HAVE GOT TO RETHINK HOW WE COMPENSATE, YOU HAVE HEDGE FUND GUYS UP THERE WHO DO NOTHING BUT SPECULATE AND GAMBLE, AND THEY MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WORKERS WHO ARE PROVIDING CARE TO VERY FRAGILE PEOPLE MAKE STARVATION WAGES. THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR COWORKERS ARE DOING IS A NORMAL SLEEVE IMPORTANT. , ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. AS A NATION WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF RETHINKING ABOUT HOW WE COMPENSATE IN AMERICA. THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE CHRIS, A SHIFT MANAGER AT MCDONALD'S. HE HAS WORKED THERE THREE YEARS, HE HAS BEEN A MANAGER FOR ABOUT A YEAR EARNING $11.15 AN HOUR. CHRIS, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD EVENING, AND THANK YOU, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. I AM A LEADER WITH THE UNION. I AM ORIGINALLY FROM ELSEWHERE. I CAME HERE FOR AN EDUCATION AND A BETTER LIFE. I MOVED FROM MY HOMETOWN IN COLUMBIA IN 2009 WITH MY FATHER AND MY YOUNGER SISTER. AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC, MY FAMILIES LIFE HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. MY FATHER WAS LAID OFF FROM HIS JOB IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY BUT WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND A JOB IN CONSTRUCTION. MY SISTER HAS A COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM AND TERRIFIED OF GETTING SICK. MY SISTER IS IN THE NINTH GRADE AND HAS STARTED ONLINE SCHOOLING. SHE STRUGGLES WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS ONLINE CLASSES. AND WORRIES ABOUT FALLING BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. I HAVE BEEN WITH MCDONALD'S FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AS A SHIFT MANAGER, I MAKE JUST $11.15 AN HOUR. EVEN WORKING FULL-TIME AS A MANAGER I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE. THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE AT MY STORE WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19. MCDONALD'S SHOULD HAVE INFORMED EMPLOYEES ABOUT POSITIVE CASES BUT MOST OF THE STAFF OF ONLY BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE FIRST CASE. I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT MCDONALD'S HAS CLOSED THE STORE TO DEEP CLEAN AFTER ANY OF THE CASES. CUSTOMERS ARE STILL ALLOWED TO ENTER THE STORE WITHOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING PUTTING STAFF AT RISK. MCDONALD'S HAS NOT TAKEN WORKERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY SERIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC AREA , PANDEMIC. THIS IS THE TYPICAL LIFE FOR MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS ACROSS FLORIDA, BARELY ABLE TO MAKE RENT. MY FAMILY HAS THREE INCOMES ALL OVER $12 PER HOUR AND WE ALL STRUGGLE. WE ARE AFRAID AND WE ARE ANGRY. WE ARE RISKING OUR LIVES EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE, FOOD, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES, BUT WE STILL DO NOT HAVE NECESSARY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, SUFFICIENT PAID SICK LEAVE. MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE ARE BEING LAID OFF AND FAMILIES ARE BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED DURING THIS CRISIS. ESSENTIAL WORKERS YOU SEE HERE TODAY, THOUGH OUR STORIES MAY NOT BE THE SAME, ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON IS WE CANNOT SURVIVE ON LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR. SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR OUR FAMILIES, AND A CHANCE AT LIFE IN A BETTER FUTURE. THE BEST WAY WE CAN MAKE THAT A REALITY IS BY COMING TOGETHER AND VOTING YES ON AMENDMENT TO. TO GRADUALLY RAISE WAGES IN FLORIDA. AMENDMENT TWO RAISES FLORIDA'S MINIMUM WAGE FROM $8.56 PER HOUR TO $10 PER HOUR IN 2021, INCREASING BY ONE DOLLAR PER HOUR EACH YEAR UNTIL $15 PER HOUR IS PHASED IN DURING 2026. WE CAN WIN HIGHER WAGES AND IMMIGRANTS LIKE ME WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SELECTION. VOTING FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS THIS ELECTION MAKES THIS ELECTION THE MOST IMPORTANT IN MY LIFETIME. I AM VOTING YES ON AMENDMENT TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. WORKERS AT MCDONALD'S AND OTHER FAST FOOD PLACES HAVE HELPED FEED , THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK YOU AND OTHER FAST FOOD WORKERS HAVE DONE IN STANDING UP IN THE FIGHT FOR $15. THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. EIGHT STATES HAVE PASSED A $15 PER HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. IF WE GAIN CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE, ONE OF THE FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS WILL BE PASSING A $15 PER HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. WORKERS IN AMERICA CANNOT MAKE IT ON $11 PER HOUR. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS SUSIE RIVERA. SUSIE IS A CAREGIVER IN TEXAS AND HAS BEEN A CAREGIVER FOR OVER 30 YEARS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, SHE HAD TO WORK ABOUT 110 HOURS A WEEK. SHE IS THE MAIN PROVIDER FOR HER HOUSEHOLD OF FIVE PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT. THANK YOU. IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE, SENATOR SANDERS AREA , SENATOR SANDERS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I AM A WORKER LEADER FOR THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC WORKERS ALLIANCE. I LIVE IN TEXAS OR HAVE BEEN A HOME CARE WORKER FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED I WAS WORKING OVER 110 HOURS LIKE MR. SANDERS SAID A WEEK. ALSO, NOW THAT THE PANDEMIC HIT US, I AM WORKING 80 HOURS A WEEK. I LOVE TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE. I HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME FOR ALL OF MY PEERS. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF WORKING THE WAY I WORK. I CURRENTLY MAKE $15 PER HOUR AND THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD, BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND PEERS DO NOT GET THAT PAY THE SAME RATE AND UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT I KNOW THEY DESERVE MORE PAY . THE FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL THE PANDEMIC IS WEIGHING ON ME VERY HEAVILY AND MY WIFE IS IMMUNOCOMPROMISED AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN GO OUT TO WORK. AS A CARE WORKER, I AM AN ESSENTIAL WORKER AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL WORKER. ALL DOMESTIC WORKERS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL AND THEY WILL BE. WE ARE ESSENTIAL PEOPLE. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE WERE ESSENTIAL. OUR WORK MAKES ALL OF THEIR WORK POSSIBLE. , OTHER WORK POSSIBLE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF WORKING OUT OF OUR HOMES LIKE SOME PEOPLE HAVE. WE JUST CANNOT DO THAT. WE NEED A DOMESTIC WORKERS TO BE PAID. WE ARE RISKING OUR LIVES BY WORKING DURING THIS CRISIS, BUT OUR SURVIVAL , WE HAVE TO WORK TO GET PAID TO PUT BREAD ON THE TABLE. OUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT. BUT NOW, NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AND VOTE FOR A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT CARES ABOUT US. IN THIS ELECTION, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR BETTER WAGES AND A STRONGER CARE SYSTEM, MORE UNITY. I AM 63 YEARS OLD AND THIS IS MY VERY FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT I'M VOTING IN. I AM VOTING BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE TO STEP IN. WE ALL HAVE TO STEP IN AND FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE , I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE GREAT , AMERICA CHANGE AGAIN. WE CAN DO IT JUST BY VOTING. NOW IS A TIME TO VOTE AND I URGE EVERYBODY, VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT BECAUSE IT DOES. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH DIFFERENT TIMES AND LIKE I SAID, 63 YEARS OLD, I'M VOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE THERE IS A NEED. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO STEP UP AND DO THEIR PART. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE AND FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GET INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND TO GET YOUR FRIENDS AND COWORKERS INVOLVED. IT GIVES ME A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE CHRISSY FROM IOWA, WHO HAS WORKED IN RESTAURANTS FOR 15 YEARS, CURRENTLY A SERVER IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FAILED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. I STARTED WORKING AS A SERVER WHEN I WAS 15 IN IOWA. AT THAT TIME, THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS $4.35 AN HOUR. AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THE MINIMUM TIP TO WAGE IS STILL $4.35 AN HOUR. 15 YEARS. THAT IS HALF OF MY LIFE. THERE HAS BEEN NO WAGE INCREASE. IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT THE LIVING WAGE OR THE THE WAGES PEOPLE MAKE ARE THE SAME, I WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOU. NOW I WORK IN VEGAS AS A SERVER. THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE IN MY CITY FACE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN ESCALATED SINCE MARCH. I MYSELF DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE. I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A LIFELONG MEDICAL CONDITION THAT REQUIRES MONTHLY EDUCATION THAT I PAY FOR OUT OF , MEDICATION THAT I PAY FOR OUT-OF-POCKET. I AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING INJURIES AND PAINS THAT I HAVE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IF I SEE A DOCTOR, IT COULD PUT ME INTO DEBT I CANNOT COME OUT OF. I CANNOT AFFORD ANYTHING THAT SHOULD BE A NECESSITY. I CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE, I CANNOT AFFORD TUITION. THE PRICE OF RENT IS GOING UP. MY STORY IS NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANYONE ELSE'S HERE. MY STORY IS THE SAME. I HAVE COWORKERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD INSULIN AND GO WITHOUT THEIR SHOT. I KNOW SINGLE MOTHERS WITH KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR ANYONE IN THEIR FAMILY AND THE BEST THEY CAN DO IS PRAY THAT NOTHING BAD HAPPENS TO ANYONE. THE SITUATION IS ONLY GETTING WORSE. 25% OF THE CITY IS UNEMPLOYED. WE SPECIALIZE IN HOSPITALITY AND DURING A PANDEMIC, THERE IS NO JOB OPPORTUNITIES. 100,000 PEOPLE ARE FACING EVICTIONS IN DECEMBER. WITH MASS LAYOFFS AND BUSINESSES CLOSING, EMPLOYERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THEY ARE NOW OFFERING NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR, THE MINIMUM WAGE HERE, BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THAT ONE POSITION AND THAT THEY ARE DESPERATE TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. AMIDST THE PANDEMIC, THE RENT IS INCREASING. IN FEBRUARY, THE AVERAGE COST OF A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY WAS $1100. AT NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR, THAT IS THREE FOURTHS OF YOUR PAYCHECK. WHO CAN SURVIVE ON THAT? YOU CANNOT SURVIVE ON THREE FOURTHS OF YOUR PAYCHECK GOING TO RENT. THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THEY ARE RAISING RENT. THEY ARE RAISING RENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. PEOPLE COME TO VEGAS TO HAVE ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCES, BUT THEY FAILED TO EXPERIENCE , TO REALIZE PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR LIVES HERE. WE ARE SURROUNDED BY CASINOS THAT HAVE EXCESSIVE WEALTH AND THEY OFFER THINGS TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT IS SUCH AN EXPERIENCE, BUT WORKING IN ONE FOR NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR IS NOT ENOUGH TO AFFORD AN ENTREE IN THESE ESTABLISHMENTS. YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO HEAR WHERE YOU WORK. , EAT WHERE YOU WORK. IT IS TIME THAT WE SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THIS CITY. THEY WORK HARD. THEY DESERVE TO NOT JUST MAKE PROFITS FOR PEOPLE IN CONTROL OF THE CASINOS. WE DESERVE A WORKING WAGE AND HEALTH CARE AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH WORKING WITH DIGNITY. I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. EVERY OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHERE PEOPLE WORK. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO YOU AND YOUR COWORKERS IF EVERYBODY HAD HEALTH CARE? YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR WHENEVER YOU WANT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT YOUR CREDIT CARD. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN? IT WOULD MEAN FREEDOM. IT WOULD MEAN FREEDOM BECAUSE YOU ARE FREE FROM YOUR WORRY OF STRESSING ABOUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. IT WOULD BE FREEDOM FOR, LIKE , NUMEROUS TIMES I HAVE INJURED MYSELF AND I AM TERRIFIED I COULD DO DAMAGE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND BY NOT SEEING A DOCTOR I'M MAKING IT WORSE, BUT MY BEST OPTION RIGHT NOW IS TO TAKE IBUPROFEN AND ICE IT. IT MEANS THERE IS JOB SECURITY. YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR JOB AND THAT IS NOT TIED TO YOUR HEALTH CARE. IF I DO GET HEALTH CARE I WOULD BE TERRIFIED TO LEAVE IT EVEN IF MY EMPLOYERS TREATED ME BADLY. IT IS ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES THAT OFFERS IT. IF I COULD INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN. WHEN YOU AS A HUMAN BEING AS A WORKER ARE GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE, IT DOES MEAN FREEDOM. NOT ONLY FROM THE STRESS ABOUT HOW YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR A BILL, YOU CAN LEAVE THAT JOB IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT. YOU ARE GUARANTEED HEALTH INSURANCE. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TODAY WHO ARE STUCK IN JOBS THEY DO NOT LIKE, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. THEY ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DECENT HEALTH CARE PLAN. THAT IS WHY WE ARE FIGHTING TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY DOES . GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD, AS A HUMAN RIGHT. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE STORY YOU HAVE TOLD US REFLECTS WHAT MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE IN STANDING UP AND FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA. LET'S GO BACK TO YOU AND ASK A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION. YOU TOUCHED ON THIS IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. EVERY DAY EVERYBODY HEARS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. PUTTING TRUMP ASIDE FOR THE MOMENT. WHAT DOES THE SELECTION MEAN FOR WORKING PEOPLE? WHAT DOES THIS ELECTION MEAN FOR WORKING PEOPLE? I THINK WE JUST HEARD IT BROKEN DOWN FOR US. IT MEANS WORKERS SHOULD EARN $15 AN HOUR AND YOUR LEADERSHIP TOGETHER WITH EVERYBODY IN THIS IS GOING TO PUSH THAT AND MAKE THAT A NATIONAL STANDARD. IT MEANS WE NEED TO CREATE GOOD JOBS WHERE WOMEN'S WORK WILL BE VALUED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE NATION WAS BORN. SHE SAID IF WE VALUE CARE FOR ELDERS AND CHILDCARE, IT MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE'S JOB POSSIBLE WITH PEACE OF MIND WHEN OUR ELDERS ARE CARED FOR SAFELY AT HOME AND WHEN OUR CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY CARE, AND THOSE PROVIDERS LIKE SUSIE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK 110 HOURS A WEEK TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE JOB AND A LIVING WAGE AND A SECURE BENEFIT TO CARE FOR PEOPLE THE WAY SHE DOES EVERY DAY. IT MEANS THAT WE CAN JOIN TOGETHER AS A NATION AND REWRITE THE RULES OF ALL THE THINGS THAT SEPARATE US BASED ON RACE AND GENDER AND KNOCK ALL THOSE BARRIERS DOWN SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT , THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES AN EQUAL SHOT AND A SECURE FUTURE AND A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. I THINK THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. JUST LIKE THE FIGHT FOR $15, UNION LEADERS DID NOT CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAID WHEN THEY MADE THAT DEMAND. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE IMAGINE THE BEST FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF US ONCE AND FOR ALL IN THIS NATION. I THINK IT IS A TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT FOR WORKING PEOPLE, OUR FAMILIES, AND FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THIS NATION. AND IT IS OURS TO SEIZE. WE HAVE TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT AND REQUIRE GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US AND OUR FAMILIES. WELL SAID AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU DO. LET ME PICK UP AND CLOSE THE PROGRAM BY THANKING ALL OF OUR GREAT PANELISTS. I'M SURE PEOPLE WATCHING CAN UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT EASY FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT A POLITICIAN , NOT A PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER, TO GET IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THAT IS NOT EASY. SO I APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING SUCH IMPORTANT WORK FOR WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY. I WANT TO PICK UP ON A POINT THAT MARY KAY MADE. WHEN I SPEAK, I QUOTE NELSON MANDELA OFTEN. NELSON MANDELA SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS VERY PROFOUND AND TIMELY. HE SAID AND I QUOTE, EVERYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL IT IS DONE. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR DECENT WAGES, WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, A FIGHT TO MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE OR HAVE HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE OR THAT WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, THEY SAY, THAT'S NOT REALISTIC. WHAT IS REALISTIC IS THAT A HANDFUL OF BILLIONAIRES HAVE MORE THAN THE BOTTOM HALF OF AMERICA. THAT HALF A MILLION AMERICANS ARE HOMELESS. WHAT'S REALISTIC IS HALF HOUR PEOPLE ARE PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK. STARVATION WAGES. THAT IS REALISTIC. WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THAT MINDSET. THIS IS THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK 30 YEARS TO MAKE $15 AN HOUR. NOT TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED OR TO TRY TO SURVIVE ON $11 AN HOUR. THE GOAL HERE IS TO WIN THIS ELECTION AND THEN TO BUILD A KIND OF POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE STAND UP FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND NOT JUST FOR BIG MONEY INTERESTS. WHEN WE DO THAT THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH. ALL THE GOALS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE, UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE, THEY ARE NOT DESPITE WHAT TRUMP AND HIS FRIENDS WILL TELL YOU, THESE ARE NOT RADICAL IDEAS. THEY EXIST ALL OVER THE WORLD. I AM 50 MILES AWAY TONIGHT FROM CANADA. EVERYBODY IN CANADA CAN GO TENNEY HOSPITAL THEY WANT, ANY DOCTOR THEY WANT. THE QUALITY OF CARE IS AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS. HUMAN DIGNITY. WE HAVE FIVE DAYS LEFT TO GO IN THIS CAMPAIGN. PLEASE BRING OUT YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COWORKERS. LET'S GET OUT AND VOTE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY CLOSE ELECTION. YOU CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE AND DO IT. MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. LET US WIN THIS ELECTION FOR ALL OF US AND THEN LET US COME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE AN ECONOMY AND A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE PEOPLE ON TOP. LET ME THINK ALL OF THE PANELISTS. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. LET ME THINK KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING WITH US. LET'S GO VOTE, WIN THE ELECTION, TRANS FROM THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU. , TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477508-1\/senators-harris-bernie-sanders-virtual-rally-joe-biden","Summary":"2020 vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke at a virtual town hall discussion hosted by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

SHE MADE SEVERAL STOPS IN TEXAS ON THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTING. THE PRESIDENT WENT TEXAS BY MORE THAN NINE POINTS LAST ELECTION. HE HAS A SMALLER LEAD HEADING INTO THE FINAL WEEKEND BEFORE ELECTION DAY. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN HARRIS COUNTY. [LAUGHTER] IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN HOUSTON. THERE ARE SO MANY LONG-STANDING FRIENDS. SO MANY LONG-STANDING FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO HOLD IT DOWN, TO HOLD IT UP, AND TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO. AND I AM HERE IN TEXAS, I HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY TODAY. TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THESE MONTHS, OVER THESE WEEKS, OVER THESE DAYS. TODAY, COURSE, IS THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTING. AND NOW WE ARE FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] AND WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE. BEFORE I CONTINUE, I WANT TO THANK TINA KNOWLES FOR THAT INCREDIBLE INTRODUCTION. TINA, YOU ARE AMAZING! YOU ARE AMAZING. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE COURAGE TO STEP UP, AND SPEAK OUT, AND LEAD. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT. SO HERE WE ARE. WITHIN OUR POWER, AND IN OUR HANDS, THROUGH OUR VOICE, THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR VOTE, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. KNOWING WE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING. AND THAT WE, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR IT. AND FIGHT FOR ITS IDEALS. THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE US. AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH A LOT. THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR CRISES IMPACTING US NOW IS A COUNTRY, ALL CONVERGING AT THE SAME TIME. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, A PANDEMIC. BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS VIRUS, COVID-19. WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO THE POINT THAT OVER 220,000 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY, COULD NOT EVEN BE WITH RELATIVES AND FRIENDS, HOLDING THEIR HAND, SPEAKING TO THEM IN PERSON, IN THEIR LAST HOURS HOURS ON EARTH. 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THIS VIRUS, WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE BY MOST DOCTORS' ACCOUNTS, LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS, THAT INCLUDE POTENTIALLY THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING. THIS IS, HOUSTON, ONE OF THE GREATEST MASS CASUALTY EVENTS WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN OUR COUNTRY. PROBABLY ONLY AT THE SAME PROPORTION AS WORLD WAR II. AND WE HAVE WITNESSED GREATEST FAILURE OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THIS. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE NOTE THAT BACK ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT WOULD BE. HE WAS INFORMED. THAT IT IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS INFORMED. THAT WOULD HURT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS INFORMED THAT IT AIRBORNE. AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE SAT ON IT. HE COVERED IT UP. HE DID NOT SHARE IT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE, WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, AS A PARENT? AS A TEACHER? AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER? IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28, WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28TH? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO LIMIT THE HARM? EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, LET'S BE CLEAR, ON THIS ISSUE, WE KNOW THAT FOLKS WERE NOT DOING SO WELL BEFORE. WE KNOW THAT BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS HAD TO WORK TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. [APPLAUSE] EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, WE KNEW THAT FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS, FAMILIES HAD LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? WHAT TEACHERS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE THEIR STUDENTS? SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOW MISSING SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL PHASES OF THEIR EDUCATION. WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE TO, FRANKLY, JUST BUY A COUPLE OF EXTRA ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER. BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION. HE COVERED IT UP. HE CALLED IT A HOAX. HE SAID YOU'RE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WHERE A MASK AND YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, THAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WITH HIS BOY, BILL BARR, ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SUING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BROUGHT TO US BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT AND COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [CHEERS] RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOUR RELATIVE HAS LUPUS. RAISE HER HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS BREAST CANCER AND IS SURVEY BEING , AND IS SURVIVING. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAUGHT COVID? THE MAN IS IN COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PROTECTION OR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? HERE IN TEXAS, 10 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [CHEERS] SO THERE IS A REAL CHOICE AND THE SELECTION ON THIS POINT. BECAUSE, EASY SEE, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO IS SAYING WE NEED TO EXPAND OBAMACARE. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PROTECTIONS FOR FOLKS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE NEED TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE WILL LOWER THE COST OF PREMIUMS. WE WILL BRING DOWN THE AGE OF MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO 60. WE UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE THE BODY DOES NOT JUST START FROM THE NECK DOWN, IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. [CHEERS] JOE UNDERSTANDS THESE ISSUES. THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS ARE DESCRIBING THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 AS BEING HUNGRY IN AMERICA. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS. PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. HERE IN TEXAS, ONE IN 10 HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY AS HUNGRY. 1 IN 6 HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING AN INABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. IN TEXAS, 1 IN 4 SMALL BUSINESSES IS DESCRIBING HAVING TO SHUT DOWN WITH CONCERNS THEY MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO REOPEN. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE A JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING, THEN TELL ME HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? JOE BIDEN SAYS LET'S GET $150 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE THAT MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. AND WE WILL CUT MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. JOE BIDEN SAYS YOUR FIRST TIME HOMEOWNER WILL GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS, BECAUSE WE KNOW HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS ANY AMERICAN FAMILY ACCUMULATES WEALTH. JOE BIDEN SAYS IF YOU ARE A STUDENT THAT WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE COMING FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR, YOU WILL GO TO A FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGE FOR FREE, INCLUDING AN HBCU AND PRIVATE HBCU. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ASKS, WELL HOW ARE RICH PEOPLE DOING? HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? TO THE POINT THAT ONE OF HIS FIRST, IN HIS MIND, SIGNATURE INITIATIVES, WAS TO CREATE A TAX CUT FOR THE TOP 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, WHICH WILL CAUSE US TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. WELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF WE WIN THIS ELECTION, JOE BIDEN AND I ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. WE ARE ABOUT TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN BUILD BACK OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES. WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY THAT NO WORKING FAMILY SHOULD PAY MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. WE ARE ABOUT TO PUT IN PLACE A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES, KNOWING THAT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GROWING BACK UP AMERICA'S ECONOMY, INVEST IN WORKERS, INVEST IN FAMILIES AND ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF MANY CRISES. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO, BEING A STUDENT OF AMERICA'S HISTORY, HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK THE PHRASE BLACK LIVES MATTER. GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY IS HERE TONIGHT. GEORGE FLOYD'S LIFE MATTERED. THOSE EIGHT MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS. SO JOE HAS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING TAKING PLACE. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, KNOWING THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CONTRACT COVID AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM IT, KNOWING THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDBIRTH THAN OTHER PEOPLE, KNOWING ARE NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE THE RECORDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS. WE NEED TO END CASH BAIL. BY THE WAY, IT IS AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE AS MUCH AS IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO REFORM POLICING TO THE POINT WE ALL AGREE EVERYONE SHOULD FACE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY BREAK THE LAW. JOE SAYS WE WILL HAVE A SYSTEM THAT BANS CHOKEHOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS. BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD MIGHT BE ALIVE TODAY IF THAT WERE THE CASE. WE WILL HAVE A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE LAW. WHY? BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT SOMEONE CAN GET FIRED ONE PLACE FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AND MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND GET HIRED. JOE HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT THIS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO STOOD ON A STAGE IN FRONT OF 70 MILLION AMERICAN PEOPLE AT A DEBATE AND REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS. AND THEN DOUBLE BACK AND STAND BY. HERE IS THE THING, HOUSTON, IT IS A PATTERN. LET'S NOT FORGET HE CAME TO FAME AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT BY QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE THERE WERE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AT A PROTEST WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN DIED, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, SPEWING RACIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC SLURS. WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. A PRESIDENT WHO CALLED MEXICANS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. A PRESIDENT WHO CAME INTO OFFICE AND ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS PUT INTO PLACE A MUSLIM BAN. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS, AND WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO REFLECTS WHO WE REALLY ARE. A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS WITHIN THE BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE, WHEREVER YOU LIVE, WHATEVER YOUR RACE, WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO SEES THAT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND ENDS THIS CONTINUOUS THING THAT IS ABOUT TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION. WE NEED A JOE BIDEN WHO WANTS TO UNIFY US AS A NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CRISES, THERE IS A CLIMATE CRISIS. TEXAS KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Y'ALL KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THE WEST HAS BEEN BURNING. FROM CALIFORNIA TO OREGON TO COLORADO. I'VE MET WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED BECAUSE THEIR HOMES BURNED TO THE GROUND. I MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOME IS BURNING. IN FACT, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO NEIGHBORS OF TEXAS IN THE GULF STATES. WE ARE NOW ON THE FIFTH NAMED STORM THIS YEAR HITTING THE GULF STATES. YOU KNOW WHY YOU NAME A STORM? BECAUSE IT IS REALLY BAD. THIS ONE IS ZETA. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY ZETA SISTERS. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT IS A CRISIS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. IN THE MIDWEST, THE STORMS HAVE CAUSED FLOODING TO THE POINT THAT FARMERS HAVE LOST A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. JOE UNDERSTANDS THIS. JOE SAYS WE NEED TO EMBRACE THE SCIENCE. LET'S DEAL WITH THE FACT IT LITERALLY REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS A SPECIES. JOE KNOWS IF YOU DEAL WITH THIS IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND IN THE TECHNOLOGIES ABOUT SOLAR AND WIND POWER, TEXAS IS ONE OF THE LEADERS, THAT YOU ALSO INVEST IN JOBS, MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, JOBS THAT WILL BE THE FUNCTION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS FROM THE BUILDING TRADES, FROM THE CARPENTERS AND ELECTRICIANS. JOE KNOWS THAT. JOE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. JOE KNOWS THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE WHICH IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. ALL AREAS OF OUR COUNTRY WITH POOR AIR QUALITY, 70% OF THE OCCUPANTS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. JOE KNOWS, AND WE'VE MET WITH THE FOLKS IN FLINT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CRISIS. ON THE OTHER HAND , YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, WHEN INTERVIEWED BY A JOURNALIST ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA , THE JOURNALIST ASKED SOMETHING LIKE, THESE WILDFIRES ARE RAGING, THE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THIS AND THAT, THAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS CONTRIBUTING TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, RESPONDS TO THE QUESTION BY SAYING, SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SCIENCE DOES KNOW. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS SO MUCH THAT THE LEADING SCIENCE PUBLICATION HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THERE YOU GO. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING AS A NATION. THAT BRINGS ME TO THIS MOMENT, THE LAST DAY IN TEXAS FOR EARLY VOTING. GETTING PREPARED FOR THE ELECTION ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME LIKE THEY ASK ALL OF US. I AM SURE THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADERS AMONG THIS. PEOPLE SAY, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I THINK THERE ARE THREE REASONS PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE. ONE, TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. THIS YEAR WE LOST THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS, WHO IS NOW AMONG THE ANCESTORS, AND WHO, WHILE A HERO ON THIS EARTH, SHED BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. LET'S HONOR THE FACT THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. LET'S BE ACCURATE ABOUT HISTORY. BLACK WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE UNTIL 1965, AND WE CAN NOW. I HEARD THAT. LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING. YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LIST WE JUST DISCUSSED. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. JOE AND I WILL TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING, UNDERSTANDING OUR CHILDREN ARE IN THESE SCHOOLS AND NEED RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THEIR TALENT. WE WILL PUT $70 BILLION INTO HBCU'S BECAUSE AS A PROUD GRADUATE OF AN HBCU, I KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP. YOU KNOW. SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. IT IS AT STAKE THAT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 545 CHILDREN, WHO BECAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR PARENTS ARE BECAUSE OF A CHILD SEPARATION POLICY AT THE BORDER, WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHTS OFFENSE COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS AT STAKE IS CREATING A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, RENEWING A PROMISE TO OUR DREAMERS BY RENEWING DACA PROTECTIONS. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. THAT IS REASON NUMBER TWO TO VOTE. REASON NUMBER THREE. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN NORTH CAROLINA, , IN GEORGIA, IN FLORIDA, OHIO, YOU NAME IT. ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. ESPECIALLY AFTER 2013, WHEN THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE POLICIES AND LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. IN NORTH CAROLINA, IN FACT, THE COURT THAT REVIEWED THEIR LOSS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN WITH SURGICAL PRECISION TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE HAVE SEEN POLICIES AND LOSS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT HARD FOR FOLKS TO VOTE. YOU KNOW IN TEXAS THEY PULLED UP THE DROP BOXES. IN HARRIS COUNTY WITH 11 MILLION PEOPLE THERE IS ONE DROPBOX? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IN STATES WHERE, IF PEOPLE VOTE BY MAIL, YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BALLOT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND BE SURE TO PUT IT IN THE SECOND ENVELOPE AND SIGN THAT ENVELOPE OR GET SOMEBODY TO SIGN IT FOR YOU. THE PRESIDENT ON THE DEBATE STAGE, WHO OPENLY SOLICITED VOTER SUPPRESSION , AND NOT TO MENTION THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. I MEAN, THE POST OFFICE. RODNEY ELLIS, WHERE ARE YOU? THE POST OFFICE. LIKE THE NICEST PEOPLE WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE. THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. AND SO ALL OF THIS HAS TO LEAD US TO ASK THE QUESTION, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? AND I THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWER. THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER TO STAND UP AND EXERCISE OUR VOICE. THEY KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO LET'S NOT LET ANYONE , NOT THIS ELECTION OR EVER , TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET'S NOT LET ANYONE MAKE US FEEL CONCERN OR ANXIETY ABOUT WHETHER WE MATTER. LET'S NOT GIVE ANYBODY THAT POWER OVER US TO EVER MAKE US QUESTION WHETHER WE MATTER, WHETHER WE COUNT. WE HAVE THE POWER. WE WERE BORN WITH IT. THEY DID NOT GIVE IT TO US. IT IS OURS. SO WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO GET EVERYBODY OUT IN FOUR DAYS ON NOVEMBER 3, THAT TUESDAY, AND MAKE SURE ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING ALONE AND PEOPLE ARE WEARING A MASK SO YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEIR FULL FACE, YOU ARE FEELING ALONE. LET'S REMIND PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? AND WHAT I KNOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT, WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS ONE FRIDAY EVENING IN HOUSTON WITH KAMALA AND ALL THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE WILL TELL THEM TINA NO GRACED US WITH HER PRESENCE. WE WERE ORGANIZING FOLKS. WE WERE REMINDING THEM OF THE SACRIFICE OF OUR ANCESTORS. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE CALLED AND WE TEXTED AND EMAILED PEOPLE MULTIPLE TIMES UNTIL THEY GOT SICK OF US, BUT THEY GOT OVER IT. AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE ELECTED JOE BIDEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, HOUSTON. THANK YOU.

When I was just six years old and my mother, she had th ese flash cards with photos on one side, and she would u se them to teac h us English, even thou gh she herself cannot s peak it yet .

You know, doctors, we're talking about things like lung sca rring. It will, by t he way, at this point, most l ikely qualify as a pre exist ing conditi on, which mean s on top of the numbers that w e know the disproportiona te numbers in terms of African Amer icans and Latinos for high blood pressure an d diabetes were n ow looking at this. Let's look at the r acial disparities on this virus. A frican American s an d Latinos there three times as likely to contract the disea se and twice as likely to die from the tragedy o f the loss of human life. Yo u kno w, I've been re ferring to. Th is is on e of th e greatest ma ss casualty even ts that w e've ex perienced si nce Wor ld War Two. The tr agedy of it. And here's why I bri ng it up, guys. It didn't have to be th is bad. I t didn't h ave to be th is b ad. Just thin k about it. T hanks to a fellow by t he name of Bob Woodward, we kn ow that the preside nt of the United St ates was informed back on January 28th about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu was informed that it would hurt, people of every age was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of who people are, you're on one side of his ledger. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger. If as parent s as teache rs as small busin ess ow ners what you might ha ve done if o n Ja nuary 28th you had known what the president o f the United Sta tes said down what you m ight have done to prepare knowi ng that even b efore t his pandemic, far too many America ns were wo rking two and three jobs to try and pay the rent and put food on th e table. And by the way, and Jo e Biden and my America, nobody should work more than one jo b toe, have to put food on the table and pay th e rent. But wha t folks might hav e done to prep are knowing tha t most wor king families don 't have even $1000 i n savings what peopl e might have don e to prepare small business owners worke rs? Because, you see still, e ven before this pan demic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not mad e it a nationa l priority for wor king people to h ave paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden Harris administration, but what people to prepare teacher s and studen ts and pare nts ar ound the fact that their C hildren are gonna m is s so much of these critical days of t heir educat ion what people might hav e done to prep are to jus t simply by a couple of extr a rolls of t oilet paper. But th ey sat on this infor mation a nd they di dn't tell anybody. And now we are looking at a situati on where, in the midst of a p ublic healt h pan demic, you also hav e a situation wh ere we have a presi dent who, wh ile we're se eing spikes around our country, talk ing about we've turn ed the cor ner, continuing to misl ead the American people. So there are c lear choices in thi s el ection because on the o ne hand you h ave Joe Biden, who, toge ther with President Barack Obama, cre ated Obama care, whi ch brought health ca re to over 20 million p eople and prot ected peop le with preexisting con ditions and understood that he althcare and acc ess to he alth care should be a right and not j ust a privilege of those who can af ford i t. Joe Biden, w ho says we will expand o n the Affordabl e Care Act Obama car e. We will ex tend protection s. We will bring down the cost of pr escrip tion drugs. We wi ll bring down the cost of premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. We will expand health care understanding the b ody doe sn't just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up and we need to expand ment al health care. Cle ar choices be cause, you see, on the other ha nd, you have Donald Trump who, tog ether with his boy Bill Bar, are in the Unit ed Stat es Supreme C ourt right no w trying to su e to get rid of the A ffordable C ar e Act, w hich again brou ght health car e to so many peo ple here in T exas. We're look ing at 10 million Texans who have p re ex isting conditio ns . If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks wh o have the over 20 mil lion people are likely to lose their pr otections, an d w e now have almost 89 mil lion people w ho have new pre existing condi tions called Cove in. The re are clear choices in this elect io n because of this pandemic. The worsening off the wealth gap in America has b een such that over 30 million peop le in just t he l ast sever al months had to file for unemploymen t insurance. We are seeing number s that tell us one in fiv e mothers who has a c hild under the age of 12 is des cribing her Childr en is being hungry here in Texas. W e're looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eig ht househ olds is desc ribing their ho usehold is ha ving been hungry. We're in the mi ddle of a hun ger crisis in Amer ica. They're not covering it eno ugh . We're in the middl e of a hunger cris is. Here in Tex as, one in six households has describ ed not being able t o pay their rent or bein g concerned that they cann ot pay thei r rent next month. Her e in Texas, one in four small businesses h as gone out of bus iness. An d let's be cl ear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either own s a small bus iness or runs a small b usiness. We are looking at an econom ic devast ation that i s bein g compared to the Gr eat Depression, an d on the one hand y ou have Joe Biden who says, You wanna ask me about the economy and how it's d oi ng? Then you need to te ll me how wo rking people are doing how our fam ilies doing in America. Which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxe s ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a yea r lowering middle cl taxes, also makin g sure that no wor kin g family pays mor e than 7% of you r income in child ca re. Mak ing sure there's a $15,000 tax credi t for first time h ome buyers. Understanding that is the way that we have in tergenerat ional weal th in Amer ica is to allow people toe own a home. That's how Joe Biden thinks o f the eco nomy. On the ot her hand, you h ave Donald Trump wh o, when as ked, How's the ec onomy doing ? He will ask. W ell, how's the stock marke t d oing? He asks. How a re rich peopl e doing as one o f his fi rst orde rs of bus iness? He passed a tax c ode benefiting th e top 1% an d the biggest corporati ons in Americ a. Well, let me tell you , Joe Biden a nd I, if we w in about to ge t rid of th at and inve st that money in working pe ople in America, inve st that mone y in buildi ng back up our inf rastructure, ou r roads and our br idges and renewable energy, cr eating millions of jobs, investin g that money in makin g sure that o ur stu dents, coming from fami li es that make less t han $225 ,000 go th io Public universities tui tion free, incl uding HBC use, in cludin g private H BC use ensuring that our student s, when they gradu ate if they take o n a life of service and publi c service and a job that pays less than $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That's how we'll invest that money in the American people crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America, and there are clear choice. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase black lives matter. Hey, Joe Biden, who understands that we these racial disparities ? We ne ed to acknowledge th em. Difficult though they m ay be to think about much less tal k about. We need to address it in terms of what we're doing around health care. We need to address it in te rms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in ou r education syste m, Joe Biden sa ys. Let's de al with it b y putting $1 50 bi llion into low interes t loans for min ority businesses , black and brown busin esses, wh ich tend to be th e e conomic lifeblo od of the community, Joe Biden says Let's deal with i t in terms of a crimina l justice system that must be held ac countable for those di sparities. Let's get rid of mandatory mi nimums. Let us decr iminalized marijuana an d expunge the record o f the people who have been convicted for marijuana offe nses. Let's shut do wn the private pri sons. Let's get ri d of cash bail. Understanding. People are sitti ng in jail for weeks, mon ths and ye ars simply because th ey can't afford to get out, which ma kes it uneconomic justice issue as much as i t is a criminal j ustice issu e. And on the other hand, you have Don ald Trump, who, on a debate stage two debat es ago refused to condemn whi te supremacists and then doubl e down and said t hey shou ld stand back and stand by Donal d Trump beca use you've got to understand this is a pattern w ho, when ru nning for office and even before , had the gall thi o question and challenge the le gitimacy of Americ a's first blac k presiden t, the commander in chief of the United States , who, when asked ab out the tragedy in Cha rlottesville were peaceful. Protes ters wer e pro testi ng raci al injusti ce, and ah, young wo man was kille d. And then o n the other sid e there w ere neo Naz i s wearing swastikas car rying tiki torches, h urling r acial and a nti Semit ic epithets. The commander in chie f said there were fine people on both sides. A presiden t of the Un ited State s who has ca lled Mexicans rapists and criminals who, as his first order of business instituted a Musli m ban Americ a. We dese rve better that doe s not ref lect who we are as our v alues and pr iorities as a nation th at know s we are are str ongest when we ar e unified kno ws that we have so much more i n com mon, reg ardless of where you live, the rac e, your ethni city, the l anguage o f grandmother s peaks. We k now we hav e so much more i n common, a nd we have a choice in t his e lection t o elect a Joe Biden who say s we are, as a f irst order of priority going to unify our coun try and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity clear choices in this election, not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is a climate crisis. Texas. You know that well, on around our country u p and down the West Coas t, you know, I'm from Califor nia. Up and down the West Coast, Cali fornia toe upto Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out w hole communities. I've met fam ilies tha t are being evacu ated or been ev acuated never to return t o t heir home firefig hters who were fighting fires whi le their own homes were b urned. And my brother in law 's a firefighter. Trag edies. You lo ok at the Gul f Coast state s, the neighbor, our neighbors to Texas being batte red b y thes e th ese storms. There have been now five nam ed storms just this year , and y ou know they n ame a storm b ecause it's really b ad. So Zeta being the last one, th e most recent in th e Midwest, you're se eing floo ds th at have caused farmers t o lose. Ah, who le season o f crops, Joe Biden says . We nee d to deal with this wi th a sen se of urgency. We must embra ce the science on this. We cann ot play politi cs on this, and we see that in thi s moment o f opportunit y tohave timelines, unders tanding. We must deal with this wit h a sense of urge ncy that we also hav e the opport unity to gro w our economy and create jo bs. Joe seize the op portunity in the moment t o inves t in re newa ble energie s, to inves t in the app renticeship pr ograms with the folks li ke the build ing trades, knowing that w e have a moment of op portunity to inv es t in America' s auto indus try and b e the best i n t he world and prod uction o f electric vehicles. All of these are op port unities to meet a mome nt of crisis if you are a real leader. And o n the other h and, you have the cu rrent president of th e United States, who, w hen he was aske d about the wild fires in Calif ornia. So he was asked b y a journalist. And th e questi on was something like, Well, y ou know, Mr Pre sident, these wildfires air happen ing and and scientists are telling us there's a real con nectio n between clim ate, with the extr eme change s and and human beh aviors that are contributin g t o that. And and wha t do yo u hav e to say? Th e president of the Un ited States, who is also again the com mander in chief, responded. S cience doesn't know as those science is a pers on. Can you b elieve science doe sn't know? So you k now, and there's a rout ine through theme here, too, bec ause right, that' s how he's been treating the coronavirus righ t? A re fusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know wh at is actual ly goi ng on and give us s ome direction around how we need to deal with it. Instead of t rying to make everything ever ybody think ev erything's okay as as though pe ople aren't smart eno ugh to see what is h appening aro und them. So al l these things are at p lay and so much more. And and that brings me to this moment where we are today. I'm here in Texas t o thank you for al l you have been doin g to speak up about these challenges and to re mind peo ple to vote here on the last day of e arly voting fo ur days before the end of the election. And I'm h ere to talk about it in the context of also understanding that, um, there's a lot t h at we need to g et done. A nd, um and ther e are a lot of reaso ns for f olks to vot e. And, you kno w, people ask me a lot, W hy should I vote? Does it m atter? And I think there ar e three reasons that it is importa nt that people vot e one is to h onor the an cestors, hon or the ancestors . I me an, you know, we Bernice Mark, we all kn ow we lost i n incredible Amer ican human . It's just a hero. Um , in Congressman J ohn Lewis, ju st a her o. He i s now among the ances tors John Lewis, who shed his blood o n that Edmund Pettu s Bridge. J ohn Lewis, wh o said to us, G et in good trouble. John Lewis, who l ived a life that was about a c ommitment to fighti ng for equal rights and civil rig hts. And it wa s a fight that w as born o ut of bei ng a p atriot and loving o ur count ry. Knowing the best way we ach ieve our ideal s is to fight for those id eals, to do it in every way by sta nding up, showing up and sp eaking up. So we must vote toe honor the ancestors. This year we celeb rated the 19th Amendment, th e 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendm ent. The ancestors, the su ffragettes who tho se 1 00 years ago in all o f their whi te, marching an d shouting for a woman's right t o vote, sayi ng we will not be deterred. We will not be left behind. Now let us reme mber, because we alway s must speak truth about hi story, that b lack women could n't vote unt il 1965. So we have to remember tha t. But yes, i t is important toe ho nor Those who fought f or this pr ecious right understandi ng that like C oretta Scott King told us th e fight for civil rights for equal rig hts for h uman r ights. Th is fight for justice must be fought and won with each genera tion. And wha t she meant is it is precious, Thie s writes. But you cannot ta ke them for granted . We must be vigilant. So we've v ote to honor the ancestors. We vote bec ause everything is at stake. Everythi ng is at stake, like let 's think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean , let's talk about it in t erms of these 545 b abies wh o right now have been orphan ed be cause of a fai lure of the United Sta tes g overnment to reunify th em with their parent s. Let's tal k about a nation under t his admin istration that had a policy of sepa rating Children from their paren ts at the border , a nation that bro ke it s promise to the dreamer s in ter ms of not following through on a commitmen t around DACA protecti ons. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. And t he t hird reason is thi s. So I'm t raveling the country. And i, I'v e been thio in the last week and a half. I n fact, I'm go ing back to Florida tomorr ow. Um, Florida, Georgia, Nort h Carolina, I Mich igan. I mean, you just name it, okay. And , um, and one of the things that we have been seeing certa inly since 2013 be fore for s ure. But since 2013 w hen the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we've been seei ng, as many as two dozen s ta tes putting in plac e laws through their s tate Legislat ure that have b een designed t o suppress the vote have been designed to make it di fficult for p eople to vot e have been do ne in such a way. Y ou've seen that in Texas, where t hey're tryin g t o remove the drop boxes w here they're try ing to reduc e the n umber of polls where th ey're s ayi ng If you vote fro m home, you ne ed to fill out two e nve lopes. I m ean all kind s of things r igh t. Leaders who have trying to make it difficult and confusing and to su ggest you can' t trust the p rocess . In fa ct, at that first de ba te, the pr esident, U nited State s took that s tage in fr ont of 70 million Amer icans and in my op ini on, openly en couraged a su ppression of the vote, not to men tion what he 's doi ng and what they'r e doing to mes s with the post o ffice. The post office, the b est people in the w orld work for the pos t office, the p ost office. So w e have t o ask , Wh y do we think so man y powerful peop le are going out of their way to m ake it so dif fic ult and confusi ng for us to vote. And I think th e answer is bec ause they know o ur power. They know our power. Th ey know whe n w e vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day in the spirit of John Lewis in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. Yeah, that is what is before us. And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our Children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us. They're gonna look in our eyes and they will ask us, at that moment? And you see , we're going to be able to tell t hem so mu ch more than just how we felt forwar d. We will tel l them wh at we did . We will tell t hem wha t we did. We will tell them. On thi s particul ar Friday a fternoon, on the last day of early voting i n Texas, we were sitting in the fi eld hanging out with Cami lla. We w ill tell them we texted everybody ca lled everybody emailed everybody. We knew that, Yes, we knew we were kind o f getting on thei r nerves. But we also kn ew they get o ver it, that we reminded people o f the path tha t we are on. Tha t the shoulders u pon which we st and that we remi nded people about what is at stake and tha t we reminde d people about their power. And in this mo ment where we are dea ling with crises, we reminded ou r friends and ou r neighbors and o ur family that yo u are not alone . Don't let anyone make you feel s mall that you a re big. Y ou are strong , you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you And God bless Texas . So y ou're girls.

We hope I'm so rry their f ights for socia l justic e and allows and provides oppor tunities for sustainab l e economic growth a nd provide safety nets a s well as opportun ities. I was bo rn and raised in the Rio Grande V alley, and I know som e of the many issues Vall ey natives r eally care about. We care a bout protecti ng our immigrant communi ties. W e care about p rotecti ng decker recipients and provi ding a pathway to citizenship. We care about econom ic justice an d we know that we canno t stand f or the extreme wealth dispar ities that are cu rrently taking pl ace. We support the LGBT cou p community and we suppo rt full equality. And we care about a room, a wom an's ri ght to choose, becau se women sho uld have control over thei r own bodie s. We believe in science and climate change, and we want t o see a transition to re newable energy and cre ate a resil ient infrastruc ture that better protects and pr epares our communi ty against nat ura l disasters. We wan t to create safe r communities a nd read c rime, but not by harsher p unishment, not by a milit ari zation of our poli ce, but by p roperly fundin g public education and alleviating pe ople out of pover ty b y providing good paying j obs and o pportunity on. We ca re about s ocial and e conomic justice. An d it i s for all these reasons that we canno t s it this electio n out. There is too much at st ake for us to stay on th e sidelines and remain compl acen t. We all know Colton, 19 hit the valley hard and it was devastating way have lost loved ones or we know someone who has and the RGB alone. We had over 64,000 cases and at least 3260 Corrine over look at Texas, w e learned that Te xas is the most uninsured state when i t comes to hea lth car e. And when you focus on th e Valley, that uninsur ed rate doubles in the rugby. We want affordable healthcar e expanded. W e w ant to create pl ans, and we want concrete plans on how our governme nt will provide th at. Meanwh ile, President T by his own ti meline, has not release d a healt h car e plan. We are on m on th 10 of covert 19 and th at it was a result of the lack of leadership from the Trump administration. than a one time che ck and expan sion of unemplo yment ben efits. Instead of a mas k mandate or provi ding ac cess to free testing, P resident Trump ch ose to minimize the se veri ty of Kobe 19 host rallies a nd put profits before p eople and uses pand emic to push on Democratic po licies that hurt our immigrant communities. The T adminis tration ex ploited T itle 42 of the U. S. C ode ah p ra vision that allow s for a broader power t o respond an ac t during a public heal th crisis, They used T itle 42 to sh ut down the border an d deport asylum seekers who are alr eady in the Un ited States. T he Trum p administration did this wi th no due p rocess and even after experts a nd scien tists at the C . D. C stated that there was no e vidence that doin g so would in crease public safe ty or slow the c oronavirus, Trump remains apath etic to th e issues that a re important to people in t he Rio Grande Va lley and constan tly attacks our ide ntities that we hol d with his belittling , sexist and ra cist remarks. I'm here to say that alt hough po litical disco urse may se em discouraging and off putting with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket, there is so much to be hopeful for when it masses and expandin g healthca re. So t hose who pos sibly test p ositive for Cova, 19 ar en't afraid of b eing saddled w ith a medical bill that the y c an't pay off. Joe Bid en and Sena tor Harris h ave a much be tter grasp on th e issues Valley re sidents hold dear to their hear ts. In regards to immigratio n, they understand t hat they need to provide a c learer a nd easier path to ci tizenship and know th at DACA recipie nts are tired of being used as a ba rgaining ch ip for Trum p's border wa ll fund ing. Ah, u seless border wall that w ill not benefit or pr otect the American people in any way and only serves to divide us . I think Sen ator Harris said it best. DACA recipi ents subjected themselv es to a vetting process and answe red questions about t he ci rcumstances of their arr ival. A nd after clearin g that vetting p rocess, three United States government offered the m protect ion. It gave them DAC A status, and th ey were promised that that information would not be shared with ice and tha t information would not be used as a basis f or deport ation. The Trump a dministration c ame i n and broke that promise . When it comes to jobs, Joe Biden and Senator Harris know the truth. Wh ile Trump l ikes to brag abou t low unem ployment rates among minorities, how many of us ar e worki ng two jobs to pu t food on t he table. How many of us are working t wo jobs yet recei ving known heal thcare? Because priva te insurance sy stem makes it so We are depe ndent on the generosity of our employer s. How man y of thos e jobs are minimum wage? How many p eople are earning $7 .25? And despite working full time, cannot afford t he cost o f living? Joe Biden and Senator Harris know that we need a $15 minimum wage. We need good paying jobs, and we need to create a strong workforce and renewable energy. now Senato r Kamala Harr is is here tod ay, and she needs no introduc tion. But I have to sa y she is a Tr ail blazer. She has brok en count les s barriers an d was the first African A meric an and first women elected as dis trict atto rney in San Francis co, an attorn ey g enera l of Cal ifornia. Just keep. And then, when she went on to be the first wom an of color to repre sent C alifornia and the United States Senate in a town hall for the Democratic prim ary, Senator Ha rris said that h er mother told her , Kamala, you may be the fir st to do many things, but you need to make sure t hat you are not the last. And I have no doub t in my m ind that she will be th e first woman of col or vice president of t he United State s on. She will pa ve the way for women to be electe d not on ly to the vice presi dency b ut to the highest offic e in the land.

Over 220,00 0 people in just t he last seve ral months have lost thei r lives . Many, many without f amily members nearb y toe hold the ir han d. Because of the nature of this , o ver almost nine mil lion people wh o have been co nflict affl icted with this v irus, who are gonn a have unknown long ter m h ealth consequ ences, doctors air talking about l ung scarrin g and things of that na ture . People a re su ffering. Meanwhi le, you have the commander i n t reat, the p resident, United States, who t ook to a st age and sa id, We're rounding the corn er. Are you k idding me? Meanwhile, We have a presid ent of the United States w ho, thanks t o Bob Woodward, w e know knew in Janua ry about how se rious thi s is. He knew in January, Januar y 28th that it w as five times m ore deadly than th e flu. He knew on January 28t h that it cou ld hurt people of every age . He knew then tha t it wa s airborne, and he covered up that informati on and h e did not tell the Americ an p eople. Mor eover, he had the gall to c all it a h oax to suggest th at ther e are two kin ds of people on his ledger, the kind that wear masks and the k ind that don't in a publi c health crisis with one of the mos t highly contagious airborne vir uses we've ev er seen. And can y ou imagine Rio Gran de what you would have do ne on January 28th if you h ad known what the president had known? What you as a fron t line worker, what you as a parent, what you as a teache r, what you, as a sm all business owner, would have don e if you had known on Jan uary 28th? Because here's the deal. Even be fore the pandemic, the situati on in our country was such tha t people had to wor k two and thre e jobs to pay the re nt and p ut foo d on the table. A nd, by th e way, in Joe Biden's Amer ica, nobody should have to pay, ha ve more than one job to put food on the table and pay t he rent. But imagine wh at y ou would h ave done when w e know most A merican fam ilies don't eve n have $100 0 in life sav ings and what people might have done to save up a li ttl e bit, knowing th at they may not be a ble goto work because still, in o ur country, peo ple goto work without pa id sick leave and paid family . Leave somethi ng Joe Biden and I are gonn a end, mak ing sure all workers are respected for the digni ty of their work, including pai d sick lea ve and paid fa mily leave. Ima gine what people woul d have done knowing our Children mig ht miss critic al stages, c ritical amounts o f education tim e and what peopl e might have done t o prepare for that, not to mention what peop le might have don e to prepar e t o buy a couple of extra rolls of toil et paper if we had known what he kne w on Janu ary 2 8th and in th e midst of this publi c health pand emic, where hun dreds of tho usands of people ha ve died wher e nine mill ion people have contrac ted the v irus. Donald T a nd his boy Bill Bar are in th e Unit ed States Sup reme Court , suing to get rid of the Affordable Care A ct that brought health c are to over 20 million people, includ ing protecting people wit h pre existin g condi tions. Hu nk If you know anyb ody who ha s diabetes , hunk, If you kno w anybody who h as high bloo d pressure, L upus, br east cance r and you see B arack Obama toget her with Vice President, Biden cr eated the Affor dable Care Act, knowing p eople with preexisting cond itions , i ncluding the 10 mil lion Texans who hav e pre existing conditions sh ould be protec ted. But Donald Trump's in court right now trying to g et rid of that and, you kn ow, part of the issue th at I see. Let's r emember this fro m the time th e guy was r unning for office. Until now, Do nald Trump has had this weird obsessi on. We're trying to ge t rid of whatever Barack Obama and J oe Biden crea ted. Do we need preside nts with weird o bsess ions? No, we're do ne with that, aren't w e? There are clear c ontrast in this ele ction. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, wh o helped push throu gh the Affor dable Care Act, Joe Bide n, who wa s saying, We wil l expand health coverag e. We will bring down the c ost of pre miums . We will brin g down the cost of p rescription dr ugs. We will lowe r Medicare elig ibility Thio ag e 60 We kn ow that health care means u nderstanding. The body d oesn't just start from the ne ck down. I t include s the neck up, and that's calle d mental h ealth care. They're clea r choices in th is electi on, and on t he othe r hand, you have the cur rent presi dent who's tryi ng to get r id of coverage for over 20 million people. T he cr ises we a re de aling with the crisis fr om this pa ndemic , that is this eco nomic crisis were ov er 30 milli on Ameri cans in just t he last several months had to file for unemployment in suran ce. We're here in T exas. We'r e looking a t one in 10 families that has des cribed t heir h ousehold is being hungry. We' re here in Texas. One i n six hous eholds is finding it diffic ult, if not impossible, to pay rent. We're here in Texas. One in four s mall businesses is ou t of busines s and fear they will never be able to reopen. There's a clear ch oice in thi s election because you s ee, on the one hand you h ave Joe Biden. Y eah, and whe n you asked Joe Biden How 's t he economy d oing? Joe Bide n says, Well, tell me how worki ng people ar e doing. Tell me h ow working fami lies are doing. Joe Biden says. You want to measure th e econo my, Then let's m easure the greatn ess of the economy based on getting folks paid s ick, leave paid fa mily l eave. Let's dea l with the economy by making s ure no w orking fami ly pays more than 7% of their income in chi ld care. Let's dea l with the economy and no t raise t axes for anyo ne who makes less than $400, 000 and bring dow n taxes for middle class f amilies, he say s. You want to tal k about the economy well. One of the bes t ways to gr ow the econ omy and any familie s economi c well being is homeownership. So w e'll have a tax cre dit of $1 5 for every new home buyer for down payments and closing costs. That's how Joe Biden t hinks abou t the economy. On the other h and, you ha ve Donald Trump who, whe n asked about th e economy, as ks ab out the s tock market, ask s about h ow rich people are doing. As one o f his first order s of business pass ed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest c orp orations of Americ a. Well, Rio Grande . I prom ise you thi s as a first o rder of business. Jo e Bide n and I are abo ut to work to get rid of th at tax cut and invest that money in workin g famil ies. Invest tha t money on buildi ng back u p our infrast ructure, which mea ns the creat ion of mi llions of jobs buildi ng back up o ur infrastructure around roads and br idges and r ene wable energy investing i n working pe ople and sm all businesses with a focus on $150 billion i n low interes t loans and access to capital for minori ty owned businesse s. That's how we will deal wi th this. Th at's how we will inves t. Our resource is there are clear c ontrast and c lear choice in this race . Let's deal with the long overdue reckoning on racia l injus tice in America. Yea h, so o n the one hand you have Joe Bi den, who was a student of Am erican history and has the courage to say black lives mat ter. Oh, Joe Biden, who say s any riel leader must speak tr uth, no matter h ow difficult it may be. To hear, any riel lead er must acknowledge the racial dispariti es that ex ist in America an d deal with them. Deal with what w e need to handle in our p ublic health care sys tem when African Amer icans and Latinos air three tim es likely to contract covert and twice as likely to die from it . Deal with it when we know Latinos hav e the some of the highes t r ates of diabetes o f a ny p opulation, hi ghe st rates of high b lood pressure of any pop ulation. And we n eed to deal with that. Let's deal w ith the disparities i n terms of ou r public public education sys tem and put resource is i nto Title one s chools, knowing that is where our Childr en, who ha ve such God gi ven capacity, deserve to have. The resource is toe, a llow them to grow and develop. And that is wh y we w ill triple title one fund ing. Joe Bid en has the courage and the abilit y to see what's g oing on to say dispropor tionately black and Latino young people are bei ng arrest ed, and we need to ad dress t he dis parities in ou r crimi nal justi ce system and re form the system by d oing a number of things. Getting rid o f m andatory minimum s, decriminalizin g marijuana, exp unging the records of people who h ave been conv icted of m arijuana, shutting down private prisons, el iminating cas h bail because t hat is an economic justi ce iss ue as much as it i s a crimin al justice is sue. And on the ot her hand, you have D onald Trump, wh o at the first debate you guys remember thi s at the first d ebate, re fused to co ndem n white supremac ists and then double dow n by saying, Sta nd back and stand by and remember, this was n't a one of f. We've se en a patte rn. Let's go b ack to t he fact th at he ran trying to suggest t hat the firs t black president o f the U nited State s was not a legitimate president of the United Sta tes. L et's remem ber, on the iss ue of Charlottesvi lle, where people were priests peace fully prote sting racial in justice, a yo ung wom an was ki lled. And on the other sid e there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, hurli ng racial epithet s, anti Semitic epithets. And the president of the United States sai d, there ar e fine people o n each side. The president of the United States , who called M exicans, ra pists and criminals , the president of the United S tates who has hi s first order of business, put in place a Mu slim ban . We deserve better th an this, and Joe Biden , in his heart , knows who w e really are a s America Joe Biden in his hea rt. Nos that regardless of w here yo u live, y our race , your gender, y our ag e, the language your gr andmother spea ks Joe Biden k nows that the v ast maj ority of us have so m uch more in common than what sepa rates us. And it i s time that w e reject hate and division and unify as a country. There are clear choices. Le t's deal with an issue Tex as knows well, the issue of th e climate crisis. It okay, you said it correctly. So Texas kn ows we're dealing w ith a climate cris is as a worl d we're lo oking at on the West Coast, you kn ow where I'm f rom. We're looking at wildfi res from Californi a to Washington ove r to Colorado , whole comm uni ties of people being b urned out of th eir homes. I've met people w ho have been evacuated from their home s, never to be able to return. I've met with fi refighte rs who were fighting f ires w hile their own ho mes were burning. My brother . In laws of firefigh ter , we look at the Gul f States neighb ors to Texas. There h ave b een five named stor ms this year alone. They nam e a st orm because i t's that bad. F ive, the most rece nt one b eings Ada. We're looking at what's been happening in th e Midwest far mers losing a whole sea son of crops becaus e of the floods, Jil l Biden says. We need to embra ce scie nce. We need to speak truth. We need t o deal with t his wit h time lines and a sen se of urgen cy becaus e we need to be abl e to breathe c lean air and drink c lean water and see th e conne ction between human behaviors and the cri si s we are f acing. J oe knows th is is n ot only about what we need to d o for our environ ment. The opp ortunity in the moment is we can also cre ate jobs. We can invest in infr astructure in renewa ble ene rgies in solar and w in d, a nd that will be milli on's of jobs. Joe also knows t his is an envi ronmen tal justice issue. When you're looki ng at t he fact that in all of the areas in the country tha t have poor a ir quality, 70% of the people who live in those places are people of color. Joe knows that and he understands h ow we can build back better in a way that we de al with the scienc e. We build up an infrastr uctural, create mi llions of jobs, and we do it in a way that is a bout equi table out comes, and we build back bette r. On the o ther hand, y ou have Donald Tru mp. Okay, so here's the thin g On the i ssue of the wildfir es he was interviewed and the journalis ts a t something like, You know, these wildfires air happening in Ca lifornia and the scienc e sister sayi ng that th ere's a conne ction between t he extreme weat her and the fires and t he president of the Unit ed States, the c ommander in chie f responded. Sci ence doesn't kno w. Can you ima gine as those sci ence is a pe rson literally reje cting the notion that we h ave so much e vidence t hat is undi sputed abou t what is upon us a nd the oppor tunity we have in the mom ent. So Ri o Grande I say al l t his to say there's a lot that we need to deal with, and the se are many of t he issues tha t are at play in this electi on, and Te xas has been turnin g it out. You guy s have been turnin g it out and you have been turnin g it o ut. Yo u have bee n sta nding in line, you've been o rganizing. Y ou are maki ng a hu ge difference. A nd so here's the thing on v oting. Y ou know, I think t here a re three reasons t hat p eople need to vote. You know, peopl e ask, Why should I vote? Why is an important. T here's t hree reasons I think on e. It's im portant to v ote toe an ER on ER. The ancestors ho nor the ancestors . All those people who came before us, who fought for our right to vote. P eople like John Lewis, t he congress ma n who passed away th is year, who said, Let's get in good t rouble. John Lewis, w ho shed his blood on the Edmu nd Pettus Brid ge for ou r right to vote. J ohn L ewis, who knew thi s wa s a matter of civil rights and dign ity. John Lewis, w ho understoo d that it was also a matter of civil rights and dign ity, to fight for f or same marri age. John Lewis , who also knew it was a matter of civil r ights and di gnity, to fight f or protections for dreamers and for a pathway for citizenship. So it's important to vo te toe hono r the ancestors, you know. This y ear we celebra ted the 19th Amen dment, which a llow ed women to vote. We celebrat ed the 1\/100 anniversar y of the 19th Amen dment, all thos e suffragettes who 100 year s ago marched and fought for our rig ht to vote . Now it's important to remember history because it w asn't until 1965 that black women could vote so we stil l have work to do, but it is time t o vote to honor the ancestors. Tha t's r eason number one. Reason Number two. Ev erythi ng is at stake, ri ght? Ever ything is at stake when this administrati on has orpha ned 545 Chil dren bec ause of a poli cy that has i t been about se paratin g Children f rom their pa rents a t the bord er. E verything is at stake when we are lo oking at th e fa ct that 200,0 00 of our frontline wo rkers have been dreamers w ho were p romised DACA pr otection. Eve rything is at sta ke. Everyth ing is at stak e when we ne ed to crea te a pathway towards citize nship. E ver ything is at stake when we talk a bout equal pay for equ al work for wom en. Yeah, everything is at stake. So that's reason n umber two. And then her e's reaso n number three. So I've been trav eling the count ry and I'll t ell you, just li ke here in Tex as, ther e are powerf ul people around our country th at h ave been making it really d ifficult fo r people to vote. They've be en passing l aws, you know. In North Caroli na, they passed a law that th e court that revie wed the law said it was writ ten with surgi cal precision to prev ent bl ack people in No rth Carolina for votin g. We have see n this arou nd the co untry whe re laws h ave been p ut in place to m ake it difficu lt fo r people o f co lor, for students, for our Native American brothers and sisters to vote laws like here in Texas, where they're taking the drop boxes where they're in other places where they're shutting down polling sites where they're requiring people toe fill out to different envelopes if their mail in ballot is gonna account. The president who took the debate stage and in front of 70 million Americans openly solicited a suppression of the vote. So we have to ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? Why are they, for example, messing with the post office? I mean, the post office, like the nicest people, work for the post office. Why are they doing this? And I believe it is because they know our power. Yeah, they know our power and we know our power, and we will not let anyone take our power from us. And that is the reason that is the reason that we are all here today to celebrate each other and to fight for this country we love. And so my last point is this This moment this moment will pass. It will pass. And one day in the future our Children, our grandchildren, others They will look in our eyes. Each one of us. They're gonna look in our eyes and they will ask us. Where were you at that moment and what we are gonna tell them? As we were hanging out at UT Rio Grande Valley this Friday afternoon on the last day of early voting, we will tell them we organized. We will tell them we brought people to vote. We will tell them. We told them about what is at stake. We will tell them We reminded people of the ancestors and our responsibility and commitment to them. We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Rio Grande.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477546-1\/senator-kamala-harris-speaks-biden-campaign-event-mcallen-texas","Summary":"2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) made remarks in McAllen, Texas, on the last day of early voting in the Lone Star State.","Source":"477546-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

So le t me just be reall y clear flori da, joe biden a nd I are proud patriotic a mericans who share th e values w ith th e vast m ajority of the american p eople who wa nt a presid ent of th e United States, who speaks trut h, who uses tha t platform, not to beat p eople down, but to lift people u p the vas t majority of the ameri can people who want a pres ident who unde rstands that regardless of where we l ive, our r ace, our gender, the la nguag e ou r gr andmo ther speaks, that we a ll have so much more in common than what separ ates us. That's wha t the americ an people want. Yeah, y eah, yeah, that's what we want. So t here 's so much at sta ke, guys, so muc h at stake in fl orida has been s o hard hit. Um , you know, I think that we 're dealing right now wi th four cri ses that have all ha ppened at the same ti me, We're de aling with this coronavirus, th is pandemic, right? Which at th is point has kill ed over 225 ,000 peo ple in jus t the last several mo nths. People who, tra gically i n many cases were alone b ecause of the natu re o f the virus couldn't have fami ly with them to hold th eir hands in th eir last hours and minutes o n earth. This pandemic that has Affli cted nine million people in our country w ho by the way, will likely exper ience long ter m health impac ts. Doctor s are talk ing about th ings like lun g scarring. We are looking at a moment where ther e has been such tr agedy in terms of loss of l ife, a mass casualty event t hat can o nly be co mpared to World War Two. And her e's the thing, the president of th e United States, wh o is also th e Commander in chief and it' s importan t to point out everything Sergea nt Cruz said abou t the responsibility th at comes wi th what we give that p erson to become tha t including that th ei r fi rst priori ty should be the health and safety of the american p eople. But w hat do we have in t he guy who is cur rently in the White Ho use on the issue o f this pandemic? Than ks to a guy by the nam e of bob Woodward. We kn ow he knew back on January 28 that this vi ru s could ki ll people at five times the rate of the flu. We k now he knew that i t would imp act people of every ag e. He knew it wa s airborne. And wh at did he do with that informat ion right system? He covered it up. He didn't tell the americ an people. Can you i magine as a p arent, as a teach er, as a small busine ss owner, Wha t you might have done? Had you known on January 28 what t he president knew wha t you might have don e? Because here' s the thing. Even bef ore the pandemic , far too man y am ericans were workin g tw o and three jobs t o put food on the ta ble and pay the rent. And by the way in joe biden and my America , nobody should ha ve to work more t han on e job to pay the r ent and put food on t he table how p eople might hav e prepared, how peopl e m ight have prepar ed knowing t hat eve n before the pandemic. Mos t families don 't hav e Even $1, 000 in savin gs. And if folks had known t he predictabl e, which is that we might hav e t o isolate, we m ay have to shut th ings down for a little bit. People cou ld have sav ed up how pe ople could have pr epared bu ying an extra couple ro lls of toi let pape r. But they sat o n that inform ation . And now i n the midst of thi s public healt h crisis , Donald Trump wi th his boy bill b arr are in th e United States Su preme Court suin g to get r id of Obamaca re, the Affordab le Care Act that President Oba ma together with Joe Bide n brought t o America and covered over 20 m illion peo ple, including people wi th preexisti ng condi tions hunk . If you know so mebody with diabetes hunk, i f you know so mebody with high bloo d pressure hunk, if you know someb ody with breast cancer o r lupus, Ye ah. And they're tryin g to take it away. So there's a cle ar choice in this elec tion because you see on t he on e han d , there's joe biden who says we're going to expand w hat we did i n c reating Obamacare. W e're go ing to make sure we b ring down th e cost of p remiums and prescript ion me dication. We're gonna bring dow n Medicare eligi bility to age 60 . We're gonna deal with the fact that when we'r e talking abou t hea lth care, the body doe sn't just start from th e neck d own. It includ es the neck up and that 's cal led mental health care. Yeah , yeah. A clear choice i n this election. A clear choice this pand emi c. This pandemic has r esu lted in an eco nomic disas ter that is being co mpared to the G re at Depression. O ver 30 million peop le in just the last sev eral months ha ve filed f or unemployme nt here in fl orida. One in nin e househol ds is d escribing their hou sehold as havi ng been hungry H ere i n Florid a, one in 7 ho useholds is descr ibing having a diffi cult time or f inding it im possib le to pa y rent h ere in f lorid a, one in f our small bus inesses is out o f busin ess, likely ne ver to be abl e to reopen . And what does Donald trump sa y we're rounding the co rner. But here 's the thing on t he economy. So on the one hand, you hav e joe bi den, who whe n as ked how's the eco nomy doing? Al ways ask the qu es tion. Well, tell me how working people a re doing , Tell me how working famili es are doing. M hm. Which is why jo e biden w ill not i ncrease taxes on anyone. Maki ng under $400,0 00 a year will bring dow n middle c lass taxes. Will put in place A policy wh ere if you hav e Children, you will pay no more than 7% o f your income in childc are. We will have a tax credit fo r first time h ome buyer s of $15,0 00 knowing that w ill he lp with down payment a nd closing costs. And on t he other hand , you have donald trump who ? When asked yes baby Who when asked about the econom y as well . How's the sto ck market doing? Asks how are rich people doing? Which is why as one of his first o rders of bus iness, he passe d a tax cu t For the top 1% a nd the b iggest corpor ations in Am erica, which wil l cause us to have to deal wit h a $2 t rillion d oll ar d eficit. W ell with your help flo rida Over these ne xt three days. When and God willing if we wi n joe biden a nd are ab out to g et rid of that tax cut and invest that money in w orking people In vest that m oney in buildin g back up our infrastructure, repairing our roads and bridges, inv esting in renewab le energy and the cre ation of million s of jobs i nvesting in o ur students who come fr om families t hat have less than $12 5,000. So you can go to the fo ur year state colle ge free or an h bcu free. The c rises w e are dealing with includes a long ove rdue r eckoning o n racial in justice in America . And on the one hand, you have joe biden who bei ng a student of a merican history an d having the courage to speak truth can say and spe ak the phrase black lives matter. Joe b iden who says we need to deal with racial dispar iti es in America. We need to speak truth a bout systemic racism. We need to acknowledg e that on thi s virus blac ks and L atinos are t hree tim es as likel y to contr act it an d t wice as likely to d ie from it. We need to sp eak truth about di sparities in o ur health care system. When black w omen are 3-4 ti mes more likely to di e in conne ction wi th childbirth and other women. We need to speak truth ab out a cri minal justice sy ste m and reform th at syst em and decrimi nalized marijuan a and expunge the records of people who hav e be en convi cted of mariju ana offe nses and shut d own private prisons and end cash ba il because it is no t only a criminal ju s tice issue, it is an ec onomic jus tice issue. On t he othe r hand, you have donald trump Who t ook a debate stag e in front of 70 m illion America ns and refused t o condemn white supremacists who then double d down and said they sh o uld stand ba ck and stand by. And let's be c lear, th is is part of a pattern because remember he came in office questio ning the le gitimacy of the firs t blac k President o f the United States. Yea h. Mh m. Remember on t he i ss ue of Charlottesv ille, wh ere folks were peacefull y protesting rac ial injustice, o ne young woman w as killed. An d on the other side, t here were a bunch of neo nazis we aring swastikas carry ing tiki tor ches, spe wing racial a nd anti Semi tic epithets. And the President of th e United States said there are fine people on both s ides, A President of the United States wh o came into office ca lling mexicans rapists and criminals put in his first sort of bu siness, a m uslim ban in e ffect, we don't want that in the Presid ent of our United States, we de serve better. Mhm. Yeah. We want a Pre sident of t he Unit ed Stat es who unders tands you want to mea sure the streng th of anyone . You want to measure the ir strengt h. You meas ure a p erson's strength, not by who they b eat down, but who the y lift up. And we are in the mid st also of a climate crisis. It's ho t and it's getting hotter . A cl imate cris is. You kn ow, I come from C alifornia, the wildfires h ave been just bu rning up the west coast, fro m California O regon and Washing ton to Colo rado. You know, I' ve I've met fam ilies and met with families who had t o evacuate. They lost t heir home permanen tly lost t heir home. I've met with firefighter s w ho were fight ing the wildfires w hile their own homes were burning. I n fact, my brother in law's a firef ighter, um , you kn ow, in th e gulf coast state s, you a ll know that th e storms that have been hitti ng, do you kn ow, we've had five na med storms just this yea r an d we name a storm because it's that b ad that it sho uld actually b e acknowledged wit h a name. Th at's how bad things are . An d so joe biden says, hey, we need to deal with the science. We need to embrace the reality and the u rgency and the imme diacy of this i ssue . We need to understand it is not only an existential thr eat to us as a speci es, i t is somet hing that transcends int o civil rights and human rights issues. When you know tha t of al l the people in our cou ntr y who live i n poor air quality zon es, 70% of peopl e of color, He kn ows tha t when we're talking abou t water a s an issue, we t hink of places li ke fl int and joe sa ys, let's deal wit h the science b ut do it in a way tha t we also see an econom ic opportunity for th e creation o f jo bs, i nvestment in rene wable energy, investment i n solar and wind. On th e oth er hand, you have donald trump who I kid y ou not. Whe n ask ed about the w ildf ires in C alifornia , and the question went, something l ike Mr President , You know , these wildfires are happe ning, th e scientists are te lling us that their extreme changes i n the climate , that th at there's a con nection also with h uman behavior s. Do y ou know that the Pres ident of the Unit ed States r esponded by saying Science do esn't know the Pr esident o f the Un ited States? Well, here's the thing. Mr. President Science does. No. And so does the leading Science magazine tha t endorsed joe bid en for Pr esi dent of the United States. So there's a lot goi ng on and we got th ree days to g et thi s done. And so let's talk fo r a mi nute about voting. You know, people ha ve been asking me and I'm s ure you because this i s a whol e beautif ul grou p of leaders. People have been ask ing why should I vo te? And I think there are three reasons that everyone should vote. On e. Honor the ancestors ho nor the ancestors . Honor people like the late great john Lewis wh o shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus bridge so we co uld vote. I know he h ears you. I kn ow he hears y ou Honor the ancestors, those suffragettes who 100 years ago got us the passage of the 19th Amendment. But let's always speak truth. B lack W omen couldn't vote u nt il 1965. So ther e is that so reason, Numbe r one, let's hon or the an cestors who s acrificed so much f or our rig ht to vote. Reason Num ber two, everything is at stake. Everyt hing every thing we just discuss ed, includin g creating a pat hway fo r citiz enship, For undocume nted immigrants, renewi ng our promise to o ur dreamers with DACA shutti ng down private de tenti on centers, reuniting 5 45 Children with their parents who the U nited States government or pha ne d. Th er e's every r eason to vot e i n terms of wh at' s at stake. An d then here's the la st point that I'd make is rea son Number thre e, including t hat America's futu re is at stake. W e are, I'm traveling a ll over the cou ntry. This i s my, I d on' t know how many times I'v e be en to florida sinc e I've been on the ticket an d many time s be fore that. T hank you Debbie, um , all over our country, peopl e are pu tti ng in place laws and procedures to make it difficul t for us to vote, mak ing it co nfusing to vote. You know, pu rging voter ro ll s passing la ws to suppress t he vote, p icking up drop boxes. That was in Hous ton yeste rday, a coun ty of 1 1 mi llion people with o ne drop box, tryi ng to make it confusi ng in diffe rent pl aces in florida, diff erent day s, right. Diffe rent envelo pes you got ta fill out and w ho's gonna sign them? The President of United St ates, who took the stage at the debat e and o penly attempted to suppress the vote. So here's the thing when we look at where we are in terms of these powerful people who are trying to and we're not gonna be distracted by what's at hand, we're not gonna be distracted by the stakes. We're not gonna be distracted, we know what we have to do. And so here's my point. Here is my point. You got to ask why are these powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? And I will tell you, I believe the reason they're trying to make it difficult and confusing for us to vote. It's because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. They know our power and let us not ever let anyone take our power from us. And so my last point, Miami is this, this moment will pass and years from now. Our Children, our grandchildren will ask us, where were you at that moment? And what we will tell them. It's so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them. We organized, we mobilized. We stood in line, we emailed and texted and called everybody we knew multiple times until they got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. And we will tell them we elected joe biden the next president of the United States. Thank you. Miami gracias girls. I he ar you've been running f rom the beautiful q ueen that you can be be coming. You can look at m y palm and see the storm coming. Read the your hair rain bo ne and they of ten create a sergeant for your skin tone. Wanna hold your h ead high because you're a pr etty woman. Get your runway straw got home and keep it going f or live your mind. I'm just t hey're gonna make anywa y, don't you get back. Doesn't matter if you're going along with that.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477610-1\/senator-kamala-harris-campaigns-miami","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, addressed supporters at a campaign rally in Miami-Dade County, Florida.","Source":"477610-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

Let me thank Pasto r Fernandez whe re are you? Th ere you are. Thank yo u so very much fo r just you know, listen, I I say these da ys we must walk by faith, n ot by sight. Um but thank you for th e int roduction. Thank you t o Debbie Wass erman Schultz. Where are you? Early voting end s tomorr ow at se ven and the election that will determine the course of our f uture as a na tion. And d are I say, as a world Wil l be decid ed on November three, just three days fr om today. And I'm really feel ing very optimistic abo ut the possibili ties and in large p art because o f what yo u all have bee n doing and contin ue to do. You know, the w orld knows the na tion knows and joe and I know the path to t he White Ho use lead s through florida. Oh a nd you all have been laying the gro undwork for years, for months, fo r weeks, for days an d reminding peo ple that we are all in this together and re minding folks of what is at stake. An d of course the re was so much an d we've been through so much, you kno w, we are in the midst of of cou rse, four crises that hav e conver ged at o ne time, a public heal th crisis of course, because of t his pandemic Whe re we have seen ov er 225,000 people in our coun try who h ave died in j ust the la st several mont hs. You know, I've been talking about this as a mass casualty event of a of a pr oportion that we've reall y not seen sin ce Worl d War Two. And the t ragedy of i t includes the fact t hat because of t he nature of this vi rus, so m any peopl e passed wit hout th e ability to have f amily members with them holding thei r hands in thos e last days on earth . We'r e looking at over nine m illion people now w ho have contra cted the virus w ith untold long term hea lth con sequences. Doc tors are talking about thing s like lung scarring, but there's no que stion. We now h ave nine million people w ho now in addi tion to those w ho had it before h ave a pre existing cond ition called Covid. Um and a nd the tragedy of this is it didn't have to be this bad Broward County . It did not h ave to be t his bad, but we have a p resident of the Un ited States w ho when thank s to a fellow by the name of bob Woodward W hen he was informed back o n Januar y 28, infor med that this i s a pandemic. That we're talk ing about. A virus that is highly contag ious and deadly, more d eadly. Five time s more deadly than th e flu is airb orne will aff ect peopl e of every age. He cover ed that inform ation up. He did not share it with the am erican people. Can you imagine as a par ent, as a small business owner, as a tea cher, What you might have don e if you ha d known what t he presiden t knew on January 2 8, how you might have pre pare d how you might have pla nned? Because remember even before this pandemic, So many families in o ur country, working peo ple had to work two and 3 jobs to put fo od o n the table a nd pay the rent. An d by the way, in a biden administra tion, our belief is nobody should have to work more than one job to put foo d on the tabl e an d pay the rent. But how p eople mi ght hav e prepared kn owing that most a merican families don't have More than $1, 000 in savings. How they might have prepar ed ho w small busines ses might have p repared when we're l ooking at the impa ct h ere in flor ida and around the c oun try. U m, you know, I j oke, but seriously ho w we might ha ve prepared just to buy an extra couple o f roll s of toilet paper those d ays, right? But t hey sat on this informati on and now we ar e looking at t he pain and the loss t hat so many peo ple have s uffered and on top of all of thi s, in the midst of a pub lic health crisis donald trump tog ether with his boy, Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Cou rt suing to get r id of the Afforda ble Care Act that President Oba ma and Vice President b iden brought to the americ an people and allowed for over 20 milli on people to have coverage including protectin g people wit h pre existi ng condit ions. And no w they're trying to get rid of it. And let's put this i n context, rais e your hand. If you know somebo dy who ha s di abetes, raise your hand, if you love somebody who has hig h blood pressure or surviving breast c ancer or lupus, and they 're trying to get rid of t hese protections. And t his brings u p the one of many w ays that the american peop le that Flo ridians have a real choice in fr ont of them because on the one hand you have joe biden Who , togethe r with Presid ent Obama created the Af fordable Care Act, J oe Biden, who says we come into office and we 're going to e xpand on what it did . We're go nna b ri ng down pre scription drug pric es, were going to b ring dow n the cost of prem iums, we 're gon na lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. We'r e gonna de al with health care in a way t hat we expand coverage. Und ers tanding that health care d oesn't mean the body s tarts from the neck do wn. It also includ es health care from t he neck up that's called me ntal health care, which we sor ely need to expand. Ther e's a real cl ear choice h ere. Two very different choices. So that 's joe. And o n the other hand, you have some one who has li ed. Yes . I said that, l ied to the american p eople has no t followed the s cience w ho has suggested t his as a hoax, who h as suggested th at on the ledger, he keeps you on one side of his ledge r. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of h is ledge r. If you don't, there's a r eal clear choice t hese crises , the economic crisis that has resulted from this pandemic Being compared to the Great Depr ession in ter ms of its impact . Over 30 milli on people in just the last several mont hs filed for unemploymen t he re. In florida, One i n nine families is d escribin g their hou sehold as having bee n hungry. We're in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. One in five mo thers. I've seen the numbers, desc ribes your Children unde r the age of 12 as b eing hungry in America . Today, we're loo king i n flori da at one in sev en househo lds who is describing a difficulty payi ng thei r rent or inabi lit y to pay their rent h ere. In f lorida, one i n four small businesses have gon e out o f business with ve ry small l ikeliho od of being able to reopen econo mic devastati on. And a gain, you have a joe biden who when asked, how do you t hink the economy i s doin g? How are you measuring th e econom y? Joe biden responds with, Well, tel l me h ow working peop le are doing. Tell me how working famil ies ar e doing, Jo e biden says We need to m ove forward, not i ncreasing taxes fo r an yone making l ess than $400,0 00 a year. We wil l i ncrease Tax cut s for middle class families. We will ensure that work ing families pay no more than 7% of t heir income i n childcare. We will ensure t hat fi rst time home buyers get a $15,000 t ax cred it to help with down payment or closing costs. U nderstanding that homeownership is one of the greatest paths toward econo mic health and wel lbeing, intergenerati onal healt h and well bei ng. That's how joe thinks abo ut the economy. On the other hand, you have dona ld trump w ho? When a sked, How is the economy doing? Ask s the quest ion. How's the stock mark et do ing? Asks how a re rich people doing ? Which clearly i s what motivated what he considers to be one of his grea test achievements wa s a tax bill that they passed benefiting the top 1% and the b iggest corpora tions in Amer ica, leading to a $2 trillion dol lar deficit tha t ev eryon e else will have to deal with. Wel l, I'm g oing t o tell you something Broward County, we're gonna do everything we can over these next three days and God willing, we are gonna win this election and joe and I are about to get rid of that tax cut and invest that money in working people and in our families invest that money in an infrastructure plan. That is gonna be about, yes, building back up our roads and our bridges, but also investing in renewable energies. It is going to create millions of jobs. We are going to invest that money, understanding that any young person coming from a family that makes less than 100 and $25,000 will go to a four year public college for free, including an HBCU because that that's how we build up. An d as joe likes to s ay, build back better i nvest in the american, peopl e inve st in our young peop le , invest in our fam ilies and boy, the return o n that inves tment is profo und. We are deali ng with crises a long overdu e reckoning on the issue of ra cial injusti ce in America. And you have joe bein g a student of america n history and h avi ng the courage t o speak truth. Who has the abi lity, abil ity a nd willingnes s t o speak th e phrase black l ives matter, joe who says we must speak truth no matter how difficul t it may be. For some t o hear, we mus t acknowl edge racial disp arities. We mu st acknowledge What the virus has h ighlighted. For examp le, in our health care system. Whe n African Americans and Latinos are thre e times as likely to contra ct the virus and t wice as likel y to die from it. Wh en bla ck women are 3 -4 times likely t o die in childbirth as compared to other wome n. Whe n our native amer ican bro thers a nd sisters have t he highest r ates of dia bete s of any population in o ur country, we must speak truth a bout these things an d address them with the mo tivation being that w e have to have a s ociety that is built on a respe ct for the c oncep t of eq uality and r eac hing e quality through initiativ es that are a bout ach ieving equity. On the other hand, y ou have donal d trump who on t he debate stage in the f irst debate, we all remember refused to condemn white supremacists and then went on to double do wn and talk ab out, stand back and st and by . And I think it's really imp ortant to put this in context and to understand a pattern. W e have witnes sed a p atter n that started before he was run ning for preside nt, where he questi oned the l egitim acy of th e first bla ck president of th e United States. We're on the issue o f Charlottesville, w here th ere were peaceful protesters p rotesti ng rac ial injustic e in A merica. A young w oman died in that pr otes t. And on the other si de, there were neo nazis wearing s wastikas carrying tiki torches, spewing r acial anti Se mitic slur s. And the Presiden t of the United States s ays there we re fine people on bo th sides. Th e Presiden t of the Uni ted States was called Mexi cans, rap ists and cri minals who as one of h is f irst orders of business pu t in p lace a m uslim ban. A nd here's the thing, we are better than this . We are so much be tter than t his thing about who we are a s americans and as a people is we kno w that the re al measur e of streng th is not me asured based on who you bea t down. It is measured based on who yo u lift up. And many of us kno w joe and let me tell you something joe in his heart and h is soul is someone who is deeply c ommitted to unifying our countr y. He and I know and we al l know re gardless of where you live. Your race, your e thnicity, you yo ur gender or the lan guage your g randmot her speaks. We al l know that the vast majority of us have so m uch more in common tha n what separates us and we want and need a president who leads with th at spirit. Yeah. And on the list of cri ses, florida knows this well. We are dealing with a cl i mate crisis. It is undeniable. You know, I com e from Ca lifornia. The wildfi res are bur ning up th e west coast of our cou ntry from California Oregon Washingto n colorado. I've met with and visite d with fami lies that have been e vacuated f rom th eir home never to b e ab le to return . I have visited with firefi ght ers that are putting out fires while t heir own homes are burning. My brother in la w's a firefighter. When you look at the gul f coast states ne ighbors to h ear, includ ing the st ate the stor ms, do you know, we've ha d five named storms in our cou ntry this y ear and we named the storm because it 's really bad what we've se en in ter ms of the midw est an d the floods th at have caused farmers to lose a whole sea son of crop s. And so joe says, hey, this is undeniable. Let u s embrace t he science on this. Let us tr eat this with a sens e of urgency and p ut in plac e timeline s like the g oal of net zero emissions by 20 50. Let us understand t hat all of us need to breathe c lean air and drink cl ean water , joe understands this i s also a civil r ig hts and human rights issue. When you look at the f act that in all of the jurisd ictions of poor air qualit y in our coun try, In 70% of them, it' s people of colo r who live d the re, joe unders tand s that when we ta lk about this crisis, t here i s a moment of o pportunity in this crisis wh ich is to invest in renewable energie s or invest in wind turbine s and solar pa neling, invest in bui lding up the s ki lls of America's workforce to take on the jobs that are necessar y to confront this cris is and invest ment in our infrast ructure, which which w ill create mi llions of job s. Joe u nderstan ds that on the other han d, you have donald tru mp who when he wa s asked abou t the wildfi res in Califo rnia. S o the journ alist asked something al ong t he lines of s o Mr Presiden t, these wildfires are happening, p eop le are suffer ing. Um and the scienti sts are telling us t here's a connection between this and the e xtreme weathe r condition s and and h uman behavio rs that have con tributed. The Presi dent of the United States of Ame rica, who i s also the Commander in chief of the Uni ted Sta tes of America, responded by saying Science doesn't know. Scien ce doesn't know th is is what the pre sident of ou r country said. And so here's the thing Mr . Pre sident Science d oes. No. And so does the major sci entific magazine which has endorse d joe biden for Pr esident of the United State s. So we' re dealing with a lot. I t's a lot. It's a lot. It is. But w e're all here to gether. We're all here t ogether. And ye s, these momen ts, you kn ow, an d in particular whe n you compo und it with what we have had to do to deal with th is virus and social isolation and the distancing, look at all o f us, you know, we can't even shake hand s and hug were we aring masks. It has a tende ncy to really make people fee l alone. An d I think that what 's im portant about this aftern oon and what y ou all hav e been doing throughout really mak es a statement that we are not alone. And that then bring s up one of the reason s for my visit toda y, which i s the import ance of votin g, voting tod ay and tomorr ow. In terms of ear ly voting, early v oting is critically important. And then o f course voting on Tuesday an d you know, many people c ome up to me and probabl y to you and they say why should I vote? And I think there are three reasons people should vote . One is to honor the ancestors. Yeah , honor the an cestors. People like a friend of Ted and Debbie and mine, our colleague, the g reat, great, great america n hero, john Lewis, john Lewis who told us you lo ve your country, ge tting good trou ble, john Lewis who sh ed his blo od on that Edmund Pettu s bri dge so that in particular bl ack people co uld vote, b ut that all p eople could vo te, john Lewis who by the way also unders tood it was a civil rights is sue. And there is a cont inuum of the fights that we ha ve h ad and contin ue to have for civil rights, john Lewi s who by the w ay, was front and center, fighting f or marriage equality, john Lewis, by the way, who was front and c enter saying we sh ould fight fo r the dreamer s. Let's hono r the ancestors. Th at's a reason to v ote. It's a reason to vot e. Is we just c elebrat ed this year, the 100th anni versary of the 1 9th amendm ent, right among the ancestors, those suffragettes who wearing t heir whit e marched and shouted and fought fo r a woman's right to vote. It's impo rtant also beca use we also have to speak truth, um, b lack women can vote until 1965, s o we've got to d eal wit h that too . But yes, let's hono r the ancest ors. That's a rea sonable reason. Numbe r two, everything is a t stake, E verything is at sta ke. Everythin g we have already discu ssed, including our stan ding in a global world, the integrity of our nation. You know, one of the things about w here we have been in A merica's streng th around th e world. Yes, w e ha ve one of the finest militaries, but ou r strength also c omes from the fact tha t we were known f or the m ost part of being a nation that kept its word. That we knew the differe nce betwe en our allies and our adversaries that we hon ore d our commitments, including ou r traditions that include a respect and r everence for the ru le of law, for th e sanctity of one's e lection sys tem and the nee d to protect it from foreign interference, things l ike that. Yeah, so there's everything at stake. Eve rything is at stake. Reas on. Numbe r three, I've been tr aveling aro und the country this I ju st actu ally was just in flo rida I think a w eek, week a nd a half ag o. Um been to Georgia, north Car olina. Um yesterday I wa s in texas. I' ve been to, yeah , that the y're do ing a great job in texa s. Um I was in Neva da Ariz ona, you get the pl ane michigan A ll over our country. You kn ow, starting in terms of recent h istory, starting with 201 3 when the Supreme Court gutted the Votin g Right s Act Where it basi cal ly took the tee th o ut of our ability to protect against st ates t hat have a his tory of discriminating agai nst voter s. So ba ck since 2013, probably almos t two dozen states enacted laws that h ave been designed to suppr ess the vote targeting a frican american vote rs, voters of color students, um native am ericans, you name it. And so much so that in north Carolina, a cour t that reviewed the law that th ey passed said i t w as designed with quote surgica l precision to prevent in that case black people from v oting. So we've been seeing this happen. We know all of th ese what we' ve seen here in flori da. I m ean, yo u know , t he attempt to make voters c onfused t he attempt t o make it difficult. U m, we've see n around the c ountry, you kn ow, so I was in tex as yester day in Ho uston Har ris Count y, you kn ow, like that . Um, and th ey i n texas One , they' re a ll owing one dropb ox per county. And i n Ha rri s County, the re are 1 1 mi llion people guy s, one dr op box in other states. We're seeing , you know, this thing abou t you gotta, if you're gonna v ote by mail, you fill out y our ballot and th en you can put it in one envelope, but don't forget to put it into that secon d envelope and t hen you gotta sign that. And then in some st ates, you kn ow, somebody else has to sign it, all kinds of stuff . We're seeing, you know, th e President of the Uni ted States e ssentially took that debate sta ge and openly encourage d the suppre ssion of the vote. So I bring all this up to say, one has t o ask why a re s o many important pe ople going out o f thei r way to make it so difficult an d conf using for us to vote? And I do believe the answer is b ecause they k now our power, they know o ur power, th ey kn ow when we vote, things c hange, they know w hen we v ote, w e win. So let's n ot ever let anyone take our p ower from us . We know we h ave the power tha t in our democrac y, the powe r is with the pe ople. You know , people ask me all the ti me , well, what d o you think is gon na happen the day after the electio n? I said, lo ok, there is no question tha t over these l ast almos t four year s our democracy has ta ken a beating. Th e rule of law, res pe ct for the rule o f law, the respect for the ind ependence of the Depa rtment of Justice. I mean, I could go down the list, Right. No question . It has tak en a beating. You kn ow, you alm ost want to thin k about lik e a hurricane hit a house. Yes . Some o f the shingles h ave fallen off, but the hous e is still standin g. I do believ e that Ame rica's dem ocr acy will always b e as strong a s our wil lingness to fi ght for it. And so t hat's why we're all hang ing o ut togethe r this afternoo n be cause we are prepared to do just that. We are prepared to do what is necessary to stand up for this country we love. And so my last point then is this, this moment will pass. It will pass and years from now. Our Children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes, each one of us and they will ask us where were you at that moment in time and what we will be able to tell them Broward County is so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized, we mobilized. We will tell them we emailed and we text and we called everyone we knew repeatedly until they got sick of us but we knew they'd get over it. We will tell them that we reminded people that we are all in this together. We will tell them that we reminded everyone we know of their individual power. We reminded them that the power in our country comes from the people and we will tell them we elected joe biden the next president of the United States. Thank you Broward County. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mhm. Yeah. Work your thank you. Yeah for so many girls I hate","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477609-1\/senator-kamala-harris-campaigns-broward-county-florida","Summary":"Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke to campaign supporters in Broward County, Florida.","Source":"477609-1","Type":"Speech","Original Source":null,"Location":null}

VALUES THAT ARE ABOUT UPLIFTING AND SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES, VALUES THAT ARE ABOUT HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO SPEAKS TRUTH AND CONDUCTS HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT INSPIRES GOOD WORK, IN A WAY THAT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATING OTHER FOLKS WITH DIGNITY. JOE AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THEY HOLD THE OFFICE IN THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD LOOK AT TWO , TO FIGURE OUT THEIR JOB IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AT LEAST 4 CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY THIS PANDEMIC. OVER 225,000 AMERICANS IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE DIED. MANY, SO SADLY , AND MANY SO SADLY WITHOUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BEING PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. PEOPLE, WHO THEIR LAST HOURS ON THIS EARTH HAD TO BE SPENT WITHOUT HOLDING THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THEY LOVE. OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS WITH UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING, OTHER LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. THE THING ABOUT THIS IS A DID , IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE SO BAD. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, BUT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE NOW KNOW ON JANUARY 28 ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS VIRUS, KNEW ON JANUARY 28 WHEN HE WAS TOLD IT WAS FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT IS AIRBORNE AND LETHAL, AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE SAT ON IT. HE COVERED IT UP. HE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IT WAS A HOAX. AND HERE'S THE THING , CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE AND HOW YOU WOULD HAVE PLANNED AS A PARENT, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, AS A TEACHER IF YOU HAD KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28? HOW YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN READY FOR THIS? BECAUSE, REMEMBER, EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC , HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY , EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT WERE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE RENT. AND, BY THE WAY, IN A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, OUR BELIEF IS YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE RENT, BUT IMAGINE HOW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PREPARED. HOW PEOPLE, KNOWING THAT MOST WORKING FAMILIES DON'T HAVE MORE THAN $1000 IN LIFE SAVINGS, WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE PUT ASIDE, KNOWING IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN FOR A WHILE. TEACHERS, PARENTS, HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE PREPARED FOR THE FACT THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF CRITICAL EDUCATION , DAYS, MONTHS, WEEKS , AND HOW WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN READY. I MEAN, I JOKE ABOUT IT, BUT HOW WE MIGHT HAVE JUST BOUGHT A COUPLE EXTRA ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER. HAD WE KNOWN. BUT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TELL ANYBODY, YOU SEE, BECAUSE HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS POLITICAL PROSPECTS THAN HE WAS ABOUT AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS, DONALD TRUMP, WITH HIS BOY BILL BARR, ARE IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO SUE TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA TOGETHER WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CREATED TO OFFER HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT, WHICH COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND SAID IT'S NOT RIGHT TO DENY FOLKS COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WITH LUPUS OR A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. [CHEERING AND HONKING] ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGE OF THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF OBAMACARE, EXPAND COVERAGE, BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, BRING DOWN PREMIUMS, WE ARE GOING TO LOWER THE ELIGIBILITY AGE FOR MEDICARE TO AGE 60. JOE BIDEN SAYS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WE'VE GOT TO STOP THINKING ABOUT THE BODY STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN. WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP. THAT'S CALLED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S JOE BIDEN'S APPROACH. AND THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP, WHO WANTS TO GET RID OF ALL THESE PROTECTIONS AND HAS THE GALL TO SUGGEST AS THOUGH WE ARE NOT WATCHING THAT WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER. THERE ARE REAL CLEAR CHOICES IN THIS ELECTION. ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IN LARGE PART HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC, YOU'VE GOT OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS WHO JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE ARE LOOKING AT IN FLORIDA, ONE IN NINE FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS HAVING BEEN HUNGRY. IN FLORIDA, IN ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED AN INABILITY OR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. IN FLORIDA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES OUT OF BUSINESS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN. ON THE ECONOMY, HERE'S THE THING , YOU ASK JOE BIDEN HOW IS THE ECONOMY DOING, AND YOU KNOW WHAT JOE BIDEN ASKS , HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? THAT IS HOW JOE BIDEN THINKS. JOE BIDEN SAYS, YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS. JOE BIDEN SAYS I UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS TO CREATE WEALTH IN A FAMILY IS HOMEOWNERSHIP, SO WE WILL HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN SAYS WORKING FAMILIES SHOULD NEVER PAY MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU GOT DONALD TRUMP, WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, ASKS ABOUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING, ASKS ABOUT HOW RICH PEOPLE ARE DOING. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU GUYS , WE ARE GOING TO TURN EVERYBODY OUT TO EARLY VOTE TODAY AND TOMORROW, AND THOSE WHO DID NOT GET AROUND TO IT, ALTHOUGH WE WANT THEM TO GET AROUND TO IT, ARE GOING TO GET THEM TO VOTE ON ON ELECTION DAY, AND GOD WILLING WE WENT ON ELECTION DAY, JOE BIDEN AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND CORPORATIONS. AND WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT IS ABOUT BUILDING BACK UP OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND INVESTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE CREATION OF JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM FAMILIES WHO MAKE LESS THAN $125,000 SO YOU GO TO A 4-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGE FOR FREE, INCLUDING AN HBCU, BOTH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS WHO COME OUT OF SCHOOL AND GRADUATE AND DECIDE TO GO INTO A JOB THAT MIGHT BE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT PAYS LESS THAN $125,000 AND ERASE YOUR DEBT. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE DESERVE. THESE CRISES , THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS , AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LONG OVERDUE ON RACIAL , OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [CHEERING AND HONKING] ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, A STUDENT OF AMERICAN HISTORY, SOMEONE WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH, WHO HAS THE COURAGE THEN TO SPEAK THE PHRASE BLACK LIVES MATTER. [CHEERING AND HONKING] JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS LOOK, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO HEAR, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR SOME TO SPEAK, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH OUR HISTORY. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENT. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES ACROSS FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR TO THE ECONOMY TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOW FIGURED OUT FROM COVID HOW THESE THINGS MANIFEST THEMSELVES TO THE POINT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO AMERICANS ARE EXPERIENCING THREE TIMES THE CONTRACTION OF COVID AND DYING AT TWICE THE RATE OF OTHER POPULATIONS. WE NEED TO SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDBIRTH THAN OTHER WOMEN. SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES OF ANYBODY IN OUR COUNTRY. AND LET'S CONFRONT THESE TRUTHS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO AT THAT DEBATE , AT THAT DEBATE , REMEMBER THE FIRST DEBATE? REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID STAND BACK AND STAND BY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THIS WAS NOT A ONE-OFF. THERE IS A PATTERN AT PLAY HERE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO CAMPAIGNED AND CAME INTO FAME RUNNING FOR OFFICE QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S SEE THE PATTERN HERE WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE PEOPLE WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE, A WOMAN DIED, AND ALL THE OTHERS, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, HURLING RACIAL AND ANTI-SEMITIC EPITHETS, AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ASKED, HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. BECAUSE, YOU SEE, JOE KNOWS , JOE KNOWS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF ANYONE'S STRENGTH AND IN PARTICULAR, THE TRUE MEASURE OF A LEADER'S STRENGTH IS NOT BASED ON WHO YOU BEAT DOWN. IT'S BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, LOOK, PALM BEACH, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF HEALING TO DO. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF REPAIR TO DO. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, JOE, IN HIS HEART AND IN HIS SOUL, IS COMMITTED TO UNIFYING OUR COUNTRY. JOE KNOWS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, YOUR ETHNICITY, YOUR AGE, YOUR GENDER, THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, JOE KNOWS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [APPLAUSE AND HONKING] THE CRISIS INCLUDES , FLORIDA KNOWS THIS WELL , A CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU ALL KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THE WEST COAST OF OUR COUNTRY, FROM CALIFORNIA, OREGON, WASHINGTON, OVER TO COLORADO HAS BEEN BURNING. I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO BE EVACUATED FROM THEIR HOMES, NEVER TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. I HAVE MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. UP AND DOWN THE GULF COAST, WE HAVE SEEN FIVE NAMED STORMS JUST THIS YEAR. AND YOU KNOW YOU NAME A STORM BECAUSE IT IS REALLY BIG AND HARMFUL. WE HAVE SEEN IN THE MIDWEST FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. SO JOE SAYS, WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND PUT IN PLACE TIMELINES. WE NEED TO HAVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES. WE NEED TO INVEST IN SOLAR AND WIND, AND JOE KNOWS THAT ALL OF THIS IS ALSO BUILDING BACK UP OUR ECONOMY. IT WILL BE ABOUT CREATING JOBS. IT WILL BE ABOUT PARTNERING WITH THE CARPENTERS AND THE PLUMBERS AND ELECTRICIANS KNOWING THAT THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING UP THE SKILLS OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE TO BE A LEADER ONCE AGAIN ON A GLOBAL CRISIS ISSUE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA, THEY ASKED HIM AND BASICALLY SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, WILDFIRES ARE HAPPENING AND SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND EXTREME CONDITIONS THAT ARE HUMAN CAUSED, AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDED BY SAYING SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT IS THAT? MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE DOES KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND HONKING] SO THERE'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY VISIT TODAY AND US COMING TOGETHER THIS BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE , EVERYBODY IS A LEADER HERE. YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE IF YOU WERE NOT A LEADER, AND I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU WHAT THEY ASKED ME, AND THEY ASKED ME, KAMALA, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? PEOPLE ASK ME WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE. ONE IS TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [HONKING] THIS YEAR, WE JUST LOST A GREAT AMERICAN HERO IN CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS. [HONKING IN CHEERING] LET'S HONK FOR JOHN LEWIS. I KNOW HE HEARS US. I KNOW HE HEARS US. [CAR HORNS HONKING] I KNOW HE HEARS US. JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT FOR US TO VOTE , IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE RIGHT OF BLACK FOLKS TO VOTE. JOHN LEWIS, WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT WHICH IS WHY IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, JOHN LEWIS WAS ALSO FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, WHY JOHN LEWIS WAS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FIGHT FOR DREAMERS. JOHN LEWIS UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE CONNECTED. LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. LET'S REMEMBER THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, WHICH GAVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SO LET'S HONOR ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO WOULD MARCH AND SHOUT FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. WHILE WE REMEMBER HISTORY, WE MUST ALSO SPEAK TRUTH THAT NOT UNTIL 1965 COULD BLACK WOMEN VOTE, SO WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, TOO, BUT LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. THAT'S A REASON TO VOTE. REASON NUMBER 2 , EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE HEALTH , LITERALLY THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. LET US ALSO TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR DREAMERS. LET US TALK ABOUT THE FIGHT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER OWN BODY. LET'S TALK ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF OUR COUNTRY ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND RESTORING THE PRINCIPLES OF A RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRACY. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE AT STAKE AND SO MUCH MORE. THE THIRD REASON TO VOTE, I BELIEVE, IS THIS , FLORIDA, WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY. IT IS HISTORIC IN NATURE BUT I WILL GO BACK TO RECENT HISTORY IN 2013, YOU REMEMBER THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WITH SHALL BE V HOLDER. AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, ABOUT TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE LAWS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO PURGE THE VOTERS ROLLS, RIGHT? AWFUL THINGS. IN FACT, SO MUCH SO THAT NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WILL GO BACK, THE COURT THAT REVIEWED WHAT THEY DID SAID THEY WROTE THE LAW WITH \"SURGICAL PRECISION\" TO PREVENT BLACK PEOPLE FROM VOTING. BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, EFFORTS TO MAKE PEOPLE OF COLOR , STUDENTS, NATIVE AMERICANS , MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO VOTE. HERE IN FLORIDA, WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. I MEAN, I'M TRAVELING THE COUNTRY. I WAS IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, RIGHT? I WAS IN HOUSTON AS MY LAST STOP. HARRIS COUNTY , I LOVE THE WORD , HARRIS COUNTY. YOU KNOW IN TEXAS THEY PASSED A RULE FOR ONLY ONE DROPBOX PER COUNTY FOR DROPPING OFF YOUR BALLOT, AND IN HARRIS COUNTY, THAT'S 4 MILLION PEOPLE. IN OTHER STATES, THEY ARE SAYING IF YOU WANT TO VOTE BY MAIL, YOU HAVE TO FILL IT OUT AND PUT IT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND PUT THE ENVELOPE IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE, AND YOU'VE GOT TO SIGN IT AND IN OTHER PLACES, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNS IT. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO VOTE. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE US WEARY AND TIRED AND OVERWHELMED. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS. THEY EVEN STOOPED SO LOW AS TO MESS WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE! SOME OF THE NICEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE POSTAL WORKERS. [HONKING] WHY ARE THEY DOING ALL THIS? THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT MUST BE ASKED , WHY WOULD SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? THAT IS THE QUESTION FOR US TO ASK, AND HERE IS I BELIEVE WHAT IS THE ANSWER. THEY ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET US ALWAYS KNOW OUR POWER. AND AT ELECTION TIME, THE POWER OF OUR VOICE IS THROUGH OUR VOTE. AND HERE IS MY LAST POINT , THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US , WHERE WERE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? AND WHAT WE, PALM BEACH, WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN A PARKING LOT THIS PARTICULAR SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH KAMALA AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED AND MOBILIZED. WE WILL TELL THEM WE EMAILED AND CALLED FOLKS AND TEXTED UNTIL FOLKS GOT TIRED OF HEARING FROM US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD GET OVER IT. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE ELECTED JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] THANK YOU, PALM BEACH. THANK YOU.

I AM BACK IN GEORGIA TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THESE YEARS, MONTHS, WEEKS AND DAYS. LOOKING AT THE KIND OF TURNOUT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN TERMS OF EARLY VOTING. I WANTED TO COME BACK TO REMIND US THAT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. THAT LAST LEG OF A LONG TRIP IS USUALLY THE LONGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO LET UP. THIS IS THE TIME TO PUT OUR FEET ON THAT PETAL AND GO. LET'S GET THIS THING DONE. MAKE SURE EVERYONE VOTES, THAT THEY DROP OFF THEIR BALLOTS IN DROP BOXES. DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MAILBOX, PUT IT IN THE DROPBOX. OR VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AT LEAST FOUR CRISES. JOE AND I TALK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME. THE FIRST TWO, A PANDEMIC. I AM JUST GOING TO COME DEAR , COME DOWN HERE. [APPLAUSE] LET'S AVOID A CATASTROPHE. [LAUGHTER] OK. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FEW CRISES. FOR A LOT OF , FOR ALL OF THE FRIENDS IN THE CARS, I AM THINKING ABOUT YOU EVEN IF YOU CAN'T SEE ME. [HONKING] THERE WE GO. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF A PROPORTION WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST MASS CASUALTY WITH EVENTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SINCE WORLD WAR II. OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY FOR THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH WERE NOT ABLE TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED, TO HOLD THEIR HANDS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE VIRUS. 9 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS WITH UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING. THE THING IS, IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS. HE WAS TOLD IT IS FIVE TIMES AS DEADLY AS THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT CAN IMPACT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT WAS AIRBORNE. WHAT DID HE DO? HE COVERED THAT INFORMATION UP. HE SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS A HOAX. HE MINIMIZED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS. HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS NOW WHERE WE ARE. ON TOP OF IT, HE HAD THE GALL TO BE IN COURT WITH BILL BARR TO TRY TO SUE TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN PASSED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME GAVE PROTECTIONS TO PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, SURVIVOR OF BREAST CANCER. [HONKING] THEY WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. THEY WANT TO SUE TO GET RID OF IT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO EXPAND OBAMACARE. WE NEED TO EXPAND IT TO THE POINT WE BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS. BRING DOWN THE AGE OF MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY AT AGE 60. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN, IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP. THAT IS CALLED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. LET'S LOOK AT THE CRISES WE ARE FACING IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS. OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN EIGHT HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING A MEMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD , IF NOT THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD , AS BEING HUNGRY. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING AN INABILITY OR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT. HERE IN GEORGIA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. POTENTIALLY NEVER ABLE TO REOPEN. AGAIN, THERE IS A REAL CLEAR DIFFERENCE. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY WHEN ASKED, JOE SAYS IS YOU TELL ME HOW OUR WORKING PEOPLE , HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? JOE SAYS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, LET'S NOT EVER RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WE WILL ALSO BRING DOWN THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RATE. WE WILL PASS A BILL THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS , FOR DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS. JOE SAYS NO WORKING FAMILY SHOULD PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY , ASKS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. ASKS ABOUT RICH PEOPLE. PASSES AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS, A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. WELL, GEORGIA, IF WE DO OUR THING THESE NEXT TWO DAYS AND GET ELECTED, JOE AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES, INVEST THAT MONEY ON BUILDING UP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE ARE ABOUT TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS COMING FROM HOMES THAT LESS THAN $125,000 TO SAY IF YOU ARE COMING FROM SUCH A HOME, YOU WILL PAY NOTHING FOR A FOUR YEAR , A FULL YEAR IN COLLEGE OR HBCU. PRIVATE OR PUBLIC. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY AND COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO HAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT IF THEY TAKE ON A JOB IN PUBLIC SERVICE OR A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN 100 WHEN A $5,000 AND ERASE THEIR DEBT. WE WILL INVEST IN THE AMERICAN WORKER AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY. GEORGIA, THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. A CLEAR CHOICE. IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL, WE ARE HAVING A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN, A STUDENT OF AMERICA'S HISTORY, SOMEONE WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH, HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK THE PHRASE \"BLACK LIVES MATTER.\" [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] JOE BUDDEN SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH IT. DEAL WITH THE HISTORY THAT HAS RESULTED IN STARK DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, WEALTH DISPARITIES. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THIS ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WE WILL DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE THE RECORDS OF PEOPLE CONVICTED. WE WILL SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS. WE WILL END THE CASH BAIL SYSTEM, WHICH IS NOT ONLY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE, BUT AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. WE WILL REQUIRE BETTER POLICING. YOU WILL BANNED CHOKEHOLD, BECAUSE GEORGE FORD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF THAT WERE THE CASE. WE WILL REQUIRE A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE LAW, BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T BE THEY GET TO BE FIRED IN ONE PLACE, AND GO TO ANOTHER AND GET HIRED THERE. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHEN WE SEE THAT BLACKS AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO TRACK , TO CONTRACT COVID. WHEN WE SEE THAT OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY. BLACK WOMEN ARE 3-4 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN OTHER WOMEN. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO, AT THAT DEBATE , REMEMBER THAT FIRST DEBATE? AT THAT DEBATE, REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DID NOT STOP THERE. HE DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID, \"STAND BACK AND STAND BY YOUR COAT GEORGIA, HERE'S THE THING. IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS A ONE-OFF. WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR THINKING ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CAREER, HE HAD THE GALL TO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST PRESIDENT. DON'T FORGET CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE FOLKS WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. AND ON THE OTHER THERE WAS A GROUP OF NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, SPEWING RACIAL AND ANTI-SEMITIC EPITHETS. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID THEY WERE FINE PEOPLE ON EACH SIDE. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID MEXICANS WERE RAPISTS. WHO HAS HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS PUT IN PLACE A MUSLIM BAN. GEORGIA, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE DESERVE THEM THIS. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, YOUR GENDER, OR AGE, THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AMERICA KNOWS WE NEED A LEADER LIKE JOE BIDEN, WHO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER, WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE REAL MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT LEAST ON WHO YOU BE DOWN, IT IS BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. WE HAVE A REAL CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. NOT TO MENTION THE CRISIS YOU'RE FACING, IT IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I COME FROM CALIFORNIA, BUT THE WEST COAST IS BURNING. WASHINGTON, OVER TO COLORADO, WILDFIRES. I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES EVACUATED, NEVER TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. I HAVE MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES WERE BURNING. IN FACT, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. IN THE GULF COAST STATES. YOU'RE LOOKING AT , WE HAVE HAD FIVE NAMED STORMS JUST THIS YEAR. YOU NAME A STORM BECAUSE IT IS THAT BIG. IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. SO, JOE BIDEN SAYS, HEY, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY OF THIS. WE NEED TO HAVE TIMELINES LIKE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND WIND TURBINES, AND SOLAR PANELING , AND LET US UNDERSTAND, THIS IS ABOUT THE CREATION OF JOBS. MILLIONS OF JOBS. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS. ALL OF THE POOR AIR QUALITY DISTRICT IN OUR COUNTRY. 70% OF THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE PLACES ARE PEOPLE OF CALLER. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, I KID YOU NOT , SO, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTION WENT SOMETHING LIKE, SO, THE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE IS HUMAN BEHAVIORS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE WILDFIRES. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDED BY SAYING, SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT IS THAT? HERE IS THE THING, MR. PRESIDENT. SCIENCE DOES NOW. AND SO DOES THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE THAT ENDORSED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. THAT BRINGS ME TO TODAY. AND THIS VOTE. SO, ARE VIRTUE OF US BEING HERE TOGETHER, THIS IS A GROUP OF LEADERS. THIS IS A GROUP OF LEADERS. SO, LIKE YOU, I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY FOLKS, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE REASONS. ONE, LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] HONOR THE ANCESTORS. AND GEORGIA, FOR YOU THIS IS A PARTICULAR POINT OF PRIDE. IN THAT MOST INCREDIBLE ANCESTOR WHO WAS A GREAT AMERICAN HERO BY THE NAME OF JOHN LEWIS. AND WHAT WE KNOW HE DID IN SHEDDING BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE , HE GOT ARRESTED 40 TIMES. GOT IN GOOD TROUBLE, TOLD US TO GET IN GOOD TROUBLE. YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT JOHN , AND LUCY KNOWS THIS , HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING. JOHN ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS IS AN EXTENSION FOR OUR RIGHTS , OUR FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. JOHN WAS FRONT AND CENTER ON THE FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, JOHN WAS FRONT AND CENTER FIGHTING FOR DR. AND FAIRNESS AND , DACA AND FAIRNESS. THAT IS THE REASON TO VOTE. TO HONOR , WE JUST CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES IN THEIR WHITE MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. OF COURSE, WHILE WE REMEMBER HISTORY, YOU MUST REMEMBER IT ACCURATELY. BLACK WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE UNTIL 1965. SO, WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. REASON NUMBER ONE, HONOR THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SO MANY ISSUES. LET'S TALK ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. LET'S TALK ABOUT RENEWING PROTECTIONS FOR DACA. LET'S TALK ABOUT PAY EQUITY AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE ALL PEOPLE GET PAID EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. REASON NUMBER THREE. THIS BRINGING , BRINGS ME BACK TO WHERE I STARTED, TALKING ABOUT THE WORK OF STACEY ABRAMS. WHICH IS THIS. WHICH IS THIS. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY AGAIN. I HAVE COME TO GEORGIA MANY TIMES. I WAS IN FLORIDA. I WAS IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, AND FLORIDA. I WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WAS IN MICHIGAN. NORTH CAROLINA, I'M GOING THERE AFTER I LEAVE HERE. WHAT I DON'T NEED TO TELL GEORGIA, BUT I WILL JUST REMIND US ALL. ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY , AND IN PARTICULAR SINCE 2013 AND THE SUPREME COURT EDIT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE LAWS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE. YOU KNOW HERE IN GEORGIA THEY WERE PURGING THE VOTER ROLLS. WE HAVE SEEN IN TEXAS HOW THEY WERE PICKING UP DROP BOXES. THEY PUT A THING IN TEXAS , ONE DROPBOX PER COUNTY. I WAS IN HARRIS COUNTY, WHERE HOUSTON IS, 4 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE THERE. THEY HAVE ONE DROPBOX. IN STATES THEY ARE SAYING IF YOU DO A MAIL-IN BALLOT, HAVE TO PUT IN ONE ENVELOPE, THEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SEAL THAT, AND PUT IT IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE, BUT IN SOME PLACES YOU'VE GOT TO BE CASH YOU GET TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE , YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNED IT? TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT. THERE WERE EVEN MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE. I MEAN, THE NICEST PEOPLE WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE. AND SO, WE HAVE GOT TO ASK, WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? AND I DO BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. [APPLAUSE] THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO, LET US NOT LET EVER ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. IT IS OURS. AT ELECTION TIME, THE POWER OF OUR VOICE IS THROUGH OUR VOTE AND WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED. WE WILL NOT BE SIDELINED. WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS MY LAST POINT. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS MY LAST POINT. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND WE WERE HANGING OUT IN A PARKING LOT TOGETHER. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED AND MOBILIZED. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE CALLED AND TEXTED EVERYBODY WE KNEW TO THE POINT THAT THEY GOT TIRED OF US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD GET OVER IT. AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE ELECTED JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU ALL.

Tomorrow's election day in abo ut 2 4 hours. Penn sylvania will determine who will be the next presid ent of the United States . Mhm. And, you know, I did an eve nt earlier, and I just decided, You know, I'm k ind of done ta lking abou t the guy in the White Hou se. So if you all don' t mind, I'm j ust gonna talk about Joe. L et's talk a bout Joe. Le t's do that. Let's do tha t. So, you know, Joe has b een talking ab out the fact that t his is a m oment tha t really require s rie l leadership i n o ur country because we're going through so many crise s that all hit at the s ame time. And so Joe talks abou t four crises in particular, um , one abou t obv iously this pu blic health pandemic, right? It 's kill ed over 225,000 Americans in just th e last se veral months. A nd you know what b reaks everybody 's heart is kn owing how ma ny people spent their last hours days on E arth without ah fami ly member nearby. You know, from any of us, I have experienced losin g a family member th at you love an d not being able to actu ally just being with them and hold their hand s in those la st hours off. Nine mil lion people ha ve contracted this v irus. Doc tors were talking ab out the long term h ealth consequences, including thin gs like lung sc arring. And here's the thin g. It didn't have t o be this way. It didn' t have to be thi s bad. If we had had really leadershi p in the White House. And you kn ow, h ere's th e thing . Now remember, Joe's been out of offic e , but back in Marc h, not ha ving the first half firsthand informati on that we know you kno w who had thanks to Bob Woo dward, let's alway s t hank him. Ok ay, but Joe, bac k in Mar ch without t he inside informati on, said , I know what this is . I know it is serious a nd we should tak e it seriously a nd put in pla ce a plan. J oe had a plan back in March becaus e, r emember, Joe has dedicated his l ife to pub lic service . Joe was there t o deal with Ebola. Joe know s the responsi bilit y off the th e highest office in th e land to deal wi th issues like this. So back in M arch, Joe tal ked abou t a plan Joe unders tands. When w e're deal ing with a pu blic health crisi s, we need to kick in one of the most fundamental respon sibilitie s of govern ment, which is to concern i tself with the healt h and well being of the American people. Joe understood that back when would he and President Obama, Barack Oba ma, P resident Joe Bide n vice president, pu shed through th e Affordab le Care Act , whi ch was on e of the most m ajor and inf luential public poli cies we have seen some Social S ecurity. It brought health car e to over 20 mill ion pe op le th at didn't have it. It p rotected people wit h preexis ting conditio ns. Raise y our hand or h ook if you know somebody wit h diabetes or high blo od pressure or Lup us or breast canc er Survivor And you k now, I me an, Pennsylvania kn ows Joe more than mos t. He's been far too much time in the hospital with the people he loves. He knows that what we're talking ab out. Health care. It's about understandin g that nobody should suffer that nobody should go through u nnecessary pain simply because they don't have enough money in th eir back pocket. Joe knows that access to health c are should be a right an d not just a privilege of those wh o can afford it. So e verything's at stake in this election. Because Joe is sayi ng, unlike t he other guy who's trying to get ri d of the affordable care act, Joe sa ying No, we're go nna build on m y success, meaning his s uccess, and we're gonna expand protec tio ns. We're gonna bring down the cost of p remiums, bring down t he cost of p rescription drugs. We're gonna lo wer eligibil ity for Medicare to age 60. W e're gonna deal wi th the fact tha t When we're talk ing about health c are, you gotta unders tan d the body doesn't just start fr om the neck down. It also includes the nec k up, and that 's called mental he alth care. There's a real choice in this e lection. Joe talks abo ut the fact that we're in the midst of a n economic crisi s, in large pa rt bec ause of this pandemic. But lo ok, we also know ev en before the pandemi c, far too many Ame ricans wer e working two a nd three jobs t o try a nd pay the re nt and put foo d on the table. Joe understands that in the America we believ e in, nobody sh ould have to work more than one job to pay the r ent and put food o n their table. Jo e says Y ou want to talk to me about the econo my and ask ed me how the economy is doing . Then I ask you, ho w are working peop le doing ? How are worki ng families do ing? Joe understand s that when they passed that tax bill bene fiting the t op 1% and the biggest corporat ions of Amer ica causing us to de al with a $ 2 trillio n deficit, that that wasn't about w orking peopl e and if we get done what we need to ge t done. P ennsylvania in th e next 24 hours Zhou and are ab out to get rid of that t ax bill an d invest that money i n working families. I nvest t hat money in i nfrastructure building, ba ck up our roads and b ridges, partnerin g with the building tra des, the ca rpenters and the plumbers and the electrician's knowi ng thei r apprenticeship prog rams are the best in the world. Buildin g up America's workfo rce. Investing in ou r aut o industr y, makin g our auto indu stry the largest ma nufacturer of electric vehicle s. In vesting in wo rking fami lies, not rais ing taxes on anyone making le ss than $40 0,0 00 a year but a lso investing i n working families . Knowing you s hould never pay more than 7% in your income in chi ld care. Investing in our students who co me from families who make less tha n 100,000. Ah, $125,000 saying, if you go to a f our year public sc hool, including an HBCU, you w ill go for free. Tha t's how Joe thinks abou t the economy. Ther e's a really cle ar choice in this race. Let's deal with what Joe being a s tudent of Ameri can his tory and having the coura ge to speak trut h knows we need to do with a long overdue rec koning on ra cial injus tice. in Amer ica. Joe has the courage to speak a term the other guy w ill never say . Black lives matter . Joe kno ws. Lo ok, it may be uncomfortable for some folks to her e, b ut we got to d eal with this. W e have to deal with t he fact that b lacks and La tinos have been three t imes likely to contract covert twice as likely to die from it. We need to deal with the fact that our native brothers and sist ers have the highes t rates of diabetes of any popula tion in our coun try. We need to deal w ith these things. Jo e knows that we are done with a so called leader who has spent f ull time tryin g to so hate and di vision between us trying to get Americans to turn on each other. We' re done with that. Yeah, and Joe knows that the true measure of strength of any human be ing is measured not based on who you beat dow n. It's measured based o n who you li ft up. There's a really clear choice in this election. Joe talks a bout the cl imate crisis be cause he's clear about th at, too . He's cle ar abou t the fact that y ou know you , you all k now I come f ro m California he's cl ear that the West Coa st is burning from Ca lifornia, Oreg on, Washington, ov er to Colorado. W ildfires. I've met with families who are evacuate d never to be able t o return to their home firefighte rs who are fightin g fires while their own homes are burning. My bro the r in law's a firefighter u p a nd down t he Gulf Coa st states, pe ople being battered by tho se storms. You know there have been fiv e named sto rms this year alon e, and you know they name a storm becaus e it's r eally bad in the Midwest, farmers t hat have lost t he whole season of cr ops because of the flo ods, Joe says. We need to embra ce the sc ience we ne ed to s ee. Th is is an immine nt knocking o n our door harm, and we ne ed to get to it. Bu t Joe sees in a m om ent of crisi s ah, m oment of opport un ity that thi s is the time then to in vest in inf rastruct ure, in vest in renewa ble energy. Inve st as I s aid earlier, not a uto in dus try and our i nvestment in b eing the greatest manufa cturer of electric ve hicles . Becau se, you see, that' s the ki nd of Leader Joe is. And Pennsylvania, you know, J oe, you know, J oe Joe has seen more hards hip than most shou ld ever ha ve to experi ence. Joe has suf fered more loss than anybody really should have to suffer. A nd I'm gonna tell yo u something about Joe that I know. An d I kno w, you k now, in the midst of any c risis he has faced, he sees al ways, ah, mome nt where hard work and determinat ion and faith can see you through to see the op por tunity of the moment and on all of these issues. Th at's wher e he's at because he believes in the American people. An d he believes in the stre ngth of w ho we are as a nation. So I'm here t o thank y ou all for ev erything you 've been doing thes e last year s, months, da ys, hours, I' m here to remind y ou. I mean, if yo u're her e, your leader So I'm here to remind us all that w e still got a lot of time and a lot of work lef t to do before this election is ove r. A lot of w ork to Dio, and we want to mak e sure ever yone votes and an d and as leaders, I'm sure yo u have b een approached with a question I have been a pproached with, Whi ch is why sh ould I vot e. And essentia lly, I belie ve the re are three r easons that a ll of us should vote one. Le t's honor the ancestors. Le t's honor the ancestor s. You know, this yea r we lost a great America n hero, Congressman John Lewi s, John Lew is, who fought, who shed blood on that Edmund Pe ttus Bridge for our righ t to vote and the right for b lack people to vote in America. Let's honor the anc est ors. This year we celebra ted the pa ssage of the 19 th A mendment because those suf fragettes 10 0 year s ago in all their w hite wer e marc hing and shouting, sa ying, Women h ave a right to vote to. And le t's always Bethlehem als o be true to history . Black wom en couldn't vote until 1965 . Got to deal with that. Bu t let's honor the ancestors becau se they imag ined a momen t like this wh ere they wante d us to stand up fo r our rights and stand u p for o ur ideals. So that's a reason to vote. Reason number two. Eve rything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Th e f uture of our democracy a re standing around the world. Our co mmitment to working people, o ur commitment to the d ignity and integrity of our leaders and each one of us. Everythi ng is at s take. Nu mber t hre e. You know, I've been trav eling the coun try I've bee n here in Pennsylvan ia before, of course. And I was just in Georgia . I was in North Carolina. I was in Texa s and Florida j ust in the last couple days. Um, all over o ur country, you know that there have been very, very serio us attempts bei ng made now for years to try a nd suppress the vo te attempts to try and make it difficult and confusi ng for people to vote. I mean , look, i n T exas, you know, th ey wer e picking up drop bo xes. They said there would could o nly be on e dropbox pe r county. I was in Housto n the other day, um, in in i n Harris Coun ty. I was in Hou ston, in H arris County . Four millio n peo ple live in that coun ty, one drop box in various st ates. They're sa yin g if yo u vote by mail, y ou gotta fi ll out your ballot and put it i n one en velope , and then y ou got ta pull it in a second envelo pe, and t hen yo u got to sign it right here, but in som e other states, and the n you hav e to have a third person sign it. Yea h, I'd like a diff erent p erson. It bananas, ri ght? And so all of this is hap pening, right? E mean, you e ven got. I mean, the y're even m essing with the post office lik e t he post offi ce. The nicest people work f or the po st office. They'r e messing wit h post office and you gotta and the senses. And what wh at we have to do, th ough in this moment is asked, Why do yo u think so many powerful people are going out of their way to try and make it diff icult a nd confu sing for us to vote? And I do believe it is bec ause they kn ow our power. Th ey know o ur powe r. They k now when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. S o let's not let anyone take our power from us. We will not be sidelined. We will not be silenced. We know our power. And my final point then is this. This moment will pass. And years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others, they're gonna look in our face. They're gonna look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, Where were you at that moment? They will ask us, where were you? And here's the thing I know We will tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized. We will tell them we mobilized. We will tell them We emailed and we texted and we call till folks got sick of us. But we knew They get over it and we will tell them Bethlehem that we elected Joe Biden the next president of the United States. Thank you. Work your bank? Yeah, Just because Long. And they often criticize you for your skin tone. I wanna hold your head high because you're pretty Woman. Get your runway stride home and keep it going. Believe you just Yes, I swear yourself. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me, girl. Be yourself. That's why myself it wait, Don't you get Doesn't matter if you're going all adapt.

I AM NOT JUST A BARBER, I AM A GOD-FEARING MAN WHO LOVES MY FAMILY, AND I LOVE TO BE IN BUSINESS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY TODAY IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. THEY SAY THIS ELECTION IS A BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THE NATION. WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TOMORROW TO PUT MORE SO IN OUR NATION, THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. MY WIFE AND I HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAINING OF OUR CHILDREN AND WERE THEY SHOULD GO. BUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE ALONE, BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A FAMILY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH KAMALA HARRIS AT A VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SHE BECAME AN ADDITIONAL ROLE MODEL FOR MY DAUGHTER. LET ME TELL YOU WHY. SHE HANDLED THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH GRACE. IF THERE IS ANYBODY THAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING, I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING KEMAL AND NOT CARDI. EXCUSE ME, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I'M TALKING. WHEN I LOOK AT , [INAUDIBLE] , BUT YOUR CHILDREN TO DREAM BIGGER, TO WALK TALLER, BECAUSE OF HAVING INSPIRATIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONNECTED. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HEART, WHO UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AS CITIZENS WITHIN PENNSYLVANIA, AS CITIZENS WITHIN AMERICA. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN OFFICE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS ON THE BALLOT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT , THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST LIKE ANY SPORTS TEAM. WE CANNOT JUST HAVE OUR STAR PLAYERS. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EVERY OTHER ROLE PLAYER THAT IS ELECTED BY US TO BE A PART OF THAT WINNING TEAM. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET, WE DO NEED OUR STARS. BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM THAT IS NEEDED FOR US TO WIN. [CARS HONKING] [APPLAUSE] PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE A FIRST-CLASS STATE. WE ARE FIRST-CLASS CITIZENS. I NEED US TO SHOW UP TOMORROW IN DROVES AND SHOW THE REST OF AMERICA HOW WE CAN BLOW TRUMP OUT OF THE WATER WITH A BLOWOUT! [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] IT AIN'T GOING TO BE CLOSE! [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO BE LEADERS IN THIS BLOWOUT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE PUTTING IN LEADERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE CONNECTED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ALLIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE CAN HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES IN OFFICE. WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE THAT HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT HBCUS. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I NEED FROM ALL OF US IS TO GET OUT TO VOTE. I NEED FROM ALL OF US TO TELL OTHERS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I NEED ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WE KNOW IS CHARGED UP WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN TRULY WIN. [CARS HONKING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PRIVILEGED TO INTRODUCE , I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAN EVERYONE GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [MARY J. BLIGE'S [\"WORK THAT\" PLAYS] (music) (music) GIRL, LIVE YOUR LIFE DON'T SWEAT, GIRL, BE YOURSELF FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME WORK YOUR THING OUT (LET 'EM GET MAD, THEY GONNA HATE ANYWAY) WORK YOUR THING OUT YEAH YEAH, WORK WHAT YOU GOT I'M TALKING 'BOUT THINGS THAT I KNOW (music) (music) HELLO, PENNSYLVANIA! ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] JOE IS HERE! YOU ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE HERE TO BRING THIS ELECTION HOME. BUT WE'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY. THAT IS IT. ONE MORE DAY. JOE AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR PRAYERS, YOUR LOVE, YOUR COURAGE , VOLUNTEERING AND MAKING CALLS. FOR YOUR TRUST IN US. AND FOR YOUR VOTE. AND AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, I KNOW WE ARE EMPOWERED. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF UNITY. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WENZHOU ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET , WHEN JOE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET, SAYING YES WAS EASY. HE AND I DON'T COME FROM THE SAME BACKGROUNDS, BUT WE WERE RAISED WITH THE SAME VALUES , HARD WORK, HONESTY, DECENCY, A BELIEF THAT WE ALL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I HAVE SEEN WHEN I HAVE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 84 DAYS. THE VALUES WE SHARE AS AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU CAN FEEL. YOU CAN FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL TOWN, WEARING MASKS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE LINING THE STREETS AND GATHERING ON CORNERS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. THEY ARE BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN. HOLDING UP SIGNS. WEARING THEIR COLORS AND STROLLING TO THE POLLS! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] AND WAVING THE RED WHITE AND BLUE! [APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] THE ENERGY OUT THERE IS REAL. AND IT IS INSPIRING. IN THIS BATTLE FOR THE VERY SOUL OF OUR NATION, WE HAVE SEEN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. WE HAVE SEEN WHO WE ARE. AND A WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. AND THAT IS WHY I KNOW THAT TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU HAVE VOTED. ]AND IF YOU HAVE NOT, FIND OUT WHEN AND WHERE YOU WILL GO TOMORROW. THERE IS STILL ALMOST 20 FOUR HOURS WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS DONE. HONK IF YOU HAVE BEEN SENDING TEXT AND MAKING CALLS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. [CARS HONKING] BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW FROM THE TIME THE POLLS OPEN TOMORROW MORNING UNTIL THEY CLOSE, EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. WE CANNOT LET UP BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER. AND EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. OUR HEALTH, OUR ECONOMY, OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TREATS ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW. A SUPREME COURT THAT IT ADVANCES THE LEGACY OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THAT LIVES UP, LIVES UP TO THE PHRASE ABOVE ITS ENTRANCE, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. THE DECISION WE MAKE WILL WITHOUT QUESTION LAST FOR GENERATIONS. AS I TRAVEL AROUND, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS RAVAGING OUR COUNTRY. REMEMBER, BACK IN JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP NEW JUST HOW BAD THE CORONAVIRUS WAS. THAT IT WAS DEADLY AND AIRBORNE. BUT WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERAS AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIED ABOUT IT. HE COVERED IT UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28 WHAT HE KNEW? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, WHAT YOUR FAMILY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? HOW WE AS A COUNTRY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. HE ONLY THINKS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR HIMSELF. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LOST 230,000 LIVES TO COVID. SO MANY PEOPLE FORCED TO DIE ALONE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. 230,000 AMERICANS. THE LAST TIME WE EXPERIENCED LOSS LIKE THIS WAS WORLD WAR II. IN ADDITION, WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND WE KNOW IT IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST. LATINOS ARE CONTRACTING COVID AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OTHERS. LET'S BE CLEAR. WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS WE HAVE FACED SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS, HE FAILED TO LEAD. 23 MILLION PEOPLE ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN AS BEING HUNGRY. IN AMERICA. IN ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND CONCERNED THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY. AND YET NINE MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC, THIS PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN TO CONTAIN IT. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE GREATEST FAILURE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. [CARS HONKING] ON TOP OF IT ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN COURT TRYING TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TAKE HEALTH COVERAGE AWAY FROM OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. HE'S TRYING TO END PROTECTIONS FOR THE OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES , HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR CANCER. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. MORE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR ASTHMA, OR CANCER. AMERICA, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE FIRST THING JOE AND I WILL DO WHEN WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. [CARS HONKING] WE WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WE WILL PROVIDE FREE TESTING AND TREATMENT AND, WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A SAFE VACCINE FOR ALL. WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE OPEN SAFELY AND WE WILL BILL BACK AN ECONOMY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. JOE AND I WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING UNDER $400,000 A YEAR. PERIOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] BUT WE WILL ASK THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WE WILL INVEST THOSE TAX DOLLARS TO REBUILD OUR NATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. MAKE CHILDCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND INVEST IN OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND IT DESERVES THE HEALTH CARE THAT ALL PEOPLE NEED. WE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND PROTECT AND EXPAND MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL WORK TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL EXISTS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE WILL CONFRONT, NOT CONDONE, WHITE SUPREMACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND PENNSYLVANIA, WE WILL BEGIN THE WORK OF HEALING AND REPAIRING AND UNITING OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. TOGETHER. JOE GETS THAT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. YOU SEE, JOE IS A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. HE SEES US AND HE UNDERSTANDS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED SO MUCH OF IT HIMSELF. JOE BIDEN IS A LEADER OF STRENGTH AND EMPATHY. TOUGHNESS AND HUMILITY. HE UNDERSTANDS THE MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU PUT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HE KNOWS NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHERE WE LIVE, RACE, GENDER, BACKGROUND OR FAITH, NO MATTER HOW WE IDENTIFY OR WHO WE LOVE, NO MATTER THE LANGUAGE A GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. [CARS HONKING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THIS. YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOICE IS YOUR POWER. AND DO NOT LET ANYONE TAKE YOUR POWER FROM YOU. NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP. NOW IS THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT. NOW IS THE TIME TO VOTE AND VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. IN THIS ELECTION, LET'S ABOUT LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT, VOTE LIKE JUSTICE, EQUALITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, CHARACTER, AND DIGNITY ARE ON THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THEY ARE. AND ONE DAY, ONE DAY, OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK US IN THE EYE, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHAT DID YOU DO AT THAT MOMENT? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR FUTURE. SO LET'S DO THAT. LET'S VOTE, BUT WITH CONVICTION AND CONFIDENCE AND HOPE, AND LET US ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

SO CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, BEFORE HIS PASSING, WROTE \"DEMO CRACY IS NOT A STATE, IT IS AN ACT.\" WHAT HE MEANT WAS AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY IS NOT GUARANTEED. IT IS ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO GUARD IT AND NEVER TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY TAKES STRUGGLE. IT TAKES SACRIFICE. BUT THERE IS JOY IN IT. AND THERE IS PROGRESS, BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] WHEN SHE CAME HERE FROM INDIA AT THE AGE OF 19, SHE DID NOT QUITE IMAGINE THIS MOMENT, BUT SHE BELIEVES SO DEEPLY IN AN AMERICA WHERE A MOMENT LIKE THIS IS POSSIBLE. SO I AM THINKING ABOUT HER AND THE GENERATIONS OF WOMEN, BLACK WOMEN , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ASIAN, WHITE, LATINA, NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO SURROUND OUR NATION , WHO THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAVE PAVED THE WAY FOR THIS MOMENT TONIGHT. WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR EQUALITY AND LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. INCLUDING THE BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT SO OFTEN PROVE THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED TO SECURE AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR OVER A CENTURY. 100 YEARS AGO WAS THE 19TH AMENDMENT. 55 YEARS AGO WAS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND NOW IN 2020, WITH A NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY WHO CAST THEIR BALLOTS AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE AND BE HEARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] TONIGHT I REFLECT ON THEIR STRUGGLE, THEIR DETERMINATION, AND THE STRENGTH OF THEIR VISION TO SEE WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. AND I STAND ON THEIR SHOULDERS. AND WHAT A TESTAMENT IT IS TO JOE'S CHARACTER THAT HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO BREAK ONE OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS THAT EXISTS IN OUR COUNTRY AND SELECT A WOMAN AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] BECAUSE EVERY LITTLE GIRL WATCHING TONIGHT SEES THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY OF POSSIBILITIES. AND TO THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER, OUR COUNTRY HAS SENT YOU A CLEAR MESSAGE, DREAM WITH AMBITION. LEAD WITH CONVICTION. SEE YOURSELVES IN A WAY THAT OTHERS MAY NOT, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. BUT KNOW THAT WE WILL APPLAUD YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTED FOR, I WILL STRIVE TO BE A VICE PRESIDENT, LIKE JOE WAS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA , LOYAL, HONEST, AND PREPARED. WAKING UP EVERY DAY THINKING OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. BECAUSE NOW IS WHEN THE REAL WORK BEGINS. THE HARD WORK. THE NECESSARY WORK. THE GOOD WORK. THE ESSENTIAL WORK TO SAVE LIVES AND BEAT THIS EPIDEMIC. TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY SO IT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. TO ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR SOCIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY. TO COMBAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY AND HEAL THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHO REPRESENTS THE BEST IN US.

TONIGHT WE ARE SEEING ALL OVER THIS NATION, ALL CITIES AND ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INDEED ACROSS THE WORLD, AN OUTPOURING OF JOY, OF HOPE, RENEWED FAITH IN TOMORROW TO BRING A BETTER DAY. AND I'M HUMBLED BY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. I PLEDGE TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO SEEKS NOT TO DIVIDE, BUT UNIFY. WHO DOESN'T SEE RED STATES AND BLUE STATES, ONLY SEES THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WORK WITH ALL MY HEART WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL OF YOU.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO UNITE US HERE AT HOME. IT IS THE HONOR OF MY LIFETIME THAT SO MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE VOTED FOR THAT VISION. NOW THE WORK OF MAKING THAT VISION IS REAL.

AND MY SON HUNTER AND MY DAUGHTER AND ALL OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSES AND ALL OUR FAMILY. THEY ARE MY HEART. JILL IS A MILITARY MOM, AN EDUCATOR. SHE DEDICATED HER LIFE TO EDUCATION. TEACHING IS NOT JUST WHAT SHE DOES, IT IS WHO SHE IS. FOR AMERICAN EDUCATORS, IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR Y'ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL HAVE THE HONOR , YOU JUST HEARD FROM KAMALA HARRIS. WHO WILL MAKE HISTORY AS THE FIRST WOMAN, THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN FROM SOUTH ASIAN DESCENT, THE FIRST IMMIGRANT EVER ELECTED TO THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DON'T TELL ME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND WE ARE REMINDED TONIGHT OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT SO HARD FOR SO MANY YEARS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ONCE AGAIN AMERICA HAS BENT THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE MORE TOWARD JUSTICE. KAMALA, DOUG, LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU'RE FAMILY. YOU HAVE BECOME AN HONORARY BIDEN. THERE IS NO WAY OUT. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO VOLUNTEERED AND WORKED THE POLLS IN THIS PANDEMIC, LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOU DESERVE A SPECIAL THANKS FROM THE ENTIRE NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO MY CAMPAIGN TEAM AND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND ALL WHO GAVE SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES TO MAKE THIS MOMENT POSSIBLE, IOU EVERYTHING , I OWE YOU EVERYTHING. ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED US, I AM PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN WE BUILT AND RAN. I AM PROUD OF THE COALITION WE PUT TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PROGRESSIVES, MODERATES, CONSERVATIVE, YOUNG, OLD, RURAL, SUBURBAN, GAY, STRAIGHT, TRANSGENDER, NATIVE AMERICAN. I MADE IT, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WAS AT ITS SLOWEST, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IMMUNITY , COMMUNITY STOOD UP AGAIN FOR ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ALL HAD MY BACK AND I WILL HAVE YOURS. I SAID AT THE OUTSET, I WANTED TO REPRESENT THIS CAMPAIGN, TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AMERICA. WE HAVE DONE THAT. FOR ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, I UNDERSTAND THE DISAPPOINTMENT TONIGHT. I LOST A COUPLE TIMES MYSELF. NOW LET'S GIVE EACH OTHER A CHANCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] IT IS TIME TO PUT AWAY THE HARSH RHETORIC, LOWER THE TEMPERATURE, SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AGAIN, AND TO MAKE PROGRESS, WE HAVE TO STOP TREATING OUR OPPONENTS AS AN ENEMY. THEY ARE NOT OUR ENEMIES, THEY ARE AMERICANS. THEY ARE AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE TELLS US TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON, A TIME TO BUILD, A TIME TO REAP AND A TIME TO SOW AND A TIME TO HEAL. THIS IS THE TIME TO HEAL IN AMERICA. [HONKING] NOW THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER, WHAT IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? WHAT IS OUR MANDATE? I BELIEVE IT IS THIS , AMERICA HAS CALLED UPON US TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF DECENCY, THE FORCES OF FAIRNESS, TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF SCIENCE AND FORCES OF HOPE IN THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR TIME. THE BATTLE TO CONTROL THE VIRUS. THE BATTLE TO BUILD PROSPERITY. THE BATTLE TO SECURE YOUR FAMILY'S HEALTH CARE. THE BATTLE TO ACHIEVE RACIAL JUSTICE AND ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BATTLE TO SAVE OUR PLANET BY GETTING CLIMATE UNDER CONTROL. THE BATTLE TO RESTORE DECENCY, DEFEND DEMOCRACY, AND GIVE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS ALL THEY ARE ASKING FOR, A FAIR SHOT. FOLKS, OUR WORK BEGINS WITH GETTING COVID UNDER CONTROL. WE CANNOT REPAIR THE ECONOMY OR RELISH LIFE'S MOST PRECIOUS MOMENTS HUGGING OUR GRANDCHILDREN, BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS, ALL THE MOMENTS THAT MATTER MOST TO US, UNTIL WE GET IT UNDER CONTROL. ON MONDAY, I WILL NAME A GROUP OF LEADING SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AS TRANSITION ADVISORS TO HELP TAKE THE BIDEN-HARRIS PLAN AND CONVERT IT INTO AN ACTION BLUEPRINT THAT WILL RESTORE IT ON JANUARY 2020, 20 - - 20, 2021. THAT PLAN WILL BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF COMPASSION, EMPATHY AND CONCERN. I WILL SPARE NO EFFORT, NONE, OR ANY COMMITMENT TO TURN AROUND THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS, I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME AS THOSE WHO DID. LET THIS GRIM ERA OF DEMONIZATION IN AMERICA BEGIN TO END HERE AND NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REFUSAL OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IS NOT SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, IT IS A DECISION, A CHOICE WE MAKE. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE, WE CAN DECIDE TO COOPERATE. I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE MANDATE GIVEN TO US FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WANT US TO COOPERATE IN THEIR INTERESTS. THAT IS THE CHOICE I WILL MAKE. I WILL CALL ON CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, TO MAKE THAT CHOICE WITH ME. THE AMERICAN STORY IS ABOUT A , ABOUT SLOW, YET WIDENING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN AMERICA. TOO MANY DREAMS HAVE BEEN DIFFERED FOR TOO , DEFERRED FOR TOO LONG. NO MATTER THEIR RACE, FAITH, IDENTITY OR DISABILITY. FOLKS, AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHAPED BY INFLECTION POINTS, BY MOMENTS IN TIME WHERE WE MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE. LINCOLN IN 1860 COMING TO SAVE THE UNION. FDR IN 1932 PROMISING A BELEAGUERED COUNTRY A NEW DEAL. JFK IN 1960 PLEDGING A NEW FRONTIER. AND 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN BARACK OBAMA MADE HISTORY, HE TOLD US YES, WE CAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] FOLKS, WE STAND AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT DESPAIR, TO BUILD PROSPERITY AND PURPOSE. WE CAN DO IT. I LONG TALKED ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE MUST RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. OUR NATION IS SHAPED BY THE CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN OUR BETTER ANGELS AND OUR DARKEST IMPULSES. IT'S TIME FOR OUR BETTER ANGELS TO PREVAIL. TONIGHT, THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING AMERICA. AND I BELIEVE AT OUR BEST, AMERICA IS A BEACON FOR THE GLOBE. WE WILL LEAD NOT ONLY BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, AND MANY HEARD MY H , HEARD ME SAY WE CAN DEFINE AMERICA IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITY. THAT IN AMERICA EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AS FAR AS THEIR DREAM AND GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AHEAD, AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT IS FREER AND MORE JUST, THAT TREATS JOBS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT, AN AMERICA THAT CURES DISEASES LIKE CANCER AND ALZHEIMER, AN AMERICA THAT NEVER LEAVES ANYONE BEHIND. AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT NEVER GIVES UP, NEVER GIVES IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS A GREAT NATION. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BAD BET TO BET AGAINST AMERICA. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. FOLKS, IN THE LAST STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, I BEGAN THINKING ABOUT A HYNMN THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME AND MY FAMILY THAT CAPTURES THE FAITH THAT SUSTAINS ME AND WHICH I BELIEVE SUSTAINS AMERICA. AND I HOPE IT CAN PROVIDE COMFORT AND SOLEMN TO THE AMERICANS WHO LOST A LOVED ONE TO THIS TERRIBLE VIRUS THIS YEAR. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. HOPEFULLY THIS HYMN GIVES YOU SOLEMN. IT GOES LIKE THIS , AND HE WILL RAISE YOU UP ON EAGLE'S WINGS, AND MAKE YOU A SIGN LIKE THE SUN AND HOLD YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. TOGETHER ON EAGLE'S WINGS WE EMBARK ON THE WORK GOD CALLED UPON US TO DO WITH FULL HEARTS AND STEADY HANDS, WITH FAITH IN AMERICA AND IN EACH OTHER, WITH LOVE OF COUNTRY, A THIRST FOR JUSTICE. LET IT BE THE NATION THAT WE KNOW WE CAN BE, A NATION UNITED, A NATION STRENGTHENED, A NATION HEALED. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE TRIED AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. REMEMBER, AS OUR GRANDPOP SAID WHEN WE WALKED OUT OF OUR HOME, HE SAID JOE, KEEP THE FAITH. OUR GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE SAID NO, SPREAD THE FAITH.

ON C-SPAN TWO, BOOK TV'S YEAR-END REVIEW FEATURES BOOKS ABOUT SCIENCE STARTING AT 8:00 P.M. ON THE ORIGINS AND FUTURES OF THE COSMOS.

THAT IS TUESDAY NIGHT STARTING AT 8:00 P.M. ON THE C-SPAN NETWORKS. VICE PRESIDENT ELECT, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, SPOKE AT A RALLY MONDAY IN COLUMBUS, GEORGIA IN SUPPORT OF JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. BOTH CANDIDATES ARE IN THE JANUARY 5 RUNOFF IN GEORGIA. THIS RUNS 50 MINUTES. HELLO, COLUMBUS GEORGIA. YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE READY TO WIN AN ELECTION. IS THAT RIGHT? WE WANT TO SAY TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, WELCOME TO THE NEW GEORGIA. WELCOME TO THE BLUE GEORGIA. GEORGIA, THEY DID NOT SEE YOU COMING, BUT HERE WE ARE. HERE IS , SHE ISN'T IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT KAMALA HARRIS. [CAR HORNS HONKING] I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. YOU FLIPPED THIS STATE BLUE. AND COME JANUARY 5 WHEN YOU SEND ME AN JON OSSOFF TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, WE ARE GOING TO SEAL THE DEAL. [CAR HORNS HONKING] SO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 5. DON'T LET UP FOR ONE DAY. JANUARY 5 IS ELECTION DAYFUL BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WE SHOULD NO LONGER BE TALKING ABOUT ELECTION DAY. THERE'S NO SUCH THING. IT'S ELECTION SEASON. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 5. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. ICE STORM IN GEORGIA, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE. SO START VOTING NOW. DURING THIS EARLY VOTING PERIOD THAT GOES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, MAKE VOTING PART OF YOUR HOLIDAY PLAN. DON'T WAIT. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. BECAUSE THE FOUR MOST POWERFUL WORDS EVER UTTERED IN A DEMOCRACY ARE, \"THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.\" AND ON NOVEMBER 3, YOU SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR. AND YOU SENT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH GEORGIA'S 16 ELECTORAL VOTES. WE KNOW THEY WON, BECAUSE WE COUNTED THEM. HA. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? [CAR HORNS HONKING] BUT THEY WILL NEED HELP. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MOMENT IS ALL ABOUT. THAT YOU WOULD SEND JON OSSOFF AND MYSELF, THAT YOU WOULD GIVE US THE GREAT HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THE GREATEST STATE IN THE UNION, THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THE HOME STATE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN WHOSE PULPIT I'M HONORED TO PREACH FROM EVERY SUNDAY AS PASTOR OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH, SPIRITUAL HOME OF DR. KING AND THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS WHO WOULD BE TELLING US RIGHT NOW, VOTE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. AND I'M HONORED JUST TO BE A PART OF THIS EFFORT. I REALLY AM. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHATEVER I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE, I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE I CAME FROM. I WAS RAISED IN PUBLIC HOUSING. ONE OF 12 CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY, I'M NUMBER 11. 12 KIDS. MY FOLKS ARE PREACHERS AND THEY CLEARLY READ THE BIBLE, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. I'M THE FIRST GRADUATE OF A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION IN MY FAMILY. MOREHOUSE COLLEGE. I GOT THERE THROUGH HARD WORK, GRIT AND DETERMINATION. BUT I GOT THERE BECAUSE SOMEBODY GAVE ME SOME PELL GRANTS AND SOME LOW-INTEREST STUDENT LOANS. AND I'M RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR KIDS GROWING UP IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES THAN IT WAS FOR ME ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU SEE AN ITERATION AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICAN STORY. BECAUSE I GREW UP IN PUBLIC HOUSING. MY MAMA IS FROM WAYCROSS, GEORGIA. THAT'S WAY ACROSS GEORGIA. SHE GREW UP IN THE 1950'S AND AS A BLACK TEENAGER, SHE SPENT MANY SUMMERS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON. SHE SPENT MANY DAYS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOBACCO. BUT THE OTHER DAY, THOSE 82-YEAR-OLD HANDS THAT USED TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON PICKED HER YOUNGEST SON TO BE OUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. [CAR HORNS HONKING] THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT AMERICA. I LOVE AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY THAT GIVES US THE POWER TO MAKE IT GREATER AND THE WAY WE MAKE IT GREATER IS FOR THE PEOPLE TO STAND UP. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN. THIS IS OUR DEMOCRACY. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO THE POLITICIANS. IT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AT OUR PLEASURE. SO I'M DEEPLY HONORED. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE GOT TO PASS COVID-19 RELIEF. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE AT THE CENTER OF ANY RELIEF THAT WE PROVIDE. WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT ORDINARY PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND OUR FIRE MEN AND FIRE WOMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US, WHO RISK THEIR LIVES BY SAVING LIVES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE DISTRIBUTED SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES DON'T FIND THEMSELVES AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ISN'T IT INTERESTING, THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE TOO OFTEN IGNORED, REFUSED TO PAY A LIVABLE WAGE, THIS PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US OF HOW IMPORTANT THEY REALLY ARE. THE FOLK WHO STOCK GROCERY STORE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE MANY OF US ARE ASLEEP. THE FOLK WHO KEEP THE ECONOMY HUMMING. WE NOW CALL THEM ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WELL, IF THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND INDEED THEY ARE, WE OUGHT TO PAY THEM AN ESSENTIAL WAGE AND PROVIDE TO THEM ESSENTIAL MEDICINE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] IT'S ONLY RIGHT. AND WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. AND MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERYBODY. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON THE PLANET CAN AND OUGHT TO PROVIDE FOR ALL THE CITIZENS. WE CAN DO IT. WE JUST HAVE TO COMMIT TO DOING IT. I'VE BEEN MOVING ALL ACROSS THIS STATE, DROPPING BY LITTLE TOWNS, AND WHEN I GO INTO THESE SMALL, RURAL TOWNS, THEY'RE SURPRISED THAT I'M THERE. I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE SURPRISED. THEY SAY REVEREND, WE'RE NOT USED TO SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE COMING BY OUR LITTLE TOWN. THAT'S STRANGE TO ME BECAUSE I'M RUNNING TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND TOO MANY OF OUR RURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. WE'VE HAD NINE HOSPITALS CLOSE IN THIS STATE IN 10 YEARS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO EXPEND MEDICAID. , EXPAND MEDICAID. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS WHO BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, WHO WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WHO WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE FROM HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN KIDS COME OUT OF SCHOOL, THEY SHOULD NOT BE SO BURDENED WITH COLLEGE DEBT THAT THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE BEFORE THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE. THEN, WE'VE GOT TO INVEST IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT WILL CREATE BROADBAND IN THESE RURAL AREAS, REPAIR OUR ROADS AND OUR BRIDGES AND OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A REFLECTION OF OUR BROKEN POLITICS AND WE MUST RISE UP IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICA AND REPAIR ROADS AND BRIDGE, REPAIR OUR DEMOCRACY FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND WE CAN DO IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO STAND TOGETHER. SO PUSH HARD NOW. IN THESE REMAINING COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND PUSH BACK AGAINST THE FORCES THAT TRY TO DIVIDE US. HAVE YOU NOTICED, I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, AND MY OPPONENT IS TRYING TO REDUCE THIS RACE TO THE KIND OF EMPTY SCHOOLYARD INSULTS MADE BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO AREN'T THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ON A PLAYGROUND. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND SHE'S BUSY CALLING ME NAMES. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DEBATE AND SHE'S ENGAGED IN NAME CALLING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, AS WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, BLESS HER HEART. SHE CAN CALL ME WHATEVER SHE WANTS. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE CAN PROVIDE IT IN THE RICHEST NATION ON THE PLANET. I BELIEVE THAT SENIORS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND BUYING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY DESERVE A LIVABLE WAGE. SHE CAN CALL THAT WHATEVER SHE WANTS. I CALL IT COMMON SENSE. AND SO HERE'S THE THING. I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE THE PEOPLE CAN DO IT. THAT IS THE COVENANT WE HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THOSE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY AND CAN BARELY GET BY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE HEART, BUT WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK TO MAKE OTHERS RICH BUT WE CAN BARELY MAKE THE RENT. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE AND MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SO WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GREAT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO , WE WHO ARE DOING OK ECONOMICALLY. BUT DEEP IN OUR HEART, WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS. SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED. AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN FIX IT IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING AS I CLOSE AND NOBODY BELIEVES A BAPTIST PREACHER WHEN HE SAYS \"AS I CLOSE.\" THEY SAY HE'S GOT AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MORE CLOSERS. BUT I'M HONESTLY, AS I CLOSE. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIOUS WORK ETHIC. HE WAS A VETERAN. LEARNED EARLY TO WAKE UP EARLY AND GET STARTED. HE WAS A PASTOR AND HE WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE HAD THINGS TO HANDLE. SO IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM WHETHER IT WAS A SCHOOL DAY OR SUMMERTIME. OR SATURDAY. HE WOKE ME UP SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, OFTEN AT DAWN. HE HAD A WAY OF SAYING, SON, GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY. HE DIDN'T THINK YOU SHOULD SLEEP LATE OR WALK AROUND, YOU KNOW, UNPREPARED. SO HE SAID GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES, GET READY. I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SO I ASKED HIM, DAD, IT'S SATURDAY. AND YOU KNOW, I'M 7, 10 YEARS OLD. GET READY FOR WHAT? SOMETIMES I'D STOP HIM, HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW, I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT LATER. YOU JUST BE READY. PUT YOUR SHOES ON, SON. HE'D WAKE ME UP AT DAWN. AND THE THING ABOUT DAWN IS THAT IT IS MORNING BUT IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S DARK. BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, AMERICA, THAT I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMES IN THE MORNING. ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? [CAR HORNS HONKING] GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! CALL EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. TELL THEM IT'S TIME TO VOTE LIKE WE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! UNTIL WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, UNTIL WE HAVE A LIVABLE WAGE, LET'S FIGHT TOGETHER, LET'S STRUGGLE TOGETHER, LET'S STAY TOGETHER, LET'S PRAY TOGETHER, LET'S MERGE TOGETHER AND TOGETHER WE WIN. GOD BLESS YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, Y'ALL. HELLO, COLUMBUS. COLUMBUS, GIVE IT UP AGAIN FOR MY FRIEND, REVEREND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. COLUMBUS, IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU FOR HOW HARD YOU'RE WORKING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING TO WELCOME THE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS. [CAR HORNS HONKING] COLUMBUS, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WATCHING GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WATCHING GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. ALL EYES ON GEORGIA. AND COLUMBUS, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA, NOW THE MOST COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. HOSTING TWO U.S. SENATE RUNOFFS FOR CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME, COLUMBUS, THAT YOUR STANDARD BEARERS ARE THE YOUNG JEWISH SON OF AN IMMIGRANT MENTORED BY JOHN LEWIS AND A BLACK PREACHER WHO HOLDS DR. KING'S PULPIT AT EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH. COLUMBUS, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME. GOOD TROUBLE. AND WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST LIKE THE BONNIE AND CLYDE OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS. COLUMBUS, HOW DID WE WIND UP WITH KELLY AND DAVID? HOW DID WE WIND UP WITH KELLY AND DAVID? TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS MORE CONCERNED WITH USING THEIR OFFICES TO LINE THEIR OWN POCKETS THAN LOOKING OUT FOR WE THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES. WE DESERVE BETTER, COLUMBUS, AND RETIREMENT IS COMING FOR KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE. WE HAVE THE POWER, COLUMBUS. WE HAVE THE POWER TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE HAVE BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS TO DISCUSS THAN DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER, LIKE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. GEORGIA HAS THE POWER TO DECIDE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. WE HAVE THE POWER TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY , BECAUSE THE FOG IS LIFTING. DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING. HE MAY NOT KNOW IT YET, BUT DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING AND GEORGIA VOTERS SENT DONALD TRUMP PACKING. YOU DID THAT. SO WHAT COMES NEXT IS UP TO US. AND COLUMBUS, WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT FOR HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH, COLUMBUS. DO YOU BELIEVE, LIKE I DO AND LIKE REV. WARNOCK DOES, THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT OR LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE GEORGIAN DESERVES THE VERY BEST HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE ON EARTH? WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I WAS JUST OUT AND CUSTOMER, GEORGIA THREE DAYS AGO , CASPER, GEORGIA THREE DAYS AGO. THEY LOST THEIR HOSPITAL IN OCTOBER IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. THEIR HOSPITAL CLOSED DOWN. DAVID PERDUE AND REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO EXPAND MEDICAID ARE RESPONSIBLE. WE'VE LOST NINE RURAL HOSPITALS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. IF YOU SEND ME AND REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL DELIVER THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN THOSE HOSPITALS. WE BELIEVE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE. WE CAN STAND UP TO THE INSURANCE AND DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE RIPPING OFF GEORGIA FAMILIES EVERY DAY. SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS THAT ARRIVE SIX MONTHS AFTER A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL. THE PRICES THAT FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO PAY AT THE PHARMACY EVERY DAY FOR LIFESAVING MEDICINES LIKE INSULIN. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY AND WE CAN FIX IT. WE CAN MAKE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IN REALITY FOR EVERY FAMILY IN THIS STATE, BECAUSE COLUMBUS HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS, COLUMBUS. WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO PASS THE MOST AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOBS AND ECONOMIC RELIEF PLAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BUILD BACK OUR ECONOMY AFTER THIS CRISIS. WE CAN REPAIR OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES. WE CAN BUILD THOSE CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. YOU CAN UPGRADE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE CAN ENSURE EVERY COMMUNITY IN GEORGIA HAS HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS. WE CAN MAKE GEORGIA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH AND AMERICA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD. WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, COLUMBUS. WE CAN CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS WHILE WE DO IT. WE CAN RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15, BECAUSE AN HONEST WEEK'S WORK SHOULD NOT JUST ALLOW US TO SURVIVE, IT SHOULD ALLOW US TO THRIVE. WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS, COLUMBUS. BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE STAKES OF THESE ELECTIONS. BECAUSE IF MITCH MCCONNELL CONTINUES TO CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE, HE WILL TRY TO DO TO JOE AND KAMALA JUST LIKE WHAT HE TRIED TO DO TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. THEY WILL BLOCK THE COVID RELIEF , MINIMUM WAGE, THEY WILL BLOCK THE EXPANSION OF PELL GRANT THAT WOULD ALLOW EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN THIS STATE TO GET A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE WITHOUT A PENNY OF DEBT. WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO, COLUMBUS, TO BE MIRED IN GRIDLOCK AND OBSTRUCTION. WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. COLUMBUS, THE POLLS ARE OPEN RIGHT NOW. THE POLLS ARE OPEN RIGHT NOW. SO COLUMBUS, SAY IT WITH ME NOW, SAY VOTE. THE POLLS ARE OPEN, COLUMBUS. HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS AN IMMIGRANT WHEN SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN THE IDEAS THAT AMERICA STANDS FOR. THE IDEAS THAT SO MANY HAVE FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED FOR. COLUMBUS, PLEASE JOIN ME IN TAKING A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE VETERANS AND ALL OF THE MILITARY FAMILIES WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN THE IDEAS THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN SHE INDULGED SOME KIND OF FANTASY ABOUT HER PAST. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH FURTHER THIS COUNTRY HAD TO GO. BUT SHE BELIEVED, LIKE THE REVEREND WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY ON A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS. THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS WHAT EMPOWERS US TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY SO THAT WE FULLY REALIZE OUR FOUNDING IDEALS OF EQUALITY IN GOD'S EYES AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE DEMAND THAT PROGRESS. THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN. COLUMBUS, SAY IT WITH ME AGAIN, SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE 14TH AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION ALREADY GUARANTEES EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. BUT WHEN AHMAUD ARBERY IS SHOT TO DEATH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON CAMERA ON THE STREET AND THE AUTHORITIES LOOK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE HE IS A YOUNG BLACK MAN, THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. COLUMBUS, ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR A NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL, REGARDLESS OF RACE, AND REGARDLESS OF CLASS? AND A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL PROTECT THE SACRED FRANCHISE AND AND VOTER SUPPRESSION? COLUMBUS, WE HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THE NEXT TWO YEARS CAN BE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS SINCE 1964 AND 1965. WE HAVE THE POWER AS GEORGIA VOTERS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE AND MOBILIZE AND WORK LIKE WE HAVE NEVER WORKED BEFORE. COLUMBUS, ARE YOU READY TO PUT IN THE WORK THESE NEXT TWO WEEKS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN? ARE YOU READY TO KNOCK ON DOORS AND CALL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND GET EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AT SCHOOL AND CHURCH AND WORK AT THE POLLS? SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. COLUMBUS, JOIN ME ONCE AGAIN IN THANKING THE REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK FOR RUNNING FOR OFFICE. COLUMBUS, JOIN ME AGAIN AND WELCOMING THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. COLUMBUS, LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER. LET'S DO IT FROM A PLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION AND DECENCY AND UNITY. WE ARE TURNING THE PAGE ON FOUR YEARS OF HATRED AND FEAR AND DIVISION AND RACISM. LET'S BE FILLED WITH LOVE FOR EACH OTHER AS WE DO THIS WORK. LET'S BUILD THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO LEAVE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE, GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. (music) GREETINGS, EVERYONE. I FIRST JUST WANT TO SAY HOW HONORED AND SO IN OUR I AM TO BE HERE AND INTRODUCE OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE DIDN'T JUST COME HERE TO SEE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT HARRIS, BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALSO HERE BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING. YOU UNDERSTOOD IT IN NOVEMBER WHEN YOU VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS. SHOUT OUT TO GEORGIA'S YOUNG VOTERS, WHO WERE NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY. EARLY VOTING HAS BEGUN IN OUR STATE AND I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOTE NOW. WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS, GEORGIA. THESE TWO SENATE RACES ARE SO VERY CRITICAL FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE. IN THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT HARRIS, WE ARE DETERMINING THE SOUL OF AMERICA. TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING, OUR VICE PRESIDENT ELECT IS A LIVING IMAGE OF AMERICA'S VOICE. PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN WITHOUT A SILVER SPOON, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO FIGHT FOR AND EARN THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. PEOPLE OF COLOR, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. WOMEN, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. AMERICA, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME THE FIRST FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, KAMALA HARRIS. (music) V.P.-ELECT HARRIS: COLUMBUS! WHAT'S UP, COLUMBUS? [LAUGHTER] WHERE DID YOU GO? HOW ABOUT BJ TILLMAN? CAN WE PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR HER? I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHE DOES NOT DO BECAUSE SHE DOES EVERYTHING. SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE LEADER. SHE THREW THIS CAMPAIGN UP TO NOVEMBER, WAS ORGANIZING FOLKS, EVERYONE FROM YOUNG STUDENTS TO THE YOUNGER OF THE ELDEST OF US, SHE HAS BEEN ORGANIZING PEOPLE AND STILL CONTINUES TO BE SUCH A LEADER. WHEN I LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE BJ, I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR HER. ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN GEORGIA. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN GEORGIA. AND I AM HERE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, TO THANK YOU ALL ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID IN NOVEMBER. BECAUSE YOU DID WHAT NO ONE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE, YOU DID WHAT NO ONE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE. YOU MADE A STATEMENT, NOT ONLY ABOUT WHO IS GEORGIA, WHAT IS THE VOICE OF GEORGIA, WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF GEORGIA, WHAT GEORGIA WILL NOT ALLOWED TO BE DENIED ABOUT GEORGIA, BUT YOU ALSO MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. YOU ALLOWED PEOPLE AROUND THIS NATION TO SAY, UH-HUH, DON'T EVER PUT US IN A BOX AND TELL US WHO WE ARE. WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. SO, I AM HERE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID. OF COURSE, NO GOOD THANK YOU COMES WITHOUT ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. [] LAUGHTER] JANUARY 5, GENERALLY FIFTH. 2020 HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR. 2020 HAS BEEN ROUGH. PEOPLE MAKING JOKES ABOUT 2020, LIKE WE WANT THIS THING TO BE OVER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, GEORGIA, COLUMBUS, 2020 IS NOT OVER UNTIL JANUARY 5. THAT'S 12020 WILL BE OVER. THAT'S WHEN WE WILL GET THIS THING DONE. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEED TO ELECT REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, TO ELECT JON OSSOFF, TO ELECT DANIEL BLACKMAN, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING THAT WAS AT STAKE IN NOVEMBER IS AT STAKE LEADING UP TO JANUARY 5. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THIS STATE. WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT SO MUCH DEVASTATION, PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS, LOST TIME BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK, LOST TIME IN TERMS OF OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND THE DAYS OF THEIR EDUCATION THEY HAVE MISSED. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH LOSS THESE YEARS, AND IN PARTICULAR THIS YEAR. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN SEVEN FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA AND IT IS HITTING GEORGIA HARD. ONE IN SEVEN DESCRIBING HUNGER IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD. ONE IN SIX GEORGIA FAMILIES ARE DESCRIBING AN INABILITY OR DIFFICULTY TO PAY RENT. ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN GEORGIA HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IS OR ARE ABOUT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT AND WHY EVERYONE, ALTHOUGH LEADERS, ARE HERE RIGHT NOW TOGETHER, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE HERE, YOU'RE A LEADER, IS TO SAY THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR VOICES HEARD, WE WILL NOT LET ANYONE SILENCE US. WE WILL SPEAK UP ABOUT WHAT WE NEED. WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE WANT AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN THROUGH OUR VOTES. AND JUST LIKE YOU DID, YOU WOULD DO IT AGAIN , WILL DO IT AGAIN. HERE'S THE THING. I WAS HERE, JOE BIDEN WAS HERE, WE WERE ALL HERE TOGETHER IN GEORGIA BEFORE NOVEMBER. REMEMBER HOW WE KNEW WHAT WAS AT STAKE AND THE CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US? WE KNEW, LIKE STACEY ABRAMS HAS BEEN TELLING US AND ORGANIZING, THAT THERE THAT WOULD TRY TO PREVENT US FROM VOTING. WE KNEW THE KINDS OF GAMES THAT THEY WOULD PLAY TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUPPRESS OUR VOTES, TO MAKE IT CONFUSING, TO DISCOURAGE US. IN NOVEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND WE SAID WE KNEW THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US. THE SAME CHALLENGE EXISTS TODAY. WE AGAIN ASK, AS IT RELATES TO JANUARY 5, THE QUESTION WE ASKED IN NOVEMBER, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY. WE KNOW THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN! SO, WHAT WE DID IN NOVEMBER, WE CAN DO AGAIN, BECAUSE IT COMES FROM A VERY DEEP PLACE INSIDE OF US. UNDERSTANDING, THIS IS NOT ABOUT A DAMN, THIS IS NOT ABOUT A GESTURE, THIS IS ABOUT OUR LIVES. THIS IS ABOUT THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN, THE LIFE OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR NATION. NOW, YOU ALL KNOW I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOUR YEARS AGO. BITTERSWEET NIGHT, THE SAME NIGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED. I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, BECOMING ONLY THE SECOND BLACK WOMAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO BE ELECTED. ONLY THE SECOND. I AM CURRENTLY THE ONLY BLACK WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND HERE'S WHAT I HAVE ALSO COME TO VISIT WITH YOU TO SHARE. THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN THAT BODY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THERE ARE ONLY 100 SENATORS. THEY CALLED THE UNITED STATES SENATE THE MOST DELIBERATIVE BODY IN THE WORLD. THEY ELECT PEOPLE, WE ELECT PEOPLE FOR SIX YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, BECAUSE THE JOB IS SO IMPORTANT AND POTENTIALLY SO POWERFUL AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING THE STATE AS A WHOLE THAT WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND A VOICE FOR THEIR STATE IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY LEADERS FOR THEIR STATE, BUT NATIONAL LEADERS. IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHERE I WENT TO THE FLOOR, THEY CALL IT THE WELL OF THE SENATE, IT IS A GRAND BUILDING, THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL, IT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE WOOD PANELING HAS BEEN THERE FOREVER, PRISTINE DESKS. YOU CAN SEE THE NAMES OF THE FOUNDERS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WRITTEN IN THOSE DESKS. AND I SAT ON THAT FLOOR WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT THEY NAMED OBAMACARE THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I WATCHED AS THEY DARE TO PLAY POLITICS WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEIR WELL-BEING. AND I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES, I WAS RELATIVELY NEW TO THE SENATE, I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THE POWER OF EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNITED STATES SENATORS. IT IS INCREDIBLE. AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT POWER, I SAW WHAT YOU PROBABLY SAW BY TELEVISION. IN THE EARLY MORNING, LATE AT NIGHT, EARLY MORNING HOURS ON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I SAW THE POWER OF JUST ONE SENATOR WHEN THE LATE, GREAT JOHN MCCAIN ON THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA, TOGETHER WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BROUGHT IT, SO HE WANTED TO ATTACK IT. I SAW THE POWER OF ONE SENATOR WHEN JOHN MCCAIN TOOK TO THAT FLOOR AND SAID, NO YOU DON'T. HE SAID, NO YOU DON'T. [CAR HORNS HONKING] POWER OF JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL. AND GEORGIA, COLUMBUS, YOU'VE GOT THE POWER TO SEND TWO. IT IS WITHIN YOUR HANDS, WITHIN OUR GRASP TO SEND THESE TWO LEADERS TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR VOICE. THEY ARE BORN OUT OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE, WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO SILENCE AND SUPPRESS YOU. BUT THEY WERE TRIUMPHANT, THEY WERE BORN OUT OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE WHEN PEOPLE DARED TO TRY AND HAVE US COUNT THREE TIMES YOUR VOTES. AND THEY ARE HERE TO TELL THE STORY. THEY ARE BORN OUT OF A MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE DARED FROM OTHER STATES LIKE TEXAS TO RECALL YOUR VOTES AND YOUR VOICE. BUT THEY LIVED TO TELL THE STORY. THEY ARE STRONG. THEY HAVE SURVIVED THESE GAMES PEOPLE ARE PLAYING BECAUSE THEY ARE THE STRONG VOICES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. SO, WE HAVE GOT IT WITHIN OUR POWER AND YOU HAVE IT WITHIN YOUR HANDS TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO IS GEORGIA. AND THE POWER OF THE VOICE OF GEORGIA SENDING THESE TWO, JON OSSOFF AND RAFAEL WARNOCK, TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SAY, IT IS US, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, WHO WILL MAKE A DECISION. IT WILL NOT BE MADE FOR US. WE WILL MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHO REPRESENTS US. [CAR HORNS HONKING] SO, LET'S GET THIS DONE. LET'S GET THIS DONE. YOU KNOW, I AM NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST, BUT I AM HERE TO SAY THAT THE DECISION YOU MAKE, THE WORK YOU PUT INTO IT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE WHO YOU MAY NEVER MEET. PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAMES, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND ARE PREPARED TO DO, THEIR LIVES WILL FOREVER BE BETTER. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS SLOGAN THAT IS ABOUT HEALTH, JOBS, JUSTICE, THAT REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICES IN AMERICA THAT MUST BE HEARD CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. RAFAEL AND JON WILL DO THAT. THEY WILL DO THAT. THIS WILL NOT BE EASY. AND IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IN THE SENATE WHICH IS WHAT THIS ELECTION WILL DO. IT RELATES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICARE, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. JOE BIDEN AND I HAVE SAYING, LOOK, IN PLACES LIKE IN COLUMBUS, UP AND DOWN GEORGIA, WE GOT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE LOWEST TAX BASE AND BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS STILL KIND OF MESSED UP, WE FUND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON THE TAX BASE OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS THAT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDS, THEY OFTEN HAVE THE FEWEST RESOURCES. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT JOE AND I PLAN TO DO THAT IS TO TRIPLE TITLE ONE FUNDING. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE NEED RAFAEL AND JON IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. WE TALK ABOUT RESPECTING THE NEED OF ALL AMERICANS TO HAVE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE THE DIGNITY OF BEING ABLE TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES KNOWING THAT THEIR HARD WORK PAYS OFF. SO JOE AND I HAVE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT OR CLOSING COSTS TO BUY A HOME. WE NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE VOTES TO DO THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'VE GOT TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW HERE IN GEORGIA, OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, OUR BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES ARE PART OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE BLOOD OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE CLOSING. PART OF HOW WE GOT TO GET DEALING WITH THIS MOVING FORWARD IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON OUR MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITOL SO JOE AND I GOT A PLAN FOR THAT. WE NEED THE VOTES IN THE SENATE. WE NEED RAFAEL AND JON THERE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS IT RELATES TO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW, THOSE WORDS ARE INSCRIBED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL MARBLE BUILDING CALLED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, IT'S AN IDEAL THAT WE KNOW WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE FOLKS WHO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, REFORMING POLICING, DOING WHAT MUST BE DONE TO SAY LET US BAN CHOKE HOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS, GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. LET'S HAVE A NATIONAL STANDARD OF USE OF FORCE. LET US REQUIRE THAT AS A NATION WE RUN OUR LAWS IN A WAY THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REAL HISTORY OF AMERICA AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO RIGHT WHAT HAS BEEN WRONG, TO DO THAT, WE WILL NEED THE LEGISLATION TO BE PASSED. WE WILL NEED JON AND RAFAEL IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE AT STAKE. AND SO I TRAVELED HERE, I GOT TO GO BACK AND VOTE ON THAT COVID PACKAGE TONIGHT IN D.C. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT, BUT I WANTED TO COME AND VISIT WITH YOU BEFORE CHRISTMAS, BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO ASK THAT AMONG THE THINGS THAT YOU PLAN TO DO FOR CHRISTMAS, WE ALL HAVE OUR TRADITIONS, SO MANY OF US, OUR TRADITIONS HAVE BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SAFE, BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS SEASON, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE CELEBRATION OF A BIRTH THAT TAUGHT US THAT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO LEAVE THIS WORLD BETTER THAN WE FOUND IT, LET US USE THOSE DAYS LEADING UP TO JANUARY 5 IN THE SPIRIT OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT, TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WE KNOW UNDERSTANDS THEIR POWER, THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. 2020, YOU KNOW, WE GOT ALL KINDS OF WORDS FOR IT, MOST OF WHICH WE SHOULD NOT SAY IN FRONT OF CHILDREN, AND LIKE I SAID, I THINK 2020 WILL TRULY BE OVER ON JANUARY 5 AND THAT BEING SAID, COLUMBUS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT OF LOSS, THIS MOMENT OF SO MANY CRISES HITTING SO HARD, IT WILL PASS AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US. THEY'LL LOOK IN OUR EYES AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? WHERE WERE YOU? AND WHAT I KNOW WE ALL WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT AT BIG MOUNTAIN, THAT WE WERE HANGING OUT WITH JON AND RAFAEL, KAMALA CAME AND PAID US A VISIT. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE ORGANIZED, THAT WE REMINDED PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE ELECTED THE NEXT SENATORS TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM! THANK YOU, COLUMBUS! THANK YOU!
