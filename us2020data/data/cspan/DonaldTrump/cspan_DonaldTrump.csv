587026,507634-1,President Trump Remarks at Georgia U.S. Senate Campaign Event,"President Trump spoke at a Dalton, Georgia, rally in support of Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both candidates in Georgia&rsquo;s two 2020 U.S. Senate runoff elections. Mr. Perdue did not attend the rally because he was quarantined after coming into contact with someone who tested for COVID-19 within the previous week. President Trump encouraged voters to vote for the two Republican candidates, noting that a win for their Democratic challengers would hand control of the Senate to Democrats. Most of the president&rsquo;s remarks concerned his displeasure with the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. He said his supporters in Congress would continue to support him as both legislative chambers were set to accept the Electoral College results in just two days. Senator Loeffler, Representative Majrorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and Ivanka Trump, the president&rsquo;s daughter, also spoke during the rally.",2021-01-04,https://www.c-span.org/video/?507634-1/president-trump-remarks-georgia-us-senate-campaign-event,Speech

As the speech was concluding, Vice President Pence issued a statement saying he lacked the constitutional authority to dismiss the votes when Congress met later that day.Note: Because of audio difficulties with the president&rsquo;s microphone, there was no audio during the first 38 seconds of his remarks.",2021-01-06,https://www.c-span.org/video/?507744-1/rally-electoral-college-vote-certification,Speech
