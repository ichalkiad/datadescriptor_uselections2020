CSPANDT17120190	Donald Trump	2019-01-17	President Trump Remarks on Missile Defense Review	THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHAT I HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I MET WITH FROM THE CUSTOMS BORDER PROTECTION DIVISION, WE NEED MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. CERTAINLY WE ARE HEARING FROM BORDER AGENTS WHAT THEY REALLY NEED. IT'S HARD TO TELL THE PRESIDENT WHO THEY WORK FOR WHEN HE MAKES A VISIT TO THE BORDER ANYTHING DIFFERENT HE WANTS TO HEAR. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. MR. PRESIDENT, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, SENATOR SULLIVAN, CONGRESSMAN TURNER, GENERAL SILVA, AND MILITARY OFFICERS, ALL MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AS WE RELEASE THE 2019 MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW. TODAY THE NUMBER OF NEW MISSILE PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD IS GROWING DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OTHER CAPABILITIES. WRIT LARGE, THE WREST OF THE WORLD IS NOT DEVELOPING NEW FIGHTER AND BOMBER AIRCRAFT. THEY ARE DEVELOPING MISSILES. THE SHEER PROLIFERATION OF OFFENSIVE MISSILE CAPABILITIES MORE THAN 20 NATION STATES TODAY IN 2019, MAKES THIS REVIEW TIMELY AND ESSENTIAL. ALIGNED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY AND NESTED WITHIN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, AND IN LOCK STEP WITH THE NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW, THIS THREAT DRIVEN REVIEW IS THE LATEST TILE IN OUR BROADER NATIONAL SECURITY MOSAIC AND WE ARE MOVING OUT ON IT. AMERICA'S COMPETITORS, INCLUDING CHINA AND RUSSIA, ARE INCREASING THEIR EXISTING MISSILE SYSTEM CAPABILITIES, ADDING NEW AND SOPHISTICATED MISSILES TO THEIR ARSENALS, INCLUDING HYPERSONIC MISSILES AND ADVANCED CRUISE MISSILES. INTEGRATING THESE MORE EFFECTIVELY INTO THEIR POLITICAL INTIMIDATION, ANTI-ACCESS, AREA DENIAL EFFORTS, AND WAR PLANNING. WHILE WE ARE FORGING A NEW PATH TO PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, NORTH KOREA'S MISSILES REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, SO DO IRAN'S. MAKE NO MISTAKE, OUR CURRENT DEFENSE CAPABILITIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR PURPOSE AND OUR COMPETITORS KNOW IT. FRUSTRATED BY OUR MID-COURSE DEFENSES, THEY ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO CIRCUMVENT TODAY'S SYSTEMS. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCE NEW THREATS AND THESE THREATS ARE HARDER TO SEE, HARDER TO TRACK, AND HARDER TO DEFEAT. TO OUR COMPETITORS, WE SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WE'RE TAKING ACTION. THE MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW CALLS FOR NECESSARY INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN OUR GROUND AND SEA-BASED MISSILE DEFENSES. FROM MORE INTERCEPTORS TO NEW KILL VEHICLES TO IMPROVED COVERAGE OF PRIORITY REGIONS LIKE THE ENDO PACIFIC. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE FOCUSED ON NEW CAPABILITIES FOR NEW THREATS. THIS INCLUDES HYPERSONICS, SPACE-BASED SENSORS AND DIRECTED ENERGY FOR BOOST PHASE MISSILE INTERCEPT AND INCLUDES A POLICY SHIFT TOWARDS GREATER INTEGRATION OF OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES. BECAUSE MISSILE DEFENSE NECESSARILY INCLUDES MISSILE OFFENSE. FOR DECADES, THE U.S. LED THE WORLD IN HYPER SONICS RESEARCH AND DELIBERATELY CHOSE NOT TO WEAPONIZE THESE SYSTEMS. CHINA AND RUSSIA HAVE CHOSEN DIFFERENTLY. OUR NATION DOES NOT SEEK ADVERSARIES, BUT WE WILL NOT IGNORE THEM EITHER. WE REFUSE TO BE BOUND BY GEOGRAPHY. OUR NEW SPACE-BASED SENSOR LAYER WILL GIVE US PERSISTENT, TIMELY, GLOBAL AWARENESS. THESE CAPABILITIES WILL REMOVE ADVERSARY'S ABILITIES TO US OR OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. CONGRESS HAS WISELY MANDATED SUCH A CAPABILITY. REST ASSURED, YOU WILL SEE THIS PRIORITY REFLECTED IN OUR UPCOMING BUDGET REQUEST. WE ARE TO THE INTERESTED IN KEEPING PACE WITH THE EMERGING THREATS. WE WANT TO OUT PACE THEM. THIS REQUIRES NOT JUST DEFENSIVE WEAPONS, BUT A HOST OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INTEGRATE MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT. MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE READY FOR THIS TASK. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF GET STUFF DONE. FROM THE MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY TO THE SPACE FORCE AND ACROSS THE JOINT FORCE, WE ARE ALL A PART OF THE MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION NOW. WE WILL WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE, NATIONAL LABS, AND ACADEMIA, WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS FROM ASIA TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO EUROPE, TO BROADEN THE SHIELD, FROM JAPANESE CO-DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW INTERCEPTOR TO OUR WORK WITH NATO TO COUNTER SHARED MISSILE THREATS. LIKE US, OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS HAVE RECOGNIZED THE THREAT. WITH US, THEY HAVE AND WILL SHARE THE BURDEN OF ANSWERING IT. IN A TIME OF GREAT POWER COMPETITION WE WILL UPHOLD OUR SOLEMN DUTY, JUST AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST, WE'LL DEFEND THE HOMELAND, OUR DEPLOYED FORCES AND OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. WE'LL DO TER POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES AND CREATE THE DIPLOMATIC SPACE TO SOLVE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS. I'LL CLOSE WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S WORDS FROM 1962. THE GREATEST DANGER OF ALL WOULD BE TO DO NOTHING. TODAY'S CAPABILITIES ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, BUT THE LOGIC REMAINS THE SAME. THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE MISSILE DEFENSE A TOP NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITY. DIRECTING THIS REVIEW IN THE FIRST WEEK OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, ALONG WITH VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, HE HAS ELEVATED THIS ISSUE ACROSS OUR GOVERNMENT, WITH OUR ALLIES, BUT MOST OF ALL IN THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONGRESS HAVE GIVEN D.O.D. THE NECESSARY AUTHORITIES, RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. THIS DEPARTMENT WILL NOT LET HIM OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DOWN. NOW IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. ACTING SECRETARY SHANAHAN, SECRETARY MARK ELSEPER, SECRETARY WILSON, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, MEMBERS OF THE JOINT CHIEFS, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES AND TO ALL OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IT IS MY HONOR TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AT THE PENTAGON. AS OUR PRESIDENT UNVEILS HIS VISION FOR OUR RENEWED COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN MISSILE DEFENSE. AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NO HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S, FRANKLY, THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT, TO A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND THEIR FAMILIES. TODAY, ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU, OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN AMERICAN HEROS WHO WERE LOST IN SYRIA YESTERDAY, AS WELL AS THOSE SERVICE MEMBERS WHO WERE WOUNDED. WE HONOR THEIR SERVICE. WE WILL HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN. THEIR FAMILIES AND ARMED FORCES SHOULD KNOW, THEIR SACRIFICE WILL ONLY STEAL OUR RESOLVE, THAT AS WE BEGIN TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME, WE WILL DO SO IN A WAY THAT ENSURES THAT THE REMNANTS OF ISIS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RE-ESTABLISH THEIR EVIL AND MURDEROUS CALIPHATE. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S IN THAT SAME SPIRIT OF RESOLVE THAT WE GATHER HERE TODAY, SINCE DAY ONE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN DECISIVE ACTION TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, WE'RE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, RESTOURGRE RESTORING DEMOCRACY, AND LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN, INCLUDING THE LARGEST MILITARY PAY RAISE IN NEARLY A DECADE. [ APPLAUSE ] AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, WE RELEASED A NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST, PURSUED THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR NUCLEAR AR SEN FALLLE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN ACTION TO EXTEND DOMINANCE ON LAND, ON SEA, IN AIR AND CYBER SECURITY AND CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SIXTH BRANCH OF OUR ARMED FORCES TO ENSURE DOMINANCE IN SPACE. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OUR PRESIDENT HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND TODAY, BY UNVEILING OUR NEW STRATEGY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL TAKE ANOTHER CRITICAL STEP TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AMERICA FIRST BEGINS WITH PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. SO NOW IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND DISTINCT PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S REALLY NICE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE ONLY DOING THAT BECAUSE I GAVE YOU THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST BUDGET IN OUR HISTORY AND I'VE NOW DONE IT TWO TIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I HATE TO TELL THE REST OF THE WORLD, BUT I'M ABOUT TO DO IT THREE TIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU GAVE ME SUCH A NICE WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE AT THE PENTAGON WITH SO MANY DISTINGUISHED MILITARY LEADERS AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY PATRICK SHANAHAN. HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE, PATRICK. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. WE WERE TALKING JUST AS I CAME ON, I SAID PAT, I HAVE TO GO NOW. WE'RE TALKING DEFENSE AND ALSO TALKING OFFENSE, CAN'T FORGET OFFENSE EITHER, CAN WE? WE HAVE THE FINEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE ORDERING THE FINEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN BE SURE OF. WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF MY ADMINISTRATION'S MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW. OUR GOAL IS SIMPLE, TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DETECT AND DESTROY ANY MISSILE LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ANYWHERE, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE BEST WAY TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE IS TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, STRONGER THAN EVER. JOINING US FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION ARE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF MISSILE DEFENSE IN CONGRESS, SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN, MY FRIEND, THANK YOU, DAN, VERY MUCH. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER, THANK YOU, MIKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALSO JOINING US FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OUR ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DAVID NORQUIST, DAVID, THANK YOU. SECRETARY MARK ESPER, SECRETARY HEATHER WILSON, THANK YOU. UNDERSECRETARIES OF DEFENSE, MICHAEL GRIFFIN, ELLEN LORD, AND JOHN RUDE. GENERAL PAUL SILVA, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GENERAL. GENERAL MARK MILLY, THANK YOU, MARK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. VERY IMPORTANTLY, CONGRATULATIONS. GENERAL JOSEPH LENGAL AND GENERAL JAMES McCONVILLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. BEFORE PRESENTING THE RESULTS OF OUR MISSILE DEFENSE REVIEW, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE BRAVE AMERICAN HEROS WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES YESTERDAY IN SELFLESS SERVICE TO OUR NATION. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEIR NOBLE AND IMMORTAL SACRIFICE. THIS MORNING I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS ANOTHER MATTER OF CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY, THE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WITHOUT A STRONG BORDER, AMERICA'S DEFENSELESS, VULNERABLE AND UNPROTECTED. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MILITARY FOR HELPING US OUT DURING THE BIG CARAVAN PERIOD, BUT NOW YOU HAVE MORE CARAVANS FORMING AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY UP. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FROM, WHO THEY ARE, NOTHING. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS. WE NEED STRONG BARRIERS AND WALLS. NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO WORK. EVERYONE KNOWS IT. EVERYBODY IS SAYING IT NOW. JUST A QUESTION OF TIME. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY OTHER , REALLY BY OTHER PRESIDENTS. IT WASN'T. JUST LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE DOING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO, WHETHER IT'S OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA, MOVING THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, SO PANE THINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO AND THEY WEREN'T, BUT WE'RE DOING THEM. A WALL HAS TO BE BUILT. WE NEED SECURITY AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. DRUGS FLOW IN, TREMENDOUS PERCENTAGES OF THE DRUGS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY COME FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. THAT IS WHY OUR HOMELAND SECURITY PROFESSIONALS HAVE ASKED CONGRESS FOR A STEEL BARRIER BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ENTRY TO FUND MORE AGENTS, BEDS, MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND TECHNOLOGY, AND TO CLOSE THE RIDICULOUS AND DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION LOOPHOLES THAT NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS BUT US. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO APPROVE BORDER SECURITY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BORDER SECURITY. IT'S GOING TO BE TIGHT, IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG. WE'RE GOING TO HETLET PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY GLADLY, BUT THEY WILL COME IN LEGALLY, THAT INCLUDES FOR THE FARMERS WHO NEED HELP AND FOR OTHERS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE POWERFUL, STRONG BORDER SECURITY. WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DEAL, SPEAKER PELOSI WILL NOT LET THEM NEGOTIATE. THE PARTY HAS BEEN HIGH JACKED BY THE OPEN BORDERS FRINGE WITHIN THE PARTY. THE RADICAL LEFT BECOMING THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS. HOPEFULLY DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS WILL STEP FORWARD TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY IS BORDER SECURITY AT THE STRONGEST LEVEL. STOP HUMAN HIGHJACKING. STOP DRUGS. STOP GANGS. STOP CRIMINALS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. THAT WAS MY PLEDGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER TO OUTLINE THE STEPS THAT WE MUST TAKE TO UPGRADE AND MODERNIZE AMERICA'S MISSILE DEFENSE, SO IMPORTANT. ROGUE REGIMES ARE ENHANCING THEIR MISSILE ARSENALS ALL OVER, THEY'RE GETTING BIGGER AND STRONGER, AND WE'RE GETTING BIGGER AND STRONGER IN EVERY WAY. THEY'RE INCREASING THEIR LETHAL STRIKE CAPABILITIES AND THEY'RE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING LONG-RANGE MISSILES THAT COULD REACH TARGETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. AS PRESIDENT, MY FIRST DUTY IS THE DEFENSE OF YOU ARE COUNTRY. FIRST DUTY. THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY. DEFENSE HAS MANY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND COVERS A LOT OF TERRITORY. I WILL ACCEPT NOTHING LESS FOR OUR NATION THAN THE MOST EFFECTIVE, CUTTING-EDGE, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS. WE HAVE THE BEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. OUR NEW STRATEGY CALLS FOR SIX MAJOR CHANGES IN MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY. FIRST, WE WILL PRIORITIZE THE DEFENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOVE ALL ELSE. OUR REVIEW CALLS FOR 20 NEW GROUND-BASED INTERCEPTERS AT FORT GREELEY, ALASKA, AND NEW RADARS AND SENSORS TO IMMEDIATELY DETECT FOREIGN MISSILES LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR GREAT NATION. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING A MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM THAT CAN SHIELD EVERY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE WILL NEVER NEGOTIATE AWAY OUR RIGHT TO DO THIS. SECOND, WE WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY, NOT JUST INVESTING MORE MONEY INTO EXISTING SYSTEMS. THE WORLD IS CHANGING. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE MUCH FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THIS PAST TUESDAY THE IRANIAN REGIME TESTED A SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLE, WHICH FAILED, THAT WILL PROVIDE IRAN WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION IF IT DIDN'T FAIL, THAT THEY COULD USE TO PURSUE INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABILITY AND A CAPABILITY ACTUALLY OF REACHING THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. THE UNITED STATES CANNOT SIMPLY BUILD MORE OF THE SAME OR MAKE ONLY INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. WHAT WE'VE DONE TO IRAN SINCE I'VE BECOME PRESIDENT IS RATHER MIRACULOUS. I ENDED THE HORRIBLE, WEAK IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AND I WILL TELL YOU, IRAN IS A MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY TODAY THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. IT'S NOT THE SAME AND IT WON'T BE THE SAME. I DO BELIEVE THEY WANT TO TALK. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY KEEP PACE WITH OUR ADVERSARIES. WE MUST OUT PACE THEM AT EVERY SINGLE TURN. WE MUST PURSUE THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH TO GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ALWAYS SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD OF THOSE WHO WOULD DO US HARM. THIRD, WE WILL PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM ALL TYPES OF MISSILE ATTACKS. IN THE PAST THE UNITED STATES LACKED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE THAT EXTENDED BEYOND BALLISTIC MISSILES. UNDER OUR PLAN THAT WILL CHANGE. THE U.S. WILL NOW ADJUST ITS POSTURE TO ALSO DEFEND AGAINST ANY MISSILE STRIKES, INCLUDING CRUISE AND HYPERSONIC MISSILES, AND WE ARE, BY THE WAY, VERY ADVANCED ALSO ON HYPERSONIC TECHNOLOGY AND MISSILES. WE WILL ALWAYS BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVERYTHING. FOURTH, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT SPACE IS A NEW WAR FIGHTING DOMAIN WITH THE SPACE FORCE LEADING THE WAY. MY UPCOMING BUDGET WILL INVEST IN A SPACE-BASED MISSILE DEFENSE LAYER. IT'S NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY BIG PART OF OUR DEFENSE AND OBVIOUSLY OF OUR OFFENSE. THE SYSTEM WILL BE MONITORED AND WE WILL TERM MY NATE ANY MISSILE LAUNCHES FROM HOSTILE POWERS OR VEEN EVEN FROM POWERS THAT MAKE A MISTAKE. IT WON'T HAPPEN, REGARDLESS OF THE MISSILE TYPE OR GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS OF THE ATTACK. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ENEMY MISSILES FIND NO SANCTUARY ON EARTH OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE. THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT I'M HEADING. WE HAVE SOME VERY BAD PLAYERS OUT THERE, AND WE'RE A GOOD PLAYER, BUT WE CAN BE FAR WORSE THAN ANYBODY IF NEED BE. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN AND I'VE WATCHED AND I'VE SEEN THE STRONGER YOU ARE, THE LESS YOU WILL NEED WHATEVER THAT STRENGTH MAY BE. FIFTH, WE WILL REMOVE BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES TO DRAMATICALLY SPEED UP THE ACQUISITION AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. SIXTH, WE WILL INSIST ON FAIR, BURDEN SHARING WITH OUR ALLIES. I MADE IT CLEAR WE ARE PROTECTING MANY, MANY WEALTHY, WEALTHY, WEALTHY COUNTRIES. ONE COUNTRY THEY SAID HAS AN UNSUSTAINABLE CASH FLOW. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY MAKE SO MUCH MONEY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I SAID, SEND IT OUR WAY. WE'RE PROTECTING YOU. SEND IT OUR WAY. WE PROTECT ALL OF THESE WEALTHY COUNTRIES, WHICH I'M VERY HONORED TO DO, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE SO WEALTHY THEY CAN EASILY PAY US THE COST OF THIS PROTECTION. SO YOU'LL SEE BIG CHANGES TAKING PLACE AND WE'VE HAD GREAT TALKS WITH COUNTRIES, FRIENDLY TALKS. ONE OF THEM SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, YES, WE WILL WORK WITH YOU. BUT FOR 30 YEARS NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED. I SAID NOW WE'RE ASKING. TOOK A LONG TIME. SAID NOW WE'RE ASKING. AND THAT ALLOWS US TO SPEND MUCH MORE MONEY THAN THESE INCREDIBLE BUDGETS WHERE IT'S JUST MONEY GOING OUT AND NOT COMING BACK. WEALTHY, WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE PROTECTING ARE ALL ON NOTICE AND ALL COOPERATING VERY NICELY. I WOULD SAY THEY PROBABLY LIKED OTHER PRESIDENTS MORE THAN ME, BUT THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T BLAME THEM. I WOULD TOO. THERE WAS A RECENT POLL IN EUROPE, THE ORIGINAL POLL WHEN I FIRST RAN I WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. AND NOW THEY SAID HE'S NOT POPULAR IN EUROPE. I SHOULDN'T BE. BECAUSE I'M ASKING THEM TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE COUNTRIES PAYING LESS THAN 1% IN NATO. LAST YEAR I RAISED $44 BILLION MORE BY SAYING, I'M SORRY, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP. THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, MY FIRST YEAR, I WAS JUST GETTING STARTED. I RAISED $24 BILLION WITH ONE MEETING. UNTIL THAT IT WAS JUST GOING DOWN, FOR 15 YEARS, JUST GOING DOWN. THE NUMBERS GOING INTO NATO. THIS YEAR WE'LL ALSO HAVE A GOOD YEAR. THEY'RE STARTING TO STEP UP. VERY UNFAIR WHEN GERMANY PAYS 1% AND WE'RE PAYING 4.3% OF A MUCH LARGER GDP. WE CANNOT BE THE FOOLS FOR OTHERS. WE CANNOT BE. WE DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED THAT. I WILL TELL YOU, FOR MANY YEARS, BEHIND YOUR BACKS, THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH NATO 100%, BUT AS I TOLD THE COUNTRIES, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE TO PAY. MINIMUM NUMBERS ACTUALLY. THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER. THEY SAID A 2% GOAL. VERY FEW PAY THAT. BUT THEY SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR , LOOK AT WHAT WE PAY, IT'S MASSIVELY HIGHER THAN THAT. SO WE HAVE VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS, BUT COUNTRIES ARE NOW STEPPING UP AND THEY CAN WELL AFFORD TO. IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS GOAL OUR PLAN DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO PRIORITIZE THE SALE OF AMERICAN MISSILE DEFENSE AND TECHNOLOGY TO OUR ALLIES AND TO OUR PARTNERS. WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND. THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE FINEST MISSILES IN THE WORLD. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. THEY'RE STEPPING UP LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SEEN BEFORE, ACTUALLY. WE WILL ALSO LEVERAGE OUR, NETWORK OF PARTNERSHIPS TO SHARE EARLY WARNING AND TRACKING INFORMATION AND DETECT MISSILE LAUNCHES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN OUR MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE BEEN HELD BACK BY SELF-IMPOSED LIMITS WHILE FOREIGN COMPETITORS GROW AND THEY ADVANCE MORE THAN WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS. PART OF THE REASON IS WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON SO MANY OTHER PLACES. NOW THAT'S CHANGING. WE'RE HELPING AND WE'RE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY ON TECHNOLOGY AN NEW DEFENSE AND FAR BEYOND DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SO THOSE DAYS ARE HISTORY. OUR STRATEGY IS GROUNDED IN ONE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE, TO DETECT AND DESTROY EVERY TYPE OF MISSILE ATTACK AGAINST ANY AMERICAN TARGET, WHETHER IT BE FOR OR AFTER LAUNCH. WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING AMERICA, WE WILL NOT TAKE ANY CHANCES. WE WILL ONLY TAKE ACTION. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AMERICAN MILITARY MIGHT. WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD, OUR MILITARY WAS VERY TIRED. IT WAS VERY DEPLETED. I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU THE THINGS THAT SOME OF OUR GREAT GENERALS WERE TELLING ME. AND NOW IT'S BEING REBUILT AT A RAPID RATE AND VERY SHORTLY WILL BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE. AS I SAID, THE MORE POWERFUL IT IS THE LESS LIKELY IT IS WE'LL EVER HAVE TO USE IT BUT IT WILL SOON BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. TODAY, WE REAFFIRM THAT A STRONG AMERICA REMAINS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT CONFLICT, PROMOTE PEACE, PRESERVE FREEDOM, AND PROTECT OUR GREAT PEOPLE. TOGETHER WE UNITE BEHIND A NOBLE MISSION TO SHIELD OUR COUNTRY WITH THE GREATEST MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS ANYWHERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, SPECIAL, SPECIAL PEOPLE AND THE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY KNOW THAT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FAR MORE SO THAN YOU WOULD EVER KNOW. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY AT ANY TIME SOON IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO JUST FINISH BY SAYING, I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE. YOU'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.

CSPANDT15320191	Donald Trump	2019-03-15	Border Security National Emergency Resolution Veto	NEWSMAKERS WITH LARRY, LOW, THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR SUNDAY AT 10:00 A.M. AND :00 P.M. EASTERN ON C-SPAN. ON FRIDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP VETOED A HOUSE AND SENATE PASSED RESOLUTION THAT WOULD TERMINATE HIS BORDER EMERGENCY DECLARATION. IT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST VETO AND HE WAS JOINED BY VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KIERSTEN NIELSEN, ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE WILL NEED A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY TO OVERRIDE THE VETO WHICH LOOKS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN. EARLIER TODAY, I SPOKE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND TO EXPRESS THE SORROW OF OUR ENTIRE NATION FOLLOWING THE TERROR ATTACKS AT TWO MOSQUES. THESE SACRED PLACES OF EUROPE WERE TURNED INTO SCENES OF EVIL KILLING. YOU HAVE ALL BEEN SEEING WHAT WENT ON. IT IS A HORRIBLE THING. I TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THE UNITED STATES IS WITH THEM ALL THE WAY. 100%, WHATEVER THEY NEED. WE WILL BE THERE. NEW ZEALAND HAS BEEN A GREAT FRIEND AND PARTNER FOR MANY YEARS. OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THEM AND WHATEVER WE CAN DO. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE JOINED CA , TODAY BY THE VICE PRESIDENT. MEMBERS OF MY CABINET, DEVOTED PUBLIC SERVANTS, AND ANGEL PARENTS. VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO ME. TO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS WE TAKE ACTION TO RESTORE OUR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND DEFEND THIS NATION FROM CRIMINAL CARTELS, HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, AND DRUGS WAS, CRIME OF ALL KINDS THIS IS THE PLACE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM BY FAR. AND I WANT TO ALSO COMPLIMENT THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AT BORDER PATROL AND ICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE JOB THEY'VE DONE. THEY'VE APPREHENDED SO MANY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT, IF WE HAD THE PROPER PROTECTION, WE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO APPREHEND. THEY WOULDN'T BE COMING IN. AS PRESIDENT, THE PROTECTION OF THE NATION IS MY HIGHEST DUTY. YESTERDAY, CONGRESS PASSED A DANGEROUS RESOLUTION THAT, IF SIGNED INTO LAW, WOULD PUT COUNTLESS AMERICANS IN DANGER, VERY GRAVE DANGER. THE DEMOCRAT-SPONSORED RESOLUTION WOULD TERMINATE VITAL BORDER SECURITY OPERATIONS BY REVOKING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ISSUED LAST MONTH. IT IS DEFINITELY A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. RARELY HAVE WE HAD SUCH A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. THEREFORE TO DEFEND THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS, I WILL BE SIGNING AND ISSUING A FORMAL VETO OF THIS RECKLESS RESOLUTION, AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. AND I HAVE TO IN PARTICULAR THANK THE REPUBLICANS, STRONG, WONDERFUL PEOPLE, THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT WERE ON OUR SIDE, AND ON THE SIDE OF BORDER SECURITY, AND ON THE SIDE OF DOING WHAT THEY HAVE TO TO KEEP OUR NATION SAFE. THEY WERE VERY COURAGEOUS YESTERDAY. AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. CONGRESS' VOTE TO DENY THE CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER IS A VOTE AGAINST REALITY. IT IS AGAINST REALITY. IT IS A TREMENDOUS NATIONAL EMERGENCY. IT'S A TREMENDOUS CRISIS. LAST MONTH MORE THAN 76,000 ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARRIVED AT OUR BORDER. WE'RE ON TRACK FOR A MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS TO RUSH OUR BORDERS. PEOPLE HATE THE WORD INVASION, BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S AN INVASION OF DRUGS AND CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, BUT WE CAPTURE THEM BECAUSE BORDER SECURITY IS SO GOOD. BUT THEY'RE PUT IN A VERY BAD POSITION. WE'RE BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. LITERALLY BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. WHAT BORDER PATROL IS ABLE TO DO IS INCREDIBLE. I ALSO, BY THE WAY, WANT TO THANK OUR MILITARY BECAUSE OUR MILITARY HAS BEEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED, AS YOU KNOW. AND THEY'RE PUTTING UP WALLS, IN SOME CASES TEMPORARY, IN SOME CASES THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY. THEY'RE SO GOOD THAT THEY'RE BETTER THAN THE PERMANENT, SO WE'RE LEAVING THEM. WE'VE REALLY NOWHERE LEFT TO HOLD ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE CAPTURING, AND WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SAY WITH THESE HORRIBLE DECISIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HANDED BY PEOPLE THAT AREN'T LIVING IN REALITY THAT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN DO. WE'RE BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. YOU CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. AND THE ONLY OPTION THEN IS TO RELEASE THEM, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT EITHER, BECAUSE WHEN YOU RELEASE THEM, THEY COME INTO OUR SOCIETY. AND IN MANY CASES THEY'RE STONE COLD CRIMINALS. AND IN MANY CASES, AND IN SOME CASES, YOU HAVE KILLERS COMING IN AND MURDERERS COMING IN, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. JUST NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. THERE'S BEEN NEARLY 2000% INCREASE IN BORDER-RELATED ASYLUM CLAIMS OVER THE LAST DECADE. PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL ECONOMICALLY THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING UP IN DROVES. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE REJECTED, BUT SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS MAKING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, LIKE THEY'VE NEVER MADE BEFORE, ARE USING THESE PEOPLE TO CRASH THE SYSTEM. OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS STRETCHED BEYOND THE BREAKING POINT, AND AS I SAID, NOTHING MUCH WE CAN DO. WE CAN JUST DO OUR JOB AND DO IT WELL, BUT THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH, IF THE DEMOCRATS WOULD, WOULD GET IT, WE'D BE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, LITERALLY IN 15 MINUTES, WE COULD MAKE A DEAL ON CHANGING CATCH AND RELEASE, CHANGING THE HORRIBLE ASYLUM LAWS THAT ARE SO UNFAIR, CHANGING VISA LOTTERY, CHAIN MIGRATION. THESE LAWS ARE JUST HORRENDOUS. I WON'T EXPLAIN THEM. BUT EVERYBODY STANDING BEHIND ME KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE. THEY'RE DANGEROUS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE INSPIRED BY DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE TO CHANGE. ONE IN THREE MIGRANT WOMEN IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE JOURNEY NORTH. THE BORDER CRISIS IS DRIVING THE DRUG CRISIS. 70,000 AMERICANS A YEAR ARE KILLED BY DRUGS INCLUDING METH, HEROIN, COCAINE AND FENTANYL, AND THE 70,000 PEOPLE IS A NUMBER THAT IS SO LOW THAT IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE USED ANYMORE. THE MASS INCURSION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS, DEADLY DRUGS, DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND CRIMINAL GANG MEMBERS ACROSS OUR BORDERS HAS TO END. WE ARE BRINGING OUT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS A YEAR OF MS-13 GANG MEMBERS AND OTHER GANG MEMBERS THAT ARE JUST AS BAD. WHERE THEY COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, THEY'RE ABLE TO SKIRT THE BORDER, COME TO AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE PROPER WALL, WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY WALL AT ALL, AND THEY GET INTO THE COUNTRY, AND THEY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE IN MANY CASES. BUT WE GET THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS, AND WE BRING THEM BACK OR WE INCARCERATE THEM. THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY I DECLARED LAST MONTH WAS AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS UNDER THE 1976 NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT. AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN TOO MANY THAT ARE BIGGER EMERGENCIES THAN WE HAVE RIGHT AT OUR OWN BORDER. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DESIGNED BY OUR FOUNDERS, TODAY I AM VETOING THIS RESOLUTION. CONGRESS HAS THE FREEDOM TO PASS THIS RESOLUTION, AND I HAVE THE DUTY TO VETO IT, AND I'M PROUD TO VETO IT. AND I'M VERY PROUD AS I SAID, OF A LOT OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT WERE WITH ME. AND I'M ALSO VERY PROUD OF THE HOUSE. THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF A SECURE BORDER. SINCE 1976, PRESIDENTS HAVE DECLARED 59 NATIONAL EMERGENCIES. THEY OFTEN INVOLVE PROTECTING FOREIGN CITIZENS IN FAR OFF LANDS. YET CONGRESS HAS NOT TERMINATED ANY OF THEM. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS STILL IN EXISTENCE. AND YET WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT OUR LAND. WE WORRY ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S LAND. THAT'S WHY I SAY, AMERICA FIRST, IF THAT'S OK, AMERICA FIRST. THE ONLY EMERGENCY CONGRESS VOTED TO REVOKE WAS THE ONE TO PROTECT OUR OWN COUNTRY. SO THINK OF THAT. WITH ALL OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, THIS WAS THE ONE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO. AND THIS IS THE ONE PERHAPS THEY SHOULD MOST DO. WE'RE JOINED TODAY BY MANY BRAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INCLUDING SHERIFFS AND JUST PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN JUST TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS BACKERS OF LAW AND ORDER. WHICH WE HAVE TO HAVE. WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY FRIENDS OF MINE, MARY ANN MENDOZA, KEN TERRY, LAURA WILKERSON, SABINE DURDIN, AND STEVE RODBECK. I'LL ASK STEVE TO SAY A FEW WORDS, AND ASK SOME OF THE FOLKS BEHIND ME TO SAY ALSO A FEW WORDS AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT. AS I SAID, I WAS ELECTED ON A VERY, BY A VERY, VERY GREAT GROUP OF AMERICAN PEOPLE, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY WANT SECURITY FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. I'D LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY NIELSEN TO SAY A FEW WORDS, AND THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR, AND THEN I'D LIKE TO GO TO SOME OF THE FOLKS BEHIND ME, AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SIGN SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US SAFETY AT OUR BORDER. SECRETARY? I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR CONSTANT SUPPORT OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN, NOT ONLY REPRESENTED BEHIND YOU, THE VERY FRONT LINES OF OUR COUNTRY, AND AT CBP AND ICE. THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY IS UNDENIABLE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS TYPE OF FLOW. AS YOU KNOW, IT'S PREDOMINANTLY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHICH MEANS THERE'S A VERY UNIQUE AND DANGEROUS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT HAND IN ADDITION TO THE SECURITY , THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IN YOUR REMARKS. SO WE HAVE A DUTY TO KNOW WHO COMES IN OUR COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOW IS SAFE AND ORDERLY. THAT'S WHAT YOU ATTEMPTED TO DO, THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE DEMANDED THAT CONGRESS DO, AND I AGAIN ASK CONGRESS TO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION. WE'VE GIVEN YOU THE FACTS. THE SYSTEM IS BREAKING. SECURITY IS AT RISK. AND THE VERY HUMANITARIAN PROTECTIONS THAT WE HOLD DEAR IN THIS COUNTRY ARE AT RISK IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SO MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU ALWAYS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND GREAT SUPPORT. MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR DECLARATION OF AN EMERGENCY ON THOSE TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE SOUTHERN BORDER WAS CLEARLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRECEDENT. AS YOU SAID, THE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT DIRECTLY AUTHORIZES THE PRESIDENT, GIVES BROAD DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT, TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO EMERGENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REQUIRE A DECISIVE RESPONSE. AND THE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CRISIS WE HAVE ON THE BORDER RIGHT NOW IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF EMERGENCY THAT PRESIDENTS ARE PERMITTED TO ADDRESS UNDER THE NATIONAL EMERGENCIES ACT. AS YOU ALLUDED TO YOURSELF, IN THE PAST 40 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN 59 EMERGENCIES DECLARED. AND MANY OF THESE HAVE DEALT WITH POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES LIKE BURUNDI, SIERRA LEONE, BELARUS. THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY IS RIGHT ON OUR DOORSTEP. IT PRESENTS A REAL CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO WHAT YOU'VE DONE FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT IS PROBABLY GROUNDED IN LAW, AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT'S IMPERATIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'LL BE DEFENDING IT, YOU'LL DEFEND IT WELL, I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING? WHY DON'T WE START WITH MIKE? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO BE STANDING NEXT TO YOUR DESK THAN I AM TODAY. THANK YOU. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE TO BE : STANDING WITH THESE COURAGEOUS AMERICANS AND WITH THESE WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN EXTRAORDINARY ANGEL PARENTS. WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. REALITY IS, IT'S NOT ONLY A CRISIS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WITH THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS ARE COMING ACROSS OUR BORDER, THE FLOW OF DRUGS. NOW DRUG OVERDOSE IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AMERICANS UNDER THE AGE OF 55. THE CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IS A CRISIS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. ADD IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND ALL THAT COMES WITH THIS CRISIS JUSTIFY THE PRESIDENT'S DECLARATION OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. THIS IS AFFECTING ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. AND TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WITH YOUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, HOMELAND SECURITY, AND WITH, I KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR LOVE IN YOUR HEART FOR THESE ANGEL PARENTS, YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR WORD BY VETOING THIS LEGISLATION. BY FINDING THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO BUILD A WALL, ADDRESS THIS EMERGENCY, AND SECURE OUR BORDER. AND I KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL GATHERED HERE AND PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHEN I SAY THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR WORD, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A VERY NECESSARY VETO TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY IN THIS COUNTRY. THE SHERIFFS AND MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS ROOM AND ACROSS THIS NATION OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR DECADES. OUR HATS ARE OFF TO YOU AGAIN, SIR. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE, IT'S AN HONOR FOR SHERIFFS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS, AND IT'S AN HONOR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE FIGHT THE DRUG TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PROFESSION FROM AN INSECURE BORDER. SO AGAIN, SINCERELY, WE THANK YOU, SIR. MR. PRESIDENT, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S SHERIFFS. AS YOU ALL KNOW, THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE FIGHTING A BATTLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY ARE IN THE TRENCHES. WHILE WE AMERICANS ONLY MAKE UP ABOUT 7% OF THE WORLD'S TOTAL POPULATION, ABOUT 68% OF THE WORLD'S TOTAL DRUGS ARE CONSUMED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL PROPAGANDA. WE HAVE A DIRE CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHWEST BORDER. AND AMERICA'S SHERIFFS STAND BEHIND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 100%. HE HAS HAD OUR BACK. HE HAS HAD THE AMERICANS' BACK, AND WE STAND BEHIND YOU SOLIDLY FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVERY DAY. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR A PRESIDENT TO TAKE THIS TYPE OF ACTION. WE COMMEND YOU, WE APPLAUD YOU, AND I SALUTE YOU, SIR. MY SON WAS KILLED IN 2014 BY A REPEAT ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY. HE WAS A POLICE OFFICER IN MESA, ARIZONA. AND ANGEL FAMILIES COME FORWARD TO TELL THEIR STORIES NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE CREATED A MANUFACTURED BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SHARE WITH YOU OUR HEARTACHE AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING ON OUR DOORSTEPS, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR NEIGHBORS, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS, AND THERE IS A WAY TO PREVENT THIS AND IT IS NOT BY CONTINUOUSLY LYING AND TELLING YOU THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM. THERE'S A PROBLEM, IT'S A NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND THANK YOU. MR. PRESIDENT, I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING WE'RE NOT USED TO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, TO HAVE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT. WHAT WE SAY IN ARIZONA, THIS ISN'T ABOUT IMMIGRATION ANYMORE. THIS IS ABOUT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTO THIS COUNTRY. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CARE ABOUT BORDER SECURITY. HUMAN BEINGS ARE BEING, THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED ON THAT BORDER EVERY DAY. AND I KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ARIZONA BORDER SHERIFFS THAT I CHALLENGE OUR CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN TO COME DOWN HERE AND SEE WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. SEE FOR YOURSELVES BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR VOTE. AND YOU WILL SEEAND I KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ARIZONA BORDER SHERIFFS THAT THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A CRISIS. AND WE ARE FIGHTING EVERY DAY ALONGSIDE LOCAL PARTNERS, SHERIFF'S OFFICES, TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE BEEN SHERIFF FOR 21 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH HIGH RISK FOR 21 YEARS ON THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE PUSH THROUGH 21 YEARS BUT YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE WHO HAS TAKEN ACTION AND YOU HAVE GIVEN US BACK OUR FOOTING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU ARE GIVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BACK WHAT THEY DESERVE, TO BE PROTECTED AND SIGNING THIS TODAY, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ALL OF US IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT IMPORTANTLY, WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS IS ALL MANUFACTURED, NO IT IS NOT. , IN MY COUNTY ALONE, ONE CITY WE HAVE ON AVERAGE ON SECOND , SHIFT IN THE HOSPITAL IN BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS, 15 TO 20 OVERDOSES ON SECOND SHIFT EVERY DAY. THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. BUT MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE STOOD UP AND TAKEN THE ACTION. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEHIND YOU, WE ARE BEHIND YOU. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING. [APPLAUSE] MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU DON'T THINK IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOUR FAMILY, I HAVE A QUICK STORY. I HAVE BEEN WITH STATE POLICE FOR OVER 30 YEARS, WORKING IN NARCOTICS, GANG TASK FORCES, AND SUPERVISED THOSE FOR 22 YEARS. MY SON GREW UP WITH DEPRESSION ISSUES AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. HE SELF-MEDICATED WITH MARIJUANA. AT 18, HIS FATHER, ME, I HAD HIM ARRESTED AROUND THE WAY. BUT HE MOVED OUT WHEN HE TURNED 18 BECAUSE HE KNEW DAD HAD RULES AND ONE WAS NO DRUGS IN THE , HOUSE. HE MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE TO STAY WITH SOME FRIENDS, GOT A JOB. HE HAD A WORK-RELATED INJURY WHERE HE SEVERED FOUR FINGERS AND WAS INTRODUCED TO OPIOIDS. SO HE WAS BATTLING MENTAL ILLNESS, AND THE OPIOID ADDICTION. AFTERWARDS, HE FINALLY CAME TO ME, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE SAID HE NEEDED HELP. WE SENT THEM TO A REHAB FACILITY FOR 30 DAYS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT , OUR INSURANCE COULD PAY FOR. HE CAME OUT OF REHAB AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS. THE CRAVING WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM, HE GOT A HOLD OF SOME HEROIN LACED WITH FENTANYL AND DIED ON DECEMBER 13, 2017. SO I AM HERE TO SAY AS FAR AS STIGMA GOES WITH NARCOTICS, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY, MY FATHER IS A RETIRED MINISTER OF 45 YEARS MY SISTER , IS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD, BROTHER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, NO ONE SMOKES IN OUR FAMILY, NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED IT HAPPENED TO , ME AND OUR FAMILY, SO IT CAN HAPPEN. THAT IS HOW HORRIFIC AND ADDICTIVE THIS DRUG IS. ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP US AND FAMILIES LIKE US IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. THIS IS THE FIRST REAL STEP IN CONFRONTING THE HEROIN AND DRUG CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE REAL STRIDES AFTER THIS. I AM THE SHERIFF OF YOUR HOME OF CAMP DAVID. WE SUFFER THE SAME PROBLEMS THERE AND I AM CONVINCED WHAT YOU ARE DOING TODAY, EVERY COUNTY BECOMES A BORDER COUNTY. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN WE FIRST MET ON THE CAMPAIGN, WHEN THEY SAID, OH, TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO WIN YOU SAID TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN AND I SAID, THEY WILL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN. RIGHT? THAT'S TRUE. I SAY IT TODAY WITH EVEN MORE MEANING. IT WAS A BIG STEP. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. THAT'S A BIG STEP. WE'RE BUILDING A LOT OF WALL RIGHT NOW. IT HAS STARTED. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING, YOU TOOK DOWN WELL, WE TOOK DOWN WALL THAT ALMOST DIDN'T EXIST. IT WAS LIKE PAPER. AND WE'RE REPLACING IT WITH IN MANY CASES WITH 30-FOOT BOLLARDS AND IN MANY PLACES WE ARE REPLACING IT WITH 18-FOOT WALL. BUT WE HAVE MANY MILES UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SIGNING CONTRACTS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS FOR LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILES OF WALL. AND IT'S BEING BUILT IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND IT'S DOING THE , JOB. IT'S DOING THE JOB. AND IT'S INTERESTING. IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WATER. AS WE DO, WE DID SAN DIEGO. YOU KNOW, CALIFORNIA IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY KEEP TALKING IN CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T WANT WALLS. I SEE A NEW CANDIDATE IN THE MIX, HE WANTS TO TAKE DOWN THE WALL. TRY THAT SOMETIME. YOU'LL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN. YOU WILL HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING IN. TAKE A LOOK AT TIJUANA. TAKE DOWN THAT WALL. YOU WANT TO SEE A MESS? TAKE DOWN THAT WALL, YOU'LL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE IN TIJUANA TRYING TO GET IN. THEY'RE NOT GETTING IN. SO AS WE BUILD IT, IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER. BUT IT GETS REALLY TO A POINT, AND THEY COME THROUGH A POINT, BUT YOU CAN CONTROL THAT POINT. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. THIS IS , WE ARE ABLE TO DO IT CHEAPER, BETTER, BETTER WALL, IT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING GOING UP. WE HAD TO TAKE THE OLD PLANS, WE DIDN'T WANT TO STOP, SO WE TOOK OLD PLANS, WE DID NOT LIKE IT, THIS WALL IS A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING STRUCTURE, IT IS MUCH STRONGER AND YOU CAN BUILD IT FASTER AND , CHEAPER. OTHER THAN THAT, WHAT CAN THEY SAY? IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. AND ON TOP OF THAT, I HAVE TO THANK THE SECRETARY AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED SO HARD, BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO IN THE BORDER PATROL, WHAT YOU DO, WHAT THOSE PATROL AGENTS AND WHAT THE ICE FOLKS DO, AND TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO. EVEN SOME OF THE SHERIFFS SAY, IF YOU CAN GET ICE TO DO IT, YOU DON'T MIND IF THEY DO IT, RIGHT, SHERIFF? AS TOUGH AS YOU ARE. THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. AND THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT THE ICE FOLKS TAKE SUCH ABUSE FROM DEMOCRATS AND SOME OTHERS, THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY AS MUCH AS ANYBODY LOVES OUR COUNTRY. SO WE'RE BUILDING A LOT OF WALL, AND WE'RE TAKING GOOD CARE OF OUR PEOPLE, AND WE'RE DOING AT POINT OF ENTRY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. WE'RE ALREADY IN CONTRACT TO BUY , THEY MAKE PRETTY INCREDIBLE NEW EQUIPMENT FOR DRUG DETECTION WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S IN THE WHEEL OF A CAR, WHERE IT IS, WHERE IT'S IN THE ENGINE, WHERE IT'S IN THE HUBCAPS. WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE STUFF. PLUS WE HAVE, ALSO WE'RE GETTING DOGS, MORE DOGS, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. I STILL SAY, IT'S STILL TRUE, NOTHING REPLACES A GOOD DOG, IS THAT RIGHT? WE CAN BUY THIS EQUIPMENT THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE, IT IS TRUE, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MATCH THE DOG. I'VE SEEN SECRET SERVICE, THEY SHOWED ME THE DOGS, CERTAIN TYPES OF GERMAN SHEPHERD, VERY SPECIFIC TYPES OF DOG. BUT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY WILL RUN BY 15 BOXES ALL EMPTY EXCEPT ONE. AND THEY'LL BE VERY, VERY STRONGLY SEALED BOXES, AND THEY'LL COME RUNNING FULL SPEED AND STOP LIKE ON A DIME. THEY KNOW THE DRUGS ARE IN THAT BOX. IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING. SO WE'RE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON EQUIPMENT, BUT I WILL SAY THIS. BUT IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE DOGS. AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING, YOU HAVE THE BEST EQUIPMENT. WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF DOGS FOR THE VARIOUS ENTRY POINTS ALSO. SO WITH THAT, I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE. IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOLKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN , AND PLEASE SAY HELLO TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN WITH US REALLY FROM DAY ONE. WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IS UNTHINKABLE. AND I APPRECIATE IT. AND YOU'RE STRONG PEOPLE. YOU'RE STRONG AND YOU'RE PROUD. AND YOUR KIDS ARE LOOKING DOWN ON YOU RIGHT NOW, AND THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF THEIR MOMS AND THEIR DADS. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? THEY'RE VERY PROUD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND AGAIN TO THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT DID WHAT THEY HAD TO DO YESTERDAY, I WANT TO THANK THEM. THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL FRIENDS, AND VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE, AND THEY WANT TO SEE BORDERS THAT ARE STRONG, WHERE WE DON'T ALLOW DRUGS AND CRIME AND ALL OF THE PROBLEMS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY. I THINK IT'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE VERY, VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS. I GUESS IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW ZEALAND, PERHAPS THAT'S A CASE. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT YET. THEY'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE PERSON AND THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A TERRIBLE THING. TERRIBLE THING. YES? MR. PRESIDENT, SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THIS RESOLUTION SAY THEY SUPPORT BORDER SECURITY BUT OPPOSE EXECUTIVE OVERREACH. DO YOU HAVE SYMPATHY I DO. THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. LOOK, I PUT NO PRESSURE ON ANYBODY. I ACTUALLY SAID , I COULD HAVE GOTTEN SOME OF THEM TO COME ALONG. I SAID, I WANT YOU TO VOTE YOUR HEART, DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO , I'M NOT PUTING PRESSURE. I'LL LET THEM KNOW WHEN THERE'S PRESSURE. I TOLD THEM THAT. WHEN I NEED YOUR VOTE, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T NEED THE VOTE. BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A VETO. AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERRIDE. IT IS GOING TO GO VERY QUICKLY. AS YOUR ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST SAID, THE CASE IS A VERY STRONG CASE, VERY POWERFUL CASE. I THINK ACTUALLY NATIONAL EMERGENCY WAS DESIGNED FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE LIKE THIS. SO WE HAVE A GREAT WE HAVE A , GREAT CASE, AND I THINK IT'S GOING VERY , IDEALLY THEY SHOULDN'T SUE IN THIS CASE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH THEY SHOULDN'T BE SUING IN THIS , CASE. BUT THEY WILL BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS DO. WE WANT BORDER SECURITY, WE WANT SAFETY, WE WANT NO DRUGS, WE WANT NO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OK? I DID NOT SEE IT. I DID NOT SEE IT. BUT I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE EVENT. IT'S A HORRIBLE THING. I SAW IT EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN NEW ZEALAND. I JUST SPOKE, AS YOU KNOW TO THE , PRIME MINISTER. I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE, DISGRACEFUL THING AND A HORRIBLE ACT. OK? THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

WITH THE HARD-WORKING PATRIOTS FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE ARE BRINGING A LOT OF THOSE CAR COMPANIES BACK. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU? THEY ARE COMING BACK. THEY ARE POURING BACK IN. THEY ARE COMING BACK FAST. THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR AMERICA. THE ECONOMY IS ROARING. THE ISIS CALIPHATE IS DEFEATED 100%. AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF LIES AND SMEARS AND SLANDER, THE RUSSIA HOAX IS FINALLY DEAD. THE COLLUSION DELUSION IS OVER. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL COMPLETED ITS REPORT AND FOUND NO COLLUSION AND NO OBSTRUCTION. I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT 2.5 YEARS AGO VERY EASILY. TOTAL EXONERATION. COMPLETE VINDICATION. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, ROBERT MUELLER WAS A GOD TO THE DEMOCRATS, WAS A GOD TO THEM UNTIL HE SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THEY DON'T LIKE HIM SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. THE CRAZY ATTEMPT BY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE , [CROWD BOOING] AND THE DEEP STATE TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE 2016 ELECTION HAVE FAILED. THE GREATEST ELECTION THAT WE HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME, MAYBE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. [CROWD CHANGING "TRUMP"] , [CROWD CHANTING "TRUMP"] THIS WAS NOTHING BUT AN EFFORT TO SABOTAGE THE WILL OF THE AMERICA. THIS IS THE ONE , WE WANT OURSELVES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. WE CAME FROM ALL OVER TO VOTE. THEY ARE NEVER TAKING IT AWAY FROM US. NEVER. OUR MOVEMENT AGAINST THE CORRUPT MEDIA , AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CORRUPT THAN IT IS TODAY. AND MANY SPECIAL INTERESTS. THAT IS WHY THEY TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE US OUT. BUT WE ARE VERY TOUGH TO TAKE OUT, AREN'T WE? VERY TOUGH. THE RUSSIA WITCHHUNT WAS A PLAN BY THOSE WHO LOST THE ELECTION TRO TRY AN , TO TRY AND ILLEGALLY REGAIN POWER BY FRAMING MEDICINE AMERICANS, MANY OF THEM. AN ELABORATE HOAX. THEY WANTED TO DESTROY A MOVEMENT LIKE OUR COUNTRY IS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. IT'S TRUE. NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND BELIEVE ME, IF THESE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS NOT TRUE, THEY WOULD BE RIGHT AGAIN. THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. NOBODY HAS IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND IN MOST COUNTRY'S HISTORIES THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WE DID IN 2016 ON NOVEMBER 8. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DEFEATED A VERY CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT AND WE KEPT OUR PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY. TODAY, OUR MOVEMENT AND OUR COUNTRY ARE THRIVING. THEIR FRAUD AHS BEEN EXPOSED AND THE KRILL ABILITY , THE CREDIBILITY OF THOSE WHO PUSHED THIS HOAX IS FOREVER BROKEN. AND THEY HAVE NOW GOT BIG PROBLEMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE HARM DONE TO OUR COUNTRY, THINK OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THINK OF THE TIME WASTED. AND YET DESPITE THIS TERRIBLE CLOUD, THIS PHONY, CORRUPT, DISGUSTING CLOUD, WE HAVE DONE MORE TOGETHER IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THIS GROUP OF MAJOR LOSERS DID NOT JUST RUTHLESSLY ATTACK ME, MY FAMILY, AND EVERYONE WHO QUESTIONED THEI R LIES. THEY TRIED TO DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY, TO POISON THE NATIONAL DEBATE, AND TO TEAR UP THE FABRIC OF OUR GREAT DEMOCRACY, THE GREATEST OF ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THEY DID IT ALL BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, PROBABLY NUMBER ONE, IN OUR HISTORY. MANY, MANY PEOPLE WERE BADLY HURT BY THIS SCAM. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY WAS HURT. OUR COUNTRY WAS HURT. AND THEY'RE ON ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATORS RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE GETTING MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION. LITTLE PENCIL NECK ADAM SCHIFF. [CROWD BOOING] HE HAS THE SMALLEST, THINNING NECK I HAVE EVER SEEN. HE IS NOT A LONG BALL HITTING. I SAW TODAY, WELL, WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW, THERE STILL COULD HAVE BEEN SOME RUSSIA COLLUSION. SICK. SICK. THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. AND THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY, BECAUSE IT IS ALL LIES. AND THEY KNOW IT IS LIES. THEY KNOW IT. THEY KNOW IT IS. JERRY NADLER, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING HIM. FOR MANY YEARS HE WAS THE CONGRESSMAN FROM MANHATTAN. I HAVE BUILT GREAT THINGS IN MANHATTAN. I HAVE BEAT HIM MANY TIMES AND NOW I HAVE TO COME HERE AND BEAT HIM AGAIN. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I WON EVERY RECORD IN THE HISTORY OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. NOTHING. WE WILL FIND SOMETHING SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES. A MISTAKE MUST HAVE BEEN MADE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE CRICKET JOURNALISTS , CROOKED JOURNALISTS, THE TOTALLY DISHONEST TV PUNDITS. BY THE WAY, THEY KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE. THEY JUST GET GREAT RATINGS. BY THE WAY, THEIR RATINGS DROPPED THROUGH THE FLOOR LAST NIGHT, DID YOU SEE THAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND OUR FRIENDS, TUCKER, SHAWN, LAURA, THROUGH THE ROOF LAST NIGHT. AND ALL THE CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICIALS WHO PAID FOR, PROMOTED, AND PERPETUATED THE SINGLE GREATEST HOAX IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY HAVE TO BE , I AM SORRY, THEY HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. [CROWD CHANTING "LOCK THEM UP"] JUST THINK OF IT. A FAKE, DIRTY DOSSIER, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAID FOR IT. BY WHO? CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, THE DNC, IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THINK OF IT. BUT THEY FAILED. THEY FAILED IN ONE WAY. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? MAYBE I GOT LUCKY. MAYBE I GOT LUCKY. BECAUSE THE FAKE NEWS, THEY WOULD NOT PUT IT ON. EVEN THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IT. THINK OF IT. THEY SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THE DEAL WAS THEY WOULD GET IT PUBLISHED OR PRINTED, ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE LIES, ALL NOW EXPOSED AS FAKE. THEY WERE GOING TO GET IT PRINTED JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND THEY COULD NOT GET ANY OF THE MEDIA TO PRINTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOU APPRECIATE , I APPRECIATE IT. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU LOSE A FEW VOTES AND THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE. BUT THEY WOULD NOT PRINTED. , PRINT IT. SO ON THAT SCORE, I GIVE THE MEDIA A LOT OF CREDIT. IT CAME OUT AFTER THE ELECTION AND EVELYN HAD A BIG, FAT YAWN. AND I HEARD ABOUT RUSSIA. I WOULD BE HEARING, THEY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RUSSIA. RUSSIA? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO , THIS WENT ON. ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEAR, REVIEW INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA? I SAID RUSSIA? WHAT THE HELL DOES RUSSIA HAVE TO DO WITH MY CAMPAIGN? IT'S TRUE. RUSSIA? RUSSIA? YOU KNOW, I GO UP TO WISCONSIN, WHERE SHE DID NOT GO. MANY YEARS, DECADES SINCE A REPUBLICAN WON. ALTHOUGH BILL CLINTON SAID HE WAS IN WISCONSIN, YOU BETTER GET UP THERE, THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUMP/PENCE SIGNS. YOU BETTER GET UP THERE, DARLIN'. THEY SAID NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT WISCONSIN, THE POSTER SAY WE ARE DOING GREAT. THEY DON'T GO TO A PLACE CALLED MICHIGAN. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD MICHIGAN? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAN BILL CLINTON SAID I WAS IN MICHIGAN, YOU BETTER GET TO MICHIGAN, IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD. THEY HAVE SO MANY OF THOSE DAMN SIGNS. EVERYWHERE I LOOKED THERE IS A SIGN. NO, MICHIGAN HAS NOT BEEN LOST IN DECADES BY THE DEMS. BY THE DEMS. HASN'T BEEN LOST. AND IF YOU REMEMBER, THIS WAS MY LAST STOP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS WAS IT. AND I WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT. BECAUSE I HEARD CROOKED HILLARY AND BILL, BARACK OBAMA AND MICHELLE , [CROWD BOOING] THEY WERE ALL ADDED , HEADED HERE AT THE LAST MOMENT. THEY HAD A TINY LITTLE CROWD, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I HAD MORE THAN THIS, BUT EVERY SEAT IS GONE AND OUTSIDE YOU HAVE 25,000 PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I REMEMBER LEAVING AND I SAID, SO SHE HAS 500 PEOPLE AND I HAD 32,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE MORE TONIGHT BECAUSE OUTSIDE WE HAVE EVEN MORE THAN WE DID THEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I STARTED SPEAKING AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING. SO IT IS NOW ELECTION DAY. I ACTUALLY SAID, AM I ALLOWED TO DO THIS? IT IS 1:00 IN THE MORNING. WHEN I HEARD SHE WAS COMING A SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHAT THE HELL. IT WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT, LAST SECOND. WE CALLED AND WE HAD 32,000 PEOPLE. SHE HAD A SMALL CROWD. I SAID SO LET ME ASK, SO SHE IS HERE IN PRIMETIME, 7:30. I AM HERE AT ONE IN THE MORNING. SHE HAS 500 PEOPLE AND I HAVE 32,000. YOU EXPLAIN, WHY AM I GOING TO LOSE MICHIGAN? WHY? WHY AM I GOING TO LOSE MICHIGAN? WHY AM I GOING TO LOSE THE GREAT STATE? I WAS ASKING MY PEOPLE. I GET HOME AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND I TOLD OUR GREAT FIRST LADY, SOON-TO-BE FIRST LADY, AND SHE IS DOING A GREAT JOB BECAUSE I LOVE HER. I SAID I HAD THIS INCREDIBLE CROWD AND I DID NOT START SPEAKING UNTIL 1:00 IN THE MORNING. I SAID HOW THE HELL CAN I LOSE MICHIGAN? AND GUESS WHAT? WE DID NOT LOSE MICHIGAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DID NOT LOSE WISCONSIN, EITHER. AND THE FACT IS WE WON A LOT OF PLACES THAT NIGHT. WE WON PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA, IOWA, YOU BETTER BELIEVE IOWA. WE LOVE IOWA. WE WON A LOT. WE WON 306 TO 223. WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS GOOD? REMEMBER, THEY SAID THERE IS NO WAY , THE DAY OF THE ELECTION I AM SAYING THIS IS PRETTY LOUSY. IT IS ALL FAKE NEWS. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT IT IN YOUR HEAD. THEY ARE GOING THERE IS NO WAY TO 270. IN OTHER WORDS I NEEDED TO 72 WIN. , I NEEDED 270 TO WIN. ON CNN, THERE IS NO WAY , THERE WAS NO RED. THEY WERE DYING. THERE IS NO WAY TO 270 FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT WILL BE A VERY SHORT EVENING FOR DONALD TRUMP. JUST NO WAY. AND THEY WERE RIGHT. WE DID NOT GET 270. WE GOT 306, OK? BUT IN THIS COUNTRY , [CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS"] BUT IN THIS COUNTRY, WE CANNOT CRIMINALIZE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. WE DO NOT ABUSE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE POWER TO TARGET OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS, WHERE THEY SPY ON ME. WHOEVER HEARD OF THIS? THEY SPIED ON ME. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN. WHO WOULD THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE? THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL HOAX IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND GUESS WHAT? WE WON. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. WE LOVE TO WIN. THEY TRIED TO TAKE SOMETHING GREAT AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM ALL OVER. I ALWAYS SAY THEY CAME FROM THE VALLEYS, THEY CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS, THEY CAME OUT OF THE DAMN RIVERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN THE RIVERS. BUT THEY CAME AND THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THESE PEOPLE EXISTED. THEY ARE HARD-WORKING, THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY ARE THE SMARTEST, THE TOUGHEST, THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE. THEY ARE. THEY ARE THE SMARTEST. REMEMBER THIS ABOUT YOURSELF. THE ELITE, THE ELITE. I ALWAYS SAID, I SAID IT HERE LAST NIGHT. I ALWAYS SAY, THEY SAY THE ELITE. THEY ARE THE ELITE, I AM NOT. I HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION THAN THEM. I AM SMARTER THAN THEM. I WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOLS, THEY DIDN'T. MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT. MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING. AND I AM PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE NOT. AND THEN THEY SAY, THE ELITE, THE ELITE. THEY ARE NOT ELITE. YOU ARE ELITE. WE ARE THE ELITE. I GET A KICK. SO AND SO, THIS ELITE. THEN YOU SEE THIS LITTLE GUY, THIS SCHLEPPER. YOU ARE SMARTER, YOU ARE SHARPER, MORE LOYAL, A HELL OF A LOT TOUGHER, A HALL , HELL OF A LOT TOUGHER. WE CANNOT HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, ONE WHERE THE LEFT-WING RADICAL ESTABLISHMENT CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING THEY WANT. [CROWD BOOING] BUT YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I SAID IT LAST NIGHT. WE HAVE SOME GREAT FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA, TOO. YOU LOOK AT RUSH AND SEAN AND LAURA AND STEVE AND TUCKER AND JANINE. JANINE IS BACK. GOING TO BE BACK ON SATURDAY NIGHT. RIGHT? AND EVEN GREG LIKES ME NOW. HE STARTED A LITTLE SLOW BUT HE LIKES ME. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT SUPPORT. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT SUPPORT. FAR MORE THAN YOU THINK. BUT WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THE SUPPORT ARE THE VOTERS THAT PULLED THE HANDLE OR WHATEVER THE HELL THEY ARE PULLING, THEY ARE PULLING IT FOR US. THE RUSSIA HOAX PROVES MORE THAN EVER THAT WE NEED TO FINISH EXACTLY WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO. DRAIN THE SWAMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS, OR IF THEY WILL APOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND JOIN US TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, WHICH WE ARE DOING INCREDIBLY. HELP US FIX OUR BROKEN TRADE DEALS, WHICH ARE COMING ALONG REALLY WELL. WE HAVE OUR TEAM RIGHT NOW IN CHINA, THEY JUST ARRIVED. CHINA. CHINA. WE HAVE GONE UP, THEY HAVE GONE DOWN, BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY. CHINA. AND BY THE WAY, WE ARE BUILDING THAT WALL. WE ARE BUILDING THAT WALL. BUILDING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAD TO GO DOWN AND LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PATH BUT THAT IS OK. NATIONAL EMERGENCY IT IS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BORDER AND YOU LOOK AT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVADING, OR AT LEAST TRYING TO INVADE OUR COUNTRY, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WE NEED IT. AND WE ARE BUILDING IT AND WE ARE BUILDING A LOT FASTER. AND BETTER. AND BETTER. IT IS BETTER, IT IS FASTER, AND IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE. AND IT IS ALSO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL. AND WE ARE BUILDING IT VERY RAPIDLY. WE HAVE RENOVATED VAST AMOUNTS OF WALL. A LOT OF IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE. WE RENOVATED IT FOR $.25 ON THE DOLLAR. THAT IS OK, TOO, RIGHT? THE FAKE NEWS DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE US ANY CREDIT FOR RENOVATION. THEY SAY, EVEN IF YOU RIP IT DOWN AND BUILD A BRAND-NEW WALL WHERE THE WALL WAS, THEY CALL THAT A RENOVATION. THAT IS NOT A RENOVATION TO ME. THAT IS NOT. THEY DO ANYTHING THEY CAN , IT SHOULD BE SCHIFF. THEY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SORT OF MAKE IT LOOK NOT SO GOOD. WE ARE REALLY DOING WELL, BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE BETTER ECONOMICALLY, AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET IN. AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN BASED ON MERIT. BASED ON MERIT. DESPITE ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE EVERY DAY, WE ARE WORKING AND FIGHTING AND WINNING. REMEMBER THAT. BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREAT FOR ALL AMERICANS. ALL AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER AGREED WITH THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO. MAYBE. THAT IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION. THAT'AS AN EMBARRASSMENT NOT ONLY TO CHICAGO, THAT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY, WHAT TOOK PLACE THERE. REMEMBER THAT. BUT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IT.

WE WILL GET IT DONE. IT IS TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME. YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT OVER 30 YEARS. I WOULD SAY IT IS TIME, RIGHT? ALSO, AND AS YOU KNOW, THIS ONE WE HAVE ALREADY PRETTY MUCH LOCKED UP. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? BECAUSE WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO GETTING STARTED ON THE BEAUTIFUL NEW SUE LOCKS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO BUILD FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO FINISHING THAT ONE OFF. AND BY THE WAY, DON'T LET YOUR NEW DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR , [CROWD BOOING] DON'T LET ANY OF OUR PEOPLE THAT FIGHT US ALL THE WAY, NOW THAT WE HAVE IT, TAKE CREDIT FOR IT. YOU ARE TOO SMART FOR THAT. WE ARE ALSO JOINED THIS EVENING BY THE SPEAKER OF THE MICHIGAN HOUSE, LEE CHATFIELD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A PERSON WHO IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, GOP CHAIRWOMAN LAURA PALMER. AND A WOMAN YOU KNOW VERY WELL. SHE HEADED UP MICHIGAN. THEY SAID SHE WAS WASTING HER TIME. TRUMP IS NEVER GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN. BUT I SAID I AM GOING TO BRING BACK YOUR AUTO BUSINESS, REMEMBER? AND I DID. AND I DID. AND WHEN WE WON I SAID WHO IS THAT WOMAN? I WANT TO SEE HER. AND WE PUT HER IN CHARGE OF THE RNC, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. RHONDA MCDANIEL. AND A FRIEND OF MINE, HE IS VERY SHY BUT HE IS VERY RICH. HE SHOULD NOT BE SHY. HE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BUILDERS AND REAL ESTATE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST OWNERS , I SHOULD NOT INTRODUCE HIM BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE IS A BIG OWNER OF PROPERTY, BUT YOU OWN PROPERTY, HE JUST OWNS MORE OF IT THAN YOU DO. AND HE IS A GREAT GUY AND HE HAS BEEN WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING. STANLEY SHAIRA. STANLEY. THOSE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN. YOU KNOW THOSE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS? HEY STANLEY, HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE THIS MONTH? STANLEY IS A GREAT GUY. HE LOVES YOU AND HE HAS BEEN WITH US FROM THE BEGINNING. AND WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH US. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE EMBARKED ON AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC REVIVAL. UNPRECEDENTED. AMERICA IS NOW THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET EARTH. THERE IS NOBODY CLOSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SINCE OUR ELECTION WIN, THE STOCK MARKET IS UP ALMOST 50%. YOU ARE LOOKING LIKE GENIUSES WITH YOUR 401(K)'S, RIGHT? YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND IS SAYING DARLING, YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT INVESTOR. HOW ARE WE DOING? WE ARE UP 67%. OH DARLING, YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT. YOUR WHOLE LIFE YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY HER OR HIM. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY THINK YOU ARE THE SINGLE GREATEST INVESTOR. THANK YOU, DARLING. BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THOSE 401K'S AND ALL THE STOCKS, DO YOU WANT TO SEE THEM DEFLATE? PUT A GOOD SOCIALIST IN THIS POSITION. GO GET YOURSELF A GOOD SOCIALIST. YOU WILL SEE SOME DEFLATION. YOU WILL SEE A NICE DEFLATION OF YOUR STOCKS AND YOUR BONDS AND YOUR 401(K)S. WE HAVE CREATED SINCE MY ELECTION, 5.5 MILLION NEW JOBS. NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. INCLUDING 600,000 , REMEMBER, THIS COULD NOT HAPPENED. YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND. BRAND-NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? IT WAS GOING DOWN. 600,000. AND IT IS GOING TO BE INCREASING BY A LOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES POURING INTO MICHIGAN AND YOUR OTHER GREAT STATES. LOTS. MORE MANUFACTURING JOBS, IN FACT, WERE CREATED IN 2018 THAN ANY YEAR IN MORE THAN 21 YEARS. THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S NOT BAD. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN ONE OF OUR BETTER STATISTICS. THAT IS ACTUALLY LIKE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AFTER YEARS OF STAGNATION, WAGES ARE RISING FAST. YOU REMEMBER I USED TO SAY THAT PEOPLE MADE MORE MONEY 21 YEARS AGO? ALL THE TIME. AND THEY HAD ONE JOB. THIS IS TWO, THREE YEARS AGO, THAN THEY DID WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS NOW. BUT NOW WAGES ARE RISING. YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE OF JOBS. LIKE I GOT CHOICE FOR THE VETERANS, WE ALSO GOT VETERANS. WE HAVE ALSO GOT CHOICE FOR THE PEOPLE WANTING JOBS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WAGES ARE RISING SUBSTANTIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE, YOU ARE DOING GREAT. BUT THEY ARE ALSO RISING MOST QUICKLY FOR THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS. FIRST TIME IN DECADES. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE STATISTICS THAT I LOVE. BLUE-COLLAR JOBS RECENTLY GROUP AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS. WHO WOULD'VE EVER THOUGHT, RIGHT? 30 YEARS. AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN 51 YEARS, AND SOON IT WILL BE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU REMEMBER, I USED TO SAY, WOULD YOU HAVE TO LOSE? WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOSE, RIGHT? AND I GOT CRITICIZED, YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT. AND I SAID, IT IS TRUE, IT IS UNFAIR, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG ALL AMERICANS HAVE ALL REACHED THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE FAKE NEWS, THEY SAID, HE WILL NOT DO WELL WITH WOMEN. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT THEY LIKED ME, TO BE HONEST, THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND. AND THEN THE ELECTION CAME, AND THEY SAID, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE FACT THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO DO WELL WITH WOMEN? BECAUSE WE DID REALLY WELL WITH WOMEN ANNA: RIGHT , WELL WITH WOMEN, RIGHT? REMEMBER WHEN I WAS SITTING BACK, COUPLE OF THEM WERE CRYING? REMEMBER, ONE OF THE TRUE KILLERS, SHE WAS CRYING, NOT FROM HAPPINESS. BUT WE DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. WE DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO BETTER WITH WOMEN NOW, BECAUSE I PRODUCED , BECAUSE WOMEN FILLED MORE THAN 50% OF ALL NEW JOBS CREATED LAST YEAR. [APPLAUSE] THINK OF BACK, 60%. THAT MEANS THE MEN, BETTER GET MOVING, FOLKS. THEY ARE BEING YOU PRETTY GOOD, MEN. 60% OF ALL NEW JOBS, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER. WE CUT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF REGULATIONS IN TWO YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. NOT FOR TWO YEARS, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS HELPING US WITH THE JOBS. AND THE UNITED STATES, PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS, IT ALL HAPPENED VERY RECENTLY, IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE OIL AND GAS PRODUCER IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER ONE. AND BY THE WAY, RUSSIA IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. BUT THEY ARE FINE. THERE ARE DOING JUST FINE. BUT THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. IF HILLARY GOT IN, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT STAT, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. YOU WOULD BE DOING WINDMILLS. HMM, AND IF IT DOESN'T BLOW, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT TELEVISION FOR THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] DARLING, I WANT TO WATCH TELEVISION. I AM SORRY, THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING. [LAUGHTER] I KNOW A LOT ABOUT WIND. I KNOW A LOT ABOUT WIND. WE PASSED MASSIVE TAX CUTS, THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND VERY IMPORTANTLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WITH SMALL FARMS, BUSINESSES, WE GOT RID OF THE DEATH TAX, THE ESTATE TAX. [APPLAUSE] SO NOW, WHEN YOU BEAT YOUR FORM OR SMALL BUSINESS TO YOUR CHILDREN UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU LIKE YOUR CHILDREN, SOME PEOPLE DON'T. SOME PEOPLE SAY, I WOULDN'T LEAVE IT TO THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, I CAN'T STAND MY KIDS. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO, WHICH I ASSUME IS HOPEFULLY A VAST MAJORITY, YOU DON'T HAVE AN ESTATE TAX TO PAY, THEY DON'T. SO THEY CAN TAKE OVER YOUR FARM, THEY CAN TAKE OVER YOUR BUSINESSES, THEY DON'T HAVE TO MORTGAGE IT TO THE HILT, AND THEN THE BANK COMES YEARS LATER AND TAKES IT AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS. NO TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WE ELIMINATED THE OBAMACARE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. [APPLAUSE] THE MOST UNPOPULAR PART OF IT. AND WE WILL HOPEFULLY IN THE COURT, IN TEXAS, YOU HEARD THAT WE WON THE CASE, KNOW IT HAS TO BE APPEALED, AND THEN WE WILL GO TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WE HAVE A CHANCE OF KILLING OBAMACARE. WE ALMOST DID IT BUT SOMEONE SURPRISED US WITH A THUMBS DOWN. BUT WE WILL DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY. BUT WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHERE YOU ARE FORCED TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO BUY BAD HEALTH CARE. NOT TOO GOOD. SO WE WILL GET RID OF OBAMACARE. AND I SAID IF THE OTHER DAY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BECOME THE PARTY OF GREAT HEALTH CARE. IT IS GOOD, IT IS IMPORTANT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE CREATED NEW OPTIONS TO HELP AMERICANS PURCHASE AFFORDABLE HALF LANDS ALL ACROSS STATE LINES, YOU KNOW HOW OPTIONS YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD . THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE ABOUT THAT MAN'S HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 100 MILLION AMERICANS. A LOT OF YOU HAVE PRIVATE PLANS, AND THEY ARE GREAT. THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT AWAY, AND THAT A THING THAT IS GOING TO WORK TOO WELL. REPUBLICANS WANT YOU TO HAVE AFFORDABLE PLANS THAT IS JUST RIGHT FOR YOU, AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN USE YOUR DOCTOR, REMEMBER THAT? THAT WAS A LIE. 28 TIMES HE SAID, THAT WAS A LIE. YOU GET CHEAPER PREMIUMS AND MUCH LOWER TO DR. MOST. THE DEDUCTIBLES ON OBAMACARE , MUCH LORD ADOPTABLE PETS , MUCH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH ON OBAMACARE THAT YOU DON'T GET TO USE IT UNTIL A REAL TRAGEDY HEADS. YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU ARE LIKE, WHO CARES ABOUT THIS ADAPTABLE? LET'S SEE IF I CAN LIVE. WE BELIEVE NO ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE BANKRUPTED WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS, AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OBAMACARE. AND REMEMBER THIS, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. SPEAKING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ALWAYS. ALWAYS. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO BEGUN THE BOLD INITIATIVE TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND IN 2018, DRUG PRICES SAW THEIR FIRST DECLINE IN 46 YEARS. FIRST TIME. [APPLAUSE] AND THEY WILL BE COMING DOWN A LOT. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN 46 YEARS THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAME DOWN, EVEN STANLEY LIKES THAT, BECAUSE HE NEEDS PLENTY AND THEN WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR AMAZING VETERANS. [APPLAUSE] OUR AMAZING VETERANS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET BE A CHOICE WERE OVER 40 YEARS , THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET V.A. CHOICE FOR OVER 40 YEARS. NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING IN LINE FOR ONE DAY, ONE WEEKS, TWO MONTHS, PEOPLE WHO WERE OK BUT NOT FEELING WELL, WAIT SO LONG THAT THEY BECOME TERMINALLY ILL, THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT. NOW, THEY GO OUTSIDE, THEY SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY GET BETTER QUICKLY. [APPLAUSE] AND, FOR 46 YEARS, V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY , YOU CAN FIRE ANYBODY IN THE V.A.. WE HAD SADISTS. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE IN SO MANY WAYS OF OUR GREAT VETERANS. THEY WERE ROUGH. IN PRIME TIME THEY WOULD SAY, I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH YOU. I AM NOT GOING TO PLAY. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUR GREAT HEROES, THAT PROTECTED US, AND YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. THEY STOLE, THEY ROBBED, YOU CAN FIRE THEM. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DID, YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. CALL IT ACCOUNTABILITY. WE PAST SEVEN MONTHS AGO TODAY, V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU HEARD THAT. YOU STOLE FROM US, GUESS WHAT, BILL, YOU ARE FIRED. YOU ARE FIRED, GET OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO GIVE FORMER PRISONERS A SECOND CHANCE, FINALLY SEND GROUNDBREAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM INTO LAW. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT FOR SO MANY YEARS. SO MANY YEARS. VERY UNFAIR. AND BY THE WAY, SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT MOST SUPPORTED IT ARE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. ALL SIDES. VERY BIPARTISAN, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FOR A CHANGE. WE ARE PUSHING AND PURSUING ALL THESE COMMONSENSE POLICIES TO ADVANCE THE COMMON GOOD FOR OUR CITIZENS. DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING A CYNICAL AND INSTRUCTIVE AGENDA OF RADICALISM , SENEGAL AND DISTRACTIVE , CYNICAL AND DESTRUCTIVE AGENDA OF RESISTANCE. WHAT THE HELL? LET'S GET SOMETHING DONE, RIGHT? RESIST. RESIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RESIST. AND THEN YOU LOOK AND THEY HAVE A PHRASE CALLED "RESIST." YOU SAY, WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? WE WANT TO DO LEGISLATION. SO MANY THINGS WE COULD BE DOING TOGETHER. THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW ADVANCING AN EXTREME $100 TRILLION GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER CALLED THE GREEN NEW DEAL. [CROWD BOOING] BECAUSE I LOVE CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE GREEN NEW DEAL. I WANT THEM TO MAKE THAT A BIG PART OF THEIR PLATFORM. NO MORE AIRPLANES, NO MORE COWS. [LAUGHTER] ONE CAR PER FAMILY, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THAT IN MICHIGAN. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, ONE CAR PER FAMILY? [CROWD BOOING] YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK ONE CAR PER FAMILY IN MICHIGAN PLAYS TOO WELL, DO YOU AGREE? [CROWD BOOING] NOT TOO WELL. AND IT HAS TO BE, OF COURSE, AN ELECTRIC CAR IT ONLY GOES, WHAT, 160 MILES. WHAT DO YOU DO? IT IS 160 MILES, DARLIN', WHERE DO I GET A CHARGE? WHERE DO I GET A CHARGE, DARLIN'? NO, WE WANT PEOPLE TO LIVE A GREAT LIFE. WE WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE CARS AND WE WANT ALL THESE COMPANIES TO KEEP COMING TO MICHIGAN AND ALL THE OTHER GREAT STATES, AND BUILDING THOSE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAD A PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO AIRPLANES THEY WERE SAYING, HOW DO YOU GET TO EUROPE ? NOBODY KNEW. HOW DO YOU GET TO AUSTRALIA? NOBODY KNEW. BUT THEY ARE WORKING ON IT. THEN, THEY WERE INTERVIEWING THIS WOMAN FROM HAWAII, THE SENATOR, THE ONE THAT WAS SO VICIOUS ABOUT JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE KAVANAGH. REMEMBER? BY THE WAY, DO WE LOVE JUSTICE GORSUCH, AND DO WE LOVE JUSTICE KAVANAGH? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE WAS SO VICIOUS TO BOTH. AND THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. SHE WAS VICIOUS. SHE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE GREEN NEW DEAL. AND THEY HAD HER. SHE IS FROM HAWAII. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE GREEN NEW DEAL? WELL, I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. BUT SHE NEVER SAW IT. THEN THEY SAID, BUT YOU CAN'T FLY ANYMORE. AND SHE IS IN HAWAII. [LAUGHTER] SHE SAID, BUT HOW WOULD I GET TO MY ISLAND? THEY SAID, WE ARE WORKING ON SOME KIND OF A TRAIN SYSTEM. [LAUGHTER] SO SHE SAID, OK, WELL THEN, I AM FOR IT 100%. IT IS THE CRAZIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY WANT TO RIP DOWN ALL THE BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN AND REBUILD THEM. LET'S DO THAT. HEY, STANLEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT IDEA? I DON'T THINK STANLEY LIKES THAT IDEA. IT IS THE CRAZIEST THING. I GET ATTACKED SO VIOLENTLY , POCAHONTAS. [LAUGHTER] [CROWD BOOING] AND I KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE RACE, I GUESS. AND THEY SAID. , I SAID, THAT IS TOO EARLY, I START ABOUT FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW. WE'VE GOT PLENTY MORE TO KNOCK OUT, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY KEEP COMING, THEY JUST KEEP COMING. BEFORE I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THE U.S. AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY WAS DECIMATED. IT WAS GOING DOWN, AND YOU PEOPLE DO IT BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. WE LOST ONE IN FOUR AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. THINK OF IT, ONE IN FOUR. I THINK THE NUMBERS WERE WORSE THAN THAT, AND SO DO YOU. BUT FROM THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, MY FIRST MEETING WAS A MEETING WITH CAR EXECUTIVES. I SAID, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET YOUR BUSINESS GOING? WE TALKED ABOUT CAFE STANDARDS? WHERE THEY WER CHOKING THEIR ENGINES, COSTING A LOT MORE TO MAKE CARS. WE TOOK HISTORIC AND DRAMATIC ACTION TO SAVE THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY AND TO DEFEND AMERICAN AUTO WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN. [APPLAUSE] AND JUST IN THE LAST VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, WE HAVE ADDED ANOTHER 6000 VEHICLE MANUFACTURING AND AUTO PARTS JOBS IN MICHIGAN ALONE, AND PREVENTED THOUSANDS MORE FROM BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS AND FROM GOING TO MEXICO. THEY CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. SORRY, MEXICO. WE WANT THEM TO GIVE US A LITTLE MORE HELP OF THE BORDER. MEXICO HAS THE TOUGHEST IMMIGRATION LAWS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE WORST, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS PUT IN THINGS THAT ARE SO BAD, SO BAD. CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THEM AND THEN HAVE TO RELEASE THEM. WHO FISH THINK OF IT. VISA LOTTERY. YOU ARE IN THE LOTTERY SYSTEM. FROM THESE COUNTRIES, YOU PICK UP A NAME. OH, ISN'T THAT NICE, BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU THINK THEY ARE GIVING US THEIR BEST PEOPLE? NO, THEY ARE NOT COME THEY ARE GIVING US THEIR WORST PEOPLE, AND SO WOULD YOU, AND SO WOULD I. WE HAVE NOTHING BUT BAD COMING OUT OF THOSE LAWS. BUT YOU KNOW THE GOOD THING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, THE RUSH TO THE BORDER. ANOTHER TWO CARAVANS NOW ARE POURING UP. MEXICO COULD STOP THEM, SO EASY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THEY DON'T, IT WILL COST THEM A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY, HONESTLY. [APPLAUSE] AND IF THEY DON'T, AND I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, WE WILL CLOSE THE DAMN BORDER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING U.S.A.] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT OR NOT, MICHIGAN, BUT MEXICO TOOK ABOUT 30% OF YOUR CAR BUSINESS. NOT WHEN I WAS HERE. WHEN I AM HERE, THEY ARE NOT. IT IS GOING THE OTHER WAY. AND WE CLOSE THE BORDER. THAT MEANS WE ARE NOT TAKING THOSE CARS TO OUR COUNTRY. THAT MEANS YOU WILL MAKE MORE CARS HERE IN THE GOOD OLD USA. THAT IS WHAT THAT MEANS. . VERY SIMPLE. . SO VERY SIMPLE. PEOPLE TRY AND MAKE IT TOO COMPLICATED. ONE OF THE GRAVEST THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY WAS THE JOB KILLING , SOVEREIGNTY-WRECKING TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. THAT IS WHAT ONE OF MY VERY FIRST ACTS IN OFFICE WAS TO WITHDRAW OUR COUNTRY FROM THE HORRIBLE, POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS TRADE DEAL AND STOP THE OFF SHORING OF , THE OFFSHORING OF MICHIGAN JOBS. SAVED A LOT OF JOBS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER. N.A.F.T.A., THAT WAS A BEAUTY. YOUR EMPTY FACTORIES HAVE STILL NOT RECOVERED FROM N.A.F.T.A.. WELL, NAFTA IS GOING TO BE A THING OF THE PAST. SOON. [APPLAUSE] OR WE WILL JUST GO TO PRE N.A.F.T.A.. WE HAD A HUGE SURPLUS OF MEXICO. WE LOST OVER THE LAST 27 YEARS WITH MEXICO, OVER $100 BILLION. BEFORE N.A.F.T.A., WE MADE $40 BILLION TO $50 BILLION. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY GOOD DEAL. NOW IT IS A HARD THING FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO GIVE US A VICTORY. LET US SEE IF THEY WILL RAISE THEIR HANDS. IF WE DON'T GO TO N.A.F.T.A., WE WILL GO TO PRE N.A.F.T.A.. THAT IS OK WITH ME. A SHORT TIME LATER I TRAVEL TO DETROIT TO CANCEL BURDENSOME REGULATIONS THAT HARM THE MOTOR CITY. WE RENEGOTIATED THE U.S.-KOREA TRADE AGREEMENT TO DOUBLE AMERICAN AUTO EXPORTS TO KOREA. WE DOUBLED THEM. THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] AND TO STOP THE CHEAP, FOREIGN PICKUP TRUCKS FROM COMING INTO THE MARKET. BECAUSE WE HAVE A CHICKEN TAX, A TARIFF OF 25%, OUR CHEAPEST MARKET. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COME IN HERE AND TAKE AWAY YOUR BUSINESSES AND TAKE AWAY YOUR JOBS. THEY WERE THRILLED, BUT THAT IS OK. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE LIVE BY TWO SIMPLE RULES, BY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN , BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE RESULTS. SINCE THE ELECTION WE HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 55,000 BRAND-NEW MOTOR VEHICLE AND AUTO PARTS JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY. 55,000. FIAT-CHRYSLER JUST ANNOUNCED A $4.5 BILLION INVESTMENT IN MICHIGAN, INCLUDING THE FIRST NEW AUTO PLANT IN DETROIT IN OVER A GENERATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN OUR COUNTRY, SEARCHING FOR $5 BILLION OVER A VERY SHORT. OF TIME , OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND FORD HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OF JUST OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL $900 MILLION GOING RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE'S COMING IN, BUT GENERAL MOTORS JUST ANNOUNCED A $300 MILLION INVESTMENT AT ITS ASSEMBLY PLANT HERE IN MICHIGAN. RIGHT NOW. BUT I AM ALSO FIGHTING WITH GENERAL MOTORS AND THE U.A.W. TO TAKE ACTION ON PLANTS IN LORDSTOWN, OHIO, GET THE DAMN PLANTS OPEN. EVERYONE ELSE IS COMING IN. GET THEM OPEN NOW. IT IS COMPANIES LIKE CHRYSLER, FORD, TOYOTA, VOLKSWAGEN, ALL INVESTING HEAVILY IN AMERICA AND HEAVILY IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WE THINK GENERAL MOTORS WILL SOON BE DOING THE SAME, I REALLY DO BELIEVE IT. THEY WENT BEFORE MY TIME. THEY WENT TO CHINA, THEY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY BUILDING STUFF. THEY WANT TO MEXICO AND SPEND A LOT OF MONEY BUILDING STUFF. THAT IS NOT HELPING US MUCH. WE THINK THEY WILL COME AROUND. AS WE PROTECT OUR JOBS, WE ARE ALSO PROTECTING AMERICA'S BORDERS. WE ARE TAKING ON THE EXTREMISTS, AND THEY ARE REALLY RADICAL, RADICAL EXTREMIST DEMOCRATS WHO WANT OPEN BORDERS AND CRIME, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. OPEN BORDERS AND CRIME. [CROWD BOOING] LAST MONTH ALONE, MORE THAN 76 THOUSAND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRIVED AT OUR BORDERS TO BE APPREHENDED. WE HAVE TO APPREHEND THEM. THINK OF THAT. 76,000 PEOPLE, MANY OF WHICH ARE ROUGH PEOPLE. I AM BEING NICE. THEY WILL CRITICIZE ME, THEY WILL SAY, HOW DARE HE SAY THAT? BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS, WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. WE APPREHEND THEM, WE CAPTURE THEM. DO YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH THE JOB IS, BORDER PATROL? THAT GUY WOULD LIKE IT. SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT. . THEY LOVE IT. THEY ARE GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT. I.C.E., THESE ARE GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE ON TRACK FOR ONE MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS TRYING TO RUSH OUR BORDERS. IT IS AN INVASION. I SAY INVASION, THEY SAY, ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THINKING. IT IS YOUR COUNTRY, TOO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? 300 AMERICANS A WEEK THAT I FROM MEXICAN-TRAFFICKED HEROINE. 300 OR WEEK. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BY HEROINE, METH, COCAINE, FENTANYL, SMUGGLED ACROSS OUR BORDER. YOU KNOW THAT. . 78,000 PEOPLE DIE, AND THAT IS A NUMBER THAT IS MUCH, MUCH SMALLER THAN THE REAL NUMBER. TWO CONFRONTS THE BORDER CRISIS LAST MONTH I DECLARED , TO CONFRONT THE BORDER CRISIS LAST MONTH I DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS RETALIATED BY PASSING A RECKLESS RESOLUTION TO TERMINATE VITAL BORDER SECURITY OPERATIONS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? AND TWO WEEKS AGO I PROUDLY ISSUED MY FIRST VETO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TWO DAYS AGO, OUR GREAT REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, I WANT GET FANCY WITH YOU, I WILL JUST SAY, THEY ESSENTIALLY GIVE US THE RIGHT TO BUILD A WALL, AND LOTS OF MONEY FOR IT. WE ARE BUILDING A WALL, WE WILL BE FINISHING THE WALL, IT IS MOVING ALONG RAPIDLY. WE ARE GIVING OUT MANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. WE ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING IT IN MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS, AND SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, I WILL BE GOING TO A CERTAIN PLACE, WHICH I WON'T TELL YOU NOW, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE WAITING FOR ME. I WILL BE GOING TO A CERTAIN PLACE AND WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU VAST SECTIONS OF BRAND-NEW, BEAUTIFUL WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE JOBS, SAFETY AND SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS FIRST. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAMPAIGNED, IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH EASIER THE SECOND TIME. REMEMBER THIS. I NEVER DID THIS BEFORE. AND I AM 1-1. WE ARE 1-1. [APPLAUSE] AND IT WAS TOUGH. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I GET UP ON THE STAGE AND I HAVE NEVER DEBATED BEFORE, THAT I NEVER LEFT CENTERSTAGE. NEVER LEFT CENTERSTAGE. MEANING WE WERE WINNING THE WHOLE TIME. I DEBATED AND I SAID, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING FROM? BUT I NEVER SAID TO ANYBODY, I AM GOING TO PRODUCE JOBS, I AM GOING TO BRING BACK YOUR AUTO BUSINESSES, I AM GOING TO DO GREAT FOR THE VETS, FOR TAX CUTS, I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY IN TWO YEARS. AND NEVER SAID. I COULDN'T SAY THAT. THAT I DID SAY THAT I WAS GOING TO DO IT, BUT WHO WAS GOING TO BELIEVE ME? NOW I HAVE DONE MORE THAN I EVER PROMISED I WAS GOING TO DO, SO THE DEBATES SHOULD BE VERY EASY. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUESTION. SO I TOLD YOU BEFORE, THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN GREAT CITIZENS, I SAY THAT NOW, AND IT IS LIKE, I SAY THAT, AND I JUST SAY, YOUR TURN. WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO BEAT THAT? AND WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS FOR EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN. EVERYBODY IS BENEFITING. EVERYBODY IS BENEFITING. [APPLAUSE] SO BEFORE FIRST ELECTION, MY FIRST ELECTION, WHAT THE HELL, I NEVER DID IT BEFORE. I DID A GOOD JOB, THOUGH, DO YOU AGREE? SO DID YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE DID IT TOGETHER. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT. I DIDN'T DO IT, WE DID IT TOGETHER. THINK ABOUT IT. NOW, INSTEAD OF SAYING I AM GOING TO DO THIS, I AM GOING TO PRODUCE 5.5 MILLION NEW JOBS, I GRANT TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING, 600,000 NEW JOBS, NOW I HAVE DONE IT. IT SHOULD BE EASY, DON'T YOU AGREE? DEMOCRATS WANT TO PRETEND THERE IS NO BORDER CRISIS. FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON. BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAUSED THE BORDER CRISIS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE, HONESTLY, BECAUSE THEY WANT VOTES, AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US A THEY PUT THAT AHEAD OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY. THE MASS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACROSS OUR BORDER IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF DEMOCRATS SUPPORTED LOOPHOLES. DEMOCRAT PROMISES OF AMNESTY, AMNESTY. YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING UP, THEY ARE ALL MET BY THE LAWYERS. THEY COME OUT, THEY ARE ALL MET BY THE LAWYERS COME AND THEY SAY , SAY THE FOLLOWING PHRASE, I'M VERY AFRAID FOR MY LIFE. I AM AFRAID FOR MY LIFE. OK. AND THEN I LOOK AT THE GUY, HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST GOT OUT OF THE RING, HE'S THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. IT'S A BIG, FAT CON JOB, FOLKS. IT'S A BIG FAT CON JOB. AND DEMOCRATS SANCTUARY CITIES AND THE REFUSAL TO PROTECT AMERICAN VOTE , AMERICAN BORDERS, IT'S NOT THE MONEY. WHEN I BOUGHT FOR THEM RECENTLY, THEY GAVE ME SO MUCH MONEY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT NOTHING FOR THE WALL. NOW, THINK OF IT. WALLS WORK, FOLKS. WE NEED THE WALL. THEY SAID, WOULD YOU CALL IT SLATS, STEEL BARRIERS? I SAID I WILL CALL IT WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT. JUST GIVE ME THE MONEY. THEN THEY GOT COLD FEET. BUT THEIR OPEN BORDER POLICIES ARE TRULY OF BETRAYAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS DANGEROUS, WHAT IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY, IT IS DANGEROUS. TO DEFEND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, I DEPLOYED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. I GOT THOUSANDS OF TROOPS, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT 4000 TROOPS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, AND THEY ARE FANTASTIC. AND THINK OF IT. FOR YEARS, WE DEFENDED THE BORDERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DEFEND OUR OWN BORDER. THINK OF HOW CRAZY THIS IS. WE ARE DEFENDING BORDERS OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE 6000 MILES AWAY, THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD THE NAME OF THESE COUNTRIES, BUT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, OUR BORDER ALONG MEXICO, WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, AND CHILD TRAFFICKERS, AND ALL OF THIS COMING IN. WE DON'T WANT TO DEFEND OUR BORDER. THINK OF THAT, HOW CRAZY THAT IS. SO NOW WE ARE DEFENDING OUR BORDERS FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE, ICE OFFICES , WE LOVE EYES , , WE LOVE ICE. THEY HAVE MADE 266,000 ARRESTS OF CRIMINAL ALIENS. YOU LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, MAKING CARS. THEY LIKE IT. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY ARE GREAT AT IT. INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF NEARLY 100,000 ASSAULTS, 30,000 SEX CRIMES, 4000 KIDNAPPINGS, AND 4000 MURDERS. WE GOT THEM. THEY GOT THEM. HOW ABOUT IF YOU DON'T GET THEM? HOW ABOUT IF YOU LEAVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE? YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH ICE. THESE VERY TOUGH PEOPLE THAT LOVE OUR COUNTRY AS MUCH AS ANYBODY I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY WANT TO SET VIOLENCE OFFENDERS FREE AND DIRECTLY THEY WILL BE COMING INTO YOUR COMMUNITIES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. WE WANT OUR COUNTRY TO BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. RIGHT? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF ICE AND THE HEROES OF BORDER PATROL. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. EVERY DAY OF MY PRESIDENCY, ICE IS TRACKING DOWN GANG MEMBERS, DRUG DINNERS, AND CRIMINAL ALIENS. AND WE ARE EITHER THROWING THEM BEHIND BARS OR THROWING THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. AND WE ARE THROWING OUT GANGS LIKE MS-13. THESE ARE SOME OF THE SICKEST, MOST DEMENTED, MOST VICIOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WE ARE THROWING THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. IN RECENT MONTHS, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS ALSO BEEN AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, ALLOWING CHILDREN TO BE RIPPED FROM THEIR MOTHERS WOMB RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. AND NOW WE GO A STEP FURTHER, IN VIRGINIA, THE GOVERNOR STATED THAT HE WOULD EVEN ALLOW A NEWBORN BABY, WRAPPED THE BABY UP, MAKE THE BABY COMFORTABLE, TO BE EXECUTED AFTER BIRTH. AND THAT IS WHY IN MY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, I CALLED ON CONGRESS TO IMMEDIATELY PASS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION OF BABIES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN FURTHER OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM. THEY ARE BEING BROUGHT SO FAR LEFT, YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT, FOLKS. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT. YOU WON'T BE HAPPY. RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, CRIME, HOAXES, AND DELUSIONS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE. IT'S THE WAY WE WANT TO LIVE. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER. THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AND WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND EVERY DAY, WE MAKE GOOD ON THE MOTTO, PROMISES MADE, PROMISES CAP. , PROMISES KEPT. LAST WEEK, I DECIDE , I SIGNED AN ORDER TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, WE ARE REBUILDING AMERICA'S MILITARY MIGHT, MAKING IT MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE, BY FAR. I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, COSTLY, ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED. IRAN IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY TODAY THAT IT WAS 2.5 YEARS AGO. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN MC IN JERUSALEM. AND JUST DAYS AGO, I ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. VERY IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA AND WE STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE SOCIALIST ROTELLE OF THE MADURO , SOCIALIST BRUTALITY OF THE MAJURO REGIME. WE STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA AND CUBA AND NICARAGUA AND THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE TO FINALLY BE FREE. WE STAND WITH THEM, DOING A LOT OF WORK. SOCIALISM IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU ARE RIGHT. EACH OF US HERE TONIGHT IS UNITED BY THE SAME TIMELESS VALUES. WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION AND THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY , NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE IN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, TO HONOR OUR HISTORY, TO BE PROUD TO BE HAPPY, TO LOVE, AND ALWAYS TO RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE BELIEVE IN THE WORDS, AND ALWAYS WILL, WE ARE NOT CHANGING IT. THEY WANT US TO CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. IN GOD WE TRUST. THESE ARE TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS, AND PRINCIPLES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS CITIZENS, HAS NEIGHBORS, AS PATRIOTS. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT UNITE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE MAGNIFICENT LAND OF MICHIGAN. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT BROUGHT THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE OF THIS INCREDIBLE STATE TO GRAND RAPIDS FOR THE VERY LAST RALLY OF THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, PROBABLY THE MOST EXCITING AND HOPEFULLY THE MOST FRUITFUL CAMPAIGN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. ON THAT HISTORIC DAY, YOU REJECTED THE FAILED POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT SHIPPED AWAY YOUR JOBS, SOLD OUT YOUR SOVEREIGNTY, AND TITUS DOWN IN ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS , TIED US DOWN IN IN LESS FOREIGN WARS WHICH WE ARE NOW WAITING AND GETTING OUT. YOU STOOD UP TO THE CORRUPT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND YOU STOOD UP TO THE RIGGED WASHINGTON POWER STRUCTURE. YOU STOOD WITH ME, YOU WATCHED THIS RIGGED POWER STRUCTURE, YOU WERE WITH ME. I WON'T FORGET IT, AND YOU WILL BE VERY PROUD LOOKING BACK THAT YOU DID IT. THANK YOU. YOU TOOK THAT YOUR COUNTRY. YOU RECAPTURED YOUR DESTINY. YOU DEFENDED YOUR DIGNITY, AND YOU PROUDLY RECLAIMED YOUR FREEDOM. MAYBE FOR A SECOND TIME. YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO YOUR NATION, AND NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS LOYAL TO YOU, 100%. THE DEMOCRATS TOOK THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN FOR GRANTED, BUT WITH US, YOU WILL NEVER, EVER BE FORGOTTEN AGAIN. YOU WILL NEVER BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED EVER, EVER, EVER. I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU AND YOUR JOBS IN YOUR LIFE AND YOUR COMMUNITY, WITH EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE, AND I WILL NEVER, EVER STOP, AND WE ARE WINNING SO BIG. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT IT COULD HAPPEN. WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO VICTORY. TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR BEAUTIFUL STAND. WE ARE GOING TO STAND FOR JUSTICE, FOR SAFETY, FOR SOVEREIGNTY, AND FOR THE SACRED RIGHTS GIVEN TO US BY THE HAND OF ALMIGHTY GOD. WE ARE ONE UNITED PEOPLE AND ONE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE TOGETHER, WITH THE VERY PROUD AND VERY TRULY INCREDIBLE AND INSPIRING PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. AND WE ARE DOING IT. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, MICHIGAN.

CSPANDT27420193	Donald Trump	2019-04-27	President Trump Holds Rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin	UNBELIEVABLE. THANK YOU, HELLO, GREEN BAY. THANK YOU. IN THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN, HOME OF THE LEGENDARY GREEN BAY PACKERS. THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER BE WITH THAN YOU, THE HARD-WORKING PATRIOTS WHO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RUN SO WELL. IT IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW, BETTER MAYBE THAN IT EVER HAS. THANK YOU. THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION IS FOUND IN THE HEART OF OUR PEOPLE. SO TRUE. TONIGHT, AMERICA'S HEART IS WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE HORRIFIC SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING IN POWAY, CALIFORNIA. OUR ENTIRE NATION MOURNS THE LOSS OF LIFE, PRAYS FOR THE WOUNDED. WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. WE FORCEFULLY CONDEMN THE EVIL OF ANTI-SEMITISM AND HATE, WHICH MUST BE DEFEATED. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE A CERTAIN OFF-DUTY BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO BRAVELY RETURNED FIRE AND HELPED DISRUPT THE ATTACK AND SAVED SO MANY LIVES. BORDER PATROL. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MAYOR STEVE, WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. AND GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM, HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. WE STAND TOGETHER, WE WILL ALL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY. TOGETHER, WE ARE BUILDING A NEW CHAPTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS. ONE FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE ENTITLED TO LIVE IN SAFETY, PROSPERITY, AND PEACE. THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME FOR OUR GREAT COUNTRY. THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME FOR AMERICA. JUST YESTERDAY, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. ACADEMY GREW, SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT UNEXPECTEDLY, NOT ME. IN FACT, IF WE HAD THE OBAMA INTEREST RATES, LOW, ALMOST NOTHING. ACTUALLY, NOTHING. IF WE HAD QUANTITATIVE EASING INSTEAD OF TIGHTENING, WE USE THIS CONSERVATIVE APPROACH, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER THAN THIS. THIS IS VERY HIGH. FAR GREATER. FIRST QUARTERS FOR THE MOST PART IS THE LOWEST QUARTER. WE DID 3.2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER. GDP CRUSHING EXPECTATIONS. ACCELERATING OUR ECONOMIC BOOM. THAT WAS WITH THE SHUTDOWN, A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, BAD WEATHER, EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE. 3.2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER. USUALLY THE LOWEST AND WORST QUARTER. PRIME MINISTER ABE, WE ARE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS. EVERY COUNTRY HAS BEEN RIPPING US OFF FOR YEARS. I LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER. HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE, BUT I SAID MR. PRIME MINISTER, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. FOR SO MANY DECADES, WE HAVE BEEN LOSING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHINA AND JAPAN, INDIA, NAME ANY COUNTRY. WE LOST. WE ARE NOT LOSING ANYMORE. I SAID WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. $68 BILLION IN TRADE LOSSES OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. A YEAR. WE ARE RENEGOTIATING. I THINK HE WILL BE FAIR. AND THEY ARE COMING IN, FRANKLY, TO MICHIGAN. THEY ARE COMING BACK. THEY WANT TO BE BACK. TO OHIO, TO PENNSYLVANIA, TO NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA, AND WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS SPECIAL PLACE? IT'S CALLED WISCONSIN. THEY WILL BE INVESTING VERY SHORTLY , AND THIS STARTED ALREADY , $40 BILLION, AND IT WILL BE A LOT MORE THAN THAT. THE POVERTY RATE FOR WISCONSIN FAMILIES HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN 22 YEARS. SHE'S GONE. WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT I HAD MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THAN SHE DID, THEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT I HAD NONE, BUT I STILL HAD MORE. THAT WAS THE END OF HER 32 YEARS SCAM ON COLLEGES. CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE DOING WHAT I AM DOING? THERE WOULD BE 200 PEOPLE TO SHOW UP, IF THEY WERE PRESIDENT. IF THEY WERE NOT PRESIDENT, NOBODY WOULD SHOW UP. IS THAT RIGHT? I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS SAYING ON THE WAY OVER , TELL ME ABOUT BAD WEATHER. WE MAY HAVE TO CANCEL. ARE YOU CRAZY? CAN YOU IMAGINE? I LEARNED THIS MORNING THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A BIG SNOWSTORM, A BIG, BIG SNOWSTORM. THE PEOPLE THAT GET IT WRONG THE MOST ARE THE WEATHER FORECASTERS AND THE POLITICAL ANALYSTS. THEY SAID THIS IS A BIG, BIG STORM. IT IS GOING TO BE HITTING GREEN BAY. WE MAY HAVE TO CANCEL. I SAID, LIKE HELL WE ARE GOING TO CANCEL. PEOPLE WERE STANDING OUT 24 HOURS AGO, 32 HOURS AGO, OUTSIDE. WHO STOOD OUT THERE FOR 24 HOURS? THANK YOU, WE LOVE YOU. AND YOU ARE REWARDED WITH THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. AMERICA'S FUTURE HAS NEVER BEEN BRIGHTER. YET THE DEMOCRATS, THOSE VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE , IN WASHINGTON HAVE NEVER BEEN ANGRIER THAN THEY ARE TODAY. YOU SEE, SOMEBODY ELSE WITH A VERY LOW LEVEL OF ENERGY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE STANDING HERE INSTEAD OF ME. THEY WOULDN'T BE IN THIS ROOM. I DON'T KNOW, THEY GOT SOME PROBLEMS, I WOULD SAY THAT. BUT IF YOU LOOK TWO WEEKS OUT IN 2016, I WAS GOING TO RALLIES. WE WERE DOING FIVE AND SIX, LIKE THIS, AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE HAD 69,000 PEOPLE SIGN UP. WHAT IS THIS PLACE, LIKE 10 OR 12 OR WHATEVER? WHATEVER IT HOLDS, WE SET THE RECORD. I JUST WAS TOLD BY THE OWNERS , WHERE IS THE OWNER? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S ALWAYS DANGEROUS. HE SAID, YES IT IS, SIR. IT IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS, YOU ASK THAT QUESTION. NO, SIR, I AM DEAD. THEY WILL TAKE THAT ANSWER AND IT WILL BE HEADLINES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU SAVED ME. THIS IS THE RECORD. WE SET RECORDS EVERYWHERE. AND IT IS NOT ME, IT IS A MOVEMENT LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT THE RADICAL, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS PUT ALL THEIR HOPES BEHIND THEIR COLLUSION DELUSION, WHICH HAS NOW BEEN TOTALLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD AS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD. THE GREATEST POLITICAL HOAX IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT REALLY HAS BEEN. THIS WITCHHUNT WAS NEVER REALLY JUST ABOUT ME. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT STOPPING YOU, THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF FREEDOM LOVING CITIZENS WHO ROSE UP ON THAT INCREDIBLE NOVEMBER DAY. REMEMBER THAT DAY? NOVEMBER 8. AND DEMANDED A GOVERNMENT THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST. AND WE ARE DOING THAT WITH CHINA, WITH INDIA, WITH JAPAN, WITH A GREAT NEW TRADE DEAL THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GET APPROVED IN THE HOUSE. I HOPE THEY ARE GOING TO APPROVE IT, BECAUSE IT IS GREAT FOR THE FARMERS. EVERYBODY WANTS IT, EVERYBODY LOVES IT. WE ARE ALL SIGNED UP AND GETTING READY IN 30 DAYS TO PUT OUT THE USMCA. LIKE THE SONG YMCA. USMCA. THAT'S WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. IT IS A GREAT DEAL AND IT IS GOING TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. [CHEERS] PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND YOUR SENATORS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RATIFY IT, HAVE TO APPROVE IT. FRANKLY, WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TODAY, MAYBE THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE US HAVE A LOSS THAN DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, RIGHT? BECAUSE N.A.F.T.A. IS ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER SIGNED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU LOOK AROUND WISCONSIN, BUT YOU STILL SEE THE SCARS. EMPTY BUILDINGS. YOU GOT TO NEW ENGLAND, OHIO, DIFFERENT PLACES, NAFTA WAS A DISASTER. WHAT WE HAD, THE ONE THING I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, I WANT TO MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPANY TO LEAVE WISCONSIN AND LEAVE OTHER STATES AND GO TO MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES, BUT GO TO MEXICO, FIRE ITS WORKERS, OPEN A NEW PLANT IN MEXICO, HIRE OTHER WORKERS, AND SELL THE EQUIPMENT INTO THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T WANT THAT. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT MAKES IT VIRTUALLY NOT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT. I HOPE WE CAN GET CONGRESS TO GET IT APPROVED QUICKLY, BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, AND ESPECIALLY MANUFACTURERS AND FARMERS, AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE FIRING PEOPLE AND MOVING THEIR PLANTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. [CHEERS] RING PEOPLE AND MOVING THEIR PLANTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. [CHEERS] POLITICIAN. BUT REMEMBER THAT SPELL WHEN EVERYONE WAS LEAVING THE COUNTRY, GOING INTO MEXICO AND CANADA, MEXICO AND CANADA? CANADA HAS BEEN TAKING BIG ADVANTAGE OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW THAT. LET'S SING O CANADA. WE LOVE THE SONG. BUT I CAME UP HERE A YEAR AGO, AND I WAS WITH FARMERS, AND THEY WERE SELLING SPECIALTY MILK. 290% TARIFF. THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T SELL IT. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY PUTTING UP A BARRIER. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN THIS NEW DEAL, AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE OPENED UP. THEY DON'T LOVE IT, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. IT IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY, AND IF THEY DIDN'T APPROVE, I WOULD HAVE PUT TARIFFS ON THEIR CARS. I DID NOT WANT TO DO IT, BUT I SAID, IF THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, WE ARE PUTTING TARIFFS ON THE CARS, AND WE WILL MAKE MORE MONEY. THE FARMERS WOULD NOT BE HELPED SO MUCH, BUT YOU WATCH THE COMPANY GROW AND PROSPER AS YOU STARVE. THAT'S NO GOOD. IT'S GOOD FOR CANADA, MEXICO, GOOD FOR US. WE GOT TO GET CONGRESS TO APPROVE IT, SO PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THOSE GENIUSES. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT TRADE DEAL, AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MAKING A DEAL WITH CHINA. BUT WHO KNOWS? I ALWAYS SAY, WHO KNOWS? BECAUSE WHO THE HELL KNOWS? THE DEAL IS EITHER GOING TO BE A GREAT DEAL , IT HAS TO BE. I TOLD PRESIDENT XI, THIS HAS TO BE A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN LOSING TO CHINA FOR MANY YEARS. $500 BILLION A YEAR. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM , THINK ABOUT. THEY CAN SAY IT IS SURPLUS, THEY CAN SAY IT IS DEFICIT, CALL IT WHATEVER YOU , WE WERE LOSING CASH. GIVING THEM 500 , HOW THE HELL CAN YOU DO IT? AS PRIME MINISTER ABE SAID TO ME TODAY, HE SAID, NOBODY HAS EVER TALKED TO ME THIS WAY. [APPLAUSE] NO, HE SAID IT. HE SAID IT FRIENDLY. HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE. BUT HE SAID NOBODY FROM THIS COUNTRY, NO PRESIDENT, HAS EVER SAID THIS. NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT. WE LOSE BILLIONS A YEAR. JAPAN, AS AN EXAMPLE, SELLS US THEIR CARS. THE CARS COME IN, NO TAX. THEY DON'T TAKE OUR CARS. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS A VERY FAIR DEAL. [LAUGHTER] THE CARS COME IN, 2.5%, BUT ESSENTIALLY NO TAX. OUR AGRICULTURE, THEY DON'T WANTED. WE WANT TO SELL THE AGRICULTURE. SO THEY SELL CARS, WE SELL PRACTICALLY NOTHING. THAT'S HOW WE HAVE THESE MASSIVE IMBALANCES WITH SO MANY COUNTRIES. CHINA IS THE BIG ONE, BECAUSE WITH CHINA, IT IS AT LEAST $375 BILLION A YEAR DEFICIT. WHO THE HELL WANTS , WHO MADE THESE DEALS? HONESTLY, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO OBAMA, THIS WAS HIM, BUT THIS WAS BEFORE OBAMA, A LONG TIME BEFORE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME, AND ALL I AM TELLING YOU IS IF WE DON'T MAKE A DEAL, WE ARE GOING TO DO EVEN BETTER. WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. WE ARE THE PIGGY BANK THAT EVERYBODY IS ROBBING. WE ARE THE ONES, THE PIGGY BANK EVERYONE IS STEALING FROM AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. [APPLAUSE] BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRIED TO STOP US, THEY CAN'T, BECAUSE OUR LOVE FOR AMERICA WILL ALWAYS BE STRONGER THAN A CORRUPT THIRST FOR POWER. I TELL YOU WHAT , PEOPLE SAY, OH, HE WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY, HE WANTS TO EXTEND, THEY DON'T BELIEVE I WILL BE LEAVING IN SIX YEARS. HE WANTS TO EXTEND, HE WANTS TO HAVE PRESIDENCY FOR LIFE. THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. I PROMISE AT THE END OF SIX YEARS, I WILL BE VERY HAPPY, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE LEFT WITH THE STRONGEST COUNTRY YOU HAVE EVER HAD, I PROMISE YOU. [CHEERS] YOU ARE RIGHT, USA. WE LOVE USA. THAT'S WHAT THIS FIGHT IS ALL ABOUT. WE ARE TAKING ON THE FAILED POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND RESTORING GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. IT'S THE PEOPLE. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE. YOU WON THE ELECTION. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE SCUM THAT'S LEAVING THE VERY TOP OF GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE THAT OTHERS USED TO SAY, OH, THESE WERE DIRTY COPS, DIRTY PLAYERS. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON. THERE'S 21 OF THEM ALREADY, AND I AM NOT EVEN DOING , THEY ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY GOT CAUGHT LIKE NOBODY EVER GOT CAUGHT. [CHEERS] LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL RED HATS, AND SOME WHITE ONES. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A LOG OF RED HATS. BUT YOU DO HAVE THE WHITE ONES, TOO. AND YOU HAVE THE BLACK ONES, TOO. AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT HATS. WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. YOU WANT TO MAKE IT TONIGHT? WE ARE DOING GREAT, THE COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT, REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, DOING SO MANY THINGS. WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. WE MAY HAVE THE GREATEST CMN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. MAGA COUNTRY. [CHEERS] WENT OUT AND HE SAID, I WAS BEATEN UP BY MAGA COUNTRY. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THAT'S A HATE CRIME, RIGHT? HE SAID HE WAS BEATEN UP BY MAGA COUNTRY. TURNED OUT TO BE A TOTAL LIE, BUT THINK OF IT. MAGA, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT CASE IN CHICAGO IS A DISGRACE TO OUR NATION. [CHEERS] SO WE HAVE A DECISION. I REALLY BELIEVE , AND IT HAS BEEN SAID , MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, THE GREATEST THEME. RONALD REAGAN USED, LET'S MAKE A CHARACTER GREAT , LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT. CLOSE, BUT NOT THE SAME. THE APOSTROPHE IS TOO COMPLICATED. HE USED IT A LITTLE BIT. WE SERIOUSLY USED IT. MAGA. AND MAGA WE GOT FOR FREE, BECAUSE MY WHOLE DEAL WAS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE STARTED GOING #MAGA. BUT WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE AND A DECISION TO MAKE. SO VERY SHORTLY WE ARE GOING TO SAY, YOU SEE WHAT WE DID WITH OUR VETS? WE HAVE CHOICE. WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS. WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH. OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO BE VERY SOON IN GREAT SHAPE. WE TOOK 100% OF THE CALIPHATE IN SYRIA , EVERYONE SAID, OH, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO , [CHEERS] AND BY THE WAY, AND WHEN SOME WHACK JOB THAT PICKS UP SOMETHING OVER THE INTERNET GOES OUT AND BLOWS UP A STORE AND PEOPLE GET KILLED, I UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPENS, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK, THEY ARE DEMENTED. BUT WE NEVERTHELESS IN TERMS OF A WAR, 100%. BUT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THESE CELLS AND THEY ARE GOING TO DO DAMAGE AND IT'S A SHAME AND WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THEM. WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB, BUT WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. THESE ARE SICK, HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS, IF YOU EVEN CALL THEM HUMAN BEINGS. SO WE HAVE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. WHEN YOU SEE , AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE A MASSIVE TELEVISION AUDIENCE , DID YOU EVER SEE SO MANY CAMERAS? IF SOMEBODY ELSE WERE HERE, YOU WOULD HAVE ABOUT , LIKE NONE. LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS USED TO BE BEFORE THEY STARTED HITTING US AND OUR RATINGS STARTED FALLING LIKE A ROCK. [CHEERS] SO WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. SO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT VERY SOON. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO DO. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD HEALTH CARE, BUT ONE MAN DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST US AT THE LAST MOMENT. [BOOS] EVEN THOUGH HE CAMPAIGNED FOR EIGHT YEARS, REPEAL AND REPLACE, BUT THAT'S OK. IF WE WIN, WE ARE COMING UP WITH A GREAT PACKAGE OF HEALTH CARE. WE ARE GOING TO BE THE PARTY OF HEALTH CARE. WE ARE COMING UP WITH A GREAT PACKAGE AFTER THE ELECTION. WE GOT TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE, WIN THE SENATE, WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THAT WAS THE WORST PART OF OBAMACARE. HERE IS OUR DECISION. DO WE USE, FOR THE NEW CAMPAIGN, WHICH WILL BE STARTING SOON , WE HAVE THE GREAT SARAH HUCKABEE OVER HERE. [CHEERS] THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. OBVIOUSLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WARMER HERE IN WISCONSIN, BUT IT IS PRETTY HOT IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT. THANKS FOR ALL THE AMAZING THINGS YOU HAVE DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. LAST NEAR , LAST YEAR ON THIS NIGHT I WAS AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EVENT. NOT QUITE THE BEST WELCOME. SO THIS IS AN AMAZING HONOR. I AM SO PROUD TO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT. THEY SAID HE COULDN'T WIN IN 2016, AND HE DID. THEY SAID HE COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER, AND IT IS BOOMING. THEY SAID HE COULDN'T REBUILD THE MILITARY, AND HE HAS DONE IT. THEY SAID THERE WAS COLLUSION, AND THERE WASN'T. THEY HAVE QUESTIONED HIM AT EVERY STEP AND HE HAS PROVEN THEM WRONG EVERY TIME BECAUSE OF YOU. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR LEADING OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS] SHE DOESN'T GET IT. SHE DOESN'T GET IT. SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ME, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. SHE IS BECOMING TOO POPULAR. I'M JEALOUS. SARAH, YOU'RE FIRED! SHE WAS WONDERING, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? SHE HAS BEEN GREAT, DANSKE BANK OUT AND MIKE AND THE WHOLE GROUP AND MADELINE, EVERYBODY. WHAT A GROUP. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND THEY REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF PHONY STUFF, THE WITCHHUNTS. THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. SO WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE JOINT TONIGHT BY MANY INCREDIBLE WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN LEADERS, A REALLY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, A MAN WHO IS REALLY THE FOCUS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN SO MUCH OF WASHINGTON. VERY TOUGH GUY, VERY STRONG GUIDE. I CALLED HIM WISCONSIN TOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU APPRECIATE IT, BUT I AM TELLING YOU HE IS REALLY GOOD. ROB JOHNSON. [CHEERS] THANK YOU, RON. GREAT JOB. HE IS DOING A BIG JOB NOW, WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT. AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , BRIAN STYLE. BRIAN, THANK YOU, BRIAN. GLENN GROTHMAN. [APPLAUSE] THIS GUY. EVERY TIME I INTRODUCE HIM , I LOVE CHAMPIONS. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS IN SPORTS, I JUST LIKE CHAMPIONS. HE IS YOUR TREE CLIMBING CHAMPION. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING , FOR FIVE YEARS. AND THAT IS NOT EASY. HE WOULD GO UP, HE WOULD COME DOWN. HE SAID THE HARD PART WAS COMING DOWN BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET KILLED IF YOU MISSED. FOR FIVE YEARS, HE WAS THE WORLD CHAMPION. HE IS WITH US TONIGHT, AND HE IS OUR CHAMPION. HE FIGHTS SO HARD. HE IS WORKING ON A RECIPROCAL TRADE BILL, SO IF SOMEBODY CHARGES US A TARIFF OF 100% OR 50% OR 25%, WE SAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RECIPROCAL TAX OF 25% OR 50% OR 100%. [APPLAUSE] WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH THAT? HE IS LEADING THE CHARGE AND HAS TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM, BUT HE IS A GREAT GUY , AND HE IS A GREAT CHAMPION , AND HIS WIFE, BY THE WAY, IS BETTER THAN HIM , SEAN DUFF. [CHEERS] THANKS, MIKE. AND THANKS ALSO TO WISCONSIN HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER, JIM STEINKE. THANKS, JIM. OH, WISCONSIN. SENATE PRESIDENT ROGER ROSS, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SCOTT FITZGERALD, THANK YOU. [CHEERS] THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR US. WE HAVE OTHER LEADERS IN THE ROOM, BUT WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. AFTER JUST THE FIRST TWO YEARS TIME, AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN, AND AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD. NO MORE GAMES. ALL OVER THE WORLD. [CHEERS] SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 6 MILLION NEW JOBS. NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT. IF I SAID THAT WHEN I CAME HERE OFTEN , I CAME HERE OFTEN. FOR MEMBER I CAME AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT WERE WITH ME. THEY BOOED THE HELL OUT OF THOSE PEOPLE. BUT THEY LIKED ME, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. IF I WOULD HAVE SAID, 6 MILLION JOBS WE ARE GOING TO CREATE BY THIS TIME , TWO AND A HALF YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW TIME FLIES? I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT, I REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT STANDING IN MY BEDROOM , I SHOULD SAY OUR BEDROOM , WITH OUR GREAT FIRST LADY. I SAID, CAN YOU BELIEVE , FIRST NIGHT. I SAID, HERE WE ARE, HERE WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. FOUR YEARS SOUNDED SO LONG AWAY. NOW FOUR YEARS IS COMING UP. WE ARE TO END A HALF YEARS, AND NO ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE AS MUCH AS WE HAVE, EVER. [CHEERS] THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, YESTERDAY WAS OUR FIRST LADY'S BIRTHDAY. AND PEOPLE LOVE HER. WE ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGE, VERY CLOSE. [LAUGHTER] IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WE WOULD BE CREATING 6 MILLION JOBS, PEOPLE WOULD'VE LAUGHED. 600,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS. REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE GONE. YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND. WE FOUND IT. THEY ARE COMING AND THEY ARE COMING FAST. 2[APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT IS NICE? I HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS HERE, THEY ARE PRETTY WILLFUL , WEALTHY PEOPLE. TO HELL WITH THEM. I CARE ABOUT EVERYBODY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? I LOVE THE FACT THAT WAGES ARE RISING FASTER FOR THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THEY SAY IT HASN'T TRICKLED DOWN, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ARE THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS. THERE IS SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT THAT. PEOPLE ARE NOW ABLE TO GO OUT. WE HAVE VETERANS CHOICE. WE HAVE EMPLOYMENT CHOICE. YOU HAD TO STAY IN A JOB THAT YOU HATED OR YOU COULDN'T GET A JOB. NOW YOU HAVE SEVEN ALTERNATIVES. YOU GET A JOB THAT YOU LOVE AND YOU GET MUCH HIGHER SALARIES. IT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT. [APPLAUSE] YOU HEARD ME SAY THIS 100 TIMES. I'LL KEEP SAYING IT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THIS. IF I MAKE ANY MISTAKES, IF I'M OFF BY JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT, THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE WILL BE HEADLINES. HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. FAKE NEWS. THEY ARE FAKE. THEY ARE FAKERS. [BOOING] WE HAVE CUT 30,000 PAGES OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL REGISTER, THAT'S AN ALL-TIME RECORD. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE PASSED THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY. SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE OF YOU, TO KEEP FAMILY FARMS, RANCHES AND SMALL BUSINESSES TOGETHER IN THE FAMILY. WHEN YOU PASS ON AND GO TO HEAVEN SO YOU CAN LOOK DOWN AT THESE GREAT CHILDREN, IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR CHILDREN DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS AND YOUR FAMILY, AND YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE FARM , YOU REMEMBER WHAT USED TO HAPPEN. THE ESTATE TAX WAS 55%. THEY HAD TO GO OUT AND BORROW MONEY. SOMETIMES, THE LAND IS WORTH MORE THAN THE INCOME AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT. THE BANKS FIGHT THEM. THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING, THE KIDS. THEY LOSE THE FARM. THEY LOSE THE SMALL BUSINESS. WE HAVE ELIMINATED THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX OR DEATH TAX ON ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] ZERO. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. AFTER DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE DEALS THAT STRIP AWAY OUR WEALTH, LITERALLY STRIPPED AWAY THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH AND OUR JOBS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. TOOK AWAY OUR DIGNITY. WHEN GREAT COMPANIES WOULD LEAVE THE UNITED STATES FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY BECAUSE OF STUPID TAXES, BECAUSE OF STUPID REGULATIONS, BECAUSE FRANKLY IN SOME CASES, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY. THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES. NOW THE CHOICES ARE GOING TO BE OTHER STATES. THEY ARE GOING TO BECOME PETITION. YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW AMERICA FOUGHT BACK. ALL OF THESE COMPANIES ARE COMING BACK INTO OUR NATION AGAIN. THEY WANT TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS. [APPLAUSE] THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER. THAT'S WHAT WE DID. YOU REMEMBER? WHEN I WAS A CIVILIAN, WHEN I HAD NO IDEA I WOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I HAD NO IDEA. I USED TO SAY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? IN MICHIGAN, THEY GAVE ME AN AWARD SEVEN YEARS AGO. IT WAS THE MAN OF THE YEAR IN MICHIGAN. DO YOU PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING? YOU ARE USING ALL , LOSING ALL OF YOUR CAR COMPANIES. THEY ARE LEAVING TO GO TO CHINA. DO YOU KNOW? THIS WAS BEFORE I WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE. I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR 20 YEARS. NOW WE'VE STOPPED IT. THOSE COMPANIES ARE ALL COMING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THE WISCONSIN TEMPERING INDUSTRY WAS THREATENED, MY ADMINISTRATION TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION. WE IMPOSED TARIFFS ON DUMPED FOREIGN GOODS. WE SUBSIDIZED PRODUCTS. WE SAVED COUNTLESS TEMPER JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT, JOHN. BIG DIFFERENCE, RIGHT? YOU WERE LOSING A LOT OF JOBS. THEY WERE TAKING THE TIMBER FROM OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES. NOPE, NOT ANYMORE. BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING WAS THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS TRANCE PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. , TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU THINK NAFTA IS BAD? THIS WOULD'VE MADE NAFTA LOOK LIKE A GOOD DEAL. THE TPP WOULD'VE DECIMATED U.S. MANUFACTURING AND GUTTED AMERICA'S AUTO INDUSTRY. IT WOULD'VE GOT IT , GUTTED THE INDUSTRY. THEY WERE DYING TO DO THIS CRAZY DEAL. I ALSO ENDED THE PARIS ACCORD. HOW WAS PARIS DOING LATELY? HOW IS PARIS? SENT ALL THE MONEY TO COUNTRIES THAT PEOPLE HAD NEVER HEARD OF AND RAISE THEIR TAXES. I ENDED THAT ONE. I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A LOT OF HEAT ON THAT ONE. [APPLAUSE] SAVED A LOT OF MONEY AND JOBS. SAVED A LOT OF BUSINESSES. WHEN I AND THIS ACCORD, I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE HEAT. MY PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD IT. IT WAS A RIPOFF. IT DIDN'T ALLOW US TO USE OUR WEALTH. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IT. WE HAVE SOMETHING WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IT HERE TO THE RULES. THEY WERE SO STRICT ON US. CHINA CAN SIGN RULES. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUED BY GREENPEACE. IF GREENPEACE GOES TO CHINA, THAT'S THE END OF GREENPEACE. YOU NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] CHINA DOESN'T CARE IF THEY VIOLATE GREENPEACE. SOME OF THESE OTHER WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. THE UNITED STATES GET SUED. WE ADHERE TO THESE THINGS. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. WE WOULD'VE LOST OUR ASS ON THAT DEAL. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A TERRIBLE DEAL. THAT'S WHY I WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE HEAT. THERE WAS NO HEAT. I'M STILL WAITING. I GUESS AT SOME POINT THEY WILL BRING IT UP. BERNIE SANDERS WILL SAY, WHAT. TAKE A LOOK AT PARIS ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON. HOW ARE THEY DOING OVER HERE? THE YELLOW VESTS, HOW ARE THEY DOING? I DON'T THINK SO. THEY ARE GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE. IN ONE OF MY FIRST ACTS OF PRESIDENTS, I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DISASTER KNOWN AS TPP. [APPLAUSE] TPP, WHAT A MESS. THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DEALS THAT WAS SET UP FOR THE STRICT PURPOSE OF TAKING WEALTH OUT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES. IT WAS A ONE-SIDED WERE SHOW. AMERICA WILL NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ANY LONGER. [APPLAUSE] FOR YEARS, WE GAVE OUR NATIONS FREE AND UNFETTERED ACCESS TO OUR ECONOMY. THEY CONSTRUCTED MASSIVE BARRIERS TO AMERICAN EXPORTS. YOU COME IN, TAKE US, IT'S WONDERFUL. WE DON'T DO THAT, WE DON'T ACCEPT YOUR PRODUCT. AS ONE EXAMPLE, WE CHARGE OTHER COUNTRIES ZERO TARIFFS ON FOREIGN PAPER PRODUCTS. WHEN WISCONSIN PAPER COMPANIES EXPORTED ABROAD, THEY SENT THEIR PRODUCT ABROAD, CHINA CHARGED US BIG TARIFFS. INDIA CHARGED US BIG TARIFFS. VIETNAM CHARGED US MASSIVE TARIFFS. UNFAIR. [BOOING] LOOK AT HARLEY DAVIDSON. I MET WITH THEM THREE YEARS AGO. ONE OF MY FIRST MEETINGS. THE PEOPLE WERE VERY NICE. THEY WERE TELLING ME, TOUGH TO DO BUSINESS. HOW ARE YOU DOING IN INDIA? THEY DON'T DO ANY BUSINESS THERE. THEY WEREN'T EVEN COMPLAINING. INDIA CHARGED 100 , 100% TARIFF. WHEN THEY SEND THEIR MOTORCYCLES AND MAKE THEM TO US, WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING. I CALLED UP THE PRIME MINISTER AND SAID, UNFAIR. HE CUT IT 50%. I SAID THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT'S 50% TO NOTHING. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS CHANGING ALL OF THAT STUFF. CHANGING ALL OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] RAPIDLY. THAT GOES FOR MILITARY PROTECTION ALSO. WE ARE GETTING RIPPED. WE ARE DEFENDING THE WORLD. WE ARE DEFENDING WEALTHY COUNTRIES. THEY CAN WELL AFFORD TO PAY US. THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING THIS FREE MILITARY , OR AT LEAST MASSIVE PARTIAL SUBSIDIES FOR SO MANY YEARS. IT'S A MOST LIKE HABIT. IT'S MORE HABIT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THERE'S ONE COUNTRY, WE LOSE $5 BILLION , I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT. I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY. THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS EMBARRASS SOMEBODY. WE SPENT $5 BILLION IN DEFENDING THEM. I SAID TO THE GENERALS, HOW MUCH DO WE SPEND? THEY SAY, $5 MILLION. VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY. I SAID, HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY? SIR, $500 MILLION. THEY ARE RICH. I CALLED THE COUNTRY. RIGHT? I CALLED THE COUNTRY. WE LOSE $4.5 MILLION FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DEPENDING , DEFENDING A COUNTRY THAT IS VERY TOUGH ON US. I CALLED AND SAID LISTEN, NO GOOD. [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE IN A STATE OF SHOCK. THEY NEVER GOT A CALL LIKE THIS IN 25 YEARS. I SAID, IT'S NO GOOD. WE ARE LOSING $4.5 BILLION. WE CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. HE GOT VERY UPSET, ANGRY. THIS IS NOT FAIR. I SAID, OF COURSE IT IS FAIR. HE SAID, WELL, WE WILL GIVE YOU 500 MILLION MORE. BECAUSE THE BUDGET, YOU SEE, HAD ALREADY BEEN SET. I SAID, I WANT MORE. WE ARGUED. THEY PAID US MORE THAN $500 MILLION FOR ONE PHONE CALL. I'M NOT BRAGGING. [APPLAUSE] ONE CALL. RON KNOWS. ONE CALL. FIRST CALL THEY HAVE HAD IN 35 YEARS. ONE-SIDED, HORRIBLE DEAL. I SAID, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BUDGETS. NEXT YEAR, WHICH NOW TURNS OUT TO BE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, I SAID WE WILL CALL YOU FOR MUCH MORE. YOU HAVE TO PAY. NOT FAIR. WE ARE DEFENDING YOU AND YOU ARE RICH. WE CAN DEFEND PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT RICH. THEY ARE BEING HORRIBLY TREATED, HUMAN RIGHTS AND ALL THIS. THAT'S DIFFERENT. THESE ARE RICH COUNTRIES. ONE PHONE CALL, WE PICK UP $500 MILLION. THAT'S NOT TERRIBLE. WE WILL PICK UP A LOT MORE. SAUDI ARABIA, VERY RICH COUNTRY. WE DEFEND THEM, WE SUBSIDIZE SAUDI ARABIA. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT CASH. WE SUBSIDIZE. THEY BUY A LOT FROM US. $450 BILLION THEY BOUGHT. YOU HAD PEOPLE WANTING TO CUT OFF SAUDI ARABIA. THEY BOUGHT $450 BILLION. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM. THE MILITARY, WE SUBSIDIZE SAUDI ARABIA. I CALLED THE KING. I LIKE THE KING. I SAID, KING, WE ARE LOSING OUR ASS DEFENDING YOU AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S TRUE. HE SAID, WHY WOULD YOU BE CALLING ME? NOBODY HAS EVER MADE SUCH A CALL BEFORE. I SAID, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID. WE ARE WORKING A DEAL WITH SAUDI ARABIA. SO MANY THINGS. HONESTLY, IT'S EASIER THAN COLLECTING $113.57 FROM A TENANT IN A BAD LOCATION IN A , IN NEW YORK CITY. IT SAFER, TOO. IT'S EASIER. IT'S TRUE. ENOUGH OF THAT. BUT IT'S TRUE. WE ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF. I'M ALL FOR NATO. WE ARE PAYING FOR ALMOST 100% OF DEFENDING EUROPE. THEY ARE KILLING US ON TRADE. THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE EU IS KILLING US. WE LOST $181 BILLION AND WE ARE DEFENDING THEM FOR PEANUTS. DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO YOU? THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT UNDER THE USMCA, AMERICAN DAIRY EXPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO SURGE TO CANADA BY MORE THAN 50%. WE HAVE TO GET THE DEAL DONE. RON, YOU HAVE TO GET THAT DEAL DONE. [APPLAUSE] GOT A GET IT DONE. IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE, I TRAVELED TO THIS VERY STATE TO SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING THAT WE WILL LIVE BY TWO SIMPLE RULES. BY AMERICAN, HIRE AMERICAN. RIGHT HERE IN WISCONSIN. [APPLAUSE] WELL WE ARE AND LEASING AMERICAN ECONOMIC RENEWAL, THE NEW AGENDA OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, RADICAL, LEFT. THEY SHOULD CHANGE THAT TO: THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRAT PARTY. IT WILL DRIVE OUR NATION INTO ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL RUIN. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY, TOO. [BOOING] NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE DEMOCRATS 'CRAZY IMMIGRATION AGENDA. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. WE WILL HAVE OVER 400 MILES OF WALL BUILT BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK. , NEXT YEAR. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN GET MONEY FOR EVERYTHING. THEY WERE WILLING TO GIVE ME MONEY FOR EVERY SINGLE THING. I SAID, I DON'T NEED THAT MUCH MONEY. GIVE ME MONEY FOR THE WALL. WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU ANYTHING FOR THE WALL. POLITICALLY, THEY DON'T LIKE IT. I WENT OUT AND DID IT A DIFFERENT WAY. WE HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE WALL AND WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. [APPLAUSE] THEIR ENTIRE PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY FAR LEFT RADICALS WHO WANT TO NULLIFY AND A RACE AMERICAN BORDERS. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT , THEY THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE VOTES FOR THEM. THESE LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS DON'T BELIEVE AMERICA HAS THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS OR DECIDE WHO GETS TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN OUR COUNTRY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY. THINK OF BORDER PATROL. WE APPREHEND 100,000 PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT IS? DEMOCRATS WANT TO ALLOW TOTALLY UNLIMITED, UNCONTROLLED, UNCHECKED MIGRATION, ALL PAID FOR BY YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. [BOOING] AND PEOPLE CAN COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, WE NEED PEOPLE TO COME IN. WE HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES COMING. THEY NEED WORKERS. BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MERIT. [APPLAUSE] LAST MONTH ALONE, 100,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRIVED AT OUR BORDERS, PLACING A MASSIVE STRAIN ON COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND PUBLIC RESOURCES. LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE SENDING MANY OF THEM THROUGH SANCTUARY CITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] WHAT DID THEY SAY? WE WANT THEM. I SAID, WE WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU. THEY SAID, WE DON'T WANT THEM. YET WHILE LIZ BURRELL'S PREACH OPEN BORDERS, THEY LIVE BEHIND GATES AND GUARDS. THEY SEND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE BEST DOCTORS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. WHILE PUSHING IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT DRAIN THE PUBLIC SERVICES. EVERYDAY CITIZENS DEPEND ON YOU. THEY DEPEND ON YOU, I DEPEND ON YOU. WE CAN CHANGE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. I USED TO SAY IN 45 MINUTES, IT'S REALLY 15 MINUTES. IT'S SO SIMPLE. WE NEED DEMOCRATS TO VOTE ON IT. OTHERWISE WE CAN'T ENGAGE THEM. THEY DON'T WANT TO. THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US A VICTORY. WE WILL TAKE IT ANYWAY. WE WILL TAKE THE VICTORY ANYWAY. THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US THE VICTORY ON THAT ISSUE. NUMBER TWO, THEY DON'T MIND OPEN BORDERS. "ARE BRING TREMENDOUS CRIME. THEY DON'T MIND CRIME. THE BORDER CRISIS IS ALSO DRIVING AND VERY STRONGLY THE DRUG CRISIS, THE BIGGEST CRISIS WE HAVE YOU , HAVE. IT'S TRAFFICKERS. CARTELS TRAFFIC HUGE AMOUNTS OF HEROIN, METH, COCAINE AND FENTANYL. DRUGS THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 90, MAYBE EVEN 100,000 PEOPLE PER YEAR. THEY RUIN THE LIVES AND FAMILIES OF SO MANY MORE. TO CONFRONT THE BORDER CRISIS, I DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. THE GOOD NEWS IS, EVERYBODY AGREES. [APPLAUSE] NOW EVERYBODY'S WITH ME. THEY LOOK AT THOSE CARAVANS, WE JUST HAD A CARE OF OUR , CARAVAN OF 20,000 PEOPLE. I TOLD MEXICO, IF YOU LET THOSE PEOPLE COME THROUGH YOUR COUNTRY, WE WILL CLOSE THE BORDER. WE WILL CLOSE IT. I DON'T CARE. [APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM BACK. THEY HAVE TO BRING THE BACK. HUMANELY. THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION IS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF DEMOCRAT BACKED POLICIES THAT PREVENT BORDER VIOLATORS FROM BEING PROMPTLY RETURNED HOME. THEY ARE LATE , ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY. CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THEM. YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM. [BOOING] IT IS CRAZY. CONGRESS HAS TO FIX THESE HORRIBLE IMMIGRATION LAWS. WE HAVE TO END HUMAN SMUGGLING. STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SHUTDOWN SANCTUARY CITIES. DEPORT CRIMINAL ALIENS. REPLACE VISA LOTTERY AND CHANGE MIGRATION WITH IMMIGRATION SYSTEMS BASED ON SKILL AND TALENT AND MERIT. [APPLAUSE] HE'LL DO IT. HE'LL DO IT. ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN FURTHER OUTSIDE THE AMERICAN MAINSTREAM. IT'S CRAZY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM. DO I LOOK FORWARD TO RUNNING AGAINST THEM. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO RIP DOWN EVERY SINGLE BUILDING IN MANHATTAN AND BUILDING NEW BUILDING IN ITS PLACE. THEY HAVE INTRODUCED A TOTAL FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF U.S. HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD ABOLISH THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE OF 180 MILLION AMERICANS, MANY OF YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. [BOOING] THEY ARE AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, ALLOWING CHILDREN TO BE RIPPED FROM THEIR MOTHERS WHEN WRITING TILL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. [BOOING] GREAT GOVERNOR. HE DID A GREAT JOB. HE'S GOT A BIG FUTURE. YOUR DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR HERE IN WISCONSIN SHOCKINGLY STATED THAT HE WILL VETO LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS WISCONSIN BABIES, BORN ALIVE. [BOOING] THE BABY IS BORN, THE MOTHER MEETS WITH THE DOCTOR. THEY TAKE CARE OF THE BABY. THEY WRAP THE BABY BEAUTIFULLY. THEN THE DOCTOR AND MOTHER DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL EXECUTE THE BABY. I DON'T THINK SO. [BOOING] INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. UNTIL THIS CRAZY MAN IN VIRGINIA SAID IT, NOBODY EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT. DID ANYBODY EVEN THINK OF THAT? LATE-TERM. THIS IS WHERE THE BABY IS ACTUALLY BORN AND CAME OUT IT, IT'S THERE. THAT'S IT. [BOOING] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, HOAXES, AND DELUSIONS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY FOR ALL AMERICANS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT REALLY IS. COMMON SENSE. [APPLAUSE] THE PARTY OF COMMON SENSE. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] LAST MONTH, I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH CHARLIE , WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE'S CHARLIE? WHERE IS HE? HE'S LIKE 14 YEARS OLD. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. [LAUGHTER] YOU BE AMAZED. I WAS WATCHING THE OTHER NIGHT THE NFL DRAFT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT WAS THE SECOND DRAFT CHOICE. HE GETS OUT, HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT LAYER FROM OHIO STATE. HE'S A MAGGOT FAN. HE LOVES TRUMP. [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I THINK WE HAVE MORE THAN THEY DO. WHO KNOWS. I THINK WE HAVE MORE THAN THEY DO. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CAREER. LAST MONTH, I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. [APPLAUSE] IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN A LOT MORE. IT'S A BIG DEAL. NOT BY MUCH BUT IT'S ALWAYS GONE UP A LOT. 18%, 6%, 9%. IT WENT DOWN AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING DOWN. ALL OF THESE VERY COMPLEX THINGS WE ARE DOING ARE STARTING TO KICK IN. MAYBE ON THAT ONE, WE WILL WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WANT TO GET IT DOWN. WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, LOOK, IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM. IF I TOLD YOU HOW CRAZY IT IS, IT'S A WEB. YOU NEED 193 IQ TO UNDERSTAND. THIS WEB OF GENIUSES PUT THIS THING TO LOWER DRUG PRICES, 19 EFFECTS HERE. WE GOT IT DOWN. WE ARE GETTING IT DOWN. WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE. IT'S AWESOME. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET DEMOCRAT SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE VASTLY EXPANDING AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES TO OBAMACARE. WE REPEALED OBAMA CARES UNFAIR AND UNPOPULAR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHERE YOU HAD TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT WAS VERY BAD. [APPLAUSE] THE REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO PROTECT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE ARE UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY AND GETTING WASHINGTON BUREAUCRATS OFF THE BACKS OF EVERYONE WHO ENJOYS OUR GREAT OUTDOORS. [APPLAUSE] WE'VE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING , I THINK YOU WILL LIKE THIS. THOSE GREAT CONGRESSMAN YOU HAVE IN THIS ROOM ARE WORKING HARD. $300 MILLION FOR THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE. [APPLAUSE] I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT EARLIER THIS MONTH, INTERLAKE STEAMSHIP COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD THE FIRST GREAT LAKES FREIGHTER IN 35 YEARS, JUST NORTH OF YOUR. STURGEON BAY. [APPLAUSE] 35 YEARS AND THAT JUST MEANS MORE JOBS, MORE JOBS, MORE JOBS. TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, WE ARE REBUILDING AMERICA'S MIGHTY MITE. WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY LIKE NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BOLDLY DEFENDING AMERICAN INTEREST. YESTERDAY, I ANNOUNCE THAT MY ADMINISTRATION IS EINSTEIN IN , ON SIGNING THE U.S. ARMS TREATY. WE ARE UN-SIGNING IT. WE ARE PULLING IT OUT OF CONGRESS. ALL OF YOU SECOND AMENDMENT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY WITH IT. WE WILL NEVER ALLOW FOREIGN BUREAUCRATS TO TRAMPLE ON AMERICA'S FREEDOM. WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT. [APPLAUSE] WHAT AN IMPACT THAT HAS HAD. WHEN I FIRST BECAME PRESIDENT, I MET WITH OUR GREAT MILITARY PEOPLE. WE WENT OVER PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WAS THE RENEWAL, IRAN WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. 14 DIFFERENT CONFLICT ZONES. YEMEN, SYRIA, ALL OVER. WHAT YOU DO WITH THESE PEOPLE? I WITHDREW FROM THAT HORRIBLE DEAL. THEY PAID $150 BILLION TO IRAN. 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. PROBABLY FOR HOSTAGES. I GOT 22 HOSTAGES OUT. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? I PUT IT OUT. WHY NOT? YOU KNOW. IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BRAG ABOUT IT, NO ONE ELSE'S. YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT. OUR AMBASSADOR , THE PRESSED PICKED IT UP. THEY WERE SAYING, IT'S NOT TRUE. HE CALLED THEM AND SAID, IT'S TRUE. INSTEAD OF SAYING, IT'S TRUE. THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT IT. FAKE NEWS. [BOOING] IT WOULD'VE OPENED IN 25 YEARS BUT I SAID TO OUR GREAT AMBASSADOR, ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LAWYERS IN NEW YORK, HE BECAME AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL. I SAID, THEY WANT TO SPEND $1.1 BILLION. WE CAN DO IT CHEAPER. THEY WANT TO BUY THIS PIECE OF LAND IN JERUSALEM. TOP DOLLAR. I SAID, WHAT CAN WE DO? HE CALLED ME BACK AND SAID, WE HAVE A PIECE OF LAND THAT IS MUCH BETTER. WE HAVE AN OLD BUILDING. WE ARE NOT USING THE BUILDING VERY MUCH. WE CAN RENOVATE THE BUILDING FOR $400,000. WE WILL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL EMBASSY IN A BETTER LOCATION. WE CAN HAVE IT DONE IN FOUR MONTHS. INSTEAD OF 25 YEARS. HERE'S YOUR ALTERNATIVE. A BUILDING IN A GREAT LOCATION, IN FOUR MONTHS, FOR $400,000. ALL OVER A BUILDING THAT WILL PRETTY MUCH NEVER GET BUILT. LET'S SAY 20 YEARS. 1.1 BILLION TODAY, MEANING $4 BILLION. A LOUSY LOCATION. IT WON'T BE AS GOOD AS WHAT WE BUILD. IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER EVER DONE THIS. I SAID, DAVID, IT'S TOO CHEAP. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE. IT'S TRUE. MAKE IT 500,000. IT'S TRUE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S OPEN. WE OPENED IT ALMOST A YEAR AGO. YOU KNOW, IN ORDER, I HAVE A VERY DIVERSE GUY WHO IS PROUD OF HIS OFFICE. HE USED TO THINK IT WAS STOLEN FROM JERUSALEM. HE CONSIDERS IT A TREASURE. EVERY TIME I GO IN HE SAYS, LOOK AT MY BEAUTIFUL STONE FROM JERUSALEM. WE ARE BUILDING A BUILDING IN JERUSALEM. I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR. BY JERUSALEM STONE. YOU ARE RIGHT THERE. WE GOT IT SO CHEAP, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE WHOLE BUILDING IS MADE PRACTICALLY OF JERUSALEM STONE. BEAUTIFUL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WE GOT IT OPEN IN FOUR MONTHS. INSTEAD OF 20 OR 25 YEARS. WE THINK AT LEAST 1.1 BILLION. IT'S A GREAT EMBASSY RIGHT NOW. IT'S A GREAT THING. GREAT. WEEKS AGO I ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. [APPLAUSE] THAT HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR 52 YEARS. FOR 52 YEARS, THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT. THEY HAD MANY MEETINGS, SUMMITS, PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. TALKING ABOUT THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT STRATEGICALLY FOR VICTORY. HEIGHTS. 52 YEARS AGO, IT STARTED. I DID IT THAT QUICKLY. DONE. IT'S ALL DONE. [APPLAUSE] WE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THE SOCIALIST BRUTALITY OF THE MADURO REGIME. YOU SEE WHAT SOCIALISM DOES. THAT WAS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. NOW IT IS ONE OF THE POOREST. TO THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO OPPOSE SOCIALISM IN OUR COUNTRY, WE SEE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. WE SEE NOTHING BUT POVERTY. WE WILL SAY AGAIN TONIGHT THAT AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. EVER. [APPLAUSE] A HELL OF A CROWD. SATURDAY NIGHT, WE ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME. YOU KNOW MY? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT WE LOVE. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] EACH OF US IN THIS ARENA IS UNITED BY THE SAME TIMELESS VALUES. WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BROKER SEE, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE THE TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS AND PRINCIPLES THAT UNITE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS BEAUTIFUL STATUS WITH , STATE OF WISCONSIN. THEY BIND US TOGETHER AS CITIZENS, PATRIOTS AND AMERICANS. YOU JOINED OUR MOVEMENT, THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE YOU REJECTED THE FAILURES AND THE TRAILS OF THE PAST. YOU WERE BETRAYED. YOU WERE BETRAYED. YOU WERE BETRAYED BY DISHONEST PEOPLE, BY STUPID PEOPLE. YOU STARED DOWN A CORRUPT SYSTEM THAT ENRICHED ITSELF AT YOUR EXPENSE. YOU PROTECTED YOUR FAMILY. YOU DEFENDED YOUR DIGNITY. YOUR HE CAPTURED YOUR DESTINY. YOU TOOK BACK YOUR COUNTRY WITH THAT GREAT ELECTION. [APPLAUSE] EVERY DAY BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 2020, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. REMEMBER. I USED TO TELL YOU ABOUT WINNING. WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO SAY, EVERY LEADER, WITHOUT FAIL, THAT COMES TO SEE ME IN THE OVAL OFFICE ALL SAY, CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ECONOMICALLY, WHICH IS TREMENDOUS. WE HAVE CREATED $12 TRILLION OF VALUE SINCE THE ELECTION. 12 TRILLION. [APPLAUSE] THEY WERE TAXING US . IF SOMEBODY ELSE WERE IN THIS POSITION, THEY WOULD'VE CAUGHT US ALREADY. THEY ARE NOT CATCHING US NOW. WE ARE WAY OUT IN FRONT.

CSPANDT2520194	Donald Trump	2019-05-02	President Trump Observes National Day of Prayer	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MRS. PENCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: GOOD MORNING. PLEASE BE SEATED. TO MEMBERS OF OUR CABINET, LEADERS IN FAITH AND PUBLIC LIFE, TO ALL OUR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, IT IS AN HONOR FOR KAREN AND ME TO BE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, OUR FIRST LADY, AND ALL OF YOU HERE IN THE ROSE GARDEN AS WE MARK THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE BIBLE TELLS US TO BE FAITHFUL IN PRAYER AND THAT THE EFFECTIVE AND FERVENT PRAYERS OF RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE AVAIL US MUCH. AND SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THIS NATION, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED IN PRAYER. IT IS THE THREAD THAT RUNS THROUGH EVERY ERA OF AMERICAN HISTORY. IN 1775, THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ESTABLISHED A DAY OF FASTING AND PRAYER. IN 1863, PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, FROM THESE VERY GROUNDS, URGED AMERICANS TO PRAY SO THAT, IN HIS WORDS, THE UNITED CRY OF THE NATION WOULD BE HEARD ON HIGH AND ANSWERED WITH BLESSING. IN 1952, PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN AND THE CONGRESS FORMALLY ESTABLISHED THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, AND SET ASIDE EACH YEAR FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TURN TO GOD IN PRAYER AND MEDITATION. EVER SINCE THEN, EVERY PRESIDENT HAS ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN HONOR OF THIS GREAT TRADITION AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES THAT TRADITION TODAY. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID JUST TWO YEARS AGO IN THIS ROSE GARDEN, IN HIS WORDS, WE ARE A NATION OF FAITH, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU AT A TIME WHEN RELIGIOUS BELIEF IS OFTEN MARGINALIZED AND OFTEN RIDICULED, IN THIS WHITE HOUSE, UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, WE BELIEVE IN PRAYER. [APPLAUSE] IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE A PRACTICE OF OPENING EVERY CABINET MEETING IN PRAYER. IN FACT, HE IS AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME ONE OF ONLY FOUR PRESIDENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHO'VE ISSUED MULTIPLE PROCLAMATIONS, CALLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO PRAYER IN A SINGLE YEAR. WE BELIEVE WE ALWAYS DO WELL, TO GO TO THE LORD IN PRAYER. BUT IT SEEMS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THESE DAYS. NO ONE SHOULD EVER FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY IN A HOUSE OF WORSHIP IN AMERICA OR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND YET WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN WE HAVE WITNESSED UNSPEAKABLE ATTACKS ON PEOPLE OF FAITH. AT A SYNAGOGUE IN CALIFORNIA JUST A FEW SHORT DAYS AGO. AT MOSQUES IN NEW ZEALAND. AT HISTORICALLY BLACK CHURCHES IN LOUISIANA THAT WE'LL BE VISITING TOMORROW. AS AMERICANS, WE MOURN WITH THOSE WHO MOURN AND GRIEVE WITH THOSE WHO GRIEVE. AND WE CONDEMN THESE ATTACKS IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS. BUT ON THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF EVERY FAITH IN THIS COUNTRY CAN BE CONFIDENT THEY HAVE A CHAMPION AND A DEFENDER OF FAITH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S TRUE. FROM EARLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NEVER, EVER PENALIZE ANYONE FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS EVER AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] TODAY, THE PRESIDENT WILL ANNOUNCE EVEN MORE STEPS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VITAL ROLE THAT PEOPLE OF FAITH AND FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS PLAY IN OUR NATIONAL LIFE. SO ON BEHALF OF OUR FAMILY, AS YOU WILL SOON HEAR FROM THE FIRST FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS, FOR OUR PRESIDENT, FOR ALL THOSE WHO SERVE IN AUTHORITY AT EVERY LEVEL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS FOR OUR ARMED FORCES AND THOSE WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. THANK YOU FOR OUR TEACHERS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND ALL WHO LEAD IN BUSINESS AND PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TODAY, WE PRAY FOR AMERICA, AND AS WE PRAY, LET'S PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE. AS WAS ENDESCRIBED IN THOSE ANCIENT WORDS MILLENNIA AGO, THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY, THAT HE'LL DO LIKE HE'S ALWAYS DONE, WITH A LONG AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS NATION, HE'LL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HE'LL HEAL THIS LAND, THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] IT'S REALLY AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL HERE TODAY. THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. WE ASK YOU ALL TO JOIN IN WITH US IN WORSHIP. I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW THIS SONG. "GIVE LORD ALL PRAISE".

WELCOME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. PLEASE BOW YOUR HEADS FOR A PRAYER. THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU. THE LORD MAKES HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON YOU. AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU. THE LORD LIFTS UP HIS CONTENTS UPON YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE. AMEN. MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HONEY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU, MELANIA, FOR THE GREAT JOB YOU DO AS FIRST LADY. PEOPLE LOVE YOU. NO MATTER WHERE I GO, PEOPLE LOVE YOU. [APPLAUSE] ON THIS NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, THE FIRST LADY AND I ARE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO THE WHITE HOUSE, A VERY SPECIAL OCCASION FOR US. I KNOW IT IS FOR YOU, TOO. THE WHITE HOUSE IS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL PLACE. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY SENDING OUR PRAYERS TO THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] THE BRUTAL REPRESSION OF THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE MUST END, AND IT MUST END SOON. PEOPLE ARE STARVING. THEY HAVE NO FOOD. THEY HAVE NO WATER. AND THIS WAS ONCE ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. SO WE WISH THEM WELL. WE'LL BE THERE TO HELP, AND WE ARE THERE TO HELP. THANK YOU. VERY IMPORTANTLY, THIS MORNING, WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE JOINED BY SO MANY OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND GREAT REPRESENTATIVES THEY ARE, AND I WANT TO START WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY SPECIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE DOING THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE IN A LONG TIME, INCLUDING AN ECONOMY THAT MAY BE THE BEST EVER, AND HE'S BEEN A BIG, BIG HELP. [APPLAUSE] YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO THAT IS. MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND ALSO A WONDERFUL LADY AND A REAL FRIEND OF THE TRUMP FAMILY AND A TREMENDOUS WIFE, I CAN SAY THAT, KAREN PENCE. THANK YOU, KAREN. WE'RE ALSO GLAD TO HAVE WITH US SECRETARY IS ONY PERDUE. WHERE SONNY PERDUE. WHERE IS SONNY? BEN CARSON. GREAT JOB. DEPUTY SECRETARY ERIC HARDEN AND AMBASSADOR SAM BROWNBACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OH, I'M LOOKING AT THAT BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD. WOULD YOU PLEASE STAND UP? WHAT A , WHAT A VOICE. WHAT A VOICE. HUH. SO GREAT. YOU BETTER COME UP HERE. [LAUGHTER] GREAT TO HAVE YOU. THANKS, ALSO, TO THE MANY FAITH LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH US TODAY. SPECIAL, SPECIAL PEOPLE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST PROUD OF IS THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT. YOU CAN NOW SPEAK YOUR MIND AND SPEAK IT FREELY. I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO THAT. I TOLD PAULA WHITE, WHO I WANT TO THANK SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S DONE , PAULA. THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID. THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR VOICE POLITICALLY, AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO LISTEN TO POLITICALLY, BUT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SPEAK. THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. SO WE GOT RID OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT. THAT'S A BIG THING.

GREAT JOB. [APPLAUSE] ON THIS SPECIAL DAY, WE JOINED COMMUNITIES AND CONGREGATIONS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IN CONTINUING A GREAT TRADITION THAT HELPED BUILD OUR NATION AND WE HAVE BUILT IT NOW STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. THEY'RE STARTING TO FIND OUT. IN MARCH OF 1776, AS THE FOUNDERS PREPARED TO DRAFT THE DECK LAATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ASKED EVERYONE TO JOIN , DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ASKED EVERYONE TO JOIN IN A DAY OF FASTING AND PRAYER. THEY GO HAND IN HAND. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. TODAY WE GIVE THANKS TO THIS MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY AND WE PROUDLY COME TOGETHER AS ONE NATION UNDER GOD. [APPLAUSE] AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIKE AND PRI DISCUSSING JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, PEOPLE ARE SO PROUD TO BE USING THAT BEAUTIFUL WORD "GOD" AND THEY'RE USING THE WORD GOD AGAIN AND THEY'RE NOT HIDING FROM IT AND THEY'RE NOT BEING TOLD TO TAKE IT DOWN AND THEY'RE NOT SAYING WE CAN'T HONOR GOD. IN GOD WE TRUST. SO IMPORTANT. A LITTLE THING ON THE CAMPAIGN BUT IT WASN'T SUCH A LITTLE THING TO ME WHEN I FIRST STARTED, FOUR YEARS AGO, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SO LONG, WE DID A GOOD JOB, BUT WHEN I FIRST STARTED CAMPAIGNING PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED OR IN SOME CASES FOOLISHLY ASHAMED TO BE USING IN STORES MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY CHRISTMAS. THEY WOULD SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS. THEY WOULD HAVE RED WALLS AND YOU'D NEVER SEE CHRISTMAS. THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR STORES NOWADAYS. IT'S ALL MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. THEY'RE PROUD OF IT. [APPLAUSE] I ALWAYS SAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. AS WE UNITE ON THIS DAY OF PRAYER, WE RENEW OUR RESOLVE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES OF FAITH AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE AND ALL OF OUR PEOPLE CAN LIVE AND PRAY AND WORSHIP IN PEACE. [APPLAUSE] IN RECENT MONTHS, IT'S BEEN PRETTY TOUGH. WE'VE SEEN EVIL AND HATE-FILLED ATTACKS ON RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD. ONE MONTH AGO, THREE HISTORICALLY BLACK CHURCHES WERE BURNED TRAGICALLY IN LOUISIANA. IN SRI LANKA AND NEW ZEALAND HUNDREDS OF CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED IN THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP. IN OCTOBER, AN ANTI-SEMITIC KILLER ATTACKED THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH. THAT WAS A HORRIBLE EVENT. THE FIRST LADY AND I WENT TO SEE THAT. IT WAS NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE. AND LAST WEEK, A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE AT A SYNAGOGUE IN POWAY, CALIFORNIA, WHILE JEWISH FAMILIES CELEBRATED THE LAST DAY OF PASSOVER. WE MOURN FOR THE LOSS OF ONE EXTRAORDINARY MEMBER OF THAT CONGREGATION, LORI GILBERT KAYE, WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE SHOOTER AND GAVE HER LIFE TO PROTECT HER RABBI. AN INCREDIBLE MAN. AN INCREDIBLE PERSON. THIS MORNING, WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF HEROES WHO RACED AFTER THE MURDERER AND HELPED DISRUPT THE ATTACK AT THE POWAY SYNAGOGUE. ARMY VETERAN OSCAR STEWART, AND BORDER PATROL AGENT JONATHAN MORALES. PLEASE STAND. PLEASE STAND. COME. [APPLAUSE] SAY A FEW WORDS, PLEASE. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. I JUST WANT TO SAY EVERYTHING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, I ECHO. WE NEED TO BE STRONG AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT LOVE GOD, WHETHER YOU CALL HIM MOW , MOHAMMED, WE NEED TO BE STRONG BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT EVIL. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO BE WHO YOU ARE. BE PROUD AND LIFT YOURSELF UP. THAT'S ALL. GOOD MORNING, ALL. I'M A BORDER PATROL ASSIGNED IN ELL SENT ROW, CALIFORNIA. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE WERE CELEBRATING OUR LAST DAY OF PASSOVER. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOYOUS, FESTIVE EVENT. WE WERE ATTACKED WITH OUR BACKS TURNED. YOU KNOW, BRAVE PEOPLE STOOD UP AND CONFRONTED THIS PERSON AND WE ENDED THE SITUATION THE BEST WE COULD WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAD. LIKE I SAID, I'D LIKE TO USE A QUOTE FROM , HE SAID, IN ORDER TO FIGHT THESE RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS AND ALL OF US KEEP DOING GOOD DEEDS AND WE'LL OVERCOME THIS EVILNESS. [APPLAUSE] INCREDIBLE JOB, BOTH OF YOU HAVE DONE. YOUR BRAVERY IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL. WE'RE ALSO PROFOUNDLY HONORED TO BE JOINED BY SOMEBODY THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT BY TELEPHONE. I HAD A WHAT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT A ONE-MINUTE CONVERSATION JUST TO EXPRESS MY SORROW AND GRATITUDE AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU COULD EXPRESS AND IT ENDED UP BEING ABOUT 25 MINUTES AND IT WAS A VERY WARM , HE'S A VERY WARM, INCREDIBLE MAN. YISROEL GOLDSTEIN, RABBI, AND I'LL TELL YOU, IT WASN'T IN THE SCHEDULE BUT RABBI, I'D LOVE TO BRING YOU UP, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY THAT EXPRESSED THE HORROR AND THE BEAUTY OF WHAT YOU REPRESENT BETTER THAN YOU DID. AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT, RABBI. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE WITH YOUR SON AND YOUR BROTHER. I APPRECIATE IT. PLEASE COME UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. [APPLAUSE] RABBI GOLDSTEIN: JUST FIVE DAYS AGO, SATURDAY MORNING, I FACED EVIL AND THE WORST DARKNESS OF ALL-TIME RIGHT IN OUR OWN HOUSE OF WORSHIP, RIGHT AT CHABAD POWAY. I FACED HIM AND I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION. DO I RUN AND HIDE OR DO I STAND TALL AND FIGHT AND PROTECT ALL THOSE THAT ARE THERE? WE CANNOT CONTROL WHAT OTHERS DO, BUT WE CAN CONTROL HOW WE REACT. MY DEAR RABBI TAUGHT ME, THE WAY WE REACT TO DARKNESS IS WITH LIGHT. IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT I MADE A DECISION, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME, I'M GOING TO SAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE . I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BY NOW BASED ON THE RULE OF STATISTICS. I WAS IN THE LINE OF FIRE, BULLETS FIRING ALL THE WAY. MY FINGERS GOT BLOWN OFF, BUT I DID NOT STOP. THE RABBI TAUGHT ME, AS A JEW, YOU ARE A SOLDIER OF GOD. YOU NEED TO STAND TALL AND STAND FAST AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO CHANGE THE WORLD. MY LIFE HAS CHANGED FOREVER BUT IT CHANGED SO I COULD MAKE CHANGE, AND I COULD HELP OTHERS LEARN HOW TO BE STRONG, HOW TO BE MIGHTY AND TALL. MANY HAVE ASKED ME, RABBI, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS? AND MY RESPONSE IS, WHAT MY RABBI TOLD ME, WHEN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS SHOT, HE SAID, WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE BASICS AND INTRODUCE A MOMENT OF SILENCE IN ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO THAT , [APPLAUSE] SO THAT CHILDREN FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD ON COULD RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S MORE GOOD TO THE WORLD, THAT THEY ARE VALUABLE, THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY, AND EVERY HUMAN BEING IS CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE. IF SOMETHING GOOD THAT CAN COME OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, HORRIFIC EVENT, LET US BRING BACK A MOMENT OF SILENCE BACK TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR DEAR, HONORABLE, MR. PRESIDENT, BEING AS THEY SAID IN YIDDISH , [APPLAUSE] MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I WAS AT HOME WEEPING. YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON WHO BEGAN MY HEALING. YOU HEAL PEOPLE IN THEIR WORST OF TIMES, AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] RABBI GOLDSTEIN: YOU HAVE HELPED ME BRING GREAT HONOR TO MRS. LORI KAYE, A 60-YEAR-OLD DEAR FRIEND OF OUR CONGREGATION. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR 25 YEARS. A STAUNCH VOLUNTEER. SHE WORKS FOR THE FRIENDSHIP CIRCLE, AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS CHILDREN OF SPECIAL NEEDS. THIS YEAR ON JUNE 2, WE'RE DOING A MARCH IN HER MEMORY TO SHOW THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP US. WE'RE GOING TO MARCH WITH VICTORY AND YOU HELPED US BRING LORI KAYE GREAT HONOR AND GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU, RABBI. [APPLAUSE] SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS. A GREAT MAN. HE SAID, THIS IS MY GREATEST MOMENT IN LIFE, TO GO FROM DARKNESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, RIGHT? THAT'S GREAT. BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RABBI. APPRECIATE IT. ANYTHING WE CAN DO, YOU KNOW THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND TRULY, YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR GRACE AND DEVOTION TOUCHES EVERY HEART AND SOUL IN AMERICA. WE'RE BLESSED BY HAVING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HERE WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU, RABBI. PLEASE GIVE OUR REGARDS TO EVERYBODY. THAT WAS A TOUGH, TOUGH PERIOD OF TIME. WE WILL FIGHT WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BODIES TO DEFEAT ANTI-SEMITISM, TONED THE ATTACKS ON THE JEW , TO END THE ATTACKS ON THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND TO CONCUR ALL FORMS OF PERSECUTION, INTOLERANCE, AND HATE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT, RABBI. EVERY CITIZEN HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO LIVE, ACCORDING TO THE TEACHINGS OF THEIR FAITH, AND THE CONVICTIONS OF THEIR HEART. THIS IS THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN LIFE. TO PROTECT THIS HERITAGE, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS STRONGLY DEFENDED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. TWO WORDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD TOO MUCH ABOUT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, BUT NOW YOU'RE HEARING IT ALL THE TIME, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE] EARLIER THIS WEEK, I TOOK ACTION TO ENSURE THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES CAN TAKE PAID TIME OFF TO OBSERVE RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS, AND JUST TODAY, WE FINALIZED NEW PROTECTIONS OF CONSCIENCE RIGHTS FOR PHYSICIANS, PHARMACISTS, NURSES, TEACHERS, STUDENTS, AND FAITH-BASED CHARITIES. THEY'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME, RIGHT, MIKE? THEY'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME. IT HAPPENED TODAY. TOGETHER, WE'RE BUILDING A CULTURE THAT CHERISHES THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF HUMAN LIFE. EVERY CHILD BORN AND UNBORN IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN ADDITION, I AM COMMITTING TO YOU TODAY THAT MY ADMINISTRATION WILL PRESERVE THE CENTRAL ROLE OF FAITH-BASED ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE AGENCIES TO CARE FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN WHILE FOLLOWING THEIR DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS. [APPLAUSE] AND THOSE ARE WORDS YOU PROBABLY NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D EVER HEAR. TO GIVE FORMER INMATES A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE, WE PASSED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. IVANKA, STAND UP. IVANKA TRUMP, AND JARED. IVANKA AND JARED WORKED SO HARD. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAN SERVE FEDERAL PRISONERS. THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE IN AND THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF PRISONERS AS THEY GET OUT, AND WE HAD THE GREATEST SUCCESS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY BEING SO STRONG. WHERE PEOPLE LEAVING PRISON, NOW ON A MUCH MORE FAIRER BASIS, BUT PEOPLE LEAVING PRISON CAN GET JOBS AND THEY'VE DONE INCREDIBLY WELL. EMPLOYERS WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE, BECAUSE THERE WAS A STIGMA, OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS A PRETTY TOUGH STIGMA, SO THEY WOULDN'T GO THAT ROUTE, AND PEOPLE WOULD END UP BACK IN PRISON. BUT NOW EMPLOYERS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE ARE DOING IT AND THEY'RE SO HAPPY. I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S PUT ON SEVEN PRISONERS, FORMER PRISONERS, AND HE TOLD ME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW REALLY GREAT THEY ARE, HOW GOOD THEY ARE. HE ACTUALLY SAID, THEY ARE BETTER THAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE THERE. THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN , SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GREAT NATION WHERE THEY'RE DOING SO WELL. SO WE HOPE THEY KEEP IT UP. THE ECONOMY IS HELPING. THE ECONOMY IS HELPING. BUT NOW THEY'RE HELPING THEMSELVES, AND THEY'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. AND WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING FAITH-BASED ADDICTION RECOVERY PROGRAMS, BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF PRAYER. [APPLAUSE] AND I WILL SAY, OUR FIRST LADY HAS TAKEN TO THIS. IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT SHE'S DONE. AND WE'RE DOWN 16% WITH OPIOID. 16% IS A LOT. AND MELANIA, PLEASE STAND UP. THAT'S A FANTASTIC JOB YOU'VE DONE. PLEASE. INCREDIBLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INCREDIBLE. I HEARD THAT NUMBER THE FIRST TIME THE OTHER DAY AND I SAID, THAT'S A LOT. THAT REALLY IS. IT'S NOT THERE, BUT WE HOPE TO GET THERE, AND WE'RE ALSO TRYING VERY HARD THROUGH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE GIVE OUT TO HOSPITALS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND EVERYBODY TO COME UP WITH PAINKILLERS THAT ARE NONADDICTIVE. SO YOU DON'T GO INTO THE HOSPITAL WITH A BROKEN ARM AND COME OUT A DRUG ADDICT, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN MANY CASES. SO WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP, AND WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO COME UP WITH A POWERFUL PAINKILLER WHICH AT THE SAME TIME IS NONADDICTIVE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? HELLO, RALPH. HERE WITH US TODAY IS ASHLEY EVANS FROM DAYTON, OHIO, WHO WAS MELANIA'S GUEST AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. TWO YEARS AGO, ASHLEY WAS SUFFERING FROM THE GRIP OF HEROIN ADDICTION, WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT. SHE RETURNED TO A RECOVERY CENTER AND WAS WELCOMED BY HER MENTOR, ANGIE DENNIS, WHO WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR. ASHLEY AND ANGIE DEVELOPED A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, AND ANGIE SAID TO HER, I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE IT BACK, I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU. . TODAY ANGIE IS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ASHLEY. ASHLEY SAYS PRAYER IS WHAT GOT ME CLEAN. BEAUTIFUL WORDS. NEXT WEEK, ASHLEY WILL CELEBRATE 16 MONTH FREASE FROM ADDICTION. AND SHE'S EARNED BACK , [APPLAUSE] THE CUSTODY OF HER BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OLIVIA WHO IS HERE ALSO RIGHT NOW WITH MOM. AND ASHLEY OR LIVIA, IS THAT OLIVIA? I HAD A FEELING THAT WAS OLIVIA. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO OLIVIA THE ENTIRE TIME. OLIVIA HAS DOMINATED THE SERVICE AND THAT'S OK. ASHLEY, COME ON UP, SAY A FEW WORDS, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT FINDING GOD SMAVED LIFE. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE. IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY BUT WITHOUT HIM I COULD NOT DO THIS. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU, ANGIE, FOR HELPING ME FIND HIM. IT'S BEEN , IT'S BEEN A CRAZY EXPERIENCE. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE. GOD HAS BEEN WITH ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND EVERYTHING HAS WORKED OUT PERFECTLY. I HAVE REUNITED WITH OLIVIA. I HAVE AN AMAZING SUPPORT SYSTEM BACK HOME AND IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. AND I'VE GOT TON DO SOME AMAZING THINGS. AND THAT'S BY THE GRACE OF GOD. SO THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SHE IS. SHE IS SO AWESOME. THE BIGGEST HONOR THAT I COULD HAVE WAS TO PASS ALONG TO ASHLEY, IT'S A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS. IT'S A RELATIONSHIP, IT'S NOT A RELIGION, IT'S NOT A BUNCH OF RULES, IT'S JUST THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU KNOW. IF YOU'LL TRUST HIM AND YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU DO YOUR PART, AND THEN TRUST HIM AND ASK FOR HELP FOR THE REST. HE'LL MAKE DOORS OPEN THAT NO MAN CAN CLOSE. YOU KNOW. SO I'M JUST HONORED TO BE PART OF THIS. [APPLAUSE] I'M GLAD I ASKED YOU TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS. ASHLEY OR LIVIA, AND ANGIE, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US AND REMINDING US THAT PRAYER WORKS MIRACLES AND PRAYER SAVES LIVES. [APPLAUSE] AS GOD PROMISES IN THE BIBLE, THOSE WHO HOPE IN THE LORD WILL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH, THEY WILL SOAR ON THE WINGS LIKE EAGLES, THEY WILL RUN AND NOT GROW WEARY. AND THEY WILL WALK AND NOT BE FAINT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MIKE AND I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME, RIGHT, MIKE? ON THIS PRAYER DAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIKE? I THINK. SO WE DESERVE IT. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE SAY HOW DO YOU GET THROUGH THAT STUFF IN HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH THOSE WITCH HUNTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE? AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE JUST DO IT, RIGHT IN AND WE THINK ABOUT GOD. THAT'S TRUE. SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ON THIS DAY OF PRAYER WE ONCE AGAIN PLACE OUR HOPES IN THE HANDS OF OUR CREATOR AND WE GIVE THANKS FOR THOSE WONDROUS LANDS OF LIBERTY AND THIS IS TRULY THE GREATEST OF ALL LANDS OF LIBERTY, OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY IS SPECIAL. IT WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL. IT WILL BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'RE DOING THINGS THAT WILL MAKE IT BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.

THIS DAY FALLS OUT DURING THE WEEK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS PROCLAIMED THE DAYS OF NATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE. AND IT IS FITTING. FOR TO ERADICATE UNSPEAKABLE HORROR, HUMANITY MUST INDEED ACT TO DO ITS PART. BUT WE MUST ALSO TURN TO YOU, MERCIFUL GOD, AND FLAIR BLESSINGS OF PEACE, LOVE, AND BROTHERHOOD AMONG OUR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ALL CREATED IN YOUR IMAGE. WE NEED YOU DESPERATELY TO HEAL US AND TO HELP US OVERCOME OUR DIVISIONS AND INSTILL WITHIN OURSELVES YOUR WILL TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR. AS WE ARE DEVASTATED BY AND CONTINUE TO REEL FROM THE WANTON MURDER AND MAYHEM AT POWAY AND AS WE ARE ALSO INSPIRED BY THE PROFOUND FAITH, HEROISM AND OPEN MIRACLES THAT OCCURRED THERE, WE PLEAD WITH YOU, DEAR GOD, TO REMOVE THE HATRED FROM THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO WOULD COMMIT SUCH HEINOUS ACTS IN SYNAGOGUES IN POWAY AND PITTSBURGH, IN MOSQUES IN NEW ZEALAND AND IN CHURCHES IN SRI LANKA. WE WILL TRUST IN YOU AND WE SHALL OUTLIVE THEM. THIS WEEK, WHEN WE REMEMBER INCOMPREHENSIBLE CRUELTY AND THE EVIL OF GENOCIDE, WE FIND JOY IN THE FACT THAT WE LIVE IN A NATION THAT IS A BEACON OF FREEDOM AND BENEVOLENCE. A NATION THAT EXTENDS ITS HAND TO THE VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED. AND PUTS WITHIN THE REACH OF ITS CITIZENS THE PROMISE OF PROSPERITY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. A NATION THAT SEEKS PEACE AND SECURITY FOR ITS PEOPLE AND THE END OF TERROR AND VIOLENCE AGAINST INNOCENTS. A NATION THAT IS ROOTED IN THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW, INCLUDING PROTECTING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM AT HOME AND ABROAD. THIS WEEK, WHEN WE REMEMBER GOOSESTEPPING JACKBOOTS THAT INSTILLED FEAR AND TERROR IN GOOD AND INNOCENT PEOPLE, WE FIND JOY IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS WHO INSPIRE PRIDE, CONFIDENCE, AND COMFORT. WE PLEAD WITH YOU, MERCIFUL GOD, WHO NEVER SLUMBERS NOR SLEEPS, TO PROVIDE THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES YOUR CONSTANT PROTECTION AS THEY RISK THEIR LIVES AND TO CONSOLE THOSE WHOSE LOVED ONES HAVE MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. ALMIGHTY GOD, WE THANK YOU FOR THIS NATION OF LOVING KINDNESS AND FOR THE GREAT PRIVILEGE AND JOY OF LIVING HERE. MAY YOU CONTINUE TO PROTECT IT AND TO SHOWER YOUR BLESSINGS UPON IT AND MAY WE MERIT YOUR LOVE NOW AND ALWAYS, AMEN. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GRAB ONE ANOTHER'S HANDS RIGHT NOW. THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S GOOD TO DWELL TOGETHER IN UNITY, I KNOW THEY'RE A LITTLE SWEATY BUT THIS IS THE LAST PRAYER. FATHER, I AM GLAD TO COME TO YOU, WE LIFT YOUR NAME UP YOU SAID YOU WOULD DRAW ALL MEN UNTO YOU. WE THANK YOU FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST LADY, THE ADMINISTRATION. WE KE CLAIRE IT WILL BE HOLY GROUND. HIS PRAISE SHALL CONTINUALLY BE IN MY MOUTH. AS WE THANK YOU FOR THE GOODNESS ARKS WE THANK YOU FOR THE PROSPER I HAVE TO THE NATION, FOR YOUR BLESSING, FOR YOUR HAND, NOW WE LIFT UP OUR PRESIDENT, YOU DECLARED IN YEREMIAH, CHAPTER 1, 5 THAT BEFORE HE WAS FORMLES IN HIS MOTHER'S WOUND YOU HAD SET HIM APART AND ORDAINED HIM. ACCORDING TO PSALMS YOU DECLARED IN 139, VERSE 16 YOU ORDAINED ALL OF HIS DAYS BEFORE ONE OF THEM EVER CAME INTO BEING. SO NOT ONE DAY TAKES YOU BE SURPRISE. WE THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GIVEN HIM THE VICTORY THROUGH CHRIST JESUS AND WE UNDERSTAND EPHESIANS CHAPTER 6, VER 12, THAT WE ARE NOT WRESTLING AGAINST FLESH AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, WICKEDNESS AND DARKNESS. WE DECLARE EVERY DEMONIC NETWORK TO BE SCATTERED RIGHT NOW. EWE DECLARE THERE'S A HEDGE OF PROTECTION OVER OUR PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY, EVERY ASSIGNMENT, THE PURPOSE THEY CARRY IN THE MANTLE AND LIKE THE APOSTLE SAID, I WAS SET APART FROM MY MOTHER'S WOUND AND MARKED OFF BY BOUNDARIES. LET HIM FULFILL THE WILL OF THE LORD FOR YOUR GREAT NAME, FOR YOUR GREAT NATION AND FOR ALL YOUR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, I DECREE THIS AND DECLARE THIS IN THE MIGHTY, MATCHLESS GAME OF JESUS CHRIST AND ACCORDING TO TO JOB, WHAT I DECREE AND DECLARE IS MATCHLESS AND EVERYBODY DECLARES AMEN.

CSPANDT20520196	Donald Trump	2019-05-20	President Trump Campaign Rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania	THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY. WHAT IS INTERESTING CONTRAST WITH DIVERSITY AND THE CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP. THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONTRAST. THAT ISSUE IS THE BIGGEST IMPLICATION AS FOR REGIONAL AND LOCAL NEWS CHANNELS. THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THESE CORPORATE ENTITIES AND THE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN STRIPPED AWAY. TALK ABOUT THESE AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION OR IT'S HARD TO GET ACCESS TO JOURNALISM AT ANY OTHER LEVEL. AND THAT IS THE CONCERN.

WE HAVE TO GET HIM IN THERE TOMORROW IF HE WINS THEY WILL NOT REPORT IT IF HE LOSES THE GREATEST STORY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE DON'T WANT THAT. THEY WILL MAKE IT INTO THE SINGLE GREATEST EVENT OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. WHEN WE CAMPAIGNED FOR PEOPLE AND IN A LOT OF CASES AND WE ALSO WON THE SENATE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT WE PICKED UP TWO ADDITIONAL SEATS. REMEMBER? WITH A CAMPAIGN WITH 32 MAJOR STOPS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN MAKE TWO MORE ON THE FINAL DAY OF A RUNOFF. CINDY SMITH DID GREAT THAT WAS A RUNOFF BUT THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK. WE WON THE SENATE. NO PRAISE. NO ACCLAMATION. NOTHING. BUT OUR FRIEND FRED A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING. A LOT OF NEWSMAKERS ARE WATCHING AND THEY WILL BE REPORTING. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE HE WINS. PLEASE. DO YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY WILL SAY? PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME TO PENNSYLVANIA AND HE WENT BACK HOME. A LOSER. I NEVER WANT TO BE CALLED A LOSER. WE, WE RAN ONE TIME WE ARE ONE AND ZERO. NOW WE WILL HAVE A SECOND TIME. ANOTHER ONE. AND THAT WILL DRIVE THEM CRAZY. AND MAYBE IF WE REALLY LIKE IT A LOT AND IF THINGS KEEP GOING LIKE THEY ARE GOING WE WILL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AND A THREE AND A FOUR OR A FIVE. NO, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. [LAUGHTER] NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE. IT WILL BE GREAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST POLITICAL SLOGAN OF ALL TIME IS WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR HEAD. MAKE AMERICA A GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT NOW THE MILITARY IS SO POWERFUL, TAKING ON COUNTRIES THAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT. FRANKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GREAT BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT. WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION SOON. DO WE KEEP OUR LOGO AND OUR SLOGAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR IT'S VERY RISKY TO CHANGE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LOGAN - - LOGO. THEY THINK IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ELECTIONS OF ALL TIME NOW WE TAKE THE SLOGAN OR THE LOGO AND POSSIBLY CHANGING IT. ONE HUNDRED TO ALL TIME HIGH STOCK MARKETS. JUST ABOUT THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY INCLUDING THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND ASIANS AND HISPANICS. ALL THESE RECORDS WE ARE SETTING EVERYTHING IS GOOD. DO WE MAKE IT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR DO WE MAKE IT KEEP AMERICA GREAT? LOOK, YOU KNOW, THIS. YOU HAVE SOME SOCIALIST WACKOS THAT WANT TO DOUBLE AND TRIPLE YOUR TAXES. THEY WANT TO KNOCK DOWN ALL BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN AND REBUILD THEM WITHOUT WINDOWS. YOU KNOW, ABOUT THAT? I USED TO LOVE THE VIEW BUT NOW WE WILL BE FORCED TO CLOSE THE WINDOW. DO WE WANT KEEP AMERICA GREAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW. IT IS VERY HARD TO LEAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL I HAVE HAD PEOPLE SAY EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT SPOT ON BECAUSE IN THEORY WE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN WE CERTAINLY WILL BY THE TIME OF THE ELECTION BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IT'S HARD TO TAKE IN EXPRESSION AND CHANGE IT. LET ME HAVE IT FOR MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] . YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING? I HAVE HAD THAT RESPONSE FROM OTHERS. LIKE TO DO POLES. I HATE TO SAY IT THIS IS CHEAPER BUT BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT YOU COULD GET. THEY INTERVIEW 103 PEOPLE I GOT THOUSANDS TONIGHT. I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT. EITHER WAY IT WILL BE GREAT WITH A GREAT CAMPAIGN AND IN FACT, WE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK. OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED AGAIN. TALK TO JAPAN, NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, EUROPEAN NATIONS, NATIONS, EUROPEAN UNION IS AN EXAMPLE. THEY BADLY MISTREATED US FOR MANY YEARS. DO WE NEED A DOCTOR? WE NEED A DOCTOR PLEASE. DO WE HAVE A DOCTOR? A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE? PLEASE. THANK YOU DOCTOR. SOMEONE THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW HAS BEEN HERE FOR TWO DAYS. I DON'T BLAME THEM. THEY HAD BEEN WAITING IN LINE FOR TWO DAYS.

I THINK I'M IN LOVE WE LOVE TRUMP. [CHANTING] WE LOVE TRUMP. [CHANTING] WE LOVE TRUMP. [CHANTING] . UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WITH THOSE FAILED TRADE POLICIES THAT HURT PENNSYLVANIA MIDDLE-CLASS. YOU KNOW, THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY WHAT THEY DID TO PENNSYLVANIA IN PARTICULAR OHIO OHIO, SOME OF THE STATES IN PARTICULAR FRANKLY NORTH CAROLINA WHAT THEY DID WAS DISGRACEFUL TO THE WORKERS. PACKED UP YOUR BUSINESSES MOVING THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES SELLING BACK THE PRODUCT WITH NO TAXES AND WE LOST REVENUE, NO TARIFFS, NOBODY EVEN APOLOGIZED EXCEPT FOR ME WE SAID WE WOULD TURN IT AROUND. NOW COMPANIES ARE POURING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS. INCLUDING THE AUTO COMPANIES. [APPLAUSE] IN THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE MY ELECTION THE UNITED STATES LOST A QUARTER OF A MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS. BUT THE GREAT BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN WORKER AND DID ON DAY NUMBER ONE THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE. YOU KNOW, THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AGAIN. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR YOU. WHO THE HELL WERE ALL THESE PEOPLE AND WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? THEY ARE THE DEPLORABLE'S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WATCHED HER SPEECH. SHE ACTUALLY SAID DEPLORABLE'S AND DIDN'T SHE SAY IRREDEEMABLE'S? TO SHOW YOU HOW GOOD I AM POLITICALLY I SAID THAT'S KILLER BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE DEPLORABLE IS THE ONE THAT CAUGHT ON I WOULD SAY IRREDEEMABLE IS WORSE THAN DEPLORABLE. BUT THEY BELIEVE IN BOTH. NOT ONLY HER BUT THE DEMOCRATS. UPON MY INAUGURATION I INHERITED ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED AND READY TO BE PUT INTO ACTION TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND IT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. THE TPP WITH A LOBBYIST AND DONORS AND SPECIAL INTEREST IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE MADE A FORTUNE HURTING THE AMERICAN WORKER. THE TPP WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR THE PEOPLE OF SCRANTON ONE - - SCRANTON AND ALLENTOWN AND PITTSBURGH. I PROUDLY WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS IN MY FIRST WEEK ON THAT JOB KILLING DISASTER WHICH BY THE WAY WOULD HAVE DESTROYED BUSINESSES. JUST LIKE NAFTA. JUST LIKE NAFTA WAS SUCH A DISASTER. NO WONDER WHERE JOE BIDEN ANNOUNCED HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BY THE WAY. [BOOING] WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I AM NOT EVEN ANNOUNCING TODAY PARAGUAY WILL WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR GO LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE HAVE THEY SAID HE HAD 600 PEOPLE. I SAY 150. BUT HE ANNOUNCED HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE FOUR LEADERS CALLED HIM UP AND BEGGED HIM TO DO IT. FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKED IT MUCH BETTER. THEY WANT BIDEN SO CHINA CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE $500 BILLION A YEAR AND MORE RIPPING OFF THE UNITED STATES. [BOOING] LOOKING AT WHAT THESE COUNTRIES HAVE MADE WE LOST ON TRADE $800 BILLION ON AVERAGE FOR MANY YEARS. 800MILLION IS A LOT A HUNDRED BILLION IS NOT EVEN CONCEIVABLE AND WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOT ONLY PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT OTHERS IT IS A SHAME BUT WE ARE STRAINING IT OUT. NOT EASY BECAUSE WE HAVE ASSAULTS FROM WITHIN THAT WE STRENGTHEN IT OUT ONE - - STRAIGHTEN IT OUT SOON WE ARE TAKING IN $100 BILLION IN TARIFFS REMEMBER THEY SUBSIDIZE THEIR PRODUCT PEOPLE ARE MOVING FROM CHINA TO GO TO AREAS WE WILL BUILD PLACES IN PENNSYLVANIA LIKE THE OLD, REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS? WE ACTUALLY MADE HER OWN PRODUCTS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR CHINA. THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. IT'S OKAY. IT WILL WORK OUT. FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE DOES BETTER WHEN THEY CAN PUSH US AROUND, RIP US OFF, MAKE US PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO HAND OVER OUR JOBS AND OUR WEALTH. EIGHT LONG YEARS AGO, IF YOU REMEMBER I SAID IT'S REALLY BAD AND WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY DID TO OUR COUNTRY , THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. [APPLAUSE] BUT JOE SAID HE IS RUNNING TO SAVE THE WORLD AND SAVE EVERY COUNTRY BUT OURS. AND HE SAID ONE WEEK AGO CHINA IS NOT A COMPETITOR. CHINA IS NOT A COMPETITOR. LOOK, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US IS INDESCRIBABLE ECONOMICALLY. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA AND I DON'T BLAME CHINA. I DON'T BLAME PRESIDENT XI. WE ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. OUR LEADERS ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WELL IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. I RAN AND WE HAVE SAVED AMERICA. WE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IF YOU DON'T MIND WE WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY OUT OF THAT $100 BILLION WE ARE SAVING AND WE WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. OKAY. DOCTOR BERKOWITZ THE SAME DOCTOR. GET THE SAME DOCTOR. HE WAS GREAT. ARE YOU OKAY? TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. TAKE YOUR TIME. LET'S GO. MAKE SURE SHE IS OKAY. MAKE SURE. TAKE YOUR TIME. THE TRUTH IS THERE IS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AT THESE RALLIES. THEY WAIT A LONG TIME. I AM EXCITED. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF EXCITEMENT. A LOT OF ENERGY. WE HAVE A LOT OF LOW ENERGY PEOPLE OUT THERE. BUT THEY ARE VICIOUS. THANK YOU. NO MORE SPYING ON TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I THINK THEY LEARNED THAT DID NOT WORK OUT TOO WELL. I THINK THEY LEARNED THAT DID NOT WORK OUT TOO WELL. HE DID A GOOD JOB. WHERE IS DON JUNIOR? THEY LIKE THE JOB THAT YOU DID. [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU OKAY? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THE VERY SAME ESTABLISHMENT THAT SACRIFICED OUR PROSPERITY AND WEAKENED HOUR MILITARY AND TIED US DOWN TO ENDLESS WARS THAT NEVER ENDED. THEY NEVER ENDED. YOU SAW WHAT WE DID TO THE CALIPHATE. THESE PEOPLE ARE STONE COLD CRAZY. YOU NEVER WANT TO SAY THAT YOU WIN BECAUSE THEY KILL PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE TOTALLY CRAZY. 100 PERCENT OF THE CALIPHATE AND THEN TO BRING OUR PEOPLE BACK HOME AND NOW TO REALLY - - RELIVE ALL OVER AGAIN THOSE FAILURES LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. ONE OF THE WORST DISASTERS FROM OUR FORMER LEADERS WAS THE DISASTER OF SMALL BUILDINGS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW ENGLAND ARE EMPTY. EVEN TO THIS DAY SOME WERE CONVERTED TO NURSING HOMES ARE TAKEN OVER BUT NOW REPLACING THEM WITH BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS. LIKE NEVER EVER BEFORE. NEARLY TWO DECADES AGO THE SAME POLITICIANS WHO WANTED TO ADMIT CHINA INTO THE WTO IS A DISASTER. SINCE THEN WE HAVE LOST 60000 FACTORIES. HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. BUT THEY ARE COMING BACK. . BUT SO MANY HAVE COME BACK. BUT IT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE IF I WAS OFF BY ONE FACTORY THEY WOULD HAVE SAID HE MADE A MISTAKE. AND THEN TO PLUNDER THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY AND NOW WE ARE FINALLY RESPONDING TO YEARS OF CHRONIC TRADE ABUSES BY DEFENDING OUR WORKERS WITH TARIFFS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS NECESSARY. NOBODY WILL STEAL OUR BUSINESSES OR CLOSE OUR FACTORIES. NOBODY WILL CLOSE OUR PLANS ANYMORE. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYONE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO PAY THE TARIFF. THEN BRING YOUR FACTORIES BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA. IF YOU WANT TO BE ANYWHERE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE. STUPID POLICY AND TAXES FORCE YOU OUT. . . . . NOW, JUST THIS MONTH THE UNITED STATES STEEL ANNOUNCED IT WILL INVEST MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM AND MAKE NEW [INAUDIBLE] , DO YOU KNOW THAT? DO KNOW WHAT THAT IS? IT'S IN PITTSBURGH, DOES ANYONE KNOW? IT'S NEAR PITTSBURGH IS SENDING OVER $1 MILLION, THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE NEWEST AND FINEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD THAT WILL MAKE A STEEL AGAIN IN OUR COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BUILDING NEW PLANTS FOR DECADES AND TOGETHER WE ARE PUTTING PENNSYLVANIA STEEL BACK INTO THESE FINE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. AS WE DEFEND OUR JOBS WERE ALSO DEFENDING OUR BORDERS AND IT IS TOUGH, AS I SAID, NO BETRAYAL OF AMERICAN WORKERS HAS BEEN WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S PURSUIT OF OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT EVERYONE TO COME IN AND COMING UP BY THE THOUSANDS AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, OUR BORDER PATROL, LAW ENFORCEMENT I.C.E. AND APPREHENDING 34, 50000 PEOPLE AT TIMES JUST IN SHORT PERIODS OF TIMES. IF YOU DON'T RELEASE THEM THEY ARREST YOU. THEY ARREST PEOPLE WORKING IN LAWN FOR SMITH AND IT'S A DISGRACE. DEMOCRATS BACKED POLICIES HAVE LEFT OUR BORDERS OVERRUN ARE DETENTION FACILITIES OVERWHELMED AS FAST AS WE BUILD THEM THEY FILL UP AND OUR HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC RESOURCES OVERBURDENED IN OUR COUNTRY IS FULL AND WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE COMING UP HERE IN OUR COUNTRY IS FULL. WE WANT MEXICO TO STOP. WE WANT ALL OF THEM TO STOP. OUR COUNTRIES IS PACKED TO THE GILLS AND WE DON'T WANT THEM COMING UP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS CLAIM TO TAKE AIR OF THE POOR AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT IT IS NOT HAPPENING THAT WAY. THE POOR ARE BEING HURT, MIDDLE INCOME ARE BEING HURT AND WE WOULD LOSE OUR BUSINESSES AND WE WOULD LOSE EVERYTHING IF WE GO WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE THAT OUR RUNNING FOR OFFICE. YOU SAW THAT IN LAST NIGHT I WATCHED ALFRED E NEWMAN , [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS GOING ON WITH FOX? WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR? PUTTING MORE DEMOCRATS ON THEN YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS AND IT'S SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON SOMETHING VERY STRANGE. DID YOU SEE THE SKY LAST NIGHT? YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO WATCH THE COMPETITION IF YOU CALL IT THAT. HE WAS KNOCKING THE HELL OUT OF FOX AND IF SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO DISPLAY THE FOX DEAL TO ME. DEMOCRATS EVEN WANT TO GIVE WELFARE AND FREE HEALTHCARE TO ANYONE WHO CROSSES OUR BORDER AND THEY WANT FREE HEALTHCARE, FREE EDUCATION, FREE ANYTHING. [CROWD BOOS] REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN PEOPLE, OUR CITIZENS. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT IS WHY WE DON'T WANT THEM TO COME. THAT IS WHY MY ADMINISTRATION IS PUBLISHED A NEW RULE TO ENSURE OUR LIMITED SUPPLY OF PUBLIC HOUSING IS SAFEGUARDED FOR LOW INCOME AMERICANS, NOT FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS, WHO ARE FIGHTING TO GET IT. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL SOON TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO ENSURE THE FEDERAL BENEFITS ARE PRESERVED FOR HARD-WORKING CITIZENS WHO NEED THEM THE MOST WE ARE ALSO OUTLINING HISTORIC PRO- AMERICAN IMMIGRATION REFORM AND I MUST TELL YOU SOME OF IT WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS YOU VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND I WILL TELL YOU IT'S NOT VERY FAR AWAY AND YOU WILL HAVE GREAT IMMIGRATION LAWS. AND TO REMEMBER EVEN THREE, FOUR AND THERE'S NO EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER BUT NOW EVERYONE IS ADMITTING, I AGREE THERE'S AN EMERGENCY I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR TWO YEARS AND THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE AND REPUBLICAN POLICIES PROTECT U.S. WORKERS AND DEMOCRAT POLICIES PROTECT SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS AND EVEN CRIMINAL ALIENS. DRUG DEALERS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE DRUGS WERE CAPTURING THEM AND WE DON'T LET THEM GO. WE CAPTURE THEM AND WE DO IT VERY SADLY IT'S ALMOST LIKE ROUTINE BUT YOU HAVE DRUG DEALERS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND MAKING OUR PEOPLE SICK AND WE ARE CAPTURING AND JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THINGS VERY CITY OF PHILADELPHIA THEY DELETED UP ILLEGAL ALIEN AFTER IT WAS RELEASED CRIMINAL ALIEN RAPED A YOUNG CHILD FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS AND WE ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR POLICE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE WE WANT TO THEM TO BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, EITHER WAY THE WAY THEY ARE WORKING AND I HOPE THE CAMERAS GET TO SEE THIS AND USUALLY THEY WILL SHOW FOR PEOPLE BEHIND ME AND PEOPLE WILL SAY WHAT THE LARGE CROWD AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY CAN TELL BY THE CHEERING. YOU KNOW, SOUNDS LIKE A BIG FOOTBALL AND. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY DON'T LIKE TO SHOW THE CROWD AND I'LL HAVE TO TELL THEM IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR TELEVISION TO SHOW THE GROUND AND THERE IS THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE THAT WILL BE FAMOUS TOMORROW THEY HAVE LOUSY SEATS NIGHT AND THE ISSUE OF THE DEMOCRATS PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN FURTHER OUTSIDE FROM THE MAINSTREAM THEY'VE GONE NUTS MORE THAN IN 20 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS TOTAL GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE. TELL ME, MANY OF YOU HAVE PHENOMENAL HEALTHCARE AND PRIVATE HEALTHCARE AND HUNDRED 80 MILLION PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOU AND WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE AND TAKE IT AWAY. IMMIGRANTS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, KILLING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND RADICAL SOCIALISM. [CROWD BOOS] THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY THAT AMERICAN ONES. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER AND THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WITH EVERY DAY WE MAKE GOOD ON OUR MOTTO PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT AND WE KEPT MORE PROMISES AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE BETWEEN REGULATION AND TAXES AND WRITE TO TRY AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT TO TRY IS? YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE BUT NOW WE CAN GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE GREAT RESEARCH WE HAVE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND A LOT OF GREAT THINGS A LOT OF GREAT THINGS HAPPENING WITH RIGHT TO TRY. WE PASSED THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE ELIMINATED 30000 PAGES OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL REGISTER AND THAT'S AN ALL-TIME RECORD. I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED STATES AND THOUGHT I WOULD BE HIT HARDER ON THIS ONE AND I WASN'T. FROM THE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS JOBS KILLING PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH WOULD HAVE COST A FORTUNE AND WOULD HAVE HEARD OUR COUNTRY HORRIBLY. WE WILL NEVER ALLOW FOREIGN BUREAUCRATS AND COUNTRIES TO TRAMPLE ON OUR SOVEREIGNTY OR TO SHUT DOWN OUR JOBS WHICH IS WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE DONE. EVERY DEMOCRAT WANTS TO OPEN BY COMPLETING THE CALL AND BY CRIPPLING YOUR NOW ONCE AGAIN GREAT STEEL INDUSTRY, YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY IS GREAT. IF YOU WANT AMERICAN ENERGY YOU HAVE TO GO . AND BRETT CAVANAGH. TWO GREAT JUSTICES. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE GREAT. WE LAUNCHED A HISTORIC INITIATIVE TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 51 YEARS, DRUG PRICES WENT DOWN. THE FIRST TIME IN 51 YEARS. WE WILL BRING THAT WAY DOWN WE PASSED THE VETERANS CHOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO GIVE THEM THE CARE AND CHOICE THAT THEY DESERVE FOR 45 YEARS. RECORD-SETTING INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING MORE THAN $70 MILLION TO BUILD SUBMARINE PROPELLERS AT THE NAVAL SHIPYARD IN A PLACE CALLED PHILADELPHIA.

THEY WERE SPINE ON OUR CAMPAIGN AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. IF THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE OTHER SIDE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER TWO YEARS AGO AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TREASON AND CALLED IT TREASON AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

AMERICA IS DRIVING, OPTIMISM IS BOOMING AND OUR PEOPLE ARE PROSPERING AND OUR COUNTRY IS WINNING AGAIN. WINNING, WINNING, WINNING AGAIN WE ARE WINNING LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND DOING GREAT AND RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. THEY WEREN'T SO RESPECTFUL FOR A LONG NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THEY RESPECT US AGAIN AS A COUNTRY AND AMERICA'S ECONOMY , IT IS NOW THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND SINCE THE ELECTION WE'VE ADDED 6 MILLION JOBS INCLUDING HALF A MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS. REMEMBER? YOU NEVER BE ABLE AND PAST ADMINISTRATIONS AND YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND WILL BE HAVE 500,000 ALREADY ADDED IN A LOT COMING BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES MOVING IN AND A LOT OF MANUFACTURER JOBS. THEY SAID THAT CANNOT BE DONE BUT WE DID IT VERY EASILY AND HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. NEARLY 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD STAMPS AND WE ARE GETTING AMERICANS OFF OF WELFARE AND BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW AT THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 31 YEARS. THINK OF THAT. IT WILL SOON BE BREAKING THAT RECORD AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN-AMERICAN ON EMPLOYMENT OF ALL REACHED THE LOWEST RATES EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. [APPLAUSE] WAGES ARE RISING AND THEY ARE GROWING FAST WHICH MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. LISTEN TO THIS ONE. FAST IS PROPORTIONATELY FOR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. IT'S GREAT. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE DOING THE BEST. OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO HIRE WORKERS AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN A DECADE WITH THE GREATEST GAINS FOR WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDWEST. DID YOU KNOW THAT? YOU HAD THE GREATEST GAINS ANYPLACE IN THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE LAST ADMINISTRATION DELIVERED LOW WAGES, ECONOMIC STAGNATION AND RAMPANT OFF SHORING, COUNTRIES DO NOT RESPECT WHAT WE WERE ALL ABOUT. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY AND TOOK OUR JOBS AND TOOK OUR BUSINESSES AND TOOK EVERYTHING AND ALL COMING BACK AND COMING BACK VERY FAST. [APPLAUSE] WE'VE TURNED IT ALL AROUND WITH JOBS AND WEALTH THEY ARE NOW GOING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY AT HEART OF OUR ECONOMIC REVIVAL IS THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST TAX CUTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IN THE VILLAGE WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE WORST THING IN OBAMACARE WHERE YOU PAID A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT PAYING FOR HORRIBLE HEALTHCARE. VERY UNPOPULAR, GOT RID OF IT. I GOT RID OF IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ALSO GOT A THING CALLED THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IN ALASKA AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITES BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TRYING TO GET IT TO RONALD REAGAN AND NOT ABLE TO GET IT BUT WE GOT IT APPROVED AND IT'S DONE AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. [APPLAUSE] WE ELIMINATED THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX ON SMALL FARMS AND RANCHES AND BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEM IN THE FAMILY. IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY BUT IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN WHAT I JUST GOT YOU DOES NOT MEAN A DAMN THING. DON'T BOTHER. ONLY GET IT IF YOU LOVE THEM. GIVE IT TO CHARITY INSTEAD. THE HELL WITH THE KIDS. [LAUGHTER] ISN'T IT A BIT THING? SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOSING AND THEY WANT TO LEAVE THE FARM OR RANCH OR BUSINESS AND WANT TO LEAVE IT AND THEY WANT TO LEAVE IT TO THEIR CHILDREN BUT CANNOT DO IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LEFT IN IT HAVE TO BORROW A FORTUNE TO PAY THE TAXES SO NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE TAXES. CHILDREN, CONGRATULATIONS, PARENTS, CANNOT BE AROUND TO WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH ANYMORE. CONGRATULATIONS. WE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOBS KILLING REGULATIONS AND NO ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER CUT REGULATIONS LIKE THAT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAGED A REGULATORY ASSAULT ON THE AMERICAN FARMERS AND YOU KNOW THAT. THAT WAS AN ASSAULT, AND INVASION IN THOSE DAYS ARE OVER AND THOSE REGULATIONS ARE NOW GONE. WE'VE ALSO ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. [APPLAUSE] LAST YEAR WE EXPORTED A RECORD AMOUNT OF ETHANOL. DOES EVERYONE LIKE ETHANOL? [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IN IOWA AND NEBRASKA AND OTHER PLACES WITH ETHANOL. WE ARE UNDOING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES AND REVERSING EIGHT PAINFUL YEARS OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER. WE HAVE SURRENDERED BUT WERE NOT SURRENDERING IF YOU READ THE PAPERS ALTHOUGH MUCH OF IT IS BIG NEWS BUT THAT IS OKAY. YOU GET THE GIST OF IT. NO SURRENDER AND WE JUST DID A WONDERFUL DEAL ON THE BORDER WITH MEXICO AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN DOING A JOB WITH CHINA AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH CHINA AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WE JUST OPEN UP JAPAN FOR CATTLE AND DIFFERENT THINGS IN JAPAN THE MARKET WAS TOTALLY CLOSED BUT WE OPENED AND I WE HAVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES OPENING UP AND IF YOU LOOK AT CANADA WERE CHARGING 285% FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS OR MATERIALS OF 285% BUT NO ONE KNEW THAT BUT WE KNEW THAT AND ESSENTIALLY THAT'S A BARRIER FOR ME NOT TO DOWN AND AGAIN WE GOT THE U.S. MCA THAT WILL BE FANTASTIC AND GOT TO GET IT APPROVED SO CALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WANT TO VOTE BECAUSE IT WILL BE PHENOMENAL FOR YOUR STATE AND PHENOMENAL FOR THE FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS AND FRIENDLY, FOR THE UNIONS AND GREAT FOR EVERYBODY IN THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH FOREIGN ASIANS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION AND NOT ONLY THE PREVIOUS MINISTRATION FOR MANY ADMINISTRATIONS BEFORE THEM ALLOWED FOREIGN NATIONS TO PLUNDER OUR COUNTRY, STEAL OUR JOBS AND TO TAKE OUR WEALTH AND IT'S ALL COMING BACK. DID YOU NOTICE? IT'S ALL COMING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ENDING THE RAMPANT THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS, KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS TO AMERICAN FARMERS AND OPENING BRAND-NEW MARKETS FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE. BUT DESPITE OUR AMAZING SUCCESS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN ANGRIER. THEY ARE SO ANGRY. DID YOU EVER SEE A PEOPLE SO ANGRY? FOR WHAT? THESE ARE ANGRY PEOPLE. EVERY DAY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNHINGED AND MORE AND MORE EXTREME. THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. DO YOU LOVE IT? [APPLAUSE] THEY CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT EVERYDAY. THEY WAITED FOR THE MUELLER REPORT AND THEY WERE WAITING AND I WAS THERE GUIDE AND YOUR 18 ANGRY DEMOCRATS ALL DEMOCRATS MANY OF THEM CONTRIBUTED TO CROOKED HILLARY AND THESE WERE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE LOOKING AT ME WITH NO COLLUSION AND HAD NO COLLUSION BUT LEADING TO NO OBSTRUCTION, NO NOTHING AND NOW THEY SAY CAN WE HAVE A DO OVER? KNOW. WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM A DO OVER. THEY ARE PLAYING GAMES. MORE THAN 100 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SIGNED UP FOR THE BERNIE SANDERS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE. WE HAVE 180 MILLION AMERICANS HAVING GREAT PRIVATE HEALTHCARE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT WOULD ALL BE TAKEN AWAY. DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT THE 100 TRILLION-DOLLAR GREEN NEW DEAL, HOW ABOUT THAT BEAUTY? GREEN NEW DEAL. [CROWD BOOS] CONCEIVED AND MADE UP BY A YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS , WELL, LET'S SEE HOW SHE WORKS OUT. [LAUGHTER] IT WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S NOT BAD. [LAUGHTER] THEY THINK THEY CAN DO IT FOR 100 TRILLION BUT ACCORDING TO IF YOU GO BY THAT RULE EVERY SINGLE BILL BUILDING IN YORK WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED DOWN AND REBUILT AS A DIFFERENT BUILDING. BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK YOU WOULD NOT HAVE WINDOWS. WOULD ANYONE LIKE THAT? A BUILDING WITHOUT WINDOWS. I THINK THAT WILL BE PRETTY. GREEN NEW DEAL. REAL PRETTY. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO GO TO STRONG TONIGHT. WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I WANT TO RUN AGAINST THEM SO BADLY. LIKE THEY FLIP THESE POLICIES SO QUICKLY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S TRUE. BASED UPON THESE POLICIES SO QUICKLY. EVERYBODY FORGETS THAT YOU GO FROM ONE THING FOR A LIFETIME AND FLIP AND GO TO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THE OPPOSITE AND THEN THEY FLIP BACK BUT DEPENDS ON WHICH RACE THEY ARE RUNNING IN BUT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS REALLY NOW THE SOCIALIST PARTY AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE MAINSTREAM. TOTALLY OUT OF TOUCH. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS WHICH BRINGS CRIME, DRUGS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY NOW SUPPORTS TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTION RIGHT UP UNTIL BIRTH AND HOW ABOUT IN VIRGINIA? WERE NOT TALKING UP UNTIL BIRTH BUT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA SAID AFTER BIRTH. THE BABY IS BORN AND YOU GENTLY WRAP THE BABY AND THEN YOU TALK TO THE MOTHER AND MAYBE THE FATHER AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL EXECUTE THE BABY. THIS BABY IS BORN. THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY LIFE IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. YOU BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE. THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU. BUSINESSES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY, TAXES WILL BE QUADRUPLED, BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE. VERY SERIOUS THING HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. WE NEVER DONE BETTER AND IT'S REALLY EASY AS A SOCIALIST TO SAY WHEN YOU DO WELL LET'S DO THIS AND WILL TAKE THIS AND GIVE YOU FREE THIS BUT NOTHING IS FREE. YOU ARE PAYING FOR. THERE IS NOTHING FREE. THEY WILL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY WILL BE ANOTHER VENEZUELA. THAT COUNTRY WAS REALLY WEALTHY 15 YEARS AGO BUT HAVE DESTROYED THAT COUNTRY AND I LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY. WERE STUDYING VENEZUELA AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT COUNTRY IS BEYOND BELIEF, TRULY A WEALTHY COUNTRY AND THEY DON'T HAVE WATER THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD. THEY DON'T HAVE HOSPITALS AND IT'S INCREDIBLE. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO US. THAT IS WHY I PASSED CONGRESS IN ONE CASE IN IT SO IMPORTANT TO PROHIBIT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE JUST CAN'T HAVE BUT WANT TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. WE HAVE TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] EVEN A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AGREE WITH US ON THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH US ON THAT. THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO USE TAXPAYER HARD EARNED DOLLARS TO SUBSIDIZE THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] NOWHERE HAVE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECOME MORE DANGEROUS OR MORE RADICAL THAN ON BORDER SECURITY. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG. BUT THEY DO THIS AND THINK IT'S GOOD POLITICALLY BUT I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE POLITICALLY. THEY ARE HURTING THEMSELVES POLITICALLY? RIGHT NOW MEXICO IS DOING MORE FOR BORDER SECURITY THAN THE DEMOCRATS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS WHAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE BORDER IN MEXICO. I WANT TO THANK MEXICO. THE TARIFFS WERE IMPORTANT BUT THEY STEPPED UP AFTER MANY YEARS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND THE PRESIDENT IS A GREAT GENTLEMAN AND WE HAD A GREAT TALK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND MET WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND WE HAVE THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE AND WE GOT THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. IT WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WERE BUILDING A WALL THAT IS STARTING OR STARTED A WHILE AGO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY NEXT YEAR AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL HAVE CLOSE TO 500 MILES OF WALL BUT NOW ARE BEING SUED BY EVERYBODY BUT DID YOU SEE WE WON THE LAWSUIT LAST WEEK? WE WANT A BIG LAWSUIT ON THE WALL. WE WON A LAWSUIT ON THE WALL, KIM, HOW ABOUT THAT? I CELEBRATE ALL NIGHT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN WENT BACK TO WORK. THIS REALLY IS THE DEFINING ISSUE OF 2020. WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION DEMOCRATS NO LONGER REPRESENT AMERICAN CITIZENS. WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS IS ABOUT FOUR TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS AND ALL EQUALS A MASSIVE COST AND EQUALS MASSIVE CRIME AND IT EQUALS THINGS THAT NOBODY CAN BELIEVE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE PROBLEMS WITH DISEASE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE SAY DON'T SAY THAT, THAT'S NOT NICE BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE BUT THE DISEASE AND THE PROBLEMS COMING IN AND IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION. CALIFORNIA WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY AND THEY WILL END UP QUADRUPLING IN SIZE IN TWO MONTHS IF THEY DON'T BE CAREFUL. IT'S CRAZY WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHAT'S HAPPENING FOLKS, IS CRAZY. WE WILL BRING IT BACK IN THE PARTY BROUGHT BACK TO RATIONALITY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SANCTUARY CITY'S AND LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS , THEY WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E. I.C.E. IS THE ONE THAT GOES IN AND THEY GO IN AND THEY WILL ATTACK SOME OF THE WORST CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD LIKE MS 13 AND CHOP PEOPLE UP AND CUT PEOPLE DOWN AND LIKE NICE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE PAINFUL THAN A BULLET. BUT THEY HAVE DONE TO YOUNG WOMEN AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TWO MEN AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO EVERYBODY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE AND TO THEM IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUGHER AND STRONGER AND PATRIOTS BUT THEY ARE MENTALLY GREAT AND THEY WILL GO AGAINST SOME REAL DEVIANCE AND TAKING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND BRING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS AND GETTING THEM OUT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WE WILL NOT HAVE IT. IOWA WILL NOT HAVE IT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FALL FOR THAT BUT I WANT TO SAY I.C.E. AND THE BORDER PATROL , BORDER PATROL HAS APPREHENDED OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS NOT THE BIGGEST IN 15, 16, 17 YEARS THEY ARE APPREHENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A MONTH BUT NOW THAT SHOULD START SLOWING DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE MEXICO'S SENDING 6000 TROOPS TO THE BORDER AND NO ONE THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT IT'S A GREAT THING THAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO WORK AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO RUN AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR SAFE FAMILY, SAFE COMMUNITIES AND STRONG BORDERS. WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO OUR COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND COME IN THROUGH MARRIAGE. WE WANT PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP US AND HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MARRIAGE SO WE WILL PROBABLY GET THAT AT SOME POINT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE THAT FAR INTO THE FUTURE. WE BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE JOINED IN HONOR TONIGHT TO BE WITH A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN, ANGEL MOM, I LOVE ANGEL MOMS. GREAT PEOPLE. THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN SO HORRIBLY HURT BUT MICHELLE IS A SPECIAL WOMAN WHOSE PRECIOUS, BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, SARAH, WAS KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN ONE DAY AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH A 4.0 GPA, THE HIGHEST MARKS YOU CAN GET FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT WAS THE HIGHEST , HIGHEST MARKS, NUMBER ONE STUDENT IN THE CLASS. PLEASE, COME UP. PLEASE, COME UP. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MICHELLE. [APPLAUSE] A GREAT WOMAN. AN EVEN GREATER MAN. THIS MAN GAVE US A VOICE. ANGEL FAMILIES A VOICE. NO OTHER PRESIDENT WOULD HEAR OUR STORY. I WAS FORTUNATE IF YOU WANT TO SAY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM IN THE RUNNING TO BECOME OUR PRESIDENT. A LOT OF OTHER ANGEL FAMILIES DID NOT HAVE THAT VOICE. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT VOICE FOR SARAH. SHE WAS KILLED JANUARY 31, 2016 WITH IN ONE DAY OF GRADUATING WITH A BACHELOR'S AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, 4.0 AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. HER KILLER WAS ECKSTEIN YEARS OLD WHEN HE CAME ACROSS THE BORDER UNACCOMPANIED ILLEGALLY AND HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER AT AGE 19 AND HAD A BLOOD ALCOHOL OF POINT TO 41, STREET RACING, HIT THE BACK OF MY DAUGHTERS SUV THAT WAS STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT GOING 70 PLUS MILES AN HOUR. MY DAUGHTER DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE. I DO NOT , THE REASON I SPEAK OUT IS I DON'T GET SARAH BACK AT THE END OF THE DAY. I SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS HAPPENING TO ANY OF YOU. OUR WONDERFUL PRESIDENT STANDS BY US AND DOES EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO HELP US BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ANOTHER FAMILY GO THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH. I THANK HIM FOR THAT AND PROUD OF HIM FOR STANDING AS STRONG AS HE HAS AGAINST THE OPPOSITION HE HAS TO FACE DAILY. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. SO IS MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. [APPLAUSE] YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIRL IS LOOKING DOWN AT YOU RIGHT NOW AND SAY I'M PROUD OF MY MOM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] GOTTEN TO KNOW A LOT OF ANGEL MOMS AND DADS AND FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY ARE GONE THROUGH IS INCREDIBLE. FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. WE PROMISE TO ALWAYS REMEMBER SARAH AND FIGHT IN HER MEMORY TO PROTECT AMERICA'S CHILDREN. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR BEING MY FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. A LOT OF FRIENDS. A LOT OF FRIENDS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THE ANGEL MOMS ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH, I CANNOT IMAGINE. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION NOT ONLY THREATENS PUBLIC SAFETY BUT DRAINS THE PUBLIC TREASURY AND OVERCROWDING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND DEPLETING THE RESOURCES LOW INCOME AMERICANS DEPEND ON. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO GET FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHEN IT SHOULD VERY WELL BE USED ALL OF THAT MONEY TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND HOSPITALIZATION AND MEDICAL FOR THE RISING NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK BY WALKING DOWN THE STREET. GETTING ACTUALLY SICK INCLUDING POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE INCREDIBLE. THE JOB ARE LAW-ENFORCEMENT DOES IS INCREDIBLE. [APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS FOR THE NEED OF ILLEGAL ALIENS BEFORE AND REPUBLICANS BELIEVE YOU MUST ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF OUR CITIZENS FIRST. WE HAVE THAT OBLIGATION. MY ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A RULE TO ENSURE THAT OUR LIMITED SUPPLY OF PUBLIC HOUSING IS USED FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW OUR LAWS, NOT THOSE WHO BREAK THEM. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROVISIONS , [APPLAUSE] THAT SAY THE WRONG PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE IN THIS VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT BUILDS AND WE WILL FINISH THE WALL, IT'S HAPPENING, IT'S GOING UP QUICKLY AS I SAID AND WERE PROUD OF WHAT WERE DOING. WERE DOING A LOT MORE THAN WERE BEING FOUGHT AT EVERY CORNER, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO IT'S A LAWSUIT OR ANOTHER LAWSUIT AND ANOTHER LAWSUIT BUT THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT ALMOST EVERY DEMOCRAT JUST A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WANTED A WALL AND IT DID NOT GO BUILT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO BUILD IT BUT THEY WANTED A WALL. THEY GAVE IT UP IN ONE CASE AND HAD THEM ALL SET AND GAVE IT BACK. A YEAR LATER OR TWO YEARS LATER BUT HE WANTED A WALL AND WITHOUT THAT IT'S JUST A VERY TOUGH SITUATION ALTHOUGH NOW I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP GREATLY BUT EVERY DAY ITS PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT AND THAT'S A GREAT BIG OBLIGATION. VERY BIG OBLIGATION. THANKS TO ALL HER BOLD INITIATIVE TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY WENT DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] WE PASSED IN THE VA WE PASSED THE A CHOICE, YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING? THEY GET IN LINE AND WAIT FOR SEVEN DAYS AND THINK OF YOURSELVES, YOU ARE ALL SPOILED PEOPLE. IF YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR TWO HOURS YOU'D BE ANGRY AT THE DOCTOR. RIGHT? THEY WAIT FOR SEVEN DAYS. THEY WAIT FOR 12 DAYS OR TWO MONTHS AND THEN THERE BE A LINE FOREVER AND SOMETIMES THEY BE UP THERE WITH A VERY SMALL PROBLEM AND END UP BEING TERMINALLY ILL BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO A DOCTOR. WE PASSED CHOICES SO THEY HAVE A CHOICE. IF THEY HAD A WEIGHT THEY GO OUTSIDE AND GO TO A LOCAL DOCTOR PAY FOR THE DOCTOR AND OUR VETERANS FOR TAKING CARE OF BUT THE CRAZY THING IS WE SAVE MONEY I DOING THAT BUT WE SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND EVERYBODY IS HAPPY ABOUT IT IN FOR 44 YEARS TO BE TRYING TO GET PAST AND I GOT A PASS. MY INITIATION AND A PROUD OF EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON IT AND WE PASSED ALSO ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS 45 YEARS, BA ACCOUNT ABILITY. BA ACCOUNT ABILITY. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE WHO WANTED THE VA TO BE SADISTIC AND HORRIBLE THINGS TO OUR DEBTS WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN PRIME TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HAVE LASTED I SECOND BUT THEY WERE SADISTIC AND THE THIEVES AND ROBBING PEOPLE AND HURTING PEOPLE, OUR THAT'S. YOU CANNOT FIRE THEM. WE PASSED THROUGH THE REPUBLIC AND SENATE AND WE GOT IT DONE. WE GOT IT ALL DONE. VA ACCOUNT ABILITY TO BE A CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNT ABILITY AND I LOOK AT WHOEVER CAN TAKE ME AND SAY YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT. YOU'RE FIRED. GET OUT. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S A BIG THING. HAVING PEOPLE THEY HAD ONE CASE WHERE SOMEONE STOLE A HALF-MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE GUILTY AND YOU CANNOT FIRE THEM. THEY COULD PROSECUTE THEM BUT CANNOT FIRE THEM. IT'S LIKE IMPOSSIBLE TO , BRINKLEY, TO DEAL WITH UNIONS AND CIVIL SERVICE AND IT'S NOT AS EASY AS I SAY BUT 45 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE BUT WE CHANGE THAT ONE IN 44 YEARS FOR CHOICE WE CHANGE THAT ONE SO DONE A GREAT JOB FOR THE VETERANS AND DOING A THIS IN THE JOB AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEM. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 107 FEDERAL JUDGES RIGHT NOW AS I SPEAK AND WE SHOULD BE UP QUICKLY TO 145 AND THAT INCLUDES TWO OUTSTANDING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, NEIL GORSUCH AN BRETT KAVANAUGH. BIG THING. [APPLAUSE] 145 OF THE FEDERAL JUDGES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND WERE GETTING THEM APPROVED VERY QUICKLY FOR UP TO 107 BUT NO ONE WOULD'VE BELIEVED US. I SIGNED IN ORDER TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING? WERE SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE TO BIG TECH DO NOT CENSOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CENSORING CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] AT OUR URGING WE ARE FINALLY SEEING MORE ATTENTION PAID TO THE NEED FOR BETTER FOREST MANAGEMENT AND I MENTIONED THE TERM WHEN I WAS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE WORST FOREST FIRES ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN ONE PARTICULAR AREA SO GREAT, PEOPLE SO GREAT BUT IT WAS LIKE A BLOWTORCH, 84-MILE AN HOUR WINDS AND THIS WAS THE STEEL FOR THE FEW HOUSES THAT HAD STEEL STRUCTURE IT WAS NOTED NOTED. IT WAS NOTED. HE NEVER FOUND THE PEOPLE IN IT WAS TOTAL CONSIDERATION AND I SAID YOU NEED FOREST MANAGEMENT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY SMILED AND LAUGHED AND TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT. THEY HAVE 15, 20 YEARS OF DEBRIS PILED UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE FOREST AND IT WAS SO DRY LIKE A BONE THAT IF YOU TOUCH IT WITH EVEN A CIGARETTE IT LIGHTS 100,000, 200,000 ACRES AND NOW THEY AGREE WITH ME AND CLEANING UP THE FOREST AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE IT BUT THEY'VE NOT DONE ENOUGH WORK AT BUT IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. OTHER PEOPLE COME TO ME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND SAY, SIR, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE FORCE. WE LIVE IN A FOREST NATION AND WE ARE A FOREST NATION AND VERY INTERESTING. FINLAND, AUSTRIA, OTHERS THEY ARE IN A FOREST NATION THEY SAY. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR FORESTS. WE DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THOSE TREES WHEN THEY FALL BECAUSE WITHIN 18 MONTHS THERE LITERALLY LIKE A MATCH. WE WERE NOT DOING THAT IN FACT ENVIRONMENTALLY THEY DO NOT WANT US TO TOUCH THOSE AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL, LET THEM LAY ON THE GROUND BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NOW YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON THAT WHOLE SUBJECT FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AND YOU'LL SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. AS WE RESTORE AMERICAN STRENGTH AT HOME WE ARE ALSO RESTORING AMERICAN POWER ABROAD AND THE EIGHT-YEAR APOLOGY TO HER IS OVER. WE DON'T APOLOGIZE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. WE STAND UP FOR AMERICA. WE NOW STAND UP FOR OUR COUNTRY AND HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY. WE HAVE A GREAT RATE COUNTRY AND STAND UP FOR IT. IN A CHANGE FROM THE PAST WE ARE PURSUING OUR INTEREST WITHOUT GETTING OUR NATION BOGGED DOWN IN ANALYST, COSTLY FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS AND THAT MAY CHANGE AND THERE ARE SOME BAD THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED LONG BEFORE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND MAYBE LONG BEFORE THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA AND IRAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER PLACES BUT I DO BELIEVE WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL AND DO BELIEVE WE HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD BE DONE SO MUCH EASIER IF IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO BUT THEY NEVER GOT IT DONE AND NEVER DID IT AND SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT WILL TAKE CARE OF IT FOR YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANKS TO THE SKILL AND TREMENDOUS COURAGE OF OUR BRAVE WARRIORS AND THEIR ALLIES, PHTHISIS CALIPHATE HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETELY DECIMATED IN SYRIA. WE HAVE DONE THAT. [APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THESE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE AND THESE ARE REALLY CRAZY, SICK PEOPLE. WHEN I SAY IT'S DONE NOTHING IS NEVER DONE BUT WE TAKE IT BACK ALL THE LAND, ONE 100% OF THE LAND AND WHEN I TOOK OVER IT WAS SHOWN IN RED AND WAS A SEA OF RED AND EVERY MONTH IT WAS LESS AND LESS AND AS YOU SAW TWO MONTHS AGO COMPLETED THAT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T WALK INTO A STORE WITH A BOMB AND BLOW UP A STORE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE STONE COLD CRAZY. NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD AT ALL. I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION GAVE 150 BILLION DOLLARS TO IRAN AND THEY GAVE 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. THINK OF THAT, 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. CASH. DON'T OVER IN AIRPLANES AND MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CASH AND NO ONE HAS SEEN A BILLION IN CASH. THEY DID NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH AMERICAN MONEY IN OUR TRI-STATE AREA NEXT TO WASHINGTON WITH ALL HOW BIG IT IS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SO THEY HAD TO GET MONEY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO BRING IT IN CASH AND GIVE THEM 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. WE GOT NOTHING. WE GOT A BAD DEAL, THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. WE ENDED THE DEAL AND WHEN THEY SIGNED THE DEAL THEY WERE SCREAMING DEATH TO AMERICA. DO YOU REMEMBER? THEY DON'T TALK THAT WAY ANYMORE. THEY BETTER NOT BE TALKING THAT WAY ANYMORE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AFTER DECADES OF BROKEN PROMISES WE OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE PROMISED WE WILL OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND THEY CAMPAIGNED AND NEVER DID IT. BUT I DID IT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THE UNITED STATES ACKNOWLEDGED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, BIG THING. BIG, BIG THING. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS AND MANY PRESIDENTS THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT BUT THEY NEVER DID. I DID IT AND IT WAS JUST FINE. GREAT THING FOR ISRAEL. IT'S A GREAT THING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT YOU NEED THE GOLAN HEIGHTS FOR SECURITY AND PROPER SECURITY AND WE GOT IT DONE. THE OVERWHELMINGLY MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THEIR LOGIN AGENDA OF PORTABLE CARE, SAFE JOB, LOW TAXES AND SECURE BORDERS. VERY SIMPLE. VERY SIMPLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN THIS ROOM BUT ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY OPPOSED THE DEMOCRAT PLATFORM OF MASS MIGRATION, HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, LATE-TERM ABORTION AND LATER THAN LATE-TERM ABORTION HOAXES AND DELUSIONS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AMERICAN WORKER, AMERICAN FARMER AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT DEARLY OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. WE BELIEVE ALL AMERICANS SHARE ONE MAGNIFICENT DESTINY AS ONE TEAM, ONE PEOPLE IN ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. [APPLAUSE] WE FIGHT ON BEHALF OF HARD-WORKING CITIZENS WHO POUR OUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL AND SWEAT EVERY DAY TO EARN A LIVING AND TAKE YOUR OTHER FAMILY AND PAY THEIR TAXES, FOLLOW OUR LAWS, RAISE THEIR CHILDREN AND SAFEGUARD THE VALUES THAT MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION EVER TO EXIST ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. [APPLAUSE] AND IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER IN ALMOST ALWAYS THEN IT'S EVER DONE BEFORE. YOU LOOK AT OUR ECONOMY AND LOOK AT OUR MILITARY AND LOOK AT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE AND IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND YOU WORK HARD AND YOU WORK SMART AND WORK HONESTLY AND WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THIS LAND IS YOUR HOME. THESE AMERICAN PATRIOTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO OUR COUNTRY AND NOW THEY ARE FINALLY HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO IS LOYAL TO THEM AND IT'S ABOUT TIME, ISN'T IT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] EVERYDAY FOR THE NEXT 16 MONTHS WE WILL KEEP ON FIGHTING AND KEEP ON WORKING AND WE WILL KEEP ON WINNING. WE WILL WIN IT FOR YOU. WE WILL WIN AGAIN IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] KEEP AMERICA GREAT. AND IN 2020 IOWA WILL ONCE AGAIN BE AT THE CENTER OF THE ACTION, REMEMBER I SAID WILL KEEP IOWA FIRST. REMEMBER THAT? JEFF, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? MAC THAT WAS A BIG MOVE TO MOVE IOWA TO THE BACK OF THE LINE OR CENTER OF THE LINE BUT WE WORKED VERY HARD AND I SAID I WIN. WE ARE KEEPING IT. WERE KEEPING IT RIGHT WHERE IT IS. IT'S ALSO A GREAT TRADITION. WOULDN'T LOOK TERRIBLE IF I WHAT WAS THE 32nd NATION IN THE VOTING LINE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD LOOK TOO GOOD. JEFF, YOU WORKED HARD ON THAT AND I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] RIGHT HERE IN THE HAWKEYE STATE THE BACKYARDS AND LIVING ROOMS AND TOWN HALLS AND FAIRGROUNDS AND DINERS IN COFFEE SHOPS ALL ACROSS THE STATE YOU WILL BE THE ONES TO SHAPE AMERICA'S FUTURE AND YOU HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT STATE POLITICALLY IN A VERY IMPORTANT STATE BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE OFTENTIMES DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS FOR OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST POWERFUL POSITION IN THE WORLD.

CSPANDT18620198	Donald Trump	2019-06-18	President Trump Announces Second Term Run	PRES. TRUMP: WE HAD SUCH LUCK IN ORLANDO. WE LOVE BEING IN ORLANDO. WHAT A TURNOUT. I SAID, THIS IS A VERY BIG ARENA. FOR A TUESDAY NIGHT. I SAID, YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR EMPTY SEATS, THE FAKE NEWS WILL SAY COMMAND IT WILL MAKE HEADLINES THEY WILL , SAY HE DID NOT FILL UP THE ARENA. I SAID, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE A CHANCE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO TO ORLANDO, WE SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT I SAID NO, I THINK WE WILL GO TO ORLANDO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND NOT ONLY DID WE FILL IT UP, BUT WE HAD 120,000 REQUESTS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THAT MEANS YOU FOLKS HAVE COME OUT VERY, VERY GOOD. CONGRATULATIONS. I WANT TO THANK OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE KAREN PENCE AND OUR MAGNIFICENT FIRST LADY MELANIA. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN MY SECOND HOME. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IN MANY CASES I THINK I CAN SAY IT IS MY FIRST HOME, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. IT IS THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. VERY HISTORIC BECAUSE EXACTLY FOUR YEARS AGO THIS WEEK I ANNOUNCED MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE THAN JUST A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT POLITICAL MOVEMENT. IT IS A MOVEMENT MADE UP OF HARD-WORKING PATRIOTS WHO LOVE THEIR COUNTRY, LOVE THEIR FLAG, LOVE THEIR CHILDREN, AND WHO BELIEVED THAT A NATION MUST CARE FOR ITS OWN CITIZENS FIRST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TOGETHER WE STAND DOWN A CORRUPT AND BROKEN POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND WE RESTORED GOVERNMENT BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE. OUR COUNTRY IS NOW THRIVING, PROSPERING, AND BOOMING, AND FRANKLY, IT IS SOARING TO INCREDIBLE NEW HEIGHTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR ECONOMY IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD, PERHAPS THE GREATEST ECONOMY WE HAVE HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THIS TEAM IN PLACE, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS WAY TO GO. OUR FUTURE HAS NEVER LOOKED BRIGHTER OR SHARPER. THE FACT IS, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS BACK, IT IS BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: 2016 WAS NOT MERELY ANOTHER FOUR-YEAR ELECTION. THIS WAS A DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. ASK THEM RIGHT THERE. [LAUGHTER] [BOOING] [CHANTING] PRES. TRUMP: BY THE WAY, THAT IS A LOT OF FAKE NEWS BACK THERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? THE AMOUNT OF PRESS WE HAVE TONIGHT REMINDS ME OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS BEFORE IT GOT POLITICAL AND THEIR RATINGS WENT DOWN THE TUBES. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS WAS OUR CHANCE TO RECLAIM OUR GOVERNMENT FROM A PERMANENT POLITICAL CLASS THAT ENRICHED ITSELF AT YOUR EXPENSE. AS I SAID ON A WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL DAY AT MY INAUGURATION, WE DID NOT MERELY TRANSFER POWER FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER. WE TRANSFERRED POWER BACK TO YOU, THE PROUD CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "USA!"] PRES. TRUMP: WE STARED DOWN THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF LOBBIES, DONORS, SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO MADE A LIVING BLEEDING OUR COUNTRY DRIVE, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE BROKE DOWN THE DOORS OF WASHINGTON BACK ROOMS WHERE DEALS WERE CUT TO CLOSE OUR COMPANIES, GIVE AWAY YOUR JOBS, SHUT DOWN OUR FACTORIES, AND SURRENDER YOUR SOVEREIGNTY AND YOUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. AND WE'V CENDED IT. WE TOOK ON A POLITICAL MACHINE THAT TRIED TO TAKE AWAY YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOTE. THEY TRIED TO TAKE AWAY YOUR DIGNITY AND YOUR DESTINY. BUT WE WILL NEVER LET THEM DO THAT, WILL WE? MANY TIMES I SAID WE WOULD DRAIN THE SWAMP. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. WE ARE DRAINING THE SWAMP. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "DRAIN THE SWAMP!"] PRES. TRUMP: THAT IS WHY THE SWAMP IS FIGHTING BACK SO VICIOUSLY AND VIOLENTLY. FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER SIEGE. AND WITH THE MUELLER REPORT, WE WON, AND NOW THEY WANT A DO-OVER. THEY WANT A DO-OVER. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. THEY WANT A DO-OVER. NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. IT IS SO BAD FOR OUR GREAT COUNTRY. A HOAX. A GREAT HOAX. OUR PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT HAS BEEN UNDER ASSAULT FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY. WE ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS IN THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF A PRESIDENCY AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NO PRESIDENT HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE , BECAUSE WE DID IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT AND ILLEGAL WITCHHUNT, THINGS NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. NOT EVEN CLOSE. NOBODY HAS DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WENT THROUGH THE GREATEST WITCHHUNT IN POLITICAL HISTORY. THE ONLY COLLUSION WAS COMMITTED BY THE DEMOCRATS, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, AND THEIR OPERATIVES, AND THE PEOPLE WHO FUNDED THE PHONY DOSSIER, CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC. IT WAS ALL AN ILLEGAL ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION TO SPY ON OUR CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID, AND SUBVERT OUR DEMOCRACY. REMEMBER, THE INSURANCE POLICY, JUST IN CASE HILLARY CLINTON LOST. REMEMBER THE INSURANCE POLICY. [CHANTING "LOCK HER UP!"] PRES. TRUMP: THEY APPOINTED 18 VERY ANGRY DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO TAKE DOWN OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. AFTER TWO YEARS, 1.4 MILLION PAGES OF DOCUMENTS, 500 SEARCH WARRANTS, 500 WITNESSES, 2800 SUBPOENAS, AND 40 F.B.I. AGENTS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK, WHAT DID THEY COME UP WITH? NO COLLUSION. AND THE FACT THAT LED OUR GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DETERMINE NO OBSTRUCTION. NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION. AND THEY SPENT $40 MILLION ON THIS WITCHHUNT. $40 MILLION. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SPENT $40 MILLION, PROBABLY A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT. THINK ABOUT IT. NOBODY HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP. NOBODY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE CALL IT THE RUSSIAN HOAX. REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAMOUS LINE SECRETLY TILLING THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT TO INFORM VLADIMIR THAT AFTER MY ELECTION, I WILL HAVE MORE -- ABILITY, OK? REMEMBER THAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBERED IT. I SAW IT HAPPEN. I DIDN'T LIKE IT. THEY DON'T BRING IT UP. THE FAKE NEWS WILL NEVER BRING IT UP. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: AND IN SEPTEMBER, JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION, THE F.B.I. TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT POSSIBLE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND HE DID NOTHING BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO WIN. THAT'S WHY HE DID NOTHING. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: HE DID NOTHING. I BUILT UP THE MILITARY, IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, AND PROVIDED ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES FOR ALL OVER EUROPE THAT COMPETED VERY, VERY STRONGLY WITH RUSSIA. WE ARE, BY THE WAY, THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "USA!"] PRES. TRUMP: THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT RUSSIA. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN POLITICAL POWER. THEY WENT AFTER MY FAMILY, MY BUSINESS, MY FINANCES, MY EMPLOYEES, ALMOST EVERYONE I HAVE EVER KNOWN OR WORKED WITH, BUT THEY ARE REALLY GOING AFTER YOU. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT YOU. THEY TRIED TO ERASE YOUR VOTES, ANDERASE YOUR LEGACY OF THE GREATEST CAMPAIGN AND THE GREATEST ELECTION PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THEY WANTED TO DENY YOU THE FUTURE THAT YOU DEMANDED , AND THE FUTURE THAT AMERICA DESERVES, AND THAT NOW, AMERICA IS GETTING. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR RADICAL DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS ARE DRIVEN BY HATRED, PREJUDICE, AND RAGE. THEY WANT TO DESTROY YOU AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AS WE KNOW IT. NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. TO UNDERSTAND DEMOCRATS' RUTHLESS TACTICS, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND OUR COURT SYSTEM NATIONWIDE. I WILL SOON HAVE APPOINTED MY 145TH JUDGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY NICE TO US. HE DIDN'T FILL THE POSITIONS. I GET THERE THE FIRST DAY. HOW MANY JUDGES DO I HAVE TO APPOINT? THEY SAID, "SIR, 139." NOW, IT IS 145. AND WE JUST FINISHED NUMBER 107, ALREADY APPROVED, SITTING ON THE BENCH. HOW ABOUT THAT? [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BY THE TIME WE ARE FINISHED WITH THE REST, WE WILL HAVE A RECORD PERCENTAGE. OUR PERCENTAGE WILL BE A RECORD, EXCEPT FOR ONE PERSON. ONE PERSON HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP. DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT PRESIDENT IS? HE'S GOT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN ME, AND IT'S DEVASTATING. HIS NAME IS GEORGE WASHINGTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: GEORGE IS AT 100% AND THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING TO GET THERE NO MATTER WHAT. I TELL YOU. 100%. WELL, HE WAS FIRST, SO HE JUST APPOINTED THEM ALL AND THAT IS IT. THAT'S GOING TO BE A HARD RECORD TO BEAT. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR JUSTICE. THEY WENT TO FILL THE JUDICIARY WITH HARD LEFT IDEOLOGUES. THEY WANT TO RADICALIZE OUR JUDICIARY. YOU KNOW THAT. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO A GREAT GENTLEMAN, JUSTICE KAVANAGH. HIGHLY RESPECTED. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: THEY DID NOT JUST TRY TO WIN. THEY TRIED TO DESTROY HIM WITH FALSE AND MALICIOUS ACCUSATIONS. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: AND THANK YOU, MARCO, AND THANK YOU LINDSAY, , WHEREVER YOU MAY BE. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. STAND UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS DOING OK IN SOUTH CAROLINA. NOW HE IS THROUGH THE ROOF. THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT PEOPLE, ALL OF THEM. THEY TRIED TO RUIN THE FAMILIES HOME NOW-JUSTICE KAVANAGH. THEY TRIED TO HIS CAREER, THEY TRIED TO RUIN HIS LIFE. THEY EVEN WANTED TO IMPEACH HIM ON FRAUDULENT CHARGES. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: THOSE CHARGES WERE A FRAUD. HE DID NOTHING WRONG. ALL IN PURSUIT OF POLITICAL DOMINATION AND CONTROL. JUST IMAGINE WHAT AN ANGRY LEFT-WING MOB WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: IMAGINE IF WE HAD A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT AND A DEMOCRAT CONGRESS IN 2020. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: THEY WOULD SHUT DOWN YOUR FREE SPEECH, USE THE POWER OF THE LAW TO PUNISH THEIR OPPONENTS WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO DO NOW ANYWAY. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE TRYING TO SHIELD THEMSELVES. THEY WOULD STRIP AMERICANS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHILE FLOODING THE COUNTRY WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE HOPES IT WILL EXPAND THEIR POLITICAL BASE AND THEY WILL GET VOTES SOMEPLACE IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT. [BOOING] [CHANTING "BUILD THAT WALL!"] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER 400 MILES OF WALL BUILT BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. IT IS MOVING RAPIDLY. IT IS MOVING VERY RAPIDLY. YOU KNOW, WE COULD NOT GET THE WALL APPROVED BY THE DEMOCRATS, EVEN THOUGH THEY VOTED FOR IT FOR YEARS AGO, AND IT'S YEARS AGO, AND IT DIDN'T GET BUILT. BUT THEY VOTED FOR IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, TRUMP'S PRESIDENT, WE DON'T WANT A WALL. COULD YOU IMAGINE THOSE CARAVANS WITHOUT HAVING THE BARRIERS AND WALLS WE HAVE ALREADY PUT UP? THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE A MESS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. SO THAT WALL IS MOVING ALONG. I CHANGED THE DESIGN. IT IS STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND CHEAPER. A LOT CHEAPER. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE MONEY, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CHEAPER. IT IS GOING WELL. INSTEAD OF BRINGING US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA, DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPLINTER US INTO FACTIONS AND TRIBES. THEY WANT US DIVIDED. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE REPUBLICANS ANYMORE. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THIS ELECTION IS NOT ONLY A VERDICT ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. IT IS A VERDICT ON THOSE WHO TRIED TO UNDERMINE OUR GREAT DEMOCRACY AND UNDERMINE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: ON JULY 4 IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG DAY. BRING YOUR FLAGS. BRING THOSE FLAGS. BRING THOSE AMERICAN FLAGS. JULY 4. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE AMERICA. SOUNDS GOOD, RIGHT? JULY 4. CELEBRATE AMERICA. THIS ELECTION IS A VERDICT ON WHETHER WE WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO LOSE AN ELECTION REFUSED TO CONCEDE AND SPEND THE NEXT TWO YEARS TRYING TO SHRED OUR CONSTITUTION AND RIP YOUR COUNTRY APART. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: YOU REMEMBER, DURING ONE OF THE DEBATES WHEN CROOKED HILLARY SAID, IF I WIN, ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPORT ME? BUT I MUST BE HONEST. I DID NOT GIVE HER A GREAT ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY HARDEST QUESTION DURING THE DEBATES. ISN'T IT AMAZING THAT IT WORKED THE OTHER WAY AROUND? ISN'T IT AMAZING? [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED, JUST COMPARE HOW THEY CAME AFTER US FOR THREE YEARS WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAD VERSUS THE FREE PASS THEY GAVE TO HILLARY AND HER AIDES AFTER THEY SET UP AN ILLEGAL SERVER, DESTROYED EVIDENCE, DELETED AND ACID WASHED 33,000 EMAILS, EXPOSE D CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, AND TURN STATE DEPARTMENT INTO A PAY THE STATE DEPARTMENT INTO A PAY FOR PLAY CASH MACHINE. [BOOING] [CHANTING "LOCK HER UP!"] PRES. TRUMP: 33,000 EMAILS DELETED! THINK OF IT. I KEEP MENTIONING, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF CORRUPTION ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE SIMPLEST THING, THEY GET A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, AND THEY DECIDE THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT. SO LINDSEY GRAHAM, THEY DELETE AND THEY ACID WASH, WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE, NOBODY DOES IT, THEY ACID WASH THOSE EMAILS. NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. BUT WE MAY FIND THEM SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE MAY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I GOT A SUBPOENA -- THINK OF THIS. IF I GOT A SUBPOENA FOR EMAILS, IF I DELETED ONE EMAIL LIKE A LOVE NOTE TO MELANIA, IT IS THE ELECTRIC CHAIR FOR TRUMP. [LAUGHTER] 33,000 EMAILS. BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE NOW HAVE A GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SO, IF YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN THIS SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL, SHOW UP NOVEMBER 3. THAT IS YOUR DAY, BIG DAY VOTE, . VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG, BIG DAY. [CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS!"] PRES. TRUMP: THANK YOU. REMEMBER, THE ONLY THING THESE CORRUPT POLITICIANS WILL UNDERSTAND IS AN EARTHQUAKE AT THE BALLOT BOX. THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL UNDERSTAND. AND THEY ARE GONNA SEE IT. PRES. TRUMP: WE DID IT ONCE AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. AND THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THE JOB. THIS TIME SHOULD BE A LOT EASIER BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH WITH OUR MILITARY, WITH OUR VETS, WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WITH OUR REGULATIONS, WITH THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY, WITH GETTING RID OF SO MANY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS, SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE OF OBAMACARE. ONE OF THE WORST THINGS ANYBODY EVER HAD TO LIVE THROUGH. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HAPPY THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT PAYING FOR BAD HEALTH INSURANCE? HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HAPPY? BAD HEALTH CARE! [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SO, EVERY TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE OUT A CHECK IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE HEALTH CARE, THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THAT. THIS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY, YOU PAY FOR THE VERY DISTINCT PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO PAY. BUT YOU HAD TO PAY A LOT. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE. YOU DON'T WANT IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT. PRES. TRUMP: THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WE GOT RID OF IT. THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. THE PEOPLE TRYING TO STOP OUR MOVEMENT ARE THE SAME WASHINGTON INSIDERS WHO SPENT THEIR CAREERS RIGGING THE SYSTEM SO YOUR LOSSES WILL BE THEIR GAINS. YOU KNOW THAT. THESE ARE THE SAME CAREER POLITICIANS WHO PRESIDED OVER DECADES OF FLAT WAGES, THE LOSS OF OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS 60,000 , -- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT NUMBER? 60,000. AND YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW IT'S TRUE? BECAUSE, IF I WASN'T -- I HAVE BEEN USING IT A LOT -- THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE HEADLINES, TRUMP IS USING FAKE NUMBERS. IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST STORY. THEY NEVER CORRECTED IT, SO I ASSUME THOSE 60,000 SHUTTERED FACTORIES, WE CLOSED UP 60,000 FACTORIES. IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. AN AVALANCHE OF JOB-KILLING REGULATIONS. ONE RUINOUS TRADE DEAL AFTER ANOTHER. BY THE WAY, THOSE TRADE DEALS ARE GETTING VERY GOOD, FOLKS. YOU'LL SEE. WE JUST COMPLETED A DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. GREAT DEAL. WE ARE WORKING WITH MEXICO, WITH CANADA. WE HAVE TO GET THE DEMOCRATS TO APPROVE IT. WE WANT IT TO BE BIPARTISAN. AS YOU KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE READ A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT CHINA. I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT XI, TERRIFIC PRESIDENT, A GREAT LEADER OF CHINA. I SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING AT LENGTH, AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT WE ARE EITHER GOING TO HAVE A GOOD DEAL, A FAIR DEAL, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A DEAL AT ALL, AND THAT IS OK TOO. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR TREASURY AND COMPANIES ARE LEAVING CHINA BECAUSE THEY WANT TO AVOID PAYING THESE LARGE TARIFFS. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN THE FAKE NEWS TELLS YOU YOU ARE PAYING, IN THE CASE OF CHINA, THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY. THAT HELPS THEM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY ARE DOING? THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING THOSE COMPANIES. AND YOU ARE NOT PAYING VERY MUCH IF YOU ARE PAYING ANYTHING AT ALL, IN THE CASE OF CHINA. AND WE ARE TAKING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN. REMEMBER THIS, AND YOU KNOW IT I AS WELL AS I DO, WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN IN $.10 FROM CHINA. WE WOULD LOSE $500 BILLION A YEAR WITH CHINA. WE REBUILT CHINA. THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB, BUT THEY TOOK US FOR SUCKERS AND THAT INCLUDES OBAMA AND BIDEN. THEY TOOK US FOR SUCKERS. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: $500 BILLION! $500 BILLION. SOMEBODY SAID, YOU MEAN $500 MILLION? THAT IS A LOT TOO. NO, $500 BILLION. IT IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT. I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO SPECIFIC, 507. WE ARE FIGHTING THE SAME POLITICS THAT RAVAGED OUR CITIES . THE SAME PEOPLE WHO THROUGH OPEN HOUR-BY-HOUR -- WHOTHREW OPE -- THE SAME PEOPLE WHO THREW OPEN OUR BORDERS AND ALLOWED DRUGS, GANGS, AND ILLEGAL LABOR TO DEVASTATE OUR POOREST AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW THAT. OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS LOOKED DOWN WITH HATRED ON OUR VALUES AND WITH UTTER DISDAIN FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES THEY WANT TO RUN. THAT'S THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HOW MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I CALLED YOU AND US -- REMEMBER THIS -- THEY CALLED US DEPLORABLES. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. I WILL NEVER FORGET. I WAS MAKING A SPEECH AFTER HILLARY USED THE WORD "DEPLORABLES." I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT BAD. SHE USED ANOTHER WORD. SHE SAID "DEPLORABLES AND IRREDEEMABLES." I THINK THAT WAS WORSE, BUT IT DID NOT GET PICKED UP. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO GET PICKED UP. I THINK "IRREDEEMABLES" IS WORSE THAN "DEPLORABLES." I WAS MAKING A SPEECH THE NEXT DAY. WE HAD A GREAT CROWD AND WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WERE WEARING, WE ARE DEPLORABLES. THE DEPLORABLES LOVE YOU. AND THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WEARING WE ARE DEPLORABLES, AND I SAID, I THINK HILLARY CLINTON MADE A BIG MISTAKE WITH THAT SPEECH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH POLITICS. ONE WORD, AND YOUR CAREER IS RUINED. YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. I HAVE NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO RETURN US TO THE BITTER FAILURES AND BETRAYALS OF THE PAST. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE GOING ON TO VICTORY. GOING ON TO VICTORY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THEY WILL TAKE IT AWAY AS FAST AS IT CAME. AND AS MIKE PENCE SAID A LITTLE WHILE AGO, THAT'S WHY WE WANT A LITTLE MORE TIME. IT IS GOING TO BE CEMENTED. IT IS GOING TO BE CEMENTED. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A BIG DECISION TO MAKE. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY. WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A THEME FOR THE NEW CAMPAIGN. RIGHT? IS IT GOING TO BE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, WHICH IS POSSIBLY THE GREATEST THEME IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS? I THINK. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. MAGA COUNTRY, RIGHT? MAGA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MAGA. WE ARE IN MAGA COUNTRY, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. BUT YOU KNOW, TODAY, WE HAD A MASSIVE DAY ON THE STOCK MARKET. A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. WE HAD A VERY BIG DAY. WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO I THINK OUR 68TH RECORD. WE HAVE HIT ALL-TIME RECORDS -- THIS IS TREMENDOUS. IT IS A LOT. SO NOW I SAY, WE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BUT HOW DO YOU GIVE UP THE NUMBER ONE , CALL THEME, LOGO, STATEMENT, EIGHT IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS FOR A NEW ONE? BUT YOU KNOW, THERE IS ANYONE THAT REALLY WORKS. AND THAT IS CALLED "KEEP AMERICA GREAT." RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: KEEP AMERICA GREAT. IN OTHER WORDS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, WHEN WE HAVE REALLY DONE, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, STILL IN THE PROCESS. WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF OUR VETS. WE HAVE CUT THE HELL OUT OF REGULATIONS. I HAVE CUT MORE REGULATIONS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF THE LENGTH OF THEIR TERM. SO NOW I SAY, -- WE HAVE A LOT OF BRILLIANT TALENT, CAMPAIGN PEOPLE. IT COSTS A FORTUNE AND THEY NEVER GIVE ME ANY IDEAS. I AM ONLY KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: SO NOW I AM SAYING, WOULD WE USE AS OUR THEME, AS OUR STATEMENT? I GOING TO ASK YOU TO VOTE ON AM IT. I AM GOING TO GO "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," THEN, "KEEP AMERICA GREAT." LET ME HEAR BY YOUR CHEERS WHAT YOU LIKE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. HOW DO YOU GIVE UP THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME? YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? IF I DO IT WITH A NEW THEME, I GIVE UP THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME, AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY, WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARE YOU READY? FIRST WE DO "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" THEN WE DO "KEEP AMERICA GREAT." LET ME HEAR IT. READY? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOT BAD. NOT BAD. IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THREE YEARS AGO IT WOULD NOT BE A CONTEST, RIGHT? ARE YOU READY?

SINCE THE FIRST DAY I WALKED THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN WHO SENT ME THERE. YOU DID. YOU DID. YOU DID. YOU DID. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU DID. YOU ALL DID. WHEN I GET BEHIND MY DESK AT THE BEAUTIFUL OVAL OFFICE, I THINK ABOUT ONLY ONE THING. HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WIN. THE US HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN, TODAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU, AND I THINK YOU SEE THAT. IT'S NOT EASY. BUT I LOVE IT, AND THE REASON I LOVE IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN FEW PRESIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO, AND IT IS A GREAT GREAT FEELING. PRES. TRUMP: TOGETHER WE ARE BREAKING THE MOST SACRED RULE IN WASHINGTON POLITICS. WE ARE KEEPING OUR PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE MY ONLY SPECIAL INTEREST IS YOU. I DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST. I DON'T CARE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: BY THE WAY, A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN SO TALENTED, SO GOOD, SO TALENTED, SO WONDERFUL, AND I HAVE A FEELING SHE WILL BE RUNNING FOR A CERTAIN GUBERNATORIAL POSITION, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, RON, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE FLORIDA. IT WILL NOT BE IN FLORIDA, I PROMISE YOU, CASEY,. SHE WOULD BE TOUGH, RIGHT? BUT A WOMAN WHO IS A SPECIAL WOMAN, AND HER FATHER, HE IS OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR US ALL THE TIME. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. THIS HAS BEEN TRULY THE OWNER OF A LIFETIME. ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES ANYBODY COULD IMAGINE. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO BE ON THE FRONT ROW OF HISTORY AND WATCH YOU DRASTICALLY CHANGE OUR COUNTRY FOR THE BETTER. YOU HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT. YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT. I COULDN'T BE PROUDER TO BE PART OF YOUR TEAM. I AM GOING TO GO AND SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY KIDS, BUT NO ONE WILL BE A STRONGER VOICE AND A MORE FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR THIS PRESIDENT, BECAUSE HE IS FIGHTING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND ALL THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND HE IS GOING TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SIX MORE YEARS TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY AS STRONG AS IT HAS EVER BEEN. THANK YOU! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE'RE GOING TO MISS HER. WE'RE GOING TO MISS HER. THANK YOU, SARAH. INCREDIBLE. A WARRIOR. SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED SIX MILLION NEW JOBS. NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. THEY SAID IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE. WE HAVE LIFTED MORE THAN SIX MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS AND WE'RE GETTING OFF OF WELFARE AND BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND THEY'RE SO HAPPY. THEY ARE SO HAPPY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST RATE IT'S BEEN IN OVER 51 YEARS. THINK ABOUT IT. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS, I NOW SAY ALSO ABOUT HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, THEY HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN HISTORY. UNEMPLOYMENT. AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS ALSO REACHED BY FAR, THE LOWEST RATE IN HISTORY. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS. AND TODAY, RIGHT NOW, AS WE SPEAK, ALMOST 160 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WORKING. BATSTHAT'S MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. IT IS THE FIRST TIME EVER. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS ALMOST 160 MILLION, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE BREAKING THAT NUMBER SOON. [APPLAUSE] WOMEN FILLED 60% OF THE NEW JOBS CREATED LAST YEAR AND WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN 74 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WAGES ARE RISING AT THE FASTEST RATE IN MANY DECADES, AND, REALLY, WHAT IS NICE, IS THAT THEY ARE RISING THE FASTEST FOR THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS. ISN'T IT NICE? PERCENTAGEWISE. AND OUR PLEDGE TO THE AMERICAN WORKER THROUGH IVANA TRUMP? SHE HAS WORKED SO HARD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: SHE HAS WORKED HARD. HAS SECURED COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE PRIVATE SECTOR TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO NEARLY 10 MILLION AMERICANS. IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE STORY. GREAT JOB. TO GET RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES, WE PASSED THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THE LARGEST. WE DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX CREDIT AND THE TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR EARNING $75,000 HAS SEEN A TAX CUT OF OVER $2000 A YEAR. AND THAT MONEY GOES RIGHT BACK INTO OUR ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: OUR RECORD-BREAKING REGULATORY REDUCTION CAMPAIGN HAS SAVED EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD AN AVERAGE OF $3000 PER YEAR, AND WE'VE ENDED THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S CRUEL AND HEARTLESS LAW ON AMERICAN ENERGY. WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO OUR ENERGY SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE MEDIA -- WE HAVE AMONG THE CLEANEST AND SHARPEST -- CRYSTAL CLEAN, YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT, I WANT CRYSTAL CLEAN AIR AND WATER ANYWHERE ON EARTH. WE ARE CREATING A FUTURE OF AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND YET OUR AIR AND WATER ARE THE CLEANEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN BY FAR. [APPLAUSE] AND IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES. WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, WE INHERITED ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED, THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. WOULD HAVE PUT YOU ALL OUT OF WORK. T.P.P. WOULD HAVE DEALT THE DEATH OFBLOW TO THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY, WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS DOING GREAT. MANY MANY PLANTS ARE NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN MICHIGAN AND OHIO PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA. THEY HADN'T BUILT ONE IN DECADES , AND NOW, THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. MY FIRST WEEK, I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE JOB-KILLING CATASTROPHE. WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS, T.P.P. AND THE PARIS ENVIRONMENTAL ACCORDS. NOT TOO GOOD. NOT TOO GOOD. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HEAT ON THAT, I TOOK NONE. WOULD HAVE COST US TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE ARE REPLACING THE N.A.F.T.A. DISASTER WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S.M.C.A. [APPLAUSE] AND U.S.M.C.A., THAT'S MEXICO AND CANADA, WILL CREATE AT LEAST 75,000 NEW JOBS FOR AMERICAN AUTO WORKERS AND GIVE A MASSIVE BOOST TO OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND GROWERS ALL ACROSS THE SUNSHINE STATE, AND WILL HOPEFULLY SOON HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS IT TO HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] IT REPLACES ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE. N.A.F.T.A. N.A.F.T.A. WAS A BEAUTY. IT WAS REALLY GOOD IF YOU WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY LEAVE OUR COUNTRY. THANKS TO OUR TARIFFS, AMERICAN STEEL MILLS ARE ROARING BACK TO LIFE. YOU KNOW THAT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE HAVE TAKEN HISTORIC ACTION TO CONFRONT CHINA'S CHRONIC TRADING ABUSES. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO, BUT THE DAYS OF STEALING AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN COMPANIES, AMERICAN IDEAS AND WEALTH, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IN THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, ON AVERAGE, WE LOST 2000 MANUFACTURING JOBS A MONTH. SINCE MY INAUGURATION, WE'VE ADDED 16,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS A MONTH. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. REMEMBER THE STATEMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION -- YOU'D NEED A MAGIC WAND TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING. WELL, WE'LL TELL SLEEPY JOE THAT WE FOUND THE MAGIC WAND, THE SLEEPY GUY. [LAUGHTER] PRES. TRUMP: AND TO REMEDY PAST INJUSTICES, WE PASSED GROUNDBREAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. [APPLAUSE] WE ENDED THE CLINTON ERA CRIME POLICIES THAT UNFAIRLY AFFECTED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, SO UNFAIR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE BOLDLY CONFRONTING THE OPIOID AND DRUG ADDICTION AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. DRUG ADDICTION IS THE SCOURGE OF OUR COUNTRY AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, AND WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS. SO MUCH PROGRESS. OPIOID DOWN 17%, 18%, 19% AND 21% IN SOME PLACES. AND I WANT TO THANK OUR FIRST LADY FOR HAVING WORKED SO HARD ON THAT, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE'RE EXPANDING AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, CREATING PLANS 60% CHEAPER THAN OBAMACARE. AND WE PASSED SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF. THEY'VE WANTED TO PASS IT FOR 45 YEARS. ALL OF THE GENTLEMEN THAT ARE SITTING HERE FROM CONGRESS, YOUR CONGRESSMEN, YOUR SENATORS, THEY HELPED US. IT'S CALLED "RIGHT TO TRY." [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE THE GREATEST MEDICAL LABS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE INCREDIBLE THINGS UNDER ADVISEMENT AND OUR PEOPLE, IF THEY WERE VERY SICK, THEY WERE THEY COULDN'T GET ANYTHING -- TERMINALLY ILL, THEY COULDN'T GET ANYTHING BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID NO, IT MIGHT HURT THEM, THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. SO I SAID, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND THESE PEOPLE, IF THEY WERE RICH OR HAD MONEY THEY'D, GO TO ASIA, THEY GO TO EUROPE, THEY WOULD GO ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOKING FOR A CURE. BECAUSE THE FOR F.D.A. WOULD NOT APPROVE WHAT WE CALL "RIGHT TO TRY," WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME, "RIGHT TO TRY," AND I GOT IT APPROVED AFTER 44 YEARS, I GOT IT APPROVED. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND I SAW A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHER DAY ON TELEVISION, MISS HARP, INCREDIBLE WOMAN. DID ANYONE SEE HER? SHE WAS INCREDIBLE. AND SHE WAS SO THANKFUL. AND SHE'S DOING SO WELL. AND THEY WERE GIVING HER INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE DYING. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS HAPPENED. AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY CASES LIKE ABOUT. -- LIKE THAT. "RIGHT TO TRY." AND I HOPE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM EVER USE IT, BUT NOW WE HAVE IT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HALF A CENTURY, WE HAVE REDUCED TO THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OUR AMAZING VETERANS ARE NO LONGER LEFT TO LANGUISH AND DIE ON ENDLESS WAITING LISTS, STANDING ON LINE WAITING FOR A DOCTOR. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE, SO THEY CAN SEE THEIR DOCTOR. OUR VETERANS WERE WAITING ON LINE FOR TWO DAYS. SEVEN DAYS, THREE WEEKS, FIVE WEEKS, YOU HAD VETERANS WAITING ON LINE THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN TAKEN CARE OF, THEY WAITED SO LONG. THEY BECAME TERMINALLY ILL. THE STORIES ARE HORRIBLE. WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE, YOU GO OUT NOW, YOU GET A DOCTOR, YOU FIX YOURSELF UP. THE DOCTOR SENDS US THE BILL, WE PAY FOR IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE THE LIFE AND THE VETERAN IS MORE IMPORTANT, BUT WE ALSO HAPPEN TO SAVE A LOT OF MONEY. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: V.A. CHOICE FOR THE VETERAN. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT PASSED ALSO FOR ABOUT 44 YEARS. WE ALSO PASSED V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT WHEN SOMEBODY DOES BAD THINGS OR MISTREATS OUR WONDERFUL VETERANS -- WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM, THEY WERE PROTECTED. BETWEEN CIVIL SERVICE UNIONS AND ALL OF THE PROBLEMS, IT DIDN'T MATTER. YOU COULD NOT DO ANYTHING. NOW, YOU CAN JUST SAY, "YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT, GET OUT!" [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND AS WE FIGHT TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR ALL AMERICANS, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME MORE RADICAL, MORE DANGEROUS, AND MORE UNHINGED THAN AT ANY POINT IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: ON NO ISSUE ARE DEMOCRATS MORE EXTREME AND MORE DEPRAVED THAN WHEN IT COMES TO BORDER SECURITY. THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA OF OPEN BORDERS IS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE. IT'S THE GREATEST BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AND, FRANKLY, AMERICAN LIFE, OUR COUNTRY HAS AS A WHOLE. NOBODY SEES ANYTHING LIKE IT. PEOPLE ARE POURING IN, BUT WE HAVE STOPPED IT. AND NOW, AS I SAID, WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE HELPING US, INCLUDING THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO. LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT. BUT WE NEED YOU TO CALL YOUR DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN AND YOUR DEMOCRAT SENATOR AND GET THEM TO PASS LEGISLATION WORKING WITH THESE GREAT MEN OVER HERE TO CLOSE UP THE LOOPHOLES AND TO SOLVE THE ASYLUM PROBLEM WHICH CAN BE DONE IN 15 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] ILLEGAL MASS MIGRATION BRINGS IN MILLIONS OF LOW WAGE WORKERS TO COMPETE FOR JOBS, WAGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES AGAINST THE MOST VULNERABLE AMERICANS CUTTING OFF THEIR PATH TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. THANKS TO DEMOCRATIC POLICIES, SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEING THREATENED BY THE VICIOUS GANG, MS-13. THAT I.C.E., BY THE WAY, IS TAKING OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND DROPPING THEM BACK HOME BY THE THOUSANDS, BY THE THOUSANDS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MASS ILLEGAL MIGRATION REDUCES LIVING STANDARDS AND STRAINS PUBLIC RESOURCES. IF DEMOCRAT OFFICIALS HAD TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THOSE OVERCROWDED, OVERBURDENED SCHOOLS, THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT FOR ONE MINUTE. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THEIR POLICIES ARE HORRIBLE. OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE A DISGRACE, AND THE DEMOCRATS CAN GET TOGETHER WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM QUICKLY. ONE MEETING. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN VOTED TO GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS INSTEAD OF HELPING HOMELESS AMERICANS IN DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: DEMOCRATS SUPPORT SANCTUARY CITIES. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR RON, FOR ENDING THAT WHOLE DISASTER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THEY RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. RON DESANTIS, GREAT JOB. GREAT, REALLY GREAT. THANK YOU. SO SMART. IT IS COMMON SENSE. IT'S COMMON SENSE. SANCTUARY CITIES ARE AN OPEN ATTACK ON AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND AMERICAN FAMILIES, SACRIFICING AMERICAN LIVES IN PURSUIT OF A CALLOUS POLITICAL AGENDA. THAT IS ALL IT IS. NO ONE WHO SUPPORTS SANCTUARY CITIES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WELFARE, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, AND PUBLIC RESOURCES SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM AMERICANS. AND YES, YES, WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT FEW OTHERS HAVE EVEN TRIED TO DO. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS LIKE NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE. WAIT TILL YOU SEE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL BE HEARING ABOUT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEROES OF I.C.E., BORDER PATROL, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND IN THE ULTIMATE ACT OF MORAL COWARDICE, NOT ONE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, NOT A SINGLE ONE, HAS STOOD UP TO DEFEND THE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL. THE JOB THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE. AGAINST ALL ODDS WITH THE BAD LAWS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHARACTER, THE VIRTUES, THE SPINE TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO THANK THEM AND WE HAVE TO THANK BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT A JOB THEY DO. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IT IS TIME TO PASS KATE'S LAW, END SANCTUARY CITIES, END CATCH AND RELEASE, DEPORT VICIOUS GANG MEMBERS , WHICH WE'RE DOING, STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING, STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND ESTABLISH A MODERN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM BASED ON SKILLS, CONTRIBUTIONS, AND BASED ON MERIT. WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY BASED ON MERIT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: MORE THAN 120 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE ALSO SIGNED UP TO SUPPORT CRAZY BERNIE SANDERS' SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: HE SEEMS NOT TO BE DOING TOO WELL LATELY. THEY WANT TO END MEDICARE AS WE KNOW IT AND TERMINATE THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE OF 180 MILLION AMERICANS WHO LOVE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. EVER. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "U.S.A.!"] PRES. TRUMP: REPUBLICANS DO NOT BELIEVE IN SOCIALISM, WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM, AND SO DO YOU. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL DEFEND MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS. WE WILL DEFEND IT LIKE NOBODY ELSE. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS. ALWAYS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTION RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB. LEADING DEMOCRATS HAVE EVEN OPPOSED MEASURES TO PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF CHILDREN AFTER BIRTH. YOU SAW THAT IN VIRGINIA. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY LIFE IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE TERM ABORTIONS. DAY BY DAY, WE ARE REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY AT HOME. WE ARE RESTORING AMERICA'S STANDING ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE RESPECTED AS A COUNTRY. AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AFTER PAST LEADERS SLASHED MILITARY BUDGETS, WE ARE REBUILDING THE U.S ARMED FORCES WITH $700 BILLION LAST YEAR AND $716 BILLION THIS YEAR, FAR MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WITH THE HELP OF VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, WE ARE CREATING THE SPACE FORCE. THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE, THE SPACE FORCE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE INSISTING THAT OUR FOREIGN PARTNERS AND ALLIES PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND THANKS TO OUR BRAVE WARRIORS, THE ISIS CALIPHATE THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT HAS BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED. 100%. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE REPAIRED AMERICA'S FRIENDSHIP WITH OUR CHERISHED ALLY, THE STATE OF ISRAEL, AND AS I HEARD MIKE SAYING BEFORE, WE RECOGNIZED THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: AND I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DISASTERS, JUST A DISASTER, A DISASTER, THE THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AND IMPOSED THE TOUGHEST EVER SANCTIONS ON THE WORLD'S #1 STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. WE ARE CHARTING A PATH TO STABILITY AND PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BECAUSE GREAT NATIONS DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT ENDLESS WARS. THEY'VE BEEN GOING ON FOREVER. STARTING TO REMOVE A LOT OF TROOPS. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. IN LATIN AMERICA, OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN STANDS AGAINST CORRUPT COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST REGIMES, AND WE SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF CUBA AND VENEZUELA IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. THANK YOU, MARCO. THANK YOU, RICK, THANK YOU, LINDSAY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: NOTHING WOULD MAKE US HAPPIER THAN TO THE INPUT TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS TO OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE, TO BRING DOWN THE DRUG PRICES, TO COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND TO DOMINATE THE FUTURE AS ONE AMERICAN TEAM. IT CAN HAPPEN. IT CAN HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IT CAN HAPPEN. IT'S LOOKING LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOES NOT WANT TO DO THAT, BUT IT CAN HAPPEN, AND IT VERY WELL MIGHT. THE ARE SO MANY GREAT THINGS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN AFFLICTED WITH AN IDEOLOGICAL SICKNESS THAT PROTECTS FOREIGN BORDERS BUT REFUSES TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS. THAT PROMOTES JOBS OVERSEAS BUT ALLOWS OUR FACTORIES TO CLOSE. THAT PROMOTES DEMOCRACY ABROAD, BUT SHREDS OUR CONSTITUTION AT HOME. THAT DECLARES SUPPORT FOR FREE SPEECH AND FREE THOUGHT, BUT RELENTLESSLY SUPPRESSES THEM BOTH. AND THAT CONSTANTLY SAVAGES THE HEROES OF AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE DON'T WANT THAT. NO MATTER WHAT LABEL THEY USE, A VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN 2020 IS A VOTE FOR THE RISE OF RADICAL SOCIALISM, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CROWD BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: SO DON'T EVER FORGET, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FUTURE, AND THE FATE OF YOUR COUNTRY. WE BEGIN OUR CAMPAIGN WITH THE BEST RECORD, THE BEST RESULTS, THE BEST AGENDA, AND THE ONLY POSITIVE VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: TOGETHER, WE WILL CONTINUE UNLEASHING THE POWER OF AMERICAN ENTERPRISE, SO EVERY AMERICAN CAN KNOW THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE PRIDE OF A PAYCHECK. WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A SAFE, MODERN, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. GUEST:[APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: IT WILL BE A SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION THAT STRENGTHENS OUR COUNTRY, UPHOLDS OUR VALUES AND PROTECTS OUR WAY OF LIFE. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROMPTLY STAMPED WITH THE WORDS "MADE IN THE USA." [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "U.S.A.!"] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL CREATE A GREAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BASED ON HONESTY, TRANSPARENCY, MORE OPTIONS, AND FAR LOWER COSTS FOR MUCH BETTER CARE. WE WILL GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO MILLIONS OF UNDERSERVED CHILDREN WHO ARE TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS AND FAILING SCHOOL SYSTEMS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL CONTINUE RESCUING OUR INNER CITIES FROM DISASTROUS REIGN OF DEMOCRATS WHO PRESIDED OVER THE DECIMATION OF THEIR EDUCATION SYSTEMS, THE OUTSOURCING OF THEIR JOBS, AND THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE WILL EXPAND OPPORTUNITY ZONES SO THAT NO COMMUNITY IS EVER LEFT BEHIND. THANK YOU, TIM SCOTT. GREAT HELP. IN THE FACE OF NEW THREATS, WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL PUSH ONWARD WITH NEW MEDICAL FRONTIERS. WE WILL COME UP WITH THE CURES TO MANY, MANY PROBLEMS, TO MANY, MANY DISEASES, INCLUDING CANCER AND OTHERS, AND WE'RE GETTING CLOSER ALL THE TIME. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL ERADICATE AIDS IN AMERICA ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE. WE WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR LANDING AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS AND, ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE VALUES THAT HOLD US TOGETHER. WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO -- "IN GOD WE TRUST." [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: POWERED BY THESE VALUES, WE WON A VICTORY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WE WON A VICTORY FOR EVERY PARENT WORRIED FOR THEIR CHILDREN, AND WORRIED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS THEY HAD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY EVEN BETTER. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE WON A VICTORY FOR EVERY MOM AND DAD WHO LOST A JOB BECAUSE OUR LEADERS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER, YOU'VE SEEN THAT TOO MUCH. WE WON A VICTORY FOR AMERICAN SELF-GOVERNMENT, SELF RULE, AND SELF DETERMINATION. WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED BY GOD WITH THE GREATEST NATION ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WITH YOUR HELP, WITH YOUR LOVE AND YOUR DEVOTION, AND WITH YOUR DRIVE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. [APPLAUSE] PRES. TRUMP: WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN, AND WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, ORLANDO. THANK YOU, FLORIDA.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THAT INCLUDES THE COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND I.C.E. [APPLAUSE] UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, I'M PROUD TO REPORT WE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN BORDER SECURITY. THANKS TO HIS STRONG STAND, MEXICO'S DOING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE AND APPREHENSIONS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ARE DOWN BY 28% IN JUST THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO BUILD THAT WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "BUILD THAT WALL!" ] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: OH, WE'RE BUILDING IT. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHILE LEADING VOICES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ADVOCATE LATE-TERM ABORTION AND DEFEND INFANT SIZE , INFANTIZE, I STAND WITH A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. AND BEYOND ALL OF THAT, THIS PRESIDENT PROMISED TO REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, TO ROLL BACK RED TAPE, TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY, TO CUT TAXES, AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DELIVERED SIX MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY, AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH, JOBS ARE BACK, CONFIDENCE IS BACK. IN A WORD, NORTH CAROLINA, AMERICA IS BACK. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL PROMISED MADE AND PROMISED KEPT. [CROWD CHANTING "U.S.A."] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: BUT TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT, WE HAVE TO RE-ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR YOU EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. FOUR MORE YEARS MEANS MORE JOBS, MORE JUDGES, AND MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS TO DRAIN THAT SWAMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION COULDN'T BE CLEARER AND THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER. TODAY, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY, WHO STANDS BY OUR MILITARY AND MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORMAT EVERY LEVEL. HE NEVER QUITS. HE NEVER BACKS DOWN. HE BELIEVES IN YOU, AND HE FIGHTS FOR YOU EVERY DAY. IT'S TRUE. THE OTHER PARTY , THE OTHER PARTY'S INCREASINGLY LED BY LEFT-WING LIBERALS WHO CRITICIZE THIS COUNTRY, DEMEAN THOSE WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM AND OPENLY ADVOCATE AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT WILL IMPOVERISH MILLIONS. WELL, THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA KNOW IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT MADE AMERICA THE STRONGEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE MOMENT AMERICA BECOMES A SOCIALIST COUNTRY IS THE MOMENT AMERICA CEASES TO BE AMERICA. SO WE MUST SAY WITH ONE VOICE, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IN HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I'M HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN WORKERS, I STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR FAITH AND FREEDOM AND THE AMERICAN FLAG, I STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN OUR PRESIDENT STANDS UP TO RADICAL DEMOCRATS WHO ACCUSE BORDER PATROL OF RUNNING CONCENTRATION CAMPS, USE ANTI-SEMITIC SLURS, TO DENOUNCE SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, AND CONTINUALLY ATTACK AMERICA, WE STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO OUR MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA IS THIS, AND CARRY THIS MESSAGE OUT FROM HERE TONIGHT, IF YOU ARE DOING BETTER THAN YOU WERE THREE YEARS AGO, JOIN US. IF YOUR VALUES ARE BEING BETTER DEFENDED, JOIN US. IF YOU'RE PROUD TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO FIGHTS FOR YOU AND IS PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALL WHO SERVE HER EVERY DAY , JOIN US AND RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! AND WE'LL KEEP AMERICA GREAT. SO BRING ALL YOUR ENTHUSIASM, NORTH CAROLINA, AND HAVE FAITH. FAITH THAT WHEN OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN MORE FREEDOM AND MORE GOVERNMENT, THEY WILL CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAVE FAITH IN THIS PRESIDENT WHOSE DRIVE AND VISION ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN EVEN AS WE SPEAK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, HAVE FAITH IN HE WHO BLESSED THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD WILL BLESS AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW WITH YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR ENERGY OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS, WE'LL RE-ELECT THIS PRESIDENT. WE'LL ELECT REPUBLICAN MAJORITIES IN WASHINGTON, D.C. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WITH STRONG CONSERVATIVE LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND WITH GOD'S HELP, WE'LL MAKE AMERICA AND NORTH CAROLINA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'LL MAKE AMERICA AND NORTH CAROLINA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND THIS PRESIDENT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO NOW IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND DISTINCT PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU MY FRIEND AND THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN WHERE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M FREE AND I WON'T FORGET THE MEN WHO DIED WHO GAVE THAT RIGHT TO ME AND I GLADLY STAND UP NEXT TO YOU AND DEFEND HER STILL TODAY BECAUSE THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT I LOVE THIS LAND GOD BLESS THE U.S.A. (music) (music) FROM ACROSS THE PLAINS OF TEXAS FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA FROM DETROIT DOWN TO HOUSTON AND NEW YORK TO L.A. WHERE THERE'S PRIDE IN EVERY AMERICAN HEART AND IT'S TIME WE STAND AND SAY THAT I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN WHERE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M FREE AND I WON'T FORGET THE MEN WHO DIED WHO GAVE THAT RIGHT TO ME AND I GLADLY STAND UP NEXT TO YOU AND DEFEND STILL TODAY BECAUSE THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT I LOVE THIS LAND GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO MIKE PENCE FOR THE GREAT JOB, GREAT VICE PRESIDENT. THANK YOU, MIKE. AND WE HAVE ALL NIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN TONIGHT. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO, NOTHING, NOTHING! WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT BEGIN AND THAT'S HAPPENING. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE WITH THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING NORTH CAROLINA PATRIOTS, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY BIG VICTORY WE HAD THREE YEARS AGO. TIME IS FLYING. ARE YOU GETTING READY? LET'S DO IT AGAIN; RIGHT? LET'S DO IT AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I JUST HEARD THAT THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO KILL THE MOST RIDICULOUS PROJECT I HAVE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN, THE RESOLUTION, HOW STUPID IS THAT, ON IMPEACHMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK THOSE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM VOTED FOR US. THE VOTE WAS A TOTALLY LOPSIDED 332-95-1. 332-95. THINK OF IT. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY. THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS EVER. WE'VE REBUILT THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY. IT WAS TOTALLY DEPLETED WHEN I TOOK OFFICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW IT IS REBUILT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE PASSED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS OF ANY PRESIDENT OR ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY. WE TOOK CARE OF OUR GREAT VETS, INCLUDING VETERANS' CHOICE AND VETERANS' ACCOUNTABILITY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY WANT TO TRY AND IMPEACH. IT'S A DISGRACE. DISGRACE. [BOOING] SO NOW WE HAVE THAT BEHIND US. AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS, AND I WILL IS A IT JUST ONCE , AND I WILL SAY IT JUST ONCE, WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WITH THIS WITCH-HUNT SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NEVER EVER AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR ALL OF US BY STOPPING THAT HOAX, THE RUSSIAN HOAX, I CALL IT BECAUSE AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. AND BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR ECONOMIC POLICY CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THREE VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SIMPLE WORDS, JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'VE CREATED 6 BILLION NEW JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY. IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT, NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT, THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID HE'S EXAGGERATING. AND I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BECAUSE I WASN'T EVEN SURE WE COULD DO IT. THINK OF IT. SIX MILLION JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND BY THE WAY, NORTH CAROLINA HAS HAD ITS BEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR STATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR COUNTRY HAS ADDED MORE THAN 180,000 PEOPLE TO THE WORKFORCE, AND THINK OF THAT, THROUGH WHAT WE'VE DONE ON A FEDERAL BASIS, YOU PICKED UP OVER 180,000 JOBS, NORTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THINK OF THAT. AND YOU HAVE YOUR LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. BUT LET'S NOT TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA. LET'S WIN THIS ELECTION NATIONWIDE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DO YOU REMEMBER NORTH CAROLINA? THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE CLINTON FIREWALL. SHE SPENT A FORTUNE HERE. AND I KEPT COMING IN AND COMING OUT. THEY CALLED IT EARNED MEDIA. I EARNED IT. I KEPT COMING IN ANDOMING OUT. EVERY TIME I LEFT I SAID, I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOSING NORTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS RIGHT. WE WON IT. WE WON IT EASILY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. SERIOUSLY, THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. NOVEMBER 8, THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CARINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BIG DEAL. THAT WAS WHEN YOU STARTED TO SEE THE FOLKS AT A CERTAIN OTHER CONVENTION, BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING PLACE, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VENUES I HAVE EVER SEEN, BUT I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. IT WAS UNLUCKY. I DON'T WANT ANY PART, BUT THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW THE PEOPLE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND THEN IT WAS STATE AFTER STATE. IT WAS FLORIDA. IT WAS SOUTH CAROLINA. WE LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA; RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. IT WAS PENNSYLVANIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THEY WOULDN'T ANNOUNCE NUMBERS IN PENNSYLVANIA. SO THERE WAS 1% OF THE VOTE REMAINING. IF I LOST EVERY ONE OF THOSE VOTES, WE STILL WIN BY A LOT. AND THEY WOULDN'T ANNOUNCE IT. THEY WOULDN'T ANNOUNCE IT. AND THEN WE WON THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN, FIRST TIME IN MANY MANY DECADES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEN WE HAD A SURPRISE, BUT NOT A SURPRISE TO US, BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING BACK THE AUTO INDUSTRY, BROUGHT SO MUCH BACK TO THE GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN. DO YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN HAND ON THAT BEAUTIFUL BOARD, AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS BOARD IS GETTING AWFULLY RED, THAT'S REPUBLICAN. THERE'S A LOT OF RED UP THERE. WE HAD A LOT OF , THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A NIGHT, WASN'T IT, THOUGH? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS ONE HELL OF A NIGHT. I THINK IT WAS MAYBE , YOU KNOW, THERE WERE THOSE THAT SAY ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND EXCITING EVENINGS IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION AND THE HISTORY OF ANYTHING. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO ALL OVER THE WORLD, IN SOME CASES, IT WAS MORNING. YOU GO TO ASIA, YOU GO TO EUROPE, YOU GO ALL OVER, IT WAS JUST RECORD SETTING. AND HERE'S THE POINT. WE HAVE TO DO IT BEGIN , WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. [CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS"] AND THE REASON WE HAVE TO, NOT ONLY TO DO NEW THINGS, WHICH WE WILL, AND YOU KNOW STATUTORY AND WE HAD ALL SORTS OF ARTIFICIAL WITCH-HUNTS ALL OVER OUR HEAD. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT HOAX, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD HAVE DONE ANY BETTER. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THINK WE HAVE DONE MORE IN THE FIRST 2 1/2 YEARS THAN ANY PRESIDENT EVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST 2 1/2 YEARS. BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WITCH-HUNT , YOU SAID IT. I WON'T SAY IT BECAUSE IT'S A TERRIBLE WORD. SO I WILL NOT SAY THAT THIS GUY SAID IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BULLSHIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO, NO. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME WASTED, THE TIME AND EVERYTHING, CAN YOU IMAGINE, AND YOU KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE SAID? MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE AS WELL. IS THAT POSSIBLE? THAT COULD HAPPEN. MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TOO MUCH TIME ON OUR HANDS. WHO KNOWS, BUT I CAN SAY, NOBODY IN THEIR FIRST TWO AND A HALF YEARS HAS DONE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT WE , NOT ME , WHAT WE HAVE ALL DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS THE LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG HISPANIC AMERICANS, WHERE WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL, YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY WANT A STRONG BORDER. THEY WANT IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE BORDER BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THEY WANT THAT STRONG BORDER. THEY WANT THAT WALL THAT'S BEING BUILT RIGHT NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WANT THAT WALL. AND THEY REALLY DO. THEY UNDERSTAND THE BORDER BETTER THAN ANYBODY. AND THEY DON'T WANT CRIMINALS COMING IN. THEY DON'T WANT CRIME COMING IN. THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT THEIR SALARIES ARE GOING UP, THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP. THEY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER, SO HISPANIC AMERICAN, THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN OUR HISTORY. ASIAN AMERICANS, THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN OUR HISTORY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LIKEWISE, WOMEN, 74 YEARS, SO I'M SORRY, WOMEN, I LET YOU DOWN, IT IS NOT IN OUR HISTORY, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE VERY SOON, WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE VERY SOON, WOMEN ARE DOING INCREDIBLY AND WOMEN , THE MEN ARE GOING TO GET ANGRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SORRY MEN, LOOK AT ALL THOSE SIGNS. "WOMEN FOR TRUMP." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW! THANK YOU. THAT'S A LOT OF SIGNS. DO YOU REMEMBER LAST ELECTION, DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER EVER GET THE WOMEN. THEN WE GOT THIS TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF WOMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE GOT THIS TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF WOMEN, AND DURING THE ELECTION NIGHT, THEY SAID WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED, SUPPRESSION POLLS, SUPPRESSION. POLLS ARE JUST AS THE FAKE AS THE NEWS ITSELF. BUT WOMEN FILLED 60% , AND I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS, MEN, THEY ARE GOING TO SUE ME FOR DISCRIMINATION NOW, WOMEN FILLED 60% OF ALL THE NEW JOBS CREATED LAST YEAR. WOMEN TOOK 60%. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MEN? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? BUT THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT AND OUR COUNTRY'S TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, UNPRECEDENTED. WE'VE HAD UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS. LEADERS COME IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, PRIME MINISTERS, PRESIDENTS, KINGS, QUEENS, DICTATORS SOMETIMES, I HATE TO SAY IT, DICTATORS, AND THEY ALL START OFF BY SAYING, MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE INCREDIBLE ECONOMY YOU HAVE CREATED, THE GREATEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SADLY, CHINA, WHO I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT XI, I REALLY LIKE HIM, BUT CHINA HAS HAD , YESTERDAY, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE WORST YEAR IN 27 YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE'VE HAD THE BEST. IF OUR OPPONENTS EVER GOT INTO OFFICE, INSTEAD OF BEING UP 62%, INSTEAD OF THEIR 401(K)S OF YOURS BEING UP 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, CRASH, BIG CRASH, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A CRASH THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IF THEY GOT IN OFFICE BECAUSE WE FREED UP OUR COUNTRY. WE FREED UP OUR ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY WITH REGULATION CUTS BUT ALSO WITH THOSE BIG BEAUTIFUL TAX CUTS. WE FREED IT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE LEADING VOICES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO REJECT EVERYTHING OUR NATION STANDS FOR, BUT AGAIN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS VOTE WAS SO BIG, I HAVE TO THANK MANY OF THE DEMOCRATS. I MEAN, THAT WAS AMAZING. NO, NO, I REALLY DO. I RESPECT IT. I REALLY DO. THAT WAS A SLAUGHTER, BUT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR US THIS AFTERNOON IN SOMEWHAT OF A SNEAK ATTACK, A REAL SNEAK ATTACK, MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR US WERE DEMOCRATS, AND I WANT TO THANK THEM BECAUSE THEY DID THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT AMERICA IS THE GREATEST FORCE FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD. BUT THESE LEFT-WING IDEOLOGUES SEE OUR NATION AS A FORCE OF EVIL. THE WAY THEY SPEAK SO BADLY OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY WANT TO DEMOLISH OUR CONSTITUTION, WEAKEN OUR MILITARY, ELIMINATE THE VALUES THAT BUILT THIS MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR RECENT COMMENTS WHICH ARE NEVER TALKED ABOUT. WHEN YOU SEE THE FOUR CONGRESS WOMEN , OH, ISN'T THAT LOVELY? [BOOING] I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE. I HAVE HAD PAGES AND PAGES BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU OR GO TOO LONG. WE HAVE TO GIVE A COUPLE. THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT LIVE TELEVISION. THEY CAN'T CUT IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR , [BOOING] OF A REALLY GREAT STATE. I ALMOST WON. FIRST TIME IN DECADES AND DECADES, MINNESOTA. GREAT STATE. [BOOING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "U.S.A."] BY THE WAY, I KEEP HEARING HOW MUCH ENTHUSIASM IS IN THE RADICAL LEFT. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ENTHUSIASM. THEY'RE JUST FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER. WE HAVE ALL OF THE ENTHUSIASM. [BOOING] HE GOES HOME NOW TO MOMMY AND HE GETS REPRIMANDED AND THAT'S THE END. SORRY, MOMMY. SORRY, MOM. DIDN'T MEAN TO EMBARRASS YOU, MOM. BUT IT'S TRUE. WE HAVE THE ENTHUSIASM, FOLKS. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. BY THE WAY, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE AND PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T GET IN, THOUSANDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'VE GOT ALL THE ENTHUSIASM. THEY ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER. THEY'VE GONE SO FAR LEFT NOBODY WANTS TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. SO REPRESENTATIVE OMAR BLAMED THE UNITED STATES , BOOING] FOR THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON OUR COUNTRY SAYING THAT TERRORISM IS A REACTION TO OUR INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS. SHE SMEARED U.S. SERVICEMEMBERS INVOLVED IN BLACKHAWK DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, SHE SLANDERED THE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO WERE TRYING TO KEEP PEACE IN SOMALIA. OMAR MINIMIZED THE SEPTEMBER 11TH ATTACKS ON OUR HOMELAND, SAYING SOME PEOPLE DID SOMETHING. I DON'T THINK SO. SOME PEOPLE DID SOMETHING. YES, SOME PEOPLE DID SOMETHING ALL RIGHT. SHE PLEADED FOR COMPASSION FOR ISIS RECRUITS ATTEMPTING TO JOIN THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR , [INDISCERNIBLE] OMAR LAUGHED THAT AMERICANS SPEAK OF AL QAEDA IN A MENACING TONE AND REMARKED THAT YOU DON'T SAY AMERICA WITH THIS INTENSITY. YOU SAY AL QAEDA MAKES YOU PROUD, AL QAEDA MAKES YOU PROUD. YOU DON'T SPEAK THAT WAY ABOUT AMERICA. AND AT A PRESS CONFERENCE, JUST THIS WEEK, WHEN ASKED WHETHER SHE SUPPORTED AL QAEDA, THAT'S OUR ENEMY, THAT'S OUR ENEMY. THEY ARE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE TAKE CARE OF, BUT THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO COME ALONG SOMEWHERE. SHE REFUSED TO ANSWER. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. OMAR BLAMED THE UNITED STATES FOR THE CRISIS IN VENEZUELA. THINK OF THAT ONE. AND SHE LOOKS DOWN WITH CONTEMPT ON THE HARDWORKING AMERICANS SAYING THAT IGNORANCE IS PERVASIVE IN MANY PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY. [BOOING] [CROWD CHANTING "SEND HER BACK"] OBVIOUSLY AND IMPORTANTLY, OMAR HAS A HISTORY OF LAUNCHING VICIOUS ANTI-SEMITIC , [CROWD CHANTING "SEND HER BACK"] SHE TALKED ABOUT THE EVIL ISRAEL AND IT IS ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS. NOT A GOOD THING TO SAY. SO THAT'S OMAR. THAT'S OMAR. AND BY THE WAY, MANY OTHER THINGS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL SCREEN AND YOU WILL SEE , YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, THOUGH. DID YOU HEAR ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THIS? HER COLLEAGUE REPRESENTATIVE RASHIDA TALIB , [BOOING] , AGREED WITH OMAR'S CHARACTERIZATION OF 9/11 AND SAID THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO SUPPORT ISRAEL FORGOT WHAT COUNTRY THEY REPRESENT. AND TLAIB ALSO USED THE F WORD TO DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENCY AND YOUR PRESIDENT. THAT'S NOT NICE, EVEN FOR ME. SHE WAS DESCRIBING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE BIG FAT VICIOUS , THE WAY SHE SAID IT , VICIOUS F-WORD. THAT'S NOT SOMEBODY WHAT LOVES OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO LOVES OUR COUNTRY. REPRESENTATIVE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ , [BOOING] CHECK OUT HER SCORES, BY THE WAY, WITH HER NEW GREEN NEW DEAL. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? SHE'S CONDUCTED OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS AGAINST MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE COMPARED AMERICAN BORDER AGENTS, MANAGING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT I ALWAYS SAID WAS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, AND THEY SAID IT WAS MANUFACTURED. THEY DON'T SAY IT WAS MANUFACTURED. AND WE'RE STOPPING IT, AND I WANT TO THANK MEXICO. THEY'VE GOT 21,000 SOLDIERS NOW , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STOPPING PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT CORTEZ , SOMEBODY SAID, THAT'S NOT HER NAME. IT'S , THEY SAID, THAT'S NOT HER NAME, SIR. I SAID, NO, NO. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO WITH THREE DIFFERENT NAMES. WE'LL CALL HER CORTEZ. TOO MUCH TIME. TAKES TOO MUCH TIME. SO CORTEZ ALSO , SHE SAID ESSENTIALLY NAZIS ARE RUNNING CONCENTRATION CAMPS , [BOOING] AND WHEN MIKE PENCE WENT DOWN JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE MEDIA, AND YOU LOOKED AT THOSE SO-CALLED HORRIBLE CONCENTRATION CAMPS, THEY SAID WOW, THESE PLACES ARE CLEAN. WOW, THEY HAVE AIR-CONDITIONING. THEY HAVE WATER. AND YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAME, AND WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. YOU KNOW, IN A VERY SHORT PERIO , PERIOD OF TIME, IF THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GIVE US A FEW VOTES, WE COULD SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, AND IT WOULD BE SO GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THESE KIDS AND THESE PEOPLE COME FROM ROUGH PLACES. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, SOME OF THEM SAID WE HAVE NEVER LIVED LIKE THIS BEFORE. THEY HAVE WATER. THEY HAVE AIR-CONDITIONING. THEY HAVE THINGS THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN, AND WE LISTENED TO HER TALKING ABOUT DRINKING WATER FROM TOILETS, WHICH WAS A LIE, WHICH WAS A LIE. CORTEZ SAID THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE MORE AMERICANLIE. SAID IT LEGAL IMRANTS ARE MORE AMERICAN AND SHE DESCRIBED CONTEMPORARY AMERICA THAT, IS YOU AND ME AND ALL OF US AS PATCHAGE. GARBAGE. REMEMBER DEPLORABLES? THAT IS WORSE. WE'LL SAVE IT FOR THE NOMINEE. AND WITH ME, JOE IS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD. POCHAHONTAS IS GAINING A LITTLE BIT. WE PROBABLY USED IT EARLY BUT THAT IS OKAY. WE'LL BRING IT OUT OF RETIREMENT VERY SOON. WE ARE A NEW ONE WHAT KNOCKED THE HELL OUT OF BIDEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE ACCORDING TO POLLS I WON EVERY DEBATE. CAN YOU IMAGINE? THOSE ARE THE POLLS. THEY'LL HAVE SAID THAT. MANY, MANY POLLS. CAN YOU IMAGINE I SAID OH, OH. SORRY. I AM GONE. THAT IS THE END OF TRUMP. HE IS NOT MENTALLY PREPARED FOR THIS PROBLEM. HE SAID SORRY. I RAN OUT OF TIME. RAN OUT OF TIME. HE RAN OUT OF TIME. YOU HAVE A YOUNG GUY. THEY'RE SAYING HOW TO SAY HIS NAME. HE RUNS A FAILED CITY. I SAID HOW IS HE HAS MAYOR? MIKE IS ONE OF THE NICEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU'LL EVER HEAT. HE SAID MIKE SAID HE NEVER DID A IF JOB AND I'M SHOCKED TO SEE HIM RUNNING OKAY? AND HE GOES HOME AND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE SO ANGRY AT HIM BECAUSE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A HOT YOUNG STAR. THAT IS NOT A STAR. IT'S NOT A STAR. ADD EDGE. WHO THAT EDGE STH AND I DON'T SEE HIM MEETING PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA AND MEETING SUCCESSFULLY WITH KIM JUNG UN. I DON'T SEE HIM DEALING, AND NOBODY HAS BEEN TOUGHER WITH RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T SEE HIM DEALING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. WE SPEND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BRITAIN AND LAST REAR I SAID FOLKS PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. 16 YEARS GOING LIKE THIS. THE CONTRIBUTION. NOW, IT'S LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. $100 BILLION. AND I SAID TO THEM, GREAT PEOPLE. I SAID LISTEN. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF YOU. YOU SCREW US ON TRADE AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING YOUR MILITARY BILLS SO WE'RE TAKING CARE OF TRADE. WE WANT TO DO IT NICE AND EASY AND EUROPEAN UNION IS TERRIBLE TO US UP THERE. TERRIBLE. WITH CHINA. $507 BILLION. THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN AND GUYS SAID WE'RE STOPPING THAT. NO THE TRUMP IS STOPPING IT. TRUMP IS STOPPING IT. SO IS SHE RELATED TO ELVIS? I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS? YOU NEVER KNOW. SHE THINKS THAT PEOPLE WITH SAME SKIN COLOR. SHE SAID WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE BROWN FACE THAT'S DON'T WANT TO BE BROWN VOICES. WE DON'T NEED BLACK FACE THAT'S DON'T WANT TO BE A BLACK VOICE. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID THAT? IT WOULD BE OVER RIGHT? IT WOULD BE OVER. I'D FIND A WAY TO SURVIVE, RIGHT? WE ALWAYS DO. HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE. WE PINED A WAY THAT ALWAYS FIND A WAY. THIS WEEK SHE REFUSED TO CONDEMN ANTIFA. THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE. DO YOU NOTICE THEY ATTACK PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTACHED BEFORE. THEY ATTACK AND I DON'T WANT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO PEOPLE TAKING A LOT OF SHOTS TO THE FACE. AND THEY'RE NOT ATTACKINGNO CARRIERRINGCONNECT 1200NO CARRIERRINGCONNECT 1200 JOB.

I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS TOO WELL IN NORTH CAROLINA. THIS IS A SPECIAL MAN, TWOING TO BE A GREAT CONGRESSMAN, DAN BISHOP. DAN? SO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THERE ARE TWO DANS IN THIS RACE. DAN McCREADY SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO DEMOCRACY EVER AND PACKED CROOKED HILLARY. DAN McCREADY TOOK MONEY FROM ILHAN OMAR AND MR. PRESIDENT, HE WANTS TO REPEAL YOUR TAX NO CARRIERRINGCONNECT 1200 SO OUR DEPARTMENT CHARGED SAVAGE, PROSECUTAL, HORRIBLE GANG MS13 IN CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE OPINION VIOLENTLY OPERATING FOR TEN YEARS.

I TELL THEM YOU ARE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AN PUBLIC THEY LOVE YOU AND HAVE MADE EVERY CANDIDATE, EVERYONE. THEY RAISED THEIR HAND IN GIVING HEALTH CARE. THEY JUST APRUCHED $100 MILLION. TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. LOOKING AT SIDEWALKS OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO, NANCY PELOSI'S DISTRICT NOBODY HAS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT, WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. IF YOU DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS TO STEAL YOUR MONEY AND BANKRUPT YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN. ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS, LEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO WAIT IN LINE SOMETIMES 0 YEARS AND WHO RESPECT OUR LAWS AND FOLLOW RULES THEY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM. THEY WORK HAR. YOU CAN'T SAY YOU LOVE OUR COUNTRY IF YOU WANT TO DESTROY IT THROUGH OPEN BORDERS. IT'S A DISASTER. HUMAN TRAFFICKING. YOU KNOW? FIRST TIME I HEARD AS A POLITICIAN HUMAN TRAFFICKING, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. IT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE AN ANCIENT SCRIBE. MANY, MANY YEARS AGO. HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. IT'S THE WORST NOW BECAUSE OF THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. AND WORST OF ALL, CHILDREN, BUT IT'S WOMEN. WOMEN. DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS WORSE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NOT JUST THIS NOT A UNITED STATES PROBLEM BUT THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD. HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING AND WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE IT. MOST COMES THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE POINTS. THEY'RE IN THE GOING THROUGH AREAS WE HAVE SECURITY AND GUARDS AND GATES. NO. THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT BECAUSE FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS HERE, THEY WANTED IT. NOW, THEY DON'T WANT IT. DO YOU KNOW WHY?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TOM. EVERY NATION HAS THE RIGHT TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE IMMIGRATION RULES THIS IT'S NATIONAL INTERESTS. IT'S SIMPLE AND COMMON SENSE. IT'S SIMPLE. THEY'LL EMBRACE OUR AMERICAN VALUES AND LOVE OUR AMERICAN FLAG. WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. WE NEED WORKERS BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN WHERE THEY CAN HELP OUR COUNTRY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN BASED ON MERIT. AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. MORE THAN 130 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER. IS THAT NICE?

AND THEN YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR FROM VIRGINIA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LATE TERM. HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BABY IS BORN BEFORE THIS IS A BABY BORN. NOBODY HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND THAT, WHAT A SHAME. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY LIFE IS A SACRED GIFT OF GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME. OPEN BORDERS, LATE TERM ABORTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS PARTY FOR ALL AMERICAN VALUES.

CSPANDT18201910	Donald Trump	2019-08-01	President Trump in Cincinnati, Ohio	THANK YOU ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. AND HELLO, CINCINNATI. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, I USED TO WORK IN CINCINNATI. A PLACE CALLED SWIFT IN THE VILLAGE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? IT WAS GOOD. IT WORKED OUT WELL. AND HE GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE WHEN THINGS WORK OUT WELL AT A YOUNG AGE. AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US, RIGHT? LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED! BUT I WAS WATCHING THE SO-CALLED DEBATE LAST NIGHT -- [BOOING] AND I ALSO WATCHED THE NIGHT BEFORE, THAT WAS LONG, LONG TELEVISION. AND THE DEMOCRATS SPEND MORE TIME ATTACKING BARACK OBAMA THAN THEY DID ATTACKING ME, PRACTICALLY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] AND THIS MORNING, THAT IS ALL THE FAKE NEWS WAS TALKING ABOUT. [BOOING] THAT WAS NOT PRETTY. NO, WE ARE DOING GOOD. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE STATE THAT I LOVE. I LOVE THIS STATE. VERY SPECIAL. [CHEERING] VERY, VERY SPECIAL ON THE BANKS OF THE BEAUTIFUL OHIO RIVER, WITH THE HARD-WORKING PATRIOTS OF THE AMERICAN HEARTLAND. THANK YOU, OHIO. WE LOVE YOU, OHIO. [CHEERING] THOUGH WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE, AND I ASKED THE OFFICIALS, CAN WE SNEAKS UP -- SNEAK SOME UP ALONG THE AISLE? BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS IS SOME CROWD, SOME TURNOUT. WE HAVE SOLD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TICKETS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SALE PRICE IS, WE KEEP IT NICE AND LOW. WE KEEP IT NICE AND LOW. [CHEERING] BUT THERE NEVER HAS. . BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. THIS IS A MOVEMENT THE LIKES OF WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. BABY ANYWHERE. BUT CERTAINLY IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. YOU CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS ON THE RIVERS, AND YOU CAME -- I MEAN LOOK, FROM WHEREVER YOU CAME FROM, THERE WERE A LOT OF YOU. AND THEY SHOWED UP ON ELECTION DAY, I WILL NEVER FORGET, A WONDERFUL CONGRESSMAN FROM TENNESSEE TO HAVE EARLY VOTING, ONE OF THE EARLIEST PLACES, GREAT STATE, TENNESSEE, AND HE SAID -- HE WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH ME, GREAT STATE, AND HE SAID YOU KNOW SIR, I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME, BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE LIKE THIS SHOW UP FOR EARLY VOTING. PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT VOTED IN A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SEE ANYBODY THEY WANTED TO VOTE FOR. HE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN -- THEY HAVE TRUMP BANNERS AND TRUMP HATS AND TRUMP BUTTONS. [CHEERING] TRUE. IN THIS GREAT CONGRESSMAN SAID, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING, IF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS VOTING LIKE TENNESSEE IS VOTING, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN BY A LOT. AND WE WON. AND WE WON BY A LOT. [CHEERING] OUR NATION IS STRONGER TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERING] WE HAVE THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY ON EARTH. NO ECONOMY IS CLOSE. [CHEERING] WE ARE REBUILDING THE AWESOME MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, AND SOON IT WILL BE STRONGER, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY. AND WHEN WE TOOK OVER, IT WAS DEPLETED. [CHEERING] WE TOOK OVER A DEPLETED MILITARY. IT IS NOT DEPLETED ANYMORE, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OUR SPIRIT IS STRONG, OUR STRIDE IS BACK, AND OUR STAND IS CLEAR. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. IT IS ABOUT TIME. [CHEERING] [CHANTING "USA!"] WE HAVE CREATED 6 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY. MORE THAN 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. [CHEERING] AND THEY ARE HAPPY. THEY ARE HAPPY. 123,000 MORE OHIO WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED TODAY THAN WHEN I WAS ELECTED. THINK OF THAT NUMBER. [CHEERING] AND RIGHT NOW, OHIO IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IT HAS EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS, OHIO. [CHEERING] GET UP, MIKE! AND YOU HAVE A GOOD GOVERNOR, I WANT TO TELL YOU. GOOD JOB, MIKE. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER HALF A CENTURY. AND UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE ALL REACHED THE LOWEST RATES EVER RECORDED. [CHEERING] WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO BUILD UP OUR COUNTRY, THE RAGE FILLED DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TRYING TO TEAR AMERICA APART. [BOOING] THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS NOW BEING LED BY FOUR LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO REJECT EVERYTHING THAT WE HOLD DEAR. [BOOING] NO ONE HAS PAID A HIGHER PRICE FOR THE FAR LEFT, DESTRUCTIVE AGENDA THAN AMERICANS LIVING IN OUR NATION'S INNER CITIES. THEY HAVE PAID A DEAR PRICE. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. YOU SEE OUR INNER CITIES. WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF FOUR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, AND IT HAS STOLEN MONEY AND IT HAS WASTED MONEY, AND IT IS A SHAME. [BOOING] FOR DECADES, THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN RUN EXCLUSIVELY BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS. AND IT HAS BEEN TOTAL ONE-PARTY CONTROL OF THE INNER CITIES. FOR A HUNDRED YEARS, IT HAS BEEN ONE-PARTY CONTROL, AND LOOK AT IT. WE CAN NAME ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT I WON'T DO THAT. BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO BE CONTROVERSIAL. [LAUGHTER] WE WANT NO CONTROVERSY. [CHEERING] THE DEMOCRAT RECORD IS ONE OF NEGLECT AND CORRUPTION AND DECAY. TOTAL DECAY. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TAXED AND REGULATED JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY OUT OF THESE CITIES AND OUT OF EXISTENCE. THEY HAVE SQUEEZED THE BLOOD OUT OF THEM. LEFT-WING MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS HAVE OPPOSED SCHOOL CHOICE, TRAPPING CHILDREN AND FAILING IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS LEFT AND RIGHT. SO MANY OF THESE MAYORS RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE? THEY ARE IN JAIL. THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE. [CHEERING] REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY PARENT HAS THE RIGHT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THE SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE. [CHEERING] BUT THE GREATEST BETRAYAL COMMITTED BY THE DEMOCRATS IS THEIR SUPPORT FOR OPEN BORDERS. [BOOING] AND THESE OPEN BORDERS WOULD OVERWHELM SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, DRAIN PUBLIC SERVICES, AND FLOOD COMMUNITIES WITH POISONOUS DRUGS. IT IS TOUGH ENOUGH. AND I WANT TO THANK, BY THE WAY, THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO. THEY HAVE 21,000 SOLDIERS ON THE BORDER RIGHT NOW. [CHEERING] I'M STARTING TO LIKE MEXICO A LOT. THEY DO A LOT MORE FOR US THAN THE DEMOCRATS DO, RIGHT? A LOT MORE. [CHEERING] IN THE NUMBERS ARE WAY DOWN, YOU WILL SEE THAT, WAY, WAY DOWN. DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS CARE MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS. THEY PUT FOREIGN CITIZENS BEFORE AMERICAN CITIZENS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. [BOOING] 572 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED IN CHICAGO LAST YEAR. [BOOING] [CHEERING] [CHANTING "USA!"] [CHEERING] DEMOCRAT MAYOR. DEMOCRAT MAYOR. DEMOCRAT. YOU MUST HAVE A DEMOCRAT MAYOR. DO YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT MAYOR? [BOOING] [CHEERING] COME ON, LAW ENFORCEMENT. DEMOCRAT MAYOR. [CHANTING] [CHEERING] CINCINNATI, DO YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT MAYOR? WELL THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. YOU SEE, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. CAN I SAID -- WE SET A NEW RECORD TONIGHT AT THIS ARENA. BUT WE COULD GET -- [CHEERING] BUT WE COULD GET A FEW MORE ON THE FLOORS, IF YOU MORE UP HERE. AND THEY ARE OUTSIDE WHERE IT IS 100 DEGREES OUT. AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO LET US. AND I SAID, IS THAT RUN BY THE DEMOCRATS? THE ANSWER IS YES. YOU HAVE A LOT OF HOT PEOPLE OUTSIDE. BUT WE BROKE THE ALL-TIME RECORD. SO -- [CHEERING] THE HOMICIDE RATE IN BALTIMORE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN EL SALVADOR, HONDURAS, GUATEMALA. I BELIEVE IT IS HIGHER THAN -- GIVE ME A PLACE THAT YOU THINK IS PRETTY BAD? THE GUY SAYS, AFGHANISTAN. I BELIEVE IT IS HIGHER THAN AFGHANISTAN. IN OUR COUNTRY, THINK OF THAT, I BELIEVE -- WE WILL CHECK THE NUMBERS, AND IF THEY ARE WRONG, THEY WILL TELL US TOMORROW, THEY WILL BE HEADLINES "TRUMP EXAGGERATED." I DO BELIEVE THE RATE IS HIGHER THAN AFGHANISTAN. YET DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THEIR OWN STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. NO GOOD. NO GOOD. [BOOING] THE CONDITIONS IN NANCY PELOSI'S ONCE GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ARE DEPLORABLE. THEY ARE DEPLORABLE. DO YOU REMEMBER THE WORD DEPLORABLE? YOU REMEMBER WHEN HILLARY USED THE WORD DEPLORABLE? SHE USED TWO WORDS. SHE USED DEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE, RIGHT? [BOOING] AND ONLY BEING A POLITICIAN FOR A FEW YEARS, I SAID, WHAT A TERRIBLE MISTAKE THAT SHE USED THE WORD IRREDEEMABLE. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE DEPLORABLE. DEPLORABLE WAS NOT A GOOD DAY FOR HILLARY. CROOKED HILLARY. SHE IS A CROOKED ONE. CROOKED. [CHEERING] SHE IS CROOKED. NEARLY HALF OF ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS -- IN THE STREETS OF AMERICA HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO OUR BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA IS A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A SHAME. THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT IT. LOOK AT LOS ANGELES, WITH THE TENSE AND THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DISGUSTING CONDITIONS. LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO, LOOK AT SOME OF YOUR OTHER CITIES, AND THEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT INVITES THE WHOLE WORLD TO COME INTO CALIFORNIA, WE WILL PAY FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE. AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING UP. THEY ARE COMING UP BECAUSE WITH THE HOTTEST ECONOMIC COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, BUT THEY ARE ALSO COMING UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT GOVERNOR SAYING COME ON UP, WE WILL GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE. WHO WOULDN'T COME UP? WHO WOULDN'T COME UP? HOW CRAZY IS THIS? HOW CRAZY IS THIS? SCHOOLS, HEALTH CARE. TODAY, I HAVE A SIMPLE PROPOSAL FOR DEMOCRAT LEADERS TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO END ILLEGAL MIGRATION, AND WE WILL USE THE VAST SAVINGS TO REBUILD OUR INNER CITIES. THAT IS THE WAY WE SHOULD BE DOING IT. [CHEERING] BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE VOTERS, THE VOTERS, THE VOTERS. WHAT ABOUT A THING CALLED VOTER ID? VOTER IDENTIFICATION. [CHEERING] ROB PORTMAN, PLEASE WORK ON THAT, ROB PORTMAN. YOU HAVE A GREAT SENATOR. WILL YOU PLEASE WORK ON THAT? EVERY PLACE I GO, ROB. PLEASE, ROB. VOTER ID. THEY GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THEY CAN GIVE YOU EXCEPT VOTER ID AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT A NATION WAS -- MUST CARE FOR ITS OWN CITIZENS FIRST. OUR PLEDGE TO AMERICA'S WORKERS HAS SECURED COMMITMENTS TO TRAIN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW. YOU KNOW WHO IS WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT? YOU PROBABLY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HER. IVANJKAKA TRUMP. [CHEERING] SHE IS WORKING VERY HARD. SHE GAVE UP A LOT. SHE HAD A VERY EASY LIFE. BUT SHE LOVES DOING IT. SHE HAS OVER 12 MILLION PEOPLE, TEACHING THEM, THEIR GREAT COMPANIES OF OUR COUNTRY, TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO DO IT. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE THING TO WATCH. TO GIVE FORMER PRISONERS A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE, WE PASS GROUNDBREAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT NOBODY COULD HAVE PASSED EXCEPT US. [CHEERING] PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED. A LOT OF THEM TRIED. THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. I GOT IT PASSED WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES. THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY IS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY. RIGHT? [CHEERING] AND SOMETHING WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT BUT WE DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. DOUBLED IT. AND OUR TAX PLAN ALSO CREATED NEARLY 9000 OPPORTUNITY ZONES, HOTTEST THING GOING, PROVIDING MATTIS -- MASSIVE NEW INVESTMENT FOR JOB CREATION IN THIS -- IN THE STRESSED COMMUNITIES. YOU OK? TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME. DOCTOR? DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE, PLEASE. OK? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. THANK YOU. [CHEERING] DON'T FORGET, IT IS 100 DEGREES IN HERE. THAT PERSON HAS BEEN STANDING THERE FOR ALMOST A DAY, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. I APPRECIATE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WILL COME BACK. THEY WILL GET A LITTLE SOMETHING AND THEY WILL COME RIGHT BACK. BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING, RIGHT? [CHEERING] THANK YOU. INCREDIBLE. WE ESTABLISHED MORE THAN 300 OPPORTUNITY ZONES IN OHIO ALONE. THESE ARE REALLY WORKING OUT INCREDIBLY WELL. NATIONWIDE, NEARLY 8 MILLION AFRICAN LIVE IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES, BUT EVERY DEMOCRAT VOTED AGAINST THEM. EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT. BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY THING THEY DO GOOD, THEY STICK TOGETHER. THEIR POLICY IS NO GOOD, THEY'RE LOUSY -- THEY ARE LOUSY POLITICIANS BUT THEY STICK TOGETHER LIKE GLUE. THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE. [BOOING] THAT IS THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE GOING. DEMOCRATS DELIVER POVERTY FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND PRIVILEGE FOR THEMSELVES. REPUBLICANS DELIVER JOBS, SAFETY, AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS. [CHEERING] AND WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS, AND WE WILL START OFF WITH A MAN WHO HAD A VERY, VERY TOUGH RACE FOR GOVERNOR. A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOKE. THEY CHOKE LIKE DOGS THEY CAN'T BREATHE. THEY CAN'T BREATHE. THIS GUY WAS RUNNING AGAINST A SO-CALLED STAR. [BOOING] [CHEERING] . [CHANTS OF U.S.A.] SO THAT'S TWO PROTESTERS AND TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE PROTESTERS, PROTESTERS. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO SEBGDCOND ONE? HE LOOKED AT THE GUY IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE SAID I'M OUT OF HERE, BYE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS, I GUESS. TOO BAD. BUT A MAN WHO REALLY HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB, HE CAMPAIGNED SO HARD HARD, AND THIS WAS A STAR RIGHT FROM THE FIELDS OF THE GREAT POKE HONOR -- POCAHONTAS WHO IS TRYING TO LIE AND COMPETE HER WAY TO THE PRESIDENCY. SHE DEFRAUDED PEOPLE WITH HER CREDENTIALS. SHE SAID SHE WAS INDIAN. AND I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD THAN SHE DOES AND I HAVE NONE, I'M SORRY. AND WE DROVE HER CRAZY. THAT IS GOOD, NOT BAD.

SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO SUCH A GOOD JOB THAT NOT EVERYBODY PRAORBS -- APPRECIATES IT. WHEN YOU CORRECT IT YOU MAKE YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT LESS POPULAR. BUT HE HAD NO CHOICE. IT IS A GREAT, GREAT STATE.

I LOVE JUDGES WHEN THEY SEE YOU ABOUT TWO SECONDS APBDND YOU SAY OH, THAT JUDGE SHOULD BE FAIR. THEN THEY SAY I WOULD LIKE TO RECUSE MYSELF. BECAUSE 29 YEARS AGO I PHETMET DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE BEEN DOING VERY WELL IN THE COURTS. WE HAVE BEEN WINNING A LOT OF CASES. WE HAVE NOW APPOINT EDED 148 -- THIS OF THIS -- FEDERAL JUDGES, 148. WITHIN ABOUT TWO MONTHS MITCH MCCONNELL, SENATE. ROB PORTMAN HAS HELPED SO MUCH. LISTEN TO THIS. 179 179. PERCENTAGE-WISE IT IS THE SECOND MOST -- WE WILL NEVER BE NUMBER ONE ONE. SADLY WE WILL NEVER BE NUMBER WITHIN. PERSONAL-WISE -- NUMBER ONE. THAT IS BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS NOT ABLE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS TO GET HIS PEOPLE IN, WHICH IS A SHAME. I CAME IN I HAD 148 OPENINGS. I SAID YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE NONE. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE? 148. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. WE HAVE ALL DONE A GOOD JOB TOGETHER, ROB WITH MITCH, YOU AND EVERYBODY. WITHIN TWO MONTHS WE WILL BE AT 179 FEDERAL JUDGES. THAT'S IN 2 1/2 YEARS. AND WHAT ELEMENTSSE? TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUDGES. GREAT ONES. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON, I THINK MOST OF YOU MUST KNOW THIS. WHO PERCENTAGE-WISE HAS DONE BETTER THAN ME WITH JUDGES? TELL ME. I WILL GIVE YOU A HINT. HE APPOINTED 100% OF THE FEDERAL JUDGES AND 100% OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. GEORGE WASHINGTON. THAT IS ONE RECORD WE WON'T BEAT BUT I APPOINTED MANY MORE THAN HIM SO LET'S TACK -- TAKE TIT THAT WAY. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOMEBODY AS THE LEADER OF THE G.O.P. AND CHAIR AND MY FRIEND JANE TIMKEN. AND A BOBMAN, BOB PADUCHEPADUCEK. I KEPT HEARING YOU MUST WIN THE STATE OF OHIO OVER AND OVER. YOU MUST WIN OHIO. SO I HAD TO PICK A CAMPAIGN MANAGER. AND I PICKED A MAN NAMED BOB PADUCEK. AND NO MATTER HOW BADLY WE WERE DOING HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO WIN THEIR EASILY. I SAID BOB WE JUST LOST THE HEAD OF THE G.O.P. IN OHIO. HE SAID HE LEFT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN GOVERNOR WHO ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. A DIFFERENT GOVERNOR THAN MIKE BY THE WAY. SO HE HAD TO GET OUT. I SAID WE JUST LOST -- BOB SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SIR, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. IN FACT I THINK YOU JUST WENT UP. WE LOST A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND I SAID BOB I'M WORRIED ABOUT OHIO. HE SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, I THINK YOU JUST WENT UP. I SAID TO SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS GUY BUT HE IS THE MOST OPTIMISTIC PERSON I HAVE EVER MET. TRUE. AND WE ENDED UP WINNING OHIO BY CLOSE TO NINE POINTS, WHICH IS UNHEARD OF. SO, HE WAS RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOB! ALSO HERE, DID HE DO A GOOD JOB? MY SON AND KIMBERLY. I HOPE HE DID A GOOD JOB. I HEARD YOU DID A GREAT JOB. HE'S BEEN A GREAT HELP, THEY BOTH HAVE, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, KIMBERLY. OUR SHARED REPUBLICAN AGENDA IS PRO WORKER, PRO JOBS, PRO FAMILY, PRO GROWTH AND 100% PRO AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE ELIMINATEED A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS GIVING THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD $3,000 MORE TO SPEND EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO SHUT DOWN AMERICAN ENERGY AND CLOSE UP, TOTALLY CLOSE IT UP, AMERICAN CLEAN BEAUTIFUL COAL. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. BUT YOU HAD TO SUFFER. IT DIDN'T WORK BUT YOU HAD TO SUFFERER A LONG TIME UNTIL I CAME ALONG. YOU ARE NOT SUFFERING ANY LONGER. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, THEY LIKE WIND MILLS. IF A WINDMILL IS WITHIN TWO MILES OF YOUR HOUSE, YOUR HOUSE IS PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS. THEY MAKE NOISE, THEY ARE INTERMITTENT. THEY KILL YOUR BIRDS. THEY BREAK DOWN. YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THEM EVERY 10 YEARS BECAUSE THEY WEAR OUT. AND THEY COST A FORTUNE AND THEY NEED SUBSIDY. OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE QUITE GOOD. YOU DON'T WANT ONE OF THOSE WIND MILLS WITHIN VISION. YOU HEAR THEM. THEY ARE NOISY. GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. NO, WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH THE GREAT ENERGY THAT IS POWERING OUR BUSINESSES AND CREATING SO MANY JOBS AND SOLAR, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WILL LIVE WITH SOLAR BUT IT S IS PEANUTS BY COMPARISON TO WHAT YOU NEED. WE ARE GOING TO STAY THE WAY WE'VE IT. WE'VE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE ARE PUTTING OUR COAL MINERS BACK TO WORK AND OUR STEEL WORKERS BACK TO WORK AND OUR AUTO COMPANIES BACK TO WORK. WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AGO THE INCREDIBLE GOLD THAT WE ARE SITTING ON TOP OF IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE VERY LUCKY. WE ARE NOW THE LARGEST ENERGY PRODUCER IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, BIGGER THAN THE SOVIET UNION FORMERLY. REMEMBER THE SOVIET UNION, WHEN IT WAS ALL TOGETHER, THE SOVIET UNION UNION, WHEN IT WAS ALL TOGETHER, BEFORE THEY DECIDED WE HAVE TO CALL OURSELVES RUSSIA, THEY WANTED TO BE BIGEST IN THE WORLD WORLD. THEN IT BECAME RUSSIA AND THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH ENERGY AND SO HAS SAUDI ARABIA DONE A GOOD JOB WITH ENERGY. BUT WE ARE BIGGER THAN RUSSIA, WE ARE BIGGER THAN SAUDI ARABIA BY FAR. AND I WITHDREW OUR COUNTRY FROM THE JOB KILLING VERY EXPENSIVE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LAST YEAR COAL EXPORTS WERE UP 92% COMPARED TO 2016. SHIPPING IT ALL OVER THE WORLD. TO VIETNAM. I WAS IN VIETNAM AND THEY SAID WE GET COAL FROM OHIO, WE GET COAL FROM WEST VIRGINIA. IT IS THE FINEST COAL IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 110 P 110,000 NEW MINING JOBS. AND THANKS IT STATES LIKE OHIO THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL, THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS, THE NUMBER ONE EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH ENERGY, NUMBER ONE, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT LET OTHER COUNTRIES PILLAGE OUR JOBS AND DEVASTATE OHIO COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES IN EVERY STATE. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO YOUR JOBS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. NAFTA WAS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER MADE AND PROBABLY THE WORST DEAL. YOU STILL HAVE EMPTY BUILDINGS AND FACTORIES BUT THEY ARE BEING BUILT UP FAST OR BEING KNOCKED DOWN AND HUNDREDS OF NEW COUNTRIES POURING INTO THE UNITED STATES. MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE I WAS AWARE OF ONE OF THE LAST SELLOUTS THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED OUR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURING AND MAYBE THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MEANT WHEN HE SAID YOU CAN'T PRODUCE MANUFACTURING JOBS ANY MORE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE SIGNED TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT. I KILLED IT. BY THE WAY, TRANS POFBGACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY OF THIS COUNTRY. ALREADY THEY SHIPPED OUT 30% OF YOUR JOBS TO MEXICO UNDER THE NEW USMCA. THAT IS MEXICO AND CANADA. WE HAVE TO GET THEM TO VOTE ON THAT BECAUSE THAT IS IN INCREDIBLE DEAL. UNDER THE NEW IT WILL BE HARD FOR COMPANIES TO LEAVE YOU, TO FIRE YOU, TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCT WHATEVER IT MAY BE, TO SEND IT BACK TO THE UNITED STATES WITH NO TAX. ALL AWAY END UP WITH IS AN EMPLOYMENT AND TAXES AND EMPTY BUILDINGS. SO THEY HAVE TO VOTE ON THE USMCA. BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE FORTUNE ACCOUNTANTS RIPPED US -- COUNTRIES PUSHED US AROUND. BUT AMERICA IS NOT BEING PUSHED AROUND ANY MORE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT? I THINK I GOT THAT FROM WORKING IN OHIOTO TWO SUMMERS, RIGHT? WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST ACTION TO STANDS,TO CHINA AS TRADE ABUSE AND I JUST ANNOUNCED ANOTHER 10% TARIFF ON $300 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE PRODUCTS THAT COME INTO OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS ON TOP OF THE 25% THAT WE TAKE OF $250 BILLION COMING IN FROM CHINA. AND DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU THE FACT IS CHINA DEVALUES THEIR CURRENCY, THEY POUR MONEY INTO THEIR SYSTEM, AND BECAUSE THEY DO THAT YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THOSE TARIFFS, CHINA IS PAYING FOR THOSE TARIFFS. FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS CHINA HAS TAKEN HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND NOW WE ARE STOPPING THE THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS, WE ARE STOP BEING THE THEFT OF -- STOPPING THE THEFT OF SO MANY OTHER THINGS INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THEY STEAL OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. AND I THINK THEY WANT TO TRY TO MAKE A DEAL WITH US BUT I'M NOT SURE. PAUSE THE WORD IS -- BECAUSE THE WORD IS I FEEL THEY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THEY GET -- THEY ARE PRAYING, THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A NEW PRESIDENT IN A YEAR AND A HALF SO THEY COULD CONTINUE TO RIP OFF THE UNITED STATES LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS. [BOOING] THEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE A GUY LIKE SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHO HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE IS DOING. THEY WOULD SAY TO SLEEPY JOE, SURE, JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE, OH, OK. I'LL SIGN. WE WOULD BE LOSING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO CHINA. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. PRESIDENT XI IS A GOOD MAN, HE UNDERSTANDS IT. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THERE IS A DEAL WE WILL BE TAX BEING THE HELL OUT -- WE WILL BE TAXING THE HELL OUT FOF CHINA. THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT. IF FOREIGN COUNTRIES DON'T WANT TO PAY A TARIFF I HAVE A SOLUTION. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN AMERICA. COME ON BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. COME ON BACK TO OHIO. THERE'S NO TARIFF. THERE'S NO TARIFF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS TO STEEL TARIFFS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS -- THINK OF THIS -- WERE DUMPED ON OUR SHORES. AND STEEL IS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE, IT IS NOT QUALITY. THEY WERE DUMPING GARBAGE. THEY CALL IT SAND STEEL, IT WAS DIRT STEEL. IT WAS MIXED UP. WE DIDN'T WANT TO USE IT FOR OUR JET FIGHTERS AND BEAMS THAT HOLD UP BUILDINGS. BUT THEY WERE DUMPING TREMENDOUS QUANTITIES OF STEEL. AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT THE UNITED STATES STEEL AND ALL OF OUR COMPANIES WERE GOING VIRTUALLY OUT OF BUSINESS. AND I STOPPED IT. I PUT ON A 25% TARIFF. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS POURING INTO OUR TREASURY AND OUR STEEL COMPANIES AND OUR STEEL WORKERS ARE COMING BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RIGHT HERE IN OHIO, A GREAT STEEL COMPANY THAT IS DOING GREAT AGAIN NUCOR HAS ANNOUNCED AN TKWHRAUR $85 MILLION UPGRADE. ANOTHER ONE PLANS TO BUILD A NEW $150 MILLION STEEL MILL IN CUYAHOGA. AND CLEVELAND CLIFFS ANNOUNCED A NEW $700 MILLION PLANT IN A VERY GOOD PLACE THAT I LIKE A LOT. TOLEDO, OHIO. FOUR YEARS AGO STEEL PLANTS WERE CLOSING. THERE WERE NOT BUILDING OR EXPANDING. WE ARE BUILDING NEW PLANTS IN FLORIDA, KNOCK,NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. NOT JUST OHIO. ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE DEMOCRATS HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO IT IS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. I WONDER WHY THEY FORGOT. THE JOB OF ELECTED OFFICIALS IS TO REPRESENT AMERICAN CITIZENS. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS EVEN SUPPORT DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ON OR STREETS -- ON OUR STREETS. AND MANY OF THE PLACES THAT HAVE SANCTUARY CITIES AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE, THEY DON'T WANT THEM. THEY ARE DANGEROUS, THEY ARE NOT GOOD GOOD. HERE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. IN SAN FRANCISCO AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS ARRESTED NO FEWER THAN 10 TIMES IN THE SPAN OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR FOR NUMEROUS COUNTS BURGLARY AND THEFT BUT EACH TIME HE WAS SET FREE. AND BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHEN THEY SET ALMOST FREE. A SANCTUARY JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY RELEASED A CRITICAL ALIEN FROM JAIL. THE VERY NEXT MONTH THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WAS ARRESTED FOR RAPE RAPE, THEN BEYOND ANYTHING YOU WOULD EVER BELIEVE, A HORRIBLE THING HAPPENED BUT YET AGAIN HE WAS RELEASED BACK INTO YOUR COMMUNITY COMMUNITY. AFTER A SANCTUARY CITY IN NEW JERSEY RYE LEASED -- RELEASED ANAL I DON'T KNOW CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HE WAS ARRESTED IN MISSOURI FOR THE MURDERS OF THREE PEOPLE. IN THE BIZARRE WORLD VIEW OF THE HARD LEFT, THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM DESTROYING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT AMERICANS FOR A SINGLE POLITICALLY INCORRECT THOUGHT, BUT THEY WANT TO VIRTUALLY -- YOU KNOW THIS -- THEY. WANT VIRTUAL IMMUNITY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO HAVE CREATED HORRIBLE CRIMES AND MURDER. HORRIBLE CRIMES AND MURDER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW APWAEUDING AMERICANS -- LAW ABIDDINGA ABIDEING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE WITHINON BIG LAWSUIT LAST WEEK. ONE OF MY LAWYERS FOR WINNING THAT LAWSUIT IS HERE TONIGHT. I GAVE HIM A LITTLE REPRIEVE. WE NEED A LOT OF LAWYERS IN WHITE HOUSE WE GET SUED SO MUCH SO UNFAIRLY BUT WE'RE WINNING THOSE. ONE OF THEM IS HERE. HE SAID I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO RALLY. I SAID I'M GOING TO CINCINNATI. YOU DESERVE IT. WE JUST WON THE LAWSUIT ON THE WALL. WE JUST WON THE LAWSUIT ON THE WALL AND WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL FASTER AND BETTER THAN EVER. IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATS TO END SANCTUARY CITIES AND CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THEM AND THEN YOU RELEASE THEM. AND YOU SAY WILL YOU PLEASE REPORT BACK IN FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. BUT ONLY 2% COME BACK. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SMARTEST. THEY ARE THE ONES WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE COME BACK. ONLY 2% SHOW UP. WE COULD END IT IMMEDIATELY IF THE DEMOCRATS GAVE. SO WE ARE KEEPING THEM OUT ALTOGETHER. WE ARE REPLACING RANDOM MIGRATION AND WE ARE REPLACING THE LOTTERY SYSTEM. HOW ABOUT THE LOTTERY SYSTEM? [BOOING] THIS WAS CHUCK SCHUMER. YOU PUT THE NAME IN A BASKET. THE COUNTRY PUTS THE NAME IN THE BASKET AND YOU PICK PEOPLE OUT OF THE LOTTERY. THIS ONE IS A MURDERER. THIS ONE ROBBED FOUR BANKS. THIS ONE I BETTER NOT SAY. THIS ONE ANOTHER MURDERER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ANOTHER MURDERER. THINK OF THIS. YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THEIR GREAT CITIZENS -- THEY HAVE GREAT PEOPLE LIKE WE DO. DO YOU THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO A LOTTERY? NO. THEN WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE COMING IN AND WE HOLD IT AGAINST THE COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY IS NOT BASED ON THAT. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THEY PUT INTO THESE LOTTERIES. IT IS A DISGRACE. AND HOW WE HAVE DONE THIS SO MANY YEARS, IT IS AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS TOTALLY BROKEN AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE AND WIN THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A MERIT BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. MERIT BASED. WE NEED THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE COMPANIES COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE NEED WORKERS, WE ARE DOWN TO 3.5% UNEMPLOYMENT. WE NEED PEOPLE. BUT WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN BASED ON MERIT, NOT BASED ON SOME LOTTERY PUT IN BY A GOVERNMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN FURTHER OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM. POLITICIANS WANT TO FORCE EVERYBODY ON TO THE GOVERNMENT PLAN. REMEMBER THE LIES FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN. IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. 28 TIMES, ONE LIE AFTER ANOTHER. 28 TIMES IT WAS SAID AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A TOTAL LIE. [BOOING] MY ADMINISTRATION IS DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE PLAN AND DOCTOR THAT IS BEST FOR YOU. WE ARE OFFERING PLANS UP TO 60% CHEAPER THAN BECAME CARE AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS. ALWAYS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. [BOOING] THEN YOU WILL HAVE LIKE A GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IT IS NOT ONLY LATE-TERM ABORTION, IT IS KILLING THE BABY AFTER THE BABY IS BORN. HOW ABOUT THAT? [BOOING] THINK OF THAT. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION AND THEY ARE THE PARTY, FRANKLY OF SOCIALISM. [BOOING] THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF FREEDOM, AWARE THE PARTY OF THE -- WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER AND AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU EACH AND EVERY DAY. I HAD A GREAT LIFE. I USED TO GET GREAT PUBLICITY. NO BETTER GOT GREAT PUBLICITY. I HAD SUCH A GREAT LIFE, IT WAS SO EASY. MY GREAT WIFE, THE FIRST LADY, MELANIA, SHE SAID YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HARD WORKER, YOU LOVE TO WORK, BUT YOUR LIFE WAS A LOT EASIER IN OLD DAYS. BUT I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE IT? BECAUSE WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING SO MUCH. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO THE THINGS AWARE DOING -- THINGS WE ARE DOING. EVEN THINGS LIKE RIGHT TO TRY. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. THAT IS PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY SICK, TRLERMINALLY ILL. WE'VE THE GREATEST DOCTORS AND CLINICS AND TECHNICIANS. THEY CONTENT GET COULDN'T GET -- THEY WOULD TRAVEL IT ASIA IF THEY HAD MONEY, THEY WOULD TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD HOPING FOR A CARRURE. IF THEY HAD NO MONEY THEY WOULD JUST GO HOME AND DAY. FOR 44 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RIGHT TO TRY. AWARE SO ADVANCED -- WE ARE SO ADVANCED IN MEDICINE. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT POSSIBLY WORK BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE THAT TO PEOPLE SO SICK? YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THIS WORK IF IT DIDN'T WORK TO HURT THE PEOPLE BUT THE PEOPLE WERE TRLLY ILL AND -- TERMINAL I -- ILLINOIS. -- TERMINALLY ILL. THE DOCTORS DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. WHEN OUR COUNTRY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK WE ARE GOING TO GET SUED. I SAID THEY WILL SIGN AN AGREEMENT TAKING ALL LIABILITY FROM THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DRUG COMPANIES, FROM THE COMPANIES, ALL LIABILITY. THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. LET'S TRY IT AND IT HAS BEEN A MIRACLE. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONDITION SO WELL -- HAVE DONE SO WELL. WE GOT IT DONE. WHEN I SAID ABOUT THE AGREEMENT THEY HAD THESE GREAT LAWYERS, THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. THEY SAID THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. I SAID HOW ABOUT GETTING IT TO ME IN ABOUT TWO HOURS. RIGHT TO TRY. IT IS A GREAT THING. WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS LIKE THAT. I HAVE LISTS THAT YOU WENT BELIEVE. I HAVE LISTS THAT GO ON FOR PAGES OF THIS IS WE'VE DONE. WE HAVE LAUNCHED THE INITIATIVE TO REDUCE PRECISION DRUGS INCLUDING TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO IMPORT LOWER COST DRUGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. IT IS A VERY UNFAIR SYSTEM. OUR COUNTRY PAYS THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD. LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME IN 51 YEARS THAT DRUG PRICING FOR PRECISION DRUGS ACTUALLY CAME DOWN. NOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT DOWN BY A LOT THE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT DOWN A LOT. AND NOW SO OTHER COUNTRIES -- CANADA PAYS HALF THE PRICE FOR A LOT OF DRUGS THAT WE DO. SO WE HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA CALLS ME UP. RON DE SANTOS. HE WAS A THREE AND HE WENT TO 70. THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD INCREASE. HE SAYS YOU KNOW, IF YOU BUY THE DRUGS, IF WE BAY THE DRUGS BECAUSE THIS IS SO BOTCHED UP WE HAVE A MIDDLE MAN, IT IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION. HE SAID IF I COULD BAY THE DRUGS FROM -- COULD BUY THE DRUGS FROM CANADA I COULD SAVE 50%. I SAID DO IT. AND IF YOU CAN BUY THEM FROM EUROPE BECAUSE THEIR SYSTEM LAKE I REMEMBER I USED TO SCREAM WE I WAS WINNING STATES AND NOT GETTING THE DELEGATES, THE DRUG SYSTEM IS RIGGED. SO, IF WE CAN BUY THE SAME DRUG MADE BY THE SAME PHARMACEUTICAL CANADA FROM EASTERN OR CANADA AWARE DOING IT AND WE ARE GIVE -- WE ARE DOING IT AND WE ARE GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO DO IT. IT JUST HAPPENED TODAY. WE ARE DOING ONE OTHER THING THAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS BIGGER BUT YOU WILL BE SEEING THAT THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. WITH THE HELP OF YOUR GREAT SENATOR ROB PORTMAN WE HAVE TAKEN BOLD ACTION TO CONFRONT THE ENOPIOID EPIDEMIC AND IT WENT DOWN 22% LAST YEAR. THINK OF THAT. OPIOID A BIG PROBLEM, BIG PROBLEM. DEATHS WENT DOWN FROM OPIOIDS 22%. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. GOOD JOB, ROB. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB, MIKE. WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY ON BEHALF OF OUR GREAT VETERANS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PASS VA CHOICE FOR FOUR DECADES. THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE. THIS IS WHERE A VETERAN WOULD STAND ON LINE FOR THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX DAYS, FOR THREE WEEKS, FOR FIVE WEEKS, SOMETIMES THEY ARE OK, BY THE TIME THEY SEE A DOCTOR THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. I SAID I HAVE A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE I HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS THAT LONG. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT A LOT. THIS WAS DURING A CAMPAIGN. WHAT A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS, RIGHT? WAS THAT A CAMPAIGN OR WHAT! I CAME BACK IT MY PEOPLE -- BACK TO MY PEOPLE AND I SAID THESE LINES FOR THE VETERANS ARE TOO LONG. IT TAKES THEM THREE OR FOUR WEEKS SOMETIMES TO SEE A DOCTOR. I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. LET'S LET THEY WILL GO TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR, WE WILL PAY THE BILL AND THEY WILL BE FIXED UP ALL PERFECT AND THEY CAN DO IT IMMEDIATELY. WE WILL PAY THE BILL. AND I THAUTOUGHT, I SAID MAN, AM I SMART. I'M THE SMARTEST GUY TO THINK OF THAT. SO I WENT BEFORE THIS PANEL OF EXPERTS THAT WERE WITH ME WORKING ON THINGS. I SAID HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT IDEA? THEY SAID WE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT 40 YEARS BUT NEVER BEEN ABLE -- REALLY? BUT WE GOT IT DONE. NOBODY ELSE COULD GET IT DONE. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU COULDN'T FIRE ANYBODY. IF THEY WERE TREATING OUR VETS BADLY YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. PEOPLE COULD STEAL. THEY COULD BE SADISTIC TO OR VETS. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT IN PRIME TIME TO OUR VETS. YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. IT WAS BECAUSE OF UNIONS AND OTHER THINGS. CIVIL SERVICE. YOU COULDN'T FIRE ANYBODY FOR ALMOST ANYTHING. WE HAD CASES WHERE PEOPLE GOT CAUGHT STEALING A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. WE GOT VA ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW WE SAY JIM, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, YOU ARE FIRED. WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY AND AFTER YEARS OF BUDGET CUTS AND LAYOFFS THE ARMY TANK PLAN IN LIMA -- MOST PEOPLE CALL IT LIME PRACTICE BUT I KNOW LIME PRACTICE BECAUSE I CAME HERE AND THEY SAID WE ARE CLOSING THE PLANT. REMEMBER WE I WAS HERE? IN LIMA. I USED TO SEE LIMA. NO, IT IS LIMEALIMA. BECAUSE THEY HAVE IT WRONG ON THE TELEPROMPTER AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BIG TROUBLE BUT I DON'T USE THE TELEPROMPTER TOO MUCH. IF I DID YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF HERE A LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE IT GETS VERY BORING WE YOU DO THE TELEPROMPTER DEAL. BUT I SAID LET'S GO SEE IT. DURING THE CAMPAIGN I WENT TO SEE IT AND THEY MAKE THE BEST ARMY TANK IN THE WORLD AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE COMPLEXITY, GENIUS. I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, YOU CLOSE THIS YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO OPEN IT AGAIN. THIS IS NOT LIKE A NORMAL SITUATION THAT YOU CAN OPEN FOUR WALLS AND A ROOF. THIS IS GENIUS. YOU WILL NEVER REPLACE THESE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WORK HERE. AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING AT THE TIME OTHER THAN I SAID YOU ARE NOT CLOSING IT, THEY TOOK IT OFF THE LIST. THEY KEPT IT OPEN AND NOW WE ARE MAKING ARMY TANKS AROUND THE CLOCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT FLIGHT. AMERICANS WON THE RACE TO MOON AND WE WILL NOW WIN THE RACE TO MARS. ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY ALSO, AND WE ARE ALSO WINNING THE RACE TO GREAT, GREAT STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND OFFENSE, NOT JUST MARS. AND MIKE PENCE IS DOING A GREAT JOB OF THAT, GREAT JOB. TO PROTECT AMERICA AES'S SECURITY I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DALE, THE HORRIBLE STUPID DEAL. WE GAVE IRAN $150 BILLION, WE GAVE IRAN $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, PLANE LOADS OF CASH. I WONDER WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THOSE PLANES LANDED. I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CASH. $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. [BOOING] AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, IRAN IS A MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY THAN 2 1/2 YEARS AGO WHEN I TOOK OVER. IT WAS ALL OVER. THEY HAD 14 TO 18 DIFFERENT SITES OF CON -- COP -- CONFLICT. NOW THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL SO BADLY. IRAN. IRAN. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WE RECOGNIZED THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. YOU KNOW THAT. THAT IS ANOTHER ONE, BIG ONE. FOR THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL. WE ALSO RECOGNIZED THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA AND WE CONDEMNEDED ANY OF THE SOCIALIST BRUTALITY TAKING PLACE. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. TONIGHT RERENEW OUR -- WE RENEW OUR RESOLVE THAT MARK WILL NEVER BE A SOCIAL URS COUNTRY. NEVER WILL IT EVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. NO MATTER WHAT LABEL THEY USE THEY VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IT IS FOR THE RISE OF RADICAL SOCIALISM AND THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR GREAT, OUR BEAUTIFUL, OUR WONDERFUL AMERICAN DREAM. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET OUR COUNTRY EVER GO DOWN THE ROUTE OF SOCIALISM. YOU MUST NEVER FORGET THAT THE 2020 ELECTION IS ABOUT ONE THING. IT IS ABOUT YOU. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. THEY HAVE HAD MOVEMENTS. THEY WON A STATE. THEY DID WELL IN A STATE. WE WON 32 STATES. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IT.

TO INCREDIBLE FIGHTERS FOR DECADES PEOPLE PUT SPECIAL INTEREST AHEAD OF YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY THEY TRADED AWAY YOUR FACTORIES AND SOLD YOUR FUTURES SQUANDERED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO SACRIFICE INTO ONE FOREIGN DEBACLE AFTER ANOTHER. BUT ALL OF THAT IS CHANGED AND WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN AND THEY ALL SAY WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF US FOR YEARS AND SADLY IN MANY CASES IT IS OUR ALLIES THAT TOOK THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT NOW YOU FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WE PASS THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS, NO PRESIDENT NO LONGER LOAN - - NO MATTER HOW LONG THEY SERVE JUST GOTTEN CLOSE TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH REGULATIONS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OUR ECONOMY IS SO GOOD WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL UPWARD AND CHINA WANTS TO TALK. CHINA HAS LOST 3 MILLION JOBS PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CHINA THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS DROPPING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THE TARIFFS. AND OUR COUNTRY HAS TAKEN OVER AS AN EXAMPLE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN AND ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY IN THE FORM OF TARIFFS AND CHINA THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T WANT TO TELL YOU AND OUT OF THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE HAVE TAKEN IN BECAUSE OF THE FACT OUR GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT FARMERS HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY CHINA, THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE FARMERS THEY TARGET THEM AND I SAID TO SONNY PERDUE, THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, HOW MUCH WAS IT LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE? $12,000,000,000.16 BILLIONS AND OUT OF THE TARIFFS WE HAVE TAKEN IN WE GAVE TO OUR FARMERS FOR DISTRIBUTION , HOPEFULLY VERY GOOD AND EVEN DISTRIBUTION WE HAVE GIVEN $28 BILLION SO THAT THEY ARE WHOLE. NOBODY WOULD EVER DO THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. OUR FARMERS KNOW WE HAVE TO FIGHT. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME THERE IS A GROUP OF FARMERS AND IN SOME CASES THEY ARE A BUNCH OF WOMEN TO SAY WE LIKE HIM A LOT WE ARE WITH THEM ALL THE WAY BUT TURN OFF THE CAMERAS AND THEY GO CRAZY EVER SEE THAT QUICK THOSE TEN WOMEN WHAT YOU THINK OF PRESIDENT TRUMP? WE LOVE HIM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WOULD LIKE TO PUT YOU ON TELEVISION. [LAUGHTER] THEY CAN'T TURN THE CAMERAS FAST ENOUGH IF YOU VOTED FOR PRESIDENT AND EVERYONE SAID HE DID THINGS WHO WOULD THINK OF GETTING 12 BILLION OR $28 BILLION BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED? WHAT IS THE AMOUNT THEY TOOK FROM OUR FARMERS? 16,000,000,012,000,000,000 WE WILL MAKE IT UP. WHO WOULD DO THAT? NOBODY WOULD DO THAT. FIRST OF ALL NOBODY EVER HAS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FLOWING IN FROM CHINA BECAUSE IT USED TO BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. CHINA HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES. DECADES. AND I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING. NONE OF THESE DEMOCRATS WHETHER POCAHONTAS OR SLEEPY JOE, NONE OF THEM WOULD BE ABLE TO DO A THING ABOUT IT. NOBODY WOULD EVER THINK OF HELPING THE FARMERS WHO HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY CHINA. CHINA MADE $500 BILLION ON A YEARLY BASIS THEY STEAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND NOW IT IS WORKING THE OTHER THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL THING WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THEM I WANT CHINA TO DO WELL BUT NOW THEY'VE HAD THE WORST YEAR IN 57 YEARS. I WONDER WHY. AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL WORK OUT WE WILL BE TALKING NEXT WEEK COMING TO THE UNITED STATES IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT TO MAKE A GOOD DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY, WE CANNOT GO BACK TO A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES BUT WE WILL WORRY ABOUT THEM A LITTLE BIT LATER. PLENTY OF OTHERS SAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY THEY TAKE OUR JOBS THEY MAKE OUR PRODUCTS SELL INTO A COUNTRY WITH NO TAX OR KNOW NOTHING SO WE END UP WITH CLOSE FACTORIES AND NO JOBS AND NO TAXES OR KNOW NOTHING. AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES EVEN THE PRESIDENT FROM MEXICO THE DEMOCRATS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE HORRIBLE OPEN-END LOOPHOLES WHICH WOULD BE SO GOOD IN MEXICO IS NOW PATROLLING 27000 TROOPS THEY NEVER HAD TWO TROOPS ON OUR BORDER. IF YOU SAW THE NUMBERS TODAY APPROXIMATELY 57 PERCENT DOWN. THAT OUR COUNTRY COULD FIX IT WOULD - - SO EASY THEY WOULD STICK WITH ME FOR 15 MINUTES BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS. AND TO HAVE DRUGS POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WALL TO STOP IT AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MOSTLY WOMEN, THEY TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN WHILE EVERY INCH OF WALL THAT WE PUT UP IS VITAL AND WE PUT UP MILES AND MILES. NEXT YEAR AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO HAVE 40500 MILES OF WALL BUILT. THIS MYSTERIOUS WALL. KNOW IT IS THE REAL DEAL. BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL. [BOOING] [CHANTING] BUILD THE WALL. THANK YOU TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR THE JOB HE HAS DONE USING IT AS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT. WHAT CAN BE MUCH MORE THREATENING THAN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO POUR ACROSS THE BORDERS? THE WEAKEST LAWS IN THE HISTORY OF ANY COUNTRY. WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THEM. CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO COME BACK TO COURT AND THEN NOBODY SHOWS UP. AND DEMOCRATS AND NOW WE ARE STOPPING THEM SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT COURT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION FOR AMERICAN ENERGY UNITED STATES IS NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FOR ALL OF THESE CRAZY PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. RUSSIA IS NOT TOO HAPPY THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME AND NOW WE ARE BIGGER THAN RUSSIA AND SAUDI ARABIA AND WE'RE DOING GREAT. NOT EXACTLY HAPPY THE RUSSIAN HOAX YET EVERY LEADING DEMOCRAT AND THE ENERGY THAT DRIVES THE ECONOMY IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR WAY OF LIFE. I HAVE A HUGE AUDIENCE I WISH WE COULD'VE GOTTEN A LARGER ARENA. WE TRIED I WAS WILLING TO STAND OUT IN THE RAIN AND GET MY HAIR SOAKING WET. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY SAID IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF YOUR DISTRICT. I SAID I DON'T KNOW IF IT LOOKS TO BE GOOD OUT OF YOUR DISTRICT BUT I WAS WILLING TO DO IT I WOULD SHOW IT WAS MY REAL HAIR AT LEAST. [LAUGHTER] IT MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT IT'S MY HAIR BUT IT'S BETTER THAN MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE THE SAME AGE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] IT'S A LOT BETTER A LOT. [APPLAUSE] BUT WE HAD A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND WE SAID LET'S DO THIS ONE INSTEAD AND WE PUT SCREENS OUTSIDE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE AND LOUDSPEAKERS IT IS AMAZING WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE. NOW WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING UP OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THEY TRIED TO RAM THROUGH ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED THE TPP MANY OF YOUR INDUSTRIES KISS HIM GOODBYE WOULD HAVE DATED THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY EVEN WORSE THAN NAFTA AND WE KNOW HOW BAD LOOK AT ALL THOSE EMPTY PLANTS EVEN NANCY PELOSI PUT IT UP FOR A VOTE THE TREMENDOUS DEMOCRAT SUPPORT THE MANUFACTURERS WANTED AND BY THE WAY 600,000 JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND WE HAVE TO GET USMCA PUT UP BY THE DEMOCRAT SO MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE I PROUDLY WITHDREW FROM THAT JOB DESTROYING TPP CATASTROPHE. AND WE ARE REPLACING ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY YOU CAN GO BACK AS FAR AS YOU WANT WITH NAFTA. far as you want with NAFTA. . . . .WE ARE ALSO AGGRESSIVELY COMBATING A PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE IN NORTH CAROLINA, A PROBLEM IN ALMOST ALL STATES, THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. LAST YEAR WE SAW THE FIRST NATIONWIDE DECLINE IN DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS AND NEARLY 31 YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AT THE CENTER OF THE AMERICAN DRUG CRISIS IS THE ORDER CRISIS. CRIMINAL CARTELS SMUGGLE BASS QUANTITIES OF ILLEGAL NARCOTICS INCLUDING HEROIN, METH, COCAINE AND FENTANYL, 100,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIE OF WHAT COMES ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND WE CAN'T GET THE DEMOCRATS TO HELP US IN STEALING IT EVEN TIGHTER. WE GOT TO GET THEM. [CROWD BOOS] WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM. IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE DRUG SMUGGLERS, HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND THE VICIOUS MS 13 GANG MEMBERS AND BY THE WAY, THANK YOU TO ICE. THESE PEOPLE GO INTO -- [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY GO INTO THOSE NESTS. WE CALL THEM NESTS. THESE ARE VICIOUS, VICIOUS PEOPLE. WE GO INTO THE NESTS WITH OUR ICE PEOPLE AND FOR THEM IT'S ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE. THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THEY WANT TO DO IT FOR A LIVING, LET ME SEE. THAT GUY COULD. [LAUGHTER] MAYBE HIM. MAYBE HER. MAYBE HER. BUT IT'S A ROUGH JOB AND THEY GET SO LITTLE PRAISE FOR THE JOB THEY DO. SO DANGEROUS. THESE ARE MANY KILLERS IN THOSE GAMES. WERE TAKING THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. MS 13. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW DEMOCRATS EVEN WANT TO GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. [CROWD BOOS] AS LONG AS I AM YOUR PRESIDENT I WILL NEVER EVER LET DEMOCRATS TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE AND GIVE IT AWAY FREE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE ENTERED OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. WE CAN'T DO THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IS A TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE TO COME IN. DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT TO BRING IN UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF FOREIGN REFUGEES FROM OVERSEAS ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF SUPPORTING THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. REPUBLICANS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, WHERE YOU ARE WE WANT PEOPLE TO OBEY OUR LAWS. WE WANT PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO HELP OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN FARTHER OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM AND EVERY MAJOR DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SUPPORTS A MASSIVE GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE THAT WOULD RAID MEDICARE FORCE PRIVATE DOCTORS OUT OF MEDICINE AND LEAD TO THE RATIONING OF LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT. THEY WILL TAKE AWAY THE PRIVATE HEALTHCARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE INSURANCE, 180 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE WITH WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IT'S A DISASTER. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE DID YOU EVER FEEL WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TREAT PEOPLE NICELY YOU BACK YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME. I COULD LEAVE RIGHT NOW AND SAY NORTH CAROLINA, I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU AND I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE AND PUT ONE OF THESE CRAZY PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY AGAIN MAC BUT NEVER BEEN SO FAR LEFT. I TOLD THE STORY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT A BUSINESSMAN I SAW, ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIS NAME, ONE OF THE BIGGEST HE HAS HATED ME FOR 20 YEARS AND I HATED HIM ALSO. OKAY. THEY WILL GO OUT TOMORROW BREAKING NEWS, DONALD TRUMP HATES PEOPLE. WHILE YOUR SORT OF RIGHT ABOUT THAT. I NEVER LIKED THIS GUY. I SEE HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND HE SAYS MR. PRESIDENT AND NOW HE CALLED MEET MR. PRESIDENT. HE USED TO CALL ME SOMETHING ELSE. [LAUGHTER] MR. PRESIDENT I AM FIGHTING FOR YOUR VICTORY SPINNER I SAID YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. HE SAID HONESTLY, YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB BUT ALSO IF THIS RADICAL LEFT GETS IT THEY WILL TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING AND DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. FOR THE FIRST TIME I LIKED THIS GUY. [LAUGHTER] MY ADMINISTRATION IS DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE PLAN AND DOCTRINE DO YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA 28 TIMES -- REMEMBER 28 TIMES THEY COUNTED AND IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT I WOULD IMAGINE AND YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR PLAN IN YOUR DOCTOR BUT IT DID NOT WORK OUT THAT WAY, DID IT IN OBAMACARE. WERE KEEPING OBAMACARE ALIVE AND WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WORST PART OF OBAMACARE OBAMACARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE KEEPING IT AND RUNNING IT AS WELL AS WE CAN BUT THE PREMIUMS ARE TOO HIGH AND THAT DEDUCTIBLES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF IT'S RIDICULOUS AND WE ARE COMING UP WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM AND ALL OF THE FOLKS COMING UP WITH A GREAT HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT IF WE TAKE BACK THE HOUSE THAT IS WHY DAN AND GREG IF WE TAKE BACK THE HOUSE AND IF WE KEEP THE SENATE MAYBE EVEN INCREASE IT AND IT WOULD NOT BE BAD AND ON THE ASSUMPTION WE KEEP THE PRESIDENCY WE WILL HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. WE ALMOST HAD IT. WITH A MAN CAMPAIGNING FOR EIGHT YEARS TO KNOCK OUT OBAMACARE AND WHEN HE VOTED IT DID NOT WORK OUT THAT WAY, DID IT CONNECT WE WOULD'VE HAD IT BUT WILL END UP WITH A BETTER PLAN AND SOMETIMES THROUGH ADVERSITY THINGS WORK OUT BETTER. WILL END UP WITH A BETTER PLAN. YOU WATCH. YOU ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ALSO, ALWAYS. YOU HAVE MY WORD. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES AND MORE THAN 51 YEARS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. [CROWD BOOS] RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. [CROWD BOOS] AND IF YOU LOOK AT VIRGINIA THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA HE WAS EVEN TALKING ABOUT ESSENTIALLY YOU WOULD SAY AN EXECUTION THAT HE WAS TALKING AFTER THE BABY IS BORN THE DOCTOR WILL TALK TO THE MOTHER AND THEY WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT BABY LIVES. THIS IS A RADICAL DEMOCRATIC IDEA. [CROWD BOOS] THAT IS WHY I'VE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS AND SOCIALISM. THEY ARE SOCIALISTS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] EVERY DAY WE ARE MAKING GOOD ON THE MODEL, PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. IN FACT, WE ARE KEEPING EVEN MORE PROMISES BY FAR THEN WE MADE MORE THAN WE PROMISED. SO MANY MORE. SO MANY MORE. SO MANY MORE. YOU KNOW WILL BE DID WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY SICK OR TERMINALLY ILL, RIGHT? RIGHT TO TRY. WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST DOCTORS IN THE WORLD LABS IN THE WORLD, HOSPITALS IN THE WORLD AND WE HAD INCREDIBLE MEDICINE THAT IS PROHIBITED FROM BEING USED UNTIL IT GETS APPROVAL AND SOMETIMES THAT APPROVAL CAN TAKE MANY YEARS AND I SAY IF A PERSON IS SICK AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS FOR 45 YEARS BUT IF A PERSON IS SICK AND MAYBE TERMINALLY ILL WIFE BE LETTING THEM TRY THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY? SO MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING. WE DID WRITE TO TRY IT WASN'T EASY BUT I WAS HELPED BY LINDSAY AND A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL OF THE HELPED. MARK HELPED SO MUCH AND ALL OF THEM HELPED. GREG. WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO HELP BUT IT WAS COLLOCATED, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. THE COUNTRY DID NOT WANT THE LIABILITY AND I SAID YOU DRAW UP AN AGREEMENT TAKING AWAY LIABILITY BECAUSE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES WERE VERY UNSURE AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. I GOT IT DONE AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE. RIGHT TO TRY. THINGS WE NEVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT WE ARE GETTING DONE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS WITHIN ABOUT ONE MONTH WE WILL HAVE CLOSE TO 180 FEDERAL JUDGES INCLUDING APPELLATE DIVISION JUDGES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] INCLUDING TWO GREAT NEW SUPPORT JUSTICES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH AN JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHO THEY PUT THROUGH HELL. WE PASSED SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE WANTED TO DO FOR HALF A CENTURY AND WE PASSED BE A CHOICE SO WHEN YOU'RE GREAT AND HONORED VETERANS ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR THREE WEEKS OR FIVE WEEKS OR FIVE DAYS, TEN DAYS, TWO MONTHS THEY GET AROUND THE PRIVATE DOCTOR AND WE PAY FOR THE BILL AND THEY GET THEMSELVES TAKING CARE OF INSTEAD OF DYING WHICH WAS HAPPENING. WE ALSO PASSED BE A ACCOUNTABILITY ON BEHALF OF OUR GREAT VETERANS AND THAT MEANS WHEN THEY TREAT OUR VETERANS BADLY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT IN PRIME TIME, I CAN TELL YOU. WHEN THEY TREAT OUR SECOND TROUBLED VETERANS BADLY WE CAN SAY YOU ARE FIRED. GET THE HELL OUT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S ANOTHER ONE THEY BEEN DRIVING AND IN ALL FAIRNESS THE UNIONS MADE IT VERY TOUGH AND CIVIL SERVICE MADE IT LIKE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND EVERYONE SAID YOU NEVER GET IT DONE AND I WANT TO THANK THE REPUBLICAN SENATE AND WANT TO THANK SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND KEVIN, I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE THAT WAS A GREAT JOB YOU DID ON THAT ONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD FUNDING FOR THE U.S. MILITARY $700 BILLION LAST YEAR AND 716 BILLION THIS YEAR, $738 BILLION AND YOU KNOW I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN BUDGETS BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAD TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON TODAY WITH CHINA AND RUSSIA AND WITH RADICAL ISLAM AND WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING AND I LOVE BUDGETS AND WE WILL GET TO THAT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BUT WE HAD TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY WHICH WAS TOTALLY DEPLETED. IT WAS TOTALLY DEPLETED. WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL NEW AND 35'S, F-18'S NEW SHIPS, NEW MISSILES, NEW ROCKETS -- [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE NEW EVERYTHING. AND CAME BACK WITH THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS AND THEY WERE SAYING THAT WITH THE NEW COAST GUARD CUTTERS AND WHAT A GOOD JOB THEY DONE DURING THESE HURRICANES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE ADMIRAL SAID THERE ARE THE FINEST IN THE WORLD AND THEY HAD OLD BROKEN EQUIPMENT THAT THEY HAD TO GO ON A SHOESTRING AND NOW HAVE BRAND-NEW COAST GUARD CUTTERS. WE HAD TO DO IT. THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR THE OTHER BUT WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY IS TAKING CARE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE WORKING ON THE MILITARY AND GIVE THEM A RAISE, A BEAUTIFUL RACE THEY WERE SO ENTITLED. I ALSO GOT OTHER NATO MEMBERS TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $100 BILLION OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT THEY WERE NOT PAYING AND THEY WERE DELINQUENT. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM THEY DON'T PAY AND I SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU GOT TO PAY. NATO, NOW WE ARE FINALLY MAKING IMMENSELY WEALTHY COUNTRIES PAY THE COST OF THEIR DEFENSE WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH A LOT OF THEM. THINK OF IT. WE HAD THESE IMMENSELY WEALTHY COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE PAYING FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST TO DEFEND THEM. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIGGEST EXCUSES? KING. YOU HAVE TO PAY. MR. PRIME MINISTER, YOU GOT TO PAY FOR IT OR MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'VE GOT TO PAY IT IS COSTING US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROTECT BUT DO YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST THING? I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE DID THIS FOR SO MANY YEARS, DECADES BUT YOU HAVE BEEN DEFENDING ALL ALL -- I WON'T MENTION NAMES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY -- FORGET IT. SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND THEY SAY KING, PRIME MINISTER CLEAN, NO MATTER WHAT I SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? WHAT NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED US TO DO THAT BEFORE BUT THAT THE ONLY EXCUSE BECAUSE I SAY WHY WOULD WE DO THIS AND WHY WOULD WE DEFEND YOU AND YOU COMPETE WITH US ON TRADE AND ARE IMMENSELY WEALTHY AND HAVE LOUSY TRADE DEALS THAT WE ARE RENEGOTIATING AND ULTIMATELY WHERE RENEGOTIATING ALL OF THEM BUT WHY ARE WE PROTECTING YOU? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR ANSWERS IS? BECAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. THAT'S NOT A GREAT ANSWER. SO WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS BUT I'VE GOT $100 BILLION AND THE SECRETARY OF NATO IS MY BIGGEST FAN AND UNTIL PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU HAVE TO SEE THE DATA COST OF SPENDING WAS GOING LIKE THIS AND AN ARSON WAS GOING LIKE THIS AND WE WERE DEFENDING MANY COUNTRIES THAT TREAT US VERY BADLY ON TRADE AND WE WOULD DEFENDING THEM AND NOW IT'S CHANGING AROUND WITH $100 BILLION AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. THEN I READ WHERE OBAMA IS MORE POPULAR IN GERMANY THAN TRUMP. HE'S GOT TO BE. I MAKING PEOPLE PAY THEIR BILLS. HE'S GOT TO BE. THE DAY I MORE POPULAR THAN HIM I AM NOT DOING MY JOB. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY LIKE HIM OR IN EUROPE THAN THEY LIKE TRUMP. I THINK THEY SHOULD. $100 BILLION MORE THEY ARE PAYING TO PROTECT AMERICA'S SECURITY I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE PAY THEM $150 BILLION FOR THAT PIECE TO WORK AND I WITHDREW IT AND WE PUT SECTIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THEY LIKE TO GET BACK TO BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING VERY WELL AND WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE IRAN WAS A REAL TERROR, 18 SITES OF CONFLICTION THEY WERE BEHIND EVERY ONE OF THEM IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHO KNOWS COULD'VE BEEN ELSEWHERE. I SAID WE WILL NOT DO IT, $150 BILLION, PRESIDENT OBAMA PAID AND 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. WHOEVER SOUGHT $1 MILLION PILED UP AS A PROMOTION? IN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, IT'S A LOT. IT'S A TAKE $1 MILLION AND MAKE IT $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. I'M MORE IMPRESSED WITH THAT NUMBER THEN $150 BILLION IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? $1.8 BILLION IN CASH WE GOT TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS I TERMINATED THE DEAL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM WHICH EVERY PRESIDENT SAID THEY WOULD DO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I ALSO APPROVED FOR ISRAEL THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AND IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT I SAID TO PEOPLE WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, GOLAN HEIGHTS OR THE CAPITAL OF JERUSALEM BY MOVING OUR EMBASSY THERE AND HE SAID NEITHER, SIR. WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN IRAN IS MORE IMPORTANT IN BOTH AND I SAID I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB ALL OF US TOGETHER AND AS A MOVEMENT WE DONE A GREAT JOB FOR ISRAEL. FOR YEARS YOU WANTED YOUR POLITICIANS TO APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA BUT NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU MUST NEVER FORGET THAT THE 2020 ELECTION IS ABOUT ONE THING THING, YOU. TRULY. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FUTURE AND THE FATE OF YOUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT WE DID IN 2016 AND THEY CAME FROM THE HILLS AND VALLEYS AND FROM THE CITIES AND FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING THESE FIGURES ARE SAYING WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING BACK BUT I KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN. WE GO OUT AND WE SEE THESE RALLIES, THE LIKES OF WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE EVER, EVER IN POLITICS, EVER IN POLITICS AND VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN 2020 AND A VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT TOMORROW IN NORTH CAROLINA IS A VOTE FOR THE RISE OF RADICAL SOCIALISM AND A DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CROWD BOOS] WE ARE ENTERING THIS CAMPAIGN WITH THE BEST RECORD, THE BEST RESULT, BEST AGENDA AND THE ONLY POSITIVE VISION FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND I ASCENDED AND SAID LOUDLY AND PROUDLY I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN ANY PRESIDENT OR ANY ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS DONE MORE IN 2.5 YEARS THEN WE HAVE AS A GROUP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL UP NO ONE HAS DONE WHAT WE HAVE. OUR FIRST TASK IS A GIANT VICTORY. TOMORROW, RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, WITH YOUR SUPPORT TOMORROW WE TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO FIRING SPEAKER PELOSI AND WHITNEY BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED EVERYBODY TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS TO GET OUT AND VOTE FOR DAN BISHOP AND GET OUT AND VOTE FOR GREG MURPHY. IT OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TOGETHER WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE FROM OUR HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITUATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS AND LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING DEMOCRAT RUN CITIES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. WE GO WITH TO LIFT MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO INDEPENDENCE AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL ELECT FOR THE PUBLICANS TO CONGRESS THAT GREAT A SAFE AND MODERN FAIR AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. WE WILL ENACT GREAT DEALS THE RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROBABLY STAMPED WITH THE FOUR BEAUTIFUL WORDS MADE IN THE USA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MADE IN THE USA. IF YOU WANT MADE IN AMERICA, I DON'T CARE WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER? MADE IN AMERICA OR MADE IN THE USA? WILL GO MADE IN AMERICA THEN MADE IN THE USA BUT WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER, MADE IN AMERICA? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MADE IN THE USA? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OKAY. I THINK WE KNOW THAT ANSWER. IN 2016 WE HAD IN MY OPINION THE GREATEST PHRASE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. NOW WE ARE WITHIN MOMENTS HOPEFULLY OF HAVING DESPITE WHAT YOU HEARD A FEW WEEKS AGO WHERE WE WERE HEADING THERE LIKE PLEASE, LET THERE BE A RECESSION RECESSION. THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR RESULTS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT WILL HELP THEM WIN THE ELECTION. THEY WILL NOT WIN THE ELECTION. DON'T FORGET WE ARE DOING THIS AND STILL FIGHTING THE UNFAIRNESS OF CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES ON TRADE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT GETS FIXED AND OTHER THINGS GET FIXED FIXED? WE ARE SETTING NEW RECORDS AND WE ARE PROVIDING TRADE DEALS AND FIGHTING MILITARY DEALS THAT ARE UNFAIR TO OUR COUNTRY. THINK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT ALL GETS FIXED? WE HAVE OURSELVES A COUNTRY THAT IS SO STRONG. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE HAD A PHRASE, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THE BEST. I THINK IT WAS MAYBE THE GREATEST BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT AND NOW THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO SETTING A NEW -- I THINK IT'S THE 118 TIME THAT WE WILL HAVE SET A NEW RECORD WITH THE STOCK MARKET. RIGHT? MANY, MANY TIMES. I CAN'T BE SURE BUT IT'S A LOT. I ALWAYS HAVE TO PREFACE IT. THEY WILL DO A HEADLINE THAT TRUMP DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH. THEY ALWAYS -- I'VE GOT TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. WE HAD THE GREATEST PHRASE OF ALL TIME AND EVEN THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WOULD AGREE THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, MAGA COUNTRY, NOW WE'VE LARGELY STILL HAVE A YEAR AND A HALF LITTLE BIT LESS AND CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I STOOD IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE FIRST LADY THAT FIRST NIGHT AND I SAID WELL, LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S THE BEDROOM OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. IT'S SO PERFECTLY DONE AND SO THE WAY IT WAS THAT THE BEDROOM OF THE GREAT ABE LINCOLN. HONEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THAT WAS THE FIRST NIGHT AND NOW IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND HALF THE FIRST TIME WILL BE OVER. THINK OF THAT.

IT WILL BE SAFER AND BETTER AND YOU WILL SAVE $3500 AND IT WILL BE LESS COSTLY. WE WILL TRY TO GET THAT DONE AND THEN THEY WERE FORCING YOU TO BUY LIGHT BULBS THAT COST A FORTUNE.

TRUMP AND THE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ACCOMPANIED BY VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES MIKE PENCE. UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS KELLY CRAFT, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. [APPLAUSE] GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. ACROSS THE COUNTRIES AND CULTURES WE COME TOGETHER AS ONE UNITED BY OUR BELIEF , THIS UNDERSTANDING IS NOT UNIVERSAL. TODAY ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE OF FAITH FACE A RISING TIDE OF PERSECUTION. WE HAVE WITNESSED HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST WORSHIPERS IN MOSQUES, CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES. WE HAVE WATCHED THE ARBITRARY DETENTION AND MISTREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. AND WE HAVE FELT THE CHILL OF A WORLD THAT SEEMS INCREASINGLY DISINTERESTED IN DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE TO EXERCISE A SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEF. AS LEADERS, AT TIMES SUCH AS THIS CALLS US TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT ONLY IN WORD BUT IN DEED WHICH IS WHY I'M SO EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED AND HONORED WE ARE JOINED BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THESE MEN, THE UNITED STATES IS NOT ONLY , JUST TWO MONTHS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED VICTIMS OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AT A HISTORIC EVENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE FREEDOM AND YOU'D THE , IN THE UNITED STATES. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BECOME A WATCHFUL DEFENDER RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE 2019 MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THE LARGEST FREEDOM EVENT OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. WE ANTICIPATE A FRUITFUL DISCUSSION TODAY ON HOW WE CAN EXPAND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, GUARANTEE THE SANCTITY OF HALF , OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND COMBAT RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AROUND THE WORLD AND I'M SO DELIGHTED YOU JOINED US FOR THIS EVENT. IT IS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO THINK OF A BETTER PERSON TO INTRODUCE TO A GATHERING OF THE FREEDOM OF RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD. HE KNOWS WHAT RELIGION IS, WHAT SUPPORT IT CAN GIVE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO SOCIETY'S. HE IS AN UNPRETENTIOUS MAN WHO NOT ONLY BELIEVES IN THE POWER OF RELIGION, HE LIVES HIS RELIGION. WITH RESPECT AND EVEN PIETY. HE RESPECTS THE FAITH OF OTHERS, HE IS THAT GREAT EXEMPLAR, A HARD-WORKING FAMILY MAN BORN IN INDIANA PROUD OF HIS STATE, PROUDER OF HIS COUNTRY AND A FIRST-CLASS DEMONSTRATION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WISDOM IN SELECTING THOSE WHO SERVE HIM CLOSEST. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, MY FRIEND, MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: MR. PRESIDENT, SECRETARY-GENERAL ITERIS , SECRETARY-GENERAL GUTERRES, AMBASSADOR CRAFT AND SECRETARY POMPEO, DISTINCT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WORLD LEADERS AND MOST ESPECIALLY TO THE COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN WHO JOINED US HERE TODAY WHO HAVE SUFFERED PERSECUTION AND VIOLENCE FOR SIMPLY LIVING OUT YOUR FAITH. WHETHER THAT BE CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM, BUDDHISM OR ISLAM. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO REAFFIRM AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO WHAT THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT EVERY PERSON IS ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. THE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED OUR FIRST FREEDOM IS THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. TODAY, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BECOMES THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO CONVENE A MEETING HERE IN THE UNITED NATIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE HIM. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THERE IS NO BETTER TIME FOR A MEETING LIKE THIS ON THE WORLD STAGE AS WE GATHER HERE THE UNITED NATIONS MORE THAN 80% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVE IN NATIONS WHERE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS THREATENED. OR BAND. REGIME IN A RAN BRUTALLY PERSECUTES CHRISTIANS, SUNNIS. IN IRAQ, IRAN BACKED MILITIAS TERRORIZE CHRISTIANS AND HE IS EDIE'S WERE NEARLY WIPED OUT BY ISIS RECENT CAMPAIGN OF GENOCIDE. THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN CHINA HAS ARRESTED CHRISTIAN PASTORS, BANNED THE SALE OF BIBLES, DEMOLISHED CHURCHES AND IMPRISONED MORE THAN A MILLION , IN THE MUSLIM POPULATION. THE REGIME OF DANIEL ORTEGA IS WAGING WAR ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN NICARAGUA AND VENEZUELA THE DICTATOR NICOLAS MADURO USES ANTI-HATE LAWS TO PROSECUTE CLERGY EVEN AS THEY SPREAD ANTI-SEMITISM BY TRIVIALIZING THE HOLOCAUST. COMMUTERS OF FAITH ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD HAVE FACED UNSPEAKABLE UNSPEAKABLE ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN PLACES OF WORSHIP. SHOCKING THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD. IN OCTOBER, 11 JEWS WERE MURDERED AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA. IN MARCH, A GUNMAN KILLED 51 MUSLIMS OF PRAYER AT TWO MOSQUES IN CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND AND JUST A MONTH LATER SUICIDE BOMBERS MURDERED MORE THAN 300 CHRISTIANS DURING EASTER SERVICES AT THREE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES. THESE ATTACKS STRIKE AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING FREE PEOPLE HOLD SACRED. AND THE THREATS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE ATTACKS ON PEOPLE OF FAITH UNDERSCORE WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN SUCH DECISIVE ACTION SINCE THE VERY FIRST DAYS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD AND PROMOTE OUR NATIONS PROUD TRADITION OF ADVANCING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THAT CONTINUES TODAY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION THE UNITED STATES CREATED THE GENOCIDE RECOVERY AND PERSECUTION RESPONSE PROGRAM AND WE PROVIDED MORE THAN $370 MILLION TO EIGHT ETHNIC MINORITIES AND FAITH COMMUNITIES PERSECUTED BY ISIS IN IRAQ AND THROUGHOUT THE REGION. EARLIER THIS YEAR AT THE PRESENCE DIRECTION THE SECRETARY OF STATE HELD THE SECOND ANNUAL MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM PROVIDING MORE THAN 1000 CIVIL SOCIETY AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND 100 DIFFERENT NATIONS TO THE LARGEST EVENT OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. LAST YEAR AT THE INAUGURAL MINISTERIAL AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION WE ESTABLISH THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FUND WHICH ALREADY HAS RECEIVED NEARLY $5 MILLION IN PLEDGES AND GIVEN OVER 435 RAPID RESPONSE GRANTS TO THOSE PERSECUTED FOR THEIR DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS. ANTEDATE THIS EFFORT HAS HELPED SOME 2000 VICTIMS OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AROUND THE WORLD. AS THE PRESIDENT OFTEN SAYS AMERICA'S NATION OF FAITH. AND WE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION OF EVERY PERSON, OF EVERY RACE AND EVERY CREED TO LIVE, TO WORK, TO WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF THEIR CONSCIENCE. GIVING EVIDENCE OF HIS PASSION FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, THE PRESIDENT WILL ANNOUNCE ADDITIONAL STEPS THE UNITED STATES WILL TAKE TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES AND DEFEND PEOPLE OF FAITH AROUND THE WORLD. THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY AND I ALWAYS SAY IT , IT IS A HIGH HONOR TO INDUCE THIS PRESIDENT. TO BE HERE THIS HISTORIC GATHERING, LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD STANDING FOR THE FIRST FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS AMONG THE GREATEST HONORS I'VE EVER HAD. SO LET ME SAY IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND DISTINCT PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A TIRELESS CHAMPION OF THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND PEOPLE OF EVERY FAITH IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD, THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] AN HONOR IT IS. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. AND GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR THE OUTSTANDING JOB HE IS DOING AND HAS BEEN FANTASTIC AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COUNTRY. LIKEWISE SECONDARY MIKE POMPEO, AMBASSADOR KELLY CRAFT, SECRETARY ROSS, SECRETARY MINUTIA AND INVESTOR SAM BROWNBACK ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WE HAVE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR CABINET AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE HAVE DONE A LOT. THE JOHNSON A MINUTE DOESN'T GET SPOKEN ABOUT ENOUGH BUT IN VERY PROUD TO SAY WE HAVE OBLITERATED THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT WITHIN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT NOW WE CAN LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO LISTEN TO RELIGIOUS LEADERS WITHOUT RECRIMINATION AGAINST THEM, IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING AND I SAID THAT THAT BEGINNING AND I SAY THAT NOW IS SOME THING A VERY PROUD OF. WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL THE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL COULD BE HERE ALONG WITH SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS AND MY FRIENDS, WORLD LEADERS I'VE GOT TO KNOW A LOT OF THEM AND I CAN IMAGINE YOU KNOW ALL OF THEM. I WOULD IMAGINE. IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO THINK MY DAUGHTER IVANKA FOR BEING HERE. SHE WORKED SO HARD ON ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. THANK YOU THE UNITED STATES IS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT OUR RIGHTS DO NOT COME FROM GOVERNMENT, THEY COME FROM GOD, THIS IMMORTAL TRUTH IS PROCLAIMED IN OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND ENSHRINED IN OUR FIRST AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION, BILL OF RIGHTS, OUR FOUNDERS UNDERSTOOD THAT NO RIGHT IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO A PEACEFUL PROSPEROUS AND VIRTUOUS SOCIETY THAN THE RIGHT TO FOLLOW ONE'S RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. REGRETTABLY, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ENJOYED BY AMERICAN CITIZENS IS RARE IN THE WORLD. APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE WORLD POPULATION LIVE IN COUNTRIES WHERE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES THREATEN, RESTRICTED OR EVEN BAND. WHEN I HEARD THAT NUMBER I SAID PLEASE GO BACK AND CHECK BECAUSE IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE CORRECT. SADLY IT WAS. 80%. AS WE SPEAK, JEWS, CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS, BUDDHISTS, HINDUS, SIKHS, MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF FAITH ARE BEING JAILED, SANCTIONED, TORTURED AND EVEN MURDERED EVEN AT THE HANDS OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT SIMPLY FOR EXPRESSING THEIR DEEPLY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. SO HARD TO BELIEVE. TODAY WITH ONE CLEAR VOICE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CALLS UPON THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO END RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] , [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] TO STOP THE CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE OF FAITH, RELEASE PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE, REPEAL LAWS AND RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND BELIEF, PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, THE DEFENSELESS AND THE OPPRESSED, AMERICA STANDS WITH BELIEVERS IN EVERY COUNTRY WHO ASK ONLY FOR THE FREEDOM TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE FAITH THAT IS WITHIN THEIR OWN HEARTS AS PRESIDENT, PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN. LAST YEAR OUR SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO HOSTED THE FIRST EVER MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THIS YEAR'S MINISTERIAL, SECRETARY POMPEO ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CREATE THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ALLIANCE, AN ALLIANCE OF LIKE-MINDED NATIONS DEVOTED TO CONFRONTING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I'VE APPOINTED A SPECIAL ENVOY TO MONITOR AND COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR ALMOST 250 MILLION CHRISTIANS AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE PERSECUTED WHO HAVE FAITH IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 11 CHRISTIANS ARE KILLED EVERY DAY FOR THE FOLLOWING , JUST THINK OF THIS, 11 CHRISTIANS A DAY FOR FOLLOWING THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST, WHO WOULD EVEN THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE? IN THIS DAY AND AGE, WHO WOULD THINK IF THAT IS POSSIBLE? WITH US TODAY IS PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON, WHO WAS IMPRISONED IN TURKEY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. MIGHT MINISTRATION WAS ROAD TO BRING HIM BACK HOME AFTER A VERY SHORT AND RESPECTFUL NEGOTIATION WITH A VERY STRONG MAN AND A MAN WHO HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE FORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT ERDOGAN OF TURKEY. I CALLED THE PRESIDENT AND SAID HE HAS BEEN IN HIS , HE IS AN INNOCENT MAN. I DON'T THINK PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS TRY TOO HARD UNFORTUNATELY BUT I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENTE ERDOGAN AND I WANT TO THANK ANDREW. WHERE IS HE? [APPLAUSE] WE DID A GOOD JOB WITH THAT NEGOTIATION PER YOU GOT BACK. IT WASN'T EASY, WASN'T PRETTY, BUT YOU GOT BACK AND WE ARE PROUD OF YOU. YOU HAVE A GREAT FAMILY. THE LOVE FROM SO MANY PEOPLE, I HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT SO CONGRATULATIONS AND THEY UNDERSTAND YOU ARE DOING FANTASTIC WORK WITH YOUR FAMILY. THANK YOU, ANDREW. [APPLAUSE] I ALSO WANT TO THANK FRANKLIN GRAHAM BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SO INSTRUMENTAL IN EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING, SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN SO MANY WAYS INCLUDE FLOODS AND HURRICANES AND EVERY TIME I GO I SEE HIM AND HE'S ALWAYS THERE BEFORE ME. I'M GOING TO BEAT HIM ONE DAY BUT HE IS ALWAYS AT THESE PLACES OF REALLY DISASTER AREAS. HE IS RIGHT THERE, INCREDIBLE LARGE STAFF OF VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] IN JULY I MET WITH SURVIVORS OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND WERE HONORED THAT MANY OF THEM COULD BE HERE TODAY AS WELL. SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF STATE-SPONSORED PERSECUTION, OTHERS OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS, NO MATTER THE CASE AMERICA WILL ALWAYS BE A VOICE FOR VICTIMS OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION EVERYWHERE NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, YOU HAVE A PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. COULD I ASK THOSE FOLKS TO STAND UP PLEASE? PLEASE STAND UP. [APPLAUSE] IN RECENT TIMES THE WORLD HAS ALSO WITNESSED DEVASTATING ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN SACRED PLACES OF WORSHIP, IN 2016 AND 85-YEAR-OLD CATHOLIC PRIEST WAS VICIOUSLY KILLED WHILE CELEBRATING MASS IN NORMANDY, FRANCE. THE PAST YEAR THE UNITED STATES ENDURED HORRIFYING ANTI-SOMATIC ATTACKS AGAINST JEWISH AMERICANS AT SYNAGOGUES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND CALIFORNIA. IN MARCH, MUSLIMS PRAYING WITH THEIR FAMILIES WERE SADISTICALLY MURDERED IN NEW ZEALAND. ON EASTER SUNDAY THIS YEAR, TERRORISTS BOMBED CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN SRI LANKA, KILLING HUNDREDS OF FAITHFUL WORSHIPERS SO WE , THESE PEOPLE ATTACKS ARE A WOUND ON ALL HUMANITY. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES OF EVERY FAITH, WE ARE ALSO URGING EVERY NATION TO INCREASE PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT OF CRIMES AGAINST RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES. THERE CAN BE NO GREATER CRIME THAN THAT. THIS INCLUDES MEASURES TO PREVENT THE INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF RELIGIOUS SITES AND RELICS. TODAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL DEDICATE AN ADDITIONAL $25 MILLION TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND RELIGIOUS SITES AND REP , RELICS. WE ARE ALSO PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY MANY FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS WE ANNOUNCE A VERY CRITICAL INITIATIVE. THE UNITED STATES IS FORMING A COALITION OF U.S. BUSINESSES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS BEEN DONE. THIS WILL ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PROTECT PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS IN THE WORKPLACE. THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BRILLIANT LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEN AND WOMEN ON EARTH. THEY KNOW HOW THINGS GET DONE AND THEY KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS AND THEY ARE WITH US NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THIS EXTENT. FIRST TIME EVER AND WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE YOU IN THE ROOM. GREAT BUSINESS LEADERS, GREAT PEOPLE OF STRENGTH, TOO OFTEN PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER PREACH DIVERSITY WHILE SILENCING OR CENSORING THE FAITHFUL. TRUE TOLERANCE MEANS RESPECTING THE RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR DEEPLY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. FOR I CONCLUDE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SURVIVORS IN THE ROOM FOR THEIR COURAGE, YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION TO THE WORLD, YOUR MIND IS THAT NO FORCE ON EARTH IS STRONGER THAN THE FAITH OF RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL FOREVER REMAIN AT YOUR SIDE AND THE SIDE OF ALL THOSE WHO SEEK RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. TODAY I ASK ALL NATIONS TO JOIN US IN THIS URGENT MORAL DUTY, WE ASK THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD TO HONOR THE ETERNAL RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON TO FOLLOW THEIR CONSCIENCE AND LIVE BY THEIR FAITH AND GIVE GLORY TO GOD. THE UNITED STATES HAS A VITAL ROLE IN THIS CRITICAL MISSION. SECRETARY-GENERAL GUTERRES WILL NOW SHARE WORDS ON THE EFFORT TO PROMOTE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR ALL AND HE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION OF WHAT WE ARE IN THIS ROOM FOR SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE, GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS THE FAITHFUL AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

CSPANDT279201914	Donald Trump	2019-09-27	President Trump Remarks at Hispanic Heritage Month Reception	That's very nice. Thank you. A lot of spirit. (Applause.) A lot of spirit. How are you? Well, thank you all for being here today. And I'm delighted to once again celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with you at the White House. Right? This evening, we come together to honor the devotion, and the drive, and the faith, and genius, and exceptional achievements of our incredible Hispanic American community, right? Everybody here - Hispanic and/or Hispanic American - who isn't? (Applause.) Do we have anybody? Do we have anybody who isn't? I don't think so. How are you? Great man of faith. Great. Hispanic Americans have been a big part of our national story from the very, very beginning of our country. You work hard. You raise your strong and beautiful families. You care for your neighbors. (Applause.) You start businesses, you create jobs, and you teach your children to love our country and to cherish our God-given freedom. Right? Hispanic Americans enrich America in countless ways, and we will always honor this solemn commitment to you. I will always be with you, and I think you know that maybe better than anybody knows it. (Applause.) All of our citizens - every single day, we're fighting for you. We're putting your needs, your families, and your futures first. We're putting America first. We're putting the people in this room - we're putting you first. All right? And we're delighted to be joined for this special occasion by Vice President Mike Pence, who is doing a fantastic job. (Applause.) Say a couple of words, Mike. Say a couple of words. Come on. We have some very powerful, important people that have been doing a fantastic job on the Cabinet. Administrator Andrew Wheeler - where's Andrew? Where is Andrew? (Applause.) Thank you. Whoa, Andrew. I thought you were taller than that. I thought you were taller than that, Andrew. Deputy Secretary Patrick Pizzella. Patrick. Thank you. Thank you, Patrick. (Applause.) Good job, Patrick. U.S. Treasurer - who everybody know - Jovita Carranza. (Inaudible.) (Applause.) Thank you, Jovita. A great football player at Ohio State - fantastic. He went into the NFL and he was tough as can be. A lot of people don't know that. He's a tough cookie and he's a friend of mine: Representative Anthony Gonzalez. Thank you. Along with a lot of other political people, and state and local leaders, and a lot of diplomats. All the diplomats, thank you very much. We always love diplomats in the White House because we can use diplomats sometimes.  I also want to thank Christine D'Clario for her beautiful rendition of our National Anthem. Thank you, Christine! Great job. Last week, I had the privilege of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to another phenomenal member of the Hispanic American community: the legendary pitcher for the New York Yankees - I think one of the great pitchers of all time; certainly, the greatest reliever of all time - Mariano Rivera. He was something. Boy, his record - you know, he was up - and he's been a friend of mine for a long time, and - as a Yankee fan. But there's never been any human being that broke more bats. I said, "What do you do?" He threw a heavy ball. I said, "Mariano, how do you do that?" He said, "I don't know. God just gave me this ability." But you'd have people up there, and those bats were breaking left and right. It was a heavy ball, and his record was incredible. He - his earned run average in all of the playoffs - and I think he has a record for games played. But his record was - his earned run average was less than one run a game. And they won many, many World Series, and many games. So he's a special person and a really nice person, too. Mariano is one of millions of the outstanding men and women of Hispanic heritage who has excelled in every dimension of American society, and helped to build our community into the greatest nation the world has ever seen. Today, thanks to our pro-American economic policies - you all know this - Hispanic Americans are thriving like they have never thrived before. We've created more than 6 million new jobs since my election. More than 1 million Latinas have entered the workforce. (Applause.) And, as you probably heard me say on occasion, Hispanic American unemployment right now is at the lowest level in the history of our country. (Applause.) How do they beat us in a debate? When they say, "We're going to get Hispanic vote…" And I say, "Really?" The lowest level in the history - I mean, it's the lowest in the history of our country. So that's something special. Since 2016, Hispanic American median household income has risen by $1,500, and is now the highest level in the history of our country. (Applause.) How about that? Not doing bad, right? Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home, and we've never seen these kind of numbers before. So I'm very proud to report that more Latinas own small businesses than ever before. (Applause.) And - you know, great business people. When I was out on that business market, I hated competing with you. (Laughter.) Smart and tough and vicious, but I won't say that tonight. We have one of these amazing entrepreneurs with us tonight. Maria Rios is the President and CEO of Nation Waste, Inc. And she's got an incredible story to tell. Maria, please come forward. Please.  My honor. Thank you. Well, thank you, Maria. That's a fantastic job. I was going to say maybe you should run for office, you did so well. But after seeing how well she's done, I think you should just continue to do what you're doing. You're doing very well. Thank you, Maria. As we empower women in our own economy, last month, my daughter, Ivanka, traveled to South America - including Colombia, Paraguay, and Argentina - to highlight the W-GDP initiative, the critical role women play in creating economic opportunity, and the administration's commitment to empowering women all around the world. It was really something. And Ivanka has worked so hard for jobs and for women. And gets no credit for it, but she doesn't even care, I tell you. (Applause.) Well, she gets credit with the people that count. You know that. (Applause.) That's the people that we all know. She has done, really, a fantastic job for women and also for jobs. Thirteen million additional jobs. And she'll go around and see all of these big companies, and they'll hire and really empower. It's something very special to watch. Every day, my administration is working to deliver a more prosperous future. America is winning again and America is being respected again like it hasn't been respected in a long, long time. Our country right now is more powerful than ever before. We have achieved record funding for the U.S. military - two and a half trillion dollars over the last three years. We've rebuilt it. When I was just coming into office, our military was totally depleted. It was depleted like you wouldn't want to even hear about, and it's been rebuilt. And it's bigger, better, stronger. We have an amazing military. Two and half trillion dollars. And we'll work on the budgets. But before we do the budgets, we have to rebuild our military. I think you understand. Otherwise - (applause) - otherwise budgets don't matter, right? Otherwise budgets don't matter. And we delivered a beautiful pay raise also for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine. (Applause.) So, they're very happy. More than a quarter of a million Hispanic Americans bravely serve in our Armed Forces. That's a lot of people. And we're profoundly grateful to each and every one of them. (Applause.) Great. And we're also incredibly thankful for the thousands of Hispanic Americans serving on the frontlines, protecting our borders. (Applause.) And you know better than any people how important borders are. You know better than anybody. You know, my poll numbers with Hispanics went way up. And they said, "I wonder how that is? You want strong borders." Well, the Hispanics know better than anyone. (Applause.) You don't want people coming into our country that are going to do harm to you. And, frankly, you don't want people coming into our country that are going to take your jobs. It's very simple. So, at first, I was even a little surprised to see those numbers. Mike and I were discussing it. And then, all of the sudden, it made a lot of sense. It made a lot of sense. But we - right now, Mexico has been a tremendous help to us - the President of Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border. They've never had any. We've literally never had virtually any Mexican soldiers, and we have 27,000 now. We can't get the Democrats to do what they're supposed to do with the loopholes or with asylum. No, they're not doing their job. We call them the - they're not - they're not doing their job. The "do-nothings," right? The do-nothings. You're better off saying it. You're better - you're better off saying it. You people are really out there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So, we're really doing a job with borders. We're really doing a job with the economy - number-one economy. We're at number one at everything. We have the strongest military - by the way, strongest military by far, anywhere in the world. And we're going to keep it that way, if not make it even stronger. More than - And, hopefully, by the way - hopefully, we don't have to use it. Hopefully - and, you know, interestingly, the stronger it gets, the less likely it is that we have to use it, you know? That's sort of the way it goes in life, unfortunately. More than half of our Border Patrol agents are Hispanic, and more than a quarter of our ICE agents - and those ICE agents are incredible, and they are Hispanic. And they are tough. They are tough. They're patriots. And we're - we're moving MS-13 gang members and some of these horrible people - (applause) - boom. They're being brought out. They're being brought out of our country by the thousands - by the thousands. And they are bad. As you say, bad - they're bad hombres. You better believe it. (Laughter.) He's - he said - (laughter). I used that word once, and nobody has let me forget it, right? Many of these agents are themselves immigrants or the children of immigrants. And they're incredible people - extraordinary patriots who uphold our laws and safeguard our communities. We're honored to have with us one of our finest: Patrol Agent Jose Avina. (Applause.) And, Jose, if you could come up. Come on up, Jose. Say a few words. Thank you. Wow. Jose, you come from an incredible group of people, I'll tell you what. They're brave, they're strong, they love our country. We appreciate the work you do. And I don't think anyone how much we appreciate it. You don't get the credit you deserve, but the people appreciate it, more than anybody would know. And I want you to know that we will always stand with the heroes of Border Patrol, ICE, and all of law enforcement. They have done just incredible work. To ensure a safe and prosperous future, we also are advancing the cause of human liberty in our hemisphere. We are also, by the way, advancing the cause of religious liberty. (Applause.) Right? We just talked about that at the United Nations. We've confronted the corrupt communist dictatorship in Cuba, cancelling - (applause) - cancelling the last administration's one-sided deal with the Castro regime. It was a - just another bad deal. Very one-sided. Very unfair to the United States. We're making good deals now for the United States. It's about time. Our deal with China, our deal with so many - they're all coming along very, very nicely. A little patience - to make them great, you need a little patience. Our farmers, by the way, have been incredible. They've been incredible. And now China is back buying again. They're buying a lot of our agricultural products. A lot of things are happening. The United States and our partners have also built a historic coalition of 55 countries dedicated to the future of democracy for the people of Venezuela. Right? (Applause.) Great people. And this evening, we are proud to welcome ambassadors from many nations taking part in this incredible coalition. Please put up your hands. A lot of ambassadors. We have some really great, great people. (Applause.) Thank you. Great people. A lot of very, very terrific, patriotic people. They love their country. They love our country. It's all working out really well. And the relationships have rarely been better, and probably never been better. On behalf of the American people, we want to thank you all, and thank you all for being here. Thank you very much.  And we will not allow the horrors of socialism and communism to be repeated in this century. America stands with the brave people of Cuba, and Nicaragua, and Venezuela - (applause) - in their righteous struggle for freedom. Someday soon, the Western Hemisphere will be the first fully-free hemisphere in human history. Did you know that? Human history. (Applause.) It's going to happen. Hope it happens during my term - let's say over the next 16, 18, maybe 20 years. (Laughter and applause.) We have just driven the media crazy with that. In this noble quest, we know that our cherished Hispanic American citizens are among the fiercest defenders of our shared American values. Together, we believe in freedom, we believe in justice, we believe in the rule of law, we trust in God, and we cherish the dignity of every human life. This evening, we are grateful to be joined by Martha Avila, the President of the Heartbeat of Miami Medical Clinics - doing an incredible job.  Martha has helped thousands of mothers choose life. Martha, please come up and say a few words. Let us know about the great job you've done. I already know, but they don't. Thank you, Martha. That's beautiful. Thank you, Martha. Great job. Well, thank you very much, Martha. And every day, millions of Hispanic Americans like Martha are making tremendous contributions, achieving extraordinary breakthroughs, and enriching every corner of this incredible country of ours. There is no part of American society you have not made better - Hispanic Americans. There is no aspect of American life you have not made stronger. And I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that we could not be prouder of our Hispanic American community than we are today. So to all of you here today On behalf of Mike and myself and the Cabinet - this is a great Cabinet that we have, and I want to thank them for being here. But I want to thank you for your devotion to your country. Thank you for your contribution to our culture. And thank you for helping make America greater than ever before. It is greater than ever before. Remember that. God bless you all. And God Bless America. Thank you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?464799-1/president-trump-remarks-hispanic-heritage-month-reception	President Trump delivered remarks at a Hispanic Heritage Month reception at the White House.

[CHEERING] FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS, DEMOCRATS HAVE WAGED A NONSTOP BATTLE TO OVERTURN YOUR VOTE, OVERRULE YOUR VOICE, OVERRIDE YOUR VALUES, AND OVERTHROW THE RESULTS OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 2016. [CHEERING] YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMEN, THE REAL SENATORS AND REAL CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY, THEY ARE NOT STANDING , THE GOOD PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WILL NEVER STAND FOR IT. IT'S A HOAX. [CHEERING] THE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING TO RESTORE THE RIGID POLITICAL CLASS THAT THROUGH OPEN OUR NATION'S BORDERS, SHIPPED AWAY OUR JOBS, SACRIFICED OUR WEALTH, SURRENDERED OUR SOVEREIGNTY, FLOODED OUR CITIES WITH DRUGS AND CRIME, AND BOGGED US DOWN IN ONE FOREIGN WAR AFTER ANOTHER. THE ENDLESS WARS HAVE TO STOP. [CHEERING] WE ARE DIRECTLY TAKING ON THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF CORRUPT DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS, DEEP STATE BUREAUCRATS, AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. [BOOING] IT'S REALLY FUNNY. I SEE ALL THOSE RED LIGHTS. THAT MEANS YOU ARE LIVE, RIGHT? AS SOON AS I START TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS, I SEE THOSE LIGHTS GO OFF SO FAST. BUT THEN THEY COME BACK ON. YOU KNOW WHY THEY COME BACK ON? LAST NIGHT, BY FAR, ALL OVER CABLE, THE HIGHEST-RATED SHOW WAS WHAT WE DID IN MINNESOTA, A STATE WE ARE GOING TO WIN. [CHEERING] THAT'S WHY THEY COME BACK ON. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. THEY MAY HATE TRUMP BUT THEY WANT TO GET THOSE RATINGS. HEY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND 12, 16 YEARS WHEN I'M NO LONGER PRESIDENT? THE RATINGS ARE GOING TO TANK. I ACTUALLY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ENDORSE ME. [CHEERING] HE SLIDES INTO THE UKRAINE, HE FLIES INTO UKRAINE, HE WALKS OUT WITH $168,000 A MONTH. $3 MILLION. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A GASOLINE TANK LOOKS LIKE. [BOOING] THEY ARE PAYING HIM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MONTH. HE SLIDES INTO CHINA AND HE TAKES OUT $1.5 BILLION. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I MADE A GREAT CHINA DEAL TODAY FOR ENERGY, FOR THE FARMERS. [CHEERING] PRES. TRUMP: FOR THE BANKS. FOR SOME MANY, TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE GREATS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, IT WILL BE $50 BILLION IN BOND PURCHASES. I DON'T THINK OUR FARMERS CAN PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, THAT'S OK. SHOULD WE MAKE IT 20? I SAID, MAKE IT 50. OUR FARMERS WILL BUY MORE LAND AND THEY WILL BUY BIGGER TRACTORS. [CHEERING] THEY ACTUALLY SAID, I WANT MY FARMERS. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK. WE CAN PRODUCE THIS, IT'S TOO MUCH. WE CAN'T PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I GOT CHINA TO ORDER A LOT. [CHEERING] IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE CHINA, IN THEIR RECORD YEAR, THEY WILL CATCH IT. SHIFT GOT FOUR PINOCCHIO'S FOR MAKING UP WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE CALL. THE BIGGEST YEAR WAS $60 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL. THAT'S A LOT OF CORN. 16 BILLION WAS THE BIGGEST YEAR. THEY ARE GOING TO BUY 40-50 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AGRICULTURE. [CHEERING] MY PEOPLE SAID TO ME, THEY CAN'T DO IT. THEY CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, MY PEOPLE WANTED TO STOP IT 20. I SAID, I'M NOT STOPPING AT 20. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK AND SAY, SIR, WE CAN'T DO IT. I LOVE MY FARMERS. THEY WILL BE AT THEIR BUSY , OUT THERE. THERE WILL BE MORE TRACTORS SOLD. THEY WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER AND MORE POWERFUL. THEY WILL BE MADE BY AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE JOHN DEERE. [CHEERING] FOR YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN THAT ARE HERE, THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A DEAL. THIS WAS PHASE ONE. YOU HAVE TO SEIZE THESE , SEE THESE. THEY'RE HAPPY TO DO IT. WE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. LET ME GET BACK TO BIDEN. RIGHT? [BOOING] HE WALKED OUT OF CHINA. HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION. I SAID, YOU KNOW, THOSE AREN'T THE SAME GUYS I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FROM CHINA FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. THOSE GUYS DON'T GIVE YOU 1.5 BILLION IF YOU KNOW NOTHING. THAT'S NOT THE SAME CHINESE PEOPLE I WANT TO MEET. INSTEAD OF $50 BILLION, IT WOULD BE $500 BILLION WORTH OF CORN. IT'S A CROOKED DEAL. THE FAKE NEWS IS ALWAYS COVERING IT. [BOOING] RIGHT? THE FAKE NEWS. THEY GO, THE CLAIM IS UNSUBSTANTIATED. WITH ME, AN , ANY CLAIM IS OK. WITH THEM, WHY THE CLAIM IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. I SAY, IT'S NOT UNSUBSTANTIATED. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF UKRAINE AND DID NOTHING. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF CHINA. HOW TOUGH IS CHINA? I CALLED ONE OF THE BIGGEST PEOPLE ON WALL STREET. ONE OF MY BIG, POWERFUL GUYS. I SAID, LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF DOING THAT? HE SAID, ZERO. I SAID, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ON WALL STREET, STEVE. YOU ARE THE BIGGEST. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES YOU CAN DO THAT? HE SAID, EVEN THE BIG ONES CAN'T DO THAT. FOR A GUY TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET WITH NO EXPERIENCE, A BAD TRACK RECORD, JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY. HE WALKS AWAY WITH 1.5 BILLION. THESE CROOKED PEOPLE SAY, THIS IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. [BOOING] CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY WALKED OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION? THEY WOULDN'T BE SAYING, TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. THEY WOULD BE SAYING, WHERE'S THE NEAREST CELL? THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING. IT'S A DISGRACE WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A WHOLE BIG FAT DISGRACE. IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW WHY? WE ARE HERE AND THEY ARE NOT. [CHEERING] THE DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA, THEY ARE PARTNERS. THEY ARE PARTNERS. OK? YOU EVER SEE , WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY ARE SAYING IT'S A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A CRISIS. YOU HAD CARAVAN'S, WE STOPPED IT. THE WALL IS BEING BUILT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. [CHEERING] REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS AGO? A MANUFACTURED CRISIS ON ABC. NBC. ABC AGAIN, MANUFACTURED. CNN, CROOKED AS HELL. A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. CBS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. IT'S A WORD THAT WAS NEVER USED. NOW EVERYTHING ON NETWORK , EVERY SINGLE NETWORK USED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S COLLUSION. IT'S COLLUSION. [CHEERING] THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION. WITH US, THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION RIGHT THERE. THEY COLLUDED AND THEY CONSPIRED TO SABOTAGE OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. THEY WANT TO DECEIVE THE AMERICAN VOTER. THEY WANT TO HURT THE AMERICAN VOTER. WE HAD AN ELECTION. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GREATER VICTORY THAN THE VICTORY WE HAD IN 2016. WE WILL HAVE A BIGGER ONE IN 2020. [CHEERING] THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO STOP US FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS WITH A LOT OF CRACK , CR AP. THE FIRST FROM , TIME I HEARD ABOUT RUSSIA, THEY SAID, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. HAVE YOU COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA? I LAUGHED. I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIDDING. SOME OF THE IS CAME UP. THE YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. I KNOW WHERE IT IS. I DON'T DEAL WITH IT. I TOLD THE GUYS 12 YEARS AGO, HE WAS FROM RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW. THEY COME UP AGAIN. SIR, RUSSIA KEEPS COMING UP. DINO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? IT'S A WITCHHUNT. THIS IS THE INSURANCE POLICY. THIS WAS THE INSURANCE POLICY. REMEMBER? FROM THE TWO LOVERS. IF SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. THESE PEOPLE ARE CORRUPT. THESE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING. THE TWO LOVERS. THEY PUT IT ON THE FBI SERVER. SO THEIR SPOUSES WOULDN'T FIND OUT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR PRIVATE. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR THEM, DID IT? [BOOING] LISA, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU LISA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT. LISA. SHE WILL WIN 100 MILLION. JUST IN CASE, MY DARLING, I LOVE YOU. JUST IN CASE SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. WE WILL TAKE HIM OUT.

I HEAR THE WORD IS NOT TOO GOOD. THE WORD IS SHE'S NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE. WE'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH THIS SO-CALLED INSURANCE POLICY BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THEIR PILLAGING AND PLUNDERING AND HOAXES. [CHEERING] THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS POLICIES ARE CRAZY. THE POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT. THEIR CANDIDATES ARE TERRIBLE. THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN AN ELECTION SO THEY ARE PURSUING AN ILLEGAL, INVALID, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL BULLSHIT IMPEACHMENT. [CHEERING] [CHANTING] THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND CON ARTISTS. PERPETRATING HOAXES AND WITCHHUNTS. A MAN LIKE GREG GERRIT, GREAT GUY. HE WROTE A BOOK AND THE BOOK TELLS YOU THE WHOLE STORY. BESTSELLER BOOK. GREAT GUY. SO MANY. SO MANY. HE'S NOT A LAWYER BUT HE'S BETTER THAN THE LAWYERS. HE'S CALLED STREETSMART. SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. JOHN SULLIVAN HOW ABOUT THESE FRAUDULENT WRITERS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES? THEY HAVE TO GIVE BACK THEIR PULITZER PRIZE. THAT IS A FIX. I JUST WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR TALKING ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA. PEOPLE WERE RIGHT, LIKE SEAN HANNITY. RUSH LIMBAUGH. LAURA INGRAHAM AND TUCKER CARLSON. JUDGE JEANINE. AND FRANKLY, THE BEST SHOW BY FAR IN THE MORNING IS FOX AND FRIENDS. HOW ABOUT LOU DOBBS? VARNEY IS GREAT. AND MARIA BARTIROMO. MANY OTHERS. WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE GETTING THE REAL FULL OF SURPRISE? THEY WERE RIGHT. THEY CALLED IT RIGHT. THE TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, THEY ARE DISHONEST, HORRIBLE. I THINK VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A PHONY DEAL. THERE WRITERS GET FULL OF SURPRISES , PULLITZER PRIZES. THE ONES THAT REALLY GOT IT RIGHT GO HOME EMPTY-HANDED. THANK GOD WE HAVE THEM ON OUR SIDE. THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE A THING CALLED SOCIAL MEDIA. WE GET THE WORD OUT. LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER GOTTEN THE WORD OUT BEFORE. IT IS CALLED A WITCHHUNT. THIS STORY OF THE GREATEST MASS DELUSION IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT KHAN JOBS EVER. WE MUST NEVER LET IT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RELEASE THE TRANSCRIPT OF MY CALL. THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO WORKS FOR BIDEN. HE COMES OUT WITH A TOTALLY PHONY REPORT ON MY PHONE CALL. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RELEASE IT. SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE OK. IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE. THAT IS WHY I HAD TO RELEASE IT. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE CAME OUT AND SAID HE DID NOTHING WRONG. HE GOT ELECTED ON AN ANTICORRUPTION PLATFORM. UKRAINE IS KNOWN UNFORTUNATELY AS A VERY CORRUPT PLACE. THE FAKE NEWS HARDLY PUTS THEM ON. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. NOBODY THOUGHT WE WOULD RELEASE THE CALL. NOBODY KNEW WE HAD A TRANSCRIPT. WHEN I HEARD THE VICIOUSNESS, WORSE THAN THE WHISTLEBLOWER. WHY ARE WE PROTECTING A PERSON THAT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT ARE TRUE? SHIFTY SCHIFF, LITTLE ADAM SCHIFF, I HAVE HAD YOU UP TO HERE. HE COMES OUT AND HE MAKES UP MY CONVERSATION. I WAS WATCHING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. NERVOUS NANCY. [BOOING] I USED TO THINK SHE LOVES THE COUNTRY, SHE HATES THE COUNTRY. NANCY PELOSI HATES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SHE WOULD NOT BE DOING THIS. FOREIGN PEOPLE LOOKING AT US, THEY HONESTLY THINK WE ARE NUTS. SHE WAS ANGRY WHEN SHE GOT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT. THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE WAS TOLD. BUT SHE WAS STUCK. THINK OF A GUY WHO MAKES UP A PHONE CALL. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THEIR FACES. HE GOES BEFORE CONGRESS AND MAKES UP THE STORY OF WHAT I SAID. HE MADE IT UP. IT WAS FICTION. ARE YOU IMMUNE FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THAT SHOULD BE A CRIME. I NEED YOU TO SEND THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT A CLEAR MESSAGE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE YOUR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WHO HAS DONE A LOUSY JOB. AND SUNDAY GREAT REPUBLICAN TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. WHEN JOHN BEL EDWARDS RAN FOR OFFICE, HE MADE YOUR STATE A SACRED PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEN HE GOT ELECTED AND BROKE THAT PROMISE BY RAMMING THROUGH THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN YOUR STATE'S HISTORY. [BOOING] BECAUSE THE STATE LIKES ME, I THINK I ONE BY A LOT. , WON BY A LOT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THE HELL YOU LIKE A GUY. BUT I LIKE YOU GUYS TOO. I USED TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION SITES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE PUTTING UP HOUSING. I LIKE THOSE WORKERS. JOHN BEL EDWARDS LIED TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. EDWARDS IS TRYING TO DESTROY LOUISIANA'S ENERGY SECTOR. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? WITH THREATS AND LAWSUITS INSPIRED BY THE RADICAL LEFT-WING DEMOCRATS. THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING. HE IS NOT GOOD. HE GOES AROUND SAYING HE LIKES ME VERY MUCH. BUT BEHIND MY BACK, HE DOES NOT LIKE ME. HE WAS A SUPERDELEGATE FOR CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. [BOOING] IT LOOKS LIKE BERNIE LOST HIS CHANCE. BERNIE WAS HITTING A BASEBALL TODAY TO SHOW HOW STRONG HE WAS. THEY'RE JUST THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF BAT SPEED. BERNIE, GET BETTER. IT IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. BOY DID THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM FOR YEARS AGO AND THEY LET HIM DO IT. , HE LET THEM DO IT. HE FIGURED HE WOULD WAIT FOR YEARS. WHEN BERNIE GETS OUT, IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE WILL GO TO YOUR RADICAL LEFTISTS ELIZABETH WARREN. [BOOING] THAT WILL BE THE END OF SLEEPY JOE. HE IS WHO I WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST. I DON'T CARE. JUST PUT THEM OUT THERE. LET'S GET THIS THING GOING. OUR FRIEND BRIAN KEMP DID A NUMBER ON STACEY ABRAMS. SHE HAD OPRAH. OPRAH DID A TEST USED TO BE A REALLY BIG FRIEND OF MINE. SHE USED TO GO TO MAR-A-LAGO. SHE LIKES THE KEY LIME PIE. SHE WENT TO GEORGIA AND SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR STACEY ABRAMS. THE OBAMAS WENT. [BOOING] ALL BRIAN KEMP HAD WAS DONALD TRUMP. WE HAD A RALLY AT THE AIRPORT. 55,000 PEOPLE THERE. HE WON BY 2.5 POINTS. THAT WAS AMAZING. EVERY STAR WENT DOWN THERE FOR STACEY ABRAMS. LOUISIANA CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR RAISING YOUR TAXES, KILLING YOUR JOBS, ATTACKING YOUR INDUSTRY, AND TAKING MONEY FROM OPEN BORDERS. HOW ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT OPEN BORDERS? LET EVERYONE COME IN. [BOOING] TOMORROW YOU HAVE TO VOTE JOHN BEL EDWARDS OUT. [CHEERING] AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS BEFORE THE GAME, YOU GOT TO GET GOING. JUST LEAVE AN HOUR EARLY. MAYBE AN HOUR EARLY. IT IS A RUNOFF. IF HE DOES NOT GET 50%, THEN ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES WILL WIN. IT WILL BE JOHN BEL EDWARDS AGAINST ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES. THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE BOTH PRO-JOBS, PRO-WORKERS, PROFAMILY, PRO-LIFE. AND PRO-LOUISIANA ENERGY. IF THAT IS OK. [CHEERING] I WAS HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND THEY OPENS THE BIGGEST LNG PLANT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS THING APPROVED FOR YEARS. I GOT THOSE PERMITS SO FAST FOR THEM. THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES WERE SITTING BACK AND THEY COULD NOT GET IT APPROVED. NOTHING THEY COULD DO. YOUR GOVERNOR WAS LOUSY. NO ONE COULD HELP. THAT THING WAS SO DEAD. I CAME ALONG AND GOT IT APPROVED. CONSULTANTS CALLED UP THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES. WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT APPROVED. I NEVER SAW THESE PEOPLE. I KNOW IT WAS A GOOD THING. THEY PROBABLY GOT MILLIONS IN CONSULTING FEES. I WOULD RATHER GIVE IT TO YOU PEOPLE. OR CHARITY. BUT IT CAME ALONG. NOBODY KNOWS CONSULTANTS BETTER THAN ME. THEY MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULES TOUGH. YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM A LOT OF MONEY TO SKIRT YOUR WAY THROUGH. IT TAKES YEARS AND YEARS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. I GOT THAT PLANT APPROVED AND I CAME DOWN TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BIG. NOW THEY GOING TO DOUBLE IT UP. THEY WILL PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR TWO GUYS. EDWARDS WON'T. WHEN IT GETS CLOSE AND THEY START CALLING FROM WASHINGTON AND SCHUMER AND PELOSI CALL, WE WANT TO TO GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, HE IS 100% GOING TO DROP THE SECOND AMENDMENT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE. JOHN BEL EDWARDS WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. [BOOING] OUR GUYS SUPPORT YOUR POLICE. THEY DEFEND THE GREAT WORKERS AND FAMILIES OF THE STATE. IF YOU WANT TO GOVERNOR WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR VALUES, GET OUT TOMORROW AND CAST YOUR BALLOT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. [CHEERING] , FEAR , COME UP HERE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM. WE ARE ON LIVE TELEVISION ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY DON'T LIKE THIS. THEY SAY PUT TRUMP BACK ON. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HIT YOUR REPUBLICAN OPPONENT. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HIT JOHN BEL EDWARDS BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT. GO AHEAD. IS THIS INCREDIBLE? WE NEED SOMEONE TO DO FOR LOUISIANA WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THE USA. [CHEERING] WE NEED A CONSERVATIVE. A BUSINESSMAN. SOMEONE WHO IS NOT BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT FOR LOUISIANA. THAT IS WHY I AM IN THIS RACE. LET'S GO GET IT. LET'S FIRE JOHN BEL EDWARDS. LET'S THANK OUR PRESIDENT FOR COMING DOWN HERE TO HELP US. [CHEERING] I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING TO LOUISIANA AND MAKING LOUISIANA GREAT AGAIN. MR. PRESIDENT, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. FOR REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. AND FOR PROTECTING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. [CHEERING] I DROPPED A RESOLUTION TO EXPEL NANCY PELOSI FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. GO AMERICA GO. [CHEERING] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU HAVE TO DO IT TOMORROW. GET A RUNOFF. VOTE TOMORROW FOR THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN TICKET. WE ARE ALSO DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. THESE ARE WARRIORS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE BUT EQUALLY THEY FIGHT FOR YOU AND THEY LOVE THE STATE AND THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. ONE HAS A STRANGE NAME. HE CALLED ME UP. THEY SAID THERE IS A MAN NAMED JOHMNN KENNEDY ON THE PHONE. HE IS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN A STATE THAT LIKES YOU A LOT. I SAID WHERE? LOUISIANA. [CHEERING] I SAID LET ME CHECK IT OUT. IT IS TRUE. VERY SUCCESSFUL GUY. BRILLIANT GUY. I AM A BIG STUDENT. I LIKE ACADEMICS. MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR FOR 35 YEARS AT M.I.T. HE WENT TO OXFORD. THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT AT OXFORD. HE PUTS ON THAT COUNTRY STUFF ALL THE TIME. WE KNOW THE COUNTRY IS SMARTER THAN THE OTHER GUY ANYWAY. JOHN KENNEDY SAYS, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. I SAID, TO ME YOU ARE THE REAL CHINA KENNEDY, YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL. IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT AND THERE WAS THIS MASSIVE AIRPLANE HANGAR SOMEPLACE. IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE. WE HAD THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. I LOOKED AT HIM AND I LIKED HIM AND I LOOKED AT THAT CROWD AND SAID, I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO WIN TOMORROW. THE ELECTION WAS ON A SATURDAY.

WHAT A HEART. , ON A PEER, JOHN. , COME ON UP HERE, JOHN. OXFORD! EARLIER I GAVE HIM A QUIZ. I IMAGINED YOU WERE RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN. [BOOING] AND I ASKED HIM, WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER? BUT THERE WAS ONE QUESTION I FORGOT TO ASK. WHO PROMISED TO BUILD A NEW RIVER BRIDGE? TWO GREAT MEN. TWO GREAT AMERICANS. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS VERY BRAVE. HE WAS IN BAD CONDITION. I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL THE NIGHT HE WAS EXPECTED TO DIE. HE WAS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD THAT NIGHT. I WENT THERE AND THE DOCTOR SAID, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE HIM. I THINK HE IS BETTER LOOKING NOW THAN HE WAS TWO YEARS AGO. THE GREATEST THING, HE WAS PLAYING BASEBALL. HE WAS SHOT WHILE THEY WERE PRACTICING. STEVE SCALISE. [CHEERING] HE IS RECOVERING. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT. HE HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE. HE WENT OUT AND HE PLAYED IN THE BASEBALL GAME SIX MONTHS LATER. THE FIRST BATTER HITS A GROUNDBALL RIGHT AT HIM. I SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIBLE. HE GOT DOWN AND HE GOT THAT PAUL AND HE CAUGHT IT. AND HE THREW TO FIRST. HE COULD BARELY THROW. HE THREW IT TO FIRST ON THE BATTER WAS OUT. THAT WAS A MIRACLE. THE FIRST PITCH OF THE GAME. [CHEERING] HOW TOUGH IS THAT? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THAT SUCKER. HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND HE IS ANOTHER ONE. HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH. HE IS REALLY A BRAVE GUY. STEVE SCALISE. [CHEERING] AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OTHER GREAT WARRIORS, GREAT CONGRESSMEN. COME ON UP, FELLAS. THANK YOU. THEY ARE WARRIORS. THEY MAKE BETTER , OUR LIVES BETTER ON WASHINGTON.

THIS YEAR, YOU HAVE THE WORLD CHAMPIONS OF LITTLE LEAGUE. FROM LOUISIANA. [CHEERING] CONGRATULATIONS. COME ON UP HERE, KIDS. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. I JUST SAID, DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. THEY SAID NO. YOU AND I KNOW THEY DO NOT CHOKE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD CHOKE MEANS. WHERE IS THIS BIG PICTURE? COME UP HERE. I WANT TO REPRESENT THE SKY. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REPRESENTING HIM. ARE YOU READY FOR THE MAJOR LEAGUES SOMEDAY? WHAT ARE YOU THROWING? DID YOU DO PRETTY WELL? YOU KEPT THEM PRETTY WELL SET OUT. THEY COULD NOT SEE THE BAR , BALL. 8-0. YOU DID NOT PITCH A BAD GAME. GO GET 'EM, KIDS. THANKS, FELLAS. I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO LEAVE. CHAMPIONS. THERE IS NO CHOKE. THEY DON'T CHOKE AND WE DON'T CHUG. WE DON'T LIKE CHOKERS. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, AMERICA IS BOOMING AGAIN. WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THAT IN A LONG TIME. 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS SINCE OUR GREAT ELECTION. UNEMPLOYMENT JUST REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN OVER 50 YEARS. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE HIT THE ALL-TIME LOWEST RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WAGES ARE RISING FAST. FEWER CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY TODAY WHEN I WAS SELECTED. I HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. OVER $1 TRILLION HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK IN AND IS BEING SPENT BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF BUILDING OVERSEAS. THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAVE PLEDGED TO ABOLISH ALL AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THAT IS WONDERFUL. DEMOCRATS ARE PROMISING TO ANNIHILATE LOUISIANA'S ECONOMY. [BOOING] WE ARE NEVER GOING TO LET THEM DO THAT. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS JUST SET IT. I CAME HERE TO GET YOU TO GO OUT TO VOTE. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS TOLD ME, YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK TO LOUISIANA. GO TO THOSE STATES THAT ARE CLOSE. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA. WE ABSOLUTELY WON THOSE STATES BY SO MUCH NOBODY EVER SAW IT COMING. I DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF AN ARENA. IT WAS PACKED. THAT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. WE WON PENNSYLVANIA LAST TIME. THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. WE WON MICHIGAN. WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA. FLORIDA. AND WISCONSIN. WE HAVE TO GET NANCY TO APPROVE THE USMCA. WE CALL THEM THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE WILL DO IT AFTER WE TAKE OVER THE HOUSE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION BETRAYED OUR NATION ENERGY WORKERS. NOW WE ARE PROUDLY PROMOTING AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE INDEPENDENT. I APPROVED THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE AND THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. 48,000 JOBS. MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE. I SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I OPENED UP AND WARM , ANWAR, THE LARGEST DRILLING SITE ANYWHERE. IT IS IN ALASKA. THEY COULD NOT GET IT DONE. EVEN RONALD REAGAN COULD NOT GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE. WE ENDED DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT RANSACKED THE COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE. LOUISIANA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. PROBABLY THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S.-MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT. IT WILL BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND GROWERS AND WORKERS. THEY MAY SAY WE CANNOT DO ANYMORE. WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH. PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT TO WIN SO MUCH. WE ARE NOT USED TO IT. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. IF THERE WAS HONEST VOTING, I DO THINK I WOULD'VE ONE THAT AS WELL. BUT THERE IS NOT. WHATEVER THEY TELL YOU, THERE IS NOT. THEY WILL BE SAYING WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE. IT IS NOT A NICE FEELING? DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK AND PASS THE USMCA. WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST ACTION EVER TO CONFRONT CHINA'S DECADES OF ABUSE AND NOW WE ARE GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA. THIS WAS A GREAT DAY I WAS ALMOST LATE FOR YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH CHINA. I SAID I AM NOT GOING TO BE LATE FOR LOUISIANA EVEN IF IT MEANS STANDING UP CHINA. [CHEERING] IT WAS BETWEEN LOUISIANA AND CHINA. I HAD TO PICK LOUISIANA. [CHEERING] TODAY I WAS WITH THE VICE PREMIER OF CHINA. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD. WE MADE THAT SIGNIFICANT PROCESS , PROGRESS. THEY WANT IT BADLY. IT WILL END THE MISTREATMENT OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND COMPANIES IT WILL BE GREAT FOR CHINA TOO. WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE ACHIEVE ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER AND AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT THE NEEDS OF FOREIGN CITIZENS AHEAD OF OUR OWN. WE PROTECT BORDERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. WE DON'T PROTECT OUR OWN BORDERS. YOU SEE THE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE PLUMMETED. 27,000. THINK OF IT. JUST BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT APPROVE SIMPLE CHANGES MEXICO HAS HELPED US MORE ON OUR BORDER THAN THE DEMOCRATS. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS THIS BULLISHNESS. PEOPLE SEE THEIR GAME. THE VOTERS ARE SMART. IN A RECENT DEBATE, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAISE THEIR HAND IN FAVOR OF GIVING FREE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. [BOOING] YOU WONDER WHY THEY COME TO AMERICA. WHY WOULDN'T THEY COME? FREE EVERYTHING. I DID IT AGAIN. I WAS JUST KIDDING. THE DEMOCRATIC VISION FOR AMERICA IS TO ROB AMERICAN TAXPAYERS TO FUND SOCIALISM FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. IF YOU DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS TO RAID YOUR HEALTH CARE, STEAL YOUR MONEY, OVERCROWD YOUR SCHOOLS, AND OVERWHELM YOUR COMMUNITIES, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. GET JOHN BEL EDWARDS THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE. I NEVER FORGET THAT I AM NOT PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] WE REJECT GLOBALISM. WE EMBRACE PATRIOTISM. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN DESERVES A GOVERNMENT THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE EXTREME RADICAL LEFT ARE TRYING TO ABOLISH THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CITIZENS AND NONCITIZENS. IN MANY CASES, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GREAT VETS. PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING IN ILLEGALLY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN THEM. NOT ANYMORE. JUST RECENTLY, NEW YORK CITY, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY, WE HAVE SOME REAL BAD LEADERSHIP OVER THERE. THE MAYOR RAN FOR PRESIDENT. HE GOT ZERO. HOW DO YOU GET ZERO? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THERE HAS TO BE ONE STRANGE PERSON OUT THERE. HE GOT ZERO. NEW YORK WANTED HIM TO DO SO WELL. THEY DID NOT WANT HIM BACK AS MAYOR. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID LET HIM BE PRESIDENT, JUST KEEP THEM THE HELL AWAY FROM NEW YORK. HE ISSUED A RULE THAT THE USE OF THE TERM ILLEGAL ALIEN CAN NOW BE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO $250,000. CAN YOU IMAGINE? YOU ARE A HARD WORKER AND YOU'RE SAVING YOUR MONEY. YOU JUST BUILT UP THAT MONEY AFTER YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION WORK. YOU ARE RICH. YOU FEEL BETTER THAN TRUMP EVER DID. YOU HAPPEN TO, AND ONE OF THOSE BAD MOMENTS, USE THE WORD ILLEGAL ALIEN. THEY SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GIVE ME THAT MONEY YOU WORKED YOUR ASS OFF FOR. THEIR ATTACK ON FREE SPEECH GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THEIR ATTACK ON AMERICA'S BORDERS. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE SOFT ON AMERICAN FREEDOM AND AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. DEMOCRATS ALSO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INTERVENTION IN OUR ELECTIONS BY REFUSING TO SUPPORT A SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL THING CALLED VOTER ID. [CHEERING] MAYBE I CAN ASK OUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN. IT IS SO POPULAR. IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY GROCERIES, YOU NEED IDENTIFICATION. ALMOST ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T NEED IDENTIFICATION FOR IS TO VOTE. THEY CHEAT LIKE HELL. THAT IS WHY. MAYBE THEY COULD PUT OUT A VOTER ID. YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN THAT, DON'T YOU? THEY COULD PUT IT OUT. THAT IS WHY I LOVE THIS STATE. NOW I KNOW WHY I WON THE STATE. PEOPLE CANNOT CHEAT. I LOVE THIS STATE. IT IS SO GREAT. DON'T CHANGE. PUT IT OUT FOR EVERY OTHER STATE. MOST STATES DON'T HAVE IT. WE BELIEVE AMERICANS SHOULD VOTE IN ELECTIONS. YOU GO OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE, IT IS A DISGRACE. DEMOCRATS ACCEPT SANCTUARY CITIES. THEY RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO YOUR STREETS. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. LAST NIGHT'S THEY HAD TRUMP LOVES COPS. AND COPS LOVE TRUMP. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN SO FAR OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY ARE PEOPLE. THEY ARE CRAZED LUNATICS. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS PUSHED A HEALTH CARE AGENDA THAT WOULD AND MEDICARE AS WE KNOW IT. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR BELOVED SENIORS. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE. WHO HAS PRIVATE INSURANCE? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF THE TICKET AWAY? , TOOK IT AWAY? WE HAVE TAKEN SWIFT ACTION TO LOWER THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THE MOST UNPOPULAR, UNFAIR THING . THAT IS WHEN YOU PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO PAY A FORTUNE. YOU ARE PAYING TO NOT HAVE TO PAY. IT IS TERRIBLE. I GOT RID OF IT. IT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT WAS NOT EASY. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES AND MORE THAN 50 YEARS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM DOWN MUCH LOWER. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE OUR STATES, THE DRUG INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL WIRED. DRUGS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, YOU CAN BUY THE EXACT SAME DRUG FOR 70% LESS. SAME DRUG, SAME FACTORY, SAME COMPANY. I JUST GAVE THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AND I'M GIVING OTHER GOVERNORS THE RIGHT TO GO TO CANADA AND OTHER COUNTRIES TO BUY THE DRUGS. THEY PAY MUCH LESS. WE ARE GIVING STATES THE RIGHTS TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE A DEAL ON DRUGS. IT IS EASIER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE SYSTEM WHERE THE DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO ALLOW YOU TO DO ANYTHING TO CUT THE PRICE OF DRUGS. THEY DON'T WANT TO LET YOU DO IT. TO HELP PATIENTS WITH LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS, WE PASSED RIGHTS TO TRY. IF YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL, VERY SICK, WE HAVE THE BEST DOCTORS AND LABS AND TECHNICIANS IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD NOT GET IT. YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR FOUR WEEKS. WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THIS DRUG. IT MAY HURT YOU. FOR 50 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT. I DID IT PRETTY QUICKLY. I SAID WE WILL DO THESE DISCLOSURES THAT SAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SUE THE GOVERNMENT OR THE DRUG COMPANY. BUT PEOPLE SAY, IT IS A MIRACLE. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED. IT IS INCREDIBLE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT SIX YEARS. THEY WILL BE GONE. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERING] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, FAMILY, DREAM. THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. REPUBLICANS WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM. [CHEERING] WE HAVE CONFIRMED 100 , PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS, RECORD STUFF, OBAMA GAVE ME 142 FEDERAL JUDGES. I FIGURED IT WAS NONE. I SAID, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. WITHIN TWO MONTHS WE WILL HAVE ABOUT 100. [CHEERING] OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND REBUILDING THE MILITARY HAS INCLUDED $25 MILLION FOR A PLACE CALLED BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE. EVER HEAR OF IT? RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA. $40 MILLION TO NAVAL AIR STATION JOINT RESERVE BASE NEW ORLEANS. OUR WARRIORS HAVE MORE AMMUNITION, MISSILES, ROCKETS, TANKS, FIGHTER JETS, EVERYTHING OUR TROOPS NEED TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE. IT IS ALL MADE IN THE USA. [CHEERING] AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THE ENDLESS WARS. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR FOLKS BACK HOME. WARS GOING ON FOR 19 YEARS. WE ARE POLICE AGENTS. WE ARE NOT FIGHTING WARS. WE CAN'T DO IT. NOT FAIR. OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD HELP US. THEY DON'T TREAT US RIGHT BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO. ONE OF THE MIDDLE EAST , GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS ONE OF THE BEST , WORST DECISIONS EVER MADE. IT IS LIKE QUICKSAND. WE SPENT A TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT THEN WE WANT TO FIX UP A BRIDGE AND THEY SAY, SIR, THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WE ARE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY BRINGING OUR GREAT SOLDIERS AND WARRIORS BACK HOME. [CHEERING] AFTER DECADES OF REBUILDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR OWN COUNTRY. [CHEERING] FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOT SO LONG AGO. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. [CHEERING] THE PATH TO VICTORY BEGINS WITH A GIANT WIN TOMORROW HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA. [CHEERING] WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN. WE WILL NEVER, EVER FORGET. WE WILL SEND A TERRIFIC NEW REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO BATON ROUGE. [CHEERING] TOMORROW, BEFORE THE GAME, GET YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. THESE ARE TWO GREAT PEOPLE. GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR GREAT CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE. FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS TO CREATE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS AMERICAN JOBS, WAGES, FAMILIES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL MEXICO AND THEIR GREAT 27,000 SOLDIERS WHO ARE DOING THIS AS A FAVOR TO YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT, WE WILL TELL THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE FOUR BEAUTIFUL WORDS, MADE IN AMERICA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCERS. AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE DONE. IT WILL BE ENDED IN 10 YEARS. WE HAVE THE MEDICINES TO DO IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED A LONG TIME AGO AND THEY DID NOT DO IT BUT I AM DOING IT. 10 YEARS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WILL BE ENDED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THAT? WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERING] AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE GREAT. I HOPE THEY KNOW HOW MUCH WE CHERISH THEM, AND I THINK THEY DO. WE SAW IT LAST NIGHT IN MINNESOTA. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT, BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IN LOUISIANA AND ALL ACROSS THIS LAND, WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, AND GOD WE TRUST. THAT WILL NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED A CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT SOCIALISM AND PUT A MAN ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, DEVOTION AND DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS NATURE AND , GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF LOUISIANA, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. [APPLAUSE] GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, LOUISIANA. GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. THANK YOU.

CSPANDT1710201918	Donald Trump	2019-10-17	President Trump Rally in Dallas, Texas	THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO, DALLAS. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU. SO I CAME FROM A SMALL TOWN, ALVARADO, TEXAS. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE. DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS. WHERE WE JUST OPENED A BEAUTIFUL NEW LOUIS VUITTON PLANT. BUT I'M WITH THE FREEDOM LOVING PATRIOTS OF THE LONE STAR STATE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BE A PROUD TEXAN. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BE A PROUD AMERICAN. BUT NEVER HAS. WE CELEBRATED THE INCREDIBLE REVIVAL OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND WE OPENED UP SOME BEAUTIFUL PLACES. I'LL TELL YOU, THIS PLACE IS DOING GREAT. IT WAS CREATED , HAS CREATED AN EXTRA 1000 JOBS FOR TEXAS. [CHEERING] SINCE MY ELECTION, WE'VE CREATED 775,000 NEW JOBS ACROSS YOUR STATE, INCLUDING 70,000 TEXAS MANUFACTURING JOBS. THEY SAID THOSE JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED, DIDN'T THEY? [CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY IS ONCE AGAIN LIVING BY TWO SIMPLE RULES. BY AMERICAN AND HIGHER AMERICAN , BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING. OUR PEOPLE ARE PROSPERING. OUR COUNTRY IS THRIVING. OUR NATION IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERING] THEY ARE CRAZY. AT STAKE IN THIS FIGHT IS THE SURVIVAL OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ITSELF. DON'T KID YOURSELF. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. THEY ARE DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL NEVER LET IT HAPPEN. NOT EVEN CLOSE. [CHEERING] FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS, RADICAL DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE RESULTS OF A GREAT, GREAT ELECTION. MAYBE, MAYBE THE GREATEST ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING] THEY WANT TO IMPOSE AN EXTREME AGENDA. THEY CANNOT PASS IT AND THEY CANNOT WHEN IT AT THE BALLOT BOX. THEY WON'T COME CLOSE IN 2020. THEY KNOW IT. [CHEERING] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WIN IT. THEY SAY, LET'S SEE. WHAT'S ANOTHER IDEA? WHAT'S ANOTHER IDEA? HOW DO WE WIN THIS ELECTION? YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE ANYMORE THAT THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. [BOOING] HE MAKES UP MY CONVERSATION, WHICH WAS PERFECT. HE MAKES UP MY CONVERSATION. HE SEES WHAT I SAID. IT DOESN'T PLAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT. HE MADE UP A TOTALLY FALSE CONVERSATION WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. [BOOING] AND WE CAUGHT HIM COLD. EVERYBODY KNEW IT ANYWAY. SEE, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THE UNEXPECTED. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RELEASE THE CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. [CHEERING] I WANT TO GET HIM BEFORE CONGRESS AND I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY HE HAS IMMUNITY. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE IMMUNITY FOR OUTRIGHT FRAUD? WHY WOULD YOU HAVE IMMUNITY? HE'S A FRAUD. WE ARE FIGHTING A CAMPAIGN AGAINST LEFTIST, SOCIALISTS, AND GLOBALISTS WHO WANT TO RETURN TO OPEN BORDERS, RAMPANT CRIME, AND DISASTROUS ONE-WAY TRADE DEALS. WE ARE CHANGING THAT ONE AROUND VERY QUICKLY. [CHEERING] THEY BELIEVE AMERICA IS THE WORLD'S BIG BANG AND THAT YOUR TAX DOLLARS SHOULD SUBSIDIZE THE DEFENSE OF EVERY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD BUT OUR OWN. IT'S OUR POLITICAL OPPOSITION MADE ITS FORTUNE SELLING OUT OUR NATION AND ITS CITIZENS. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. THAT'S WHY 2016 WAS SO IMPORTANT. THAT'S WHY 2020, I CAN NEVER SAY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THE ROOTS OF A TREE. YOU PLANT A BABY TREE. IT HAS TO CATCH. YOU NEED THAT EXTRA TIME. WE WILL HAVE MORE TAX CUTS. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WHAT WE'VE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. [CHEERING] THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS HAVE BETRAYED OUR COUNTRY AND THAT GREAT FOR TRAIL WAS OVER. WE ARE FINALLY AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT NOW FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS? [CHEERING] CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I'VE BEEN A POLITICIAN FOR THREE YEARS. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE CALLED A POLITICIAN. I DON'T LIKE IT. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WE ARE FINALLY AGAIN PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERING] THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT. THEY WANT TO INDOCTRINATE OUR CHILDREN. AND TEACH THEM THAT AMERICA IS A SINFUL, WICKED NATION. YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING ALL THE TIME. [BOOING] I KNOW IT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WHAT THEY WANT TO TEACH YOUR KIDS. NOT GOOD. THEY COME HOME. THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED. YOU ARE GOING, NO. DON'T TELL ME. LET'S GET THEM INTO ANOTHER SCHOOL FAST. THEY WANT TO DISARM LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. [BOOING] THEY WANT TO TEAR DOWN SYMBOLS OF FAITH AND DRIVE CHRISTIANS AND RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE. THEY WANT TO SILENCE YOUR VOICES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO CENSOR AND SHUT DOWN CONSERVATIVE VOICES. YOU KNOW THAT. [BOOING] IF THEY DIDN'T HATE OUR COUNTRY, THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS. THEY KNOW BETTER. THEY KNOW BETTER. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE ARE BUILDING A GREAT WALL ALONG THE FIVE YEARS AGO, ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM WANTED A WALL. UNTIL I CAME ALONG AND SAID, WE WILL BUILD A GREAT WALL. THEY COULD NEVER GET IT DONE. AND THEN THEY STOP THE FUNDING. THEY MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. FEW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT WE DID. WE GOT IT FROM HERE AND WE GOT IT FROM THERE AND WE GOT IT FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE ARE BUILDING THAT STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW AND IT'S HAVING A TREMENDOUS AFFECT ALREADY. NOT EASY. [CHEERING] LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS. YOU BELIEVE IT? LOOK AT ALL THOSE RED LIGHTS. DON'T WORRY, I WON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT YOUR NETWORKS . A LOT OF TIMES, I GET READY TO DO A NUMBER ON THESE 20 NETWORKS. YOU SEE THOSE RED LIGHTS GO OFF. [LAUGHTER] LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS. THAT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARD USED TO BE BEFORE IT FAILED. DO YOU KNOW WHY IT FAILED? THEY CAME AFTER US. THAT'S WHY IT FAILED. [CHEERING] NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY, THEY WILL FAIL. THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS AND THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR FREEDOMS TO THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE. [CHEERING] LAST WEEK, A VERY DUMB DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, THAT'S THE END OF HIM IN THE STATE, PLEDGED TO REVOKE THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF MANY CHURCHES AND I TOLD HIM, REMEMBER THE FLAILING ARMS? NOBODY NOTICED IT. I NOTICED IT. YOU REMEMBER? HE WAS FLAILING ALL OVER THE PLACE. JOHN GORDON IS GOING TO WIN SO EASILY. JUST LIKE TED CRUZ. [CHEERING] JOHN CORNYN IS NOT TALKING ABOUT BEDDOE ANYMORE. BETO, IN A FEW SHORT WEEKS, GOT RID OF GUNS AND RELIGION. THOSE ARE NOT GOOD THINGS IN TEXAS. [CHEERING] THE RADICAL LEFT TOLERATES DISSENT. IT PERMITS NO OPPOSITION. IT ACCEPTS NO COMPROMISE. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FIRST, IT WAS THE RUSH A HOAX. , RUSSIA HOAX. [BOOING] PRES. TRUMP: AND NOW THEY CONTINUE THE OUTRAGEOUS IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT WITH NOTHING. THEY COME AFTER ME BUT WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING IS COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING IS FIGHTING YOU AND WE NEVER LOSE. [APPLAUSE] I AM FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE VALUES, TRADITIONS, PRINCIPLES, THAT HAS MADE OUR NATION THE GREATEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE ARE FAR GREATER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU GO BACK FOUR YEARS, 7, 6, 8. EVEN ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION, 10 AND 12 YEARS. WHERE WERE YOU COMPARED TO WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? [APPLAUSE] WE MUST HOLD THE DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LIES AND CORRUPTION. THEY ARE CORRUPT PEOPLE. WE MUST SHOW AND VOTE. IT IS GOING TO BE A LANDSLIDE. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT A LANDSLIDE. [APPLAUSE] TODAY'S DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS , THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING , WHERE IS THE USMCA? EVERYBODY WANTS IT. THE DEMOCRATS EVEN WANTED. CRAZY NANCY WILL NOT LET ANYBODY VOTE IN AN. TODAY'S DEMOCRATS BELIEVE ANYONE WHO OPPOSES THEM MUST BE CRUSHED. I HAVE TO SAY THIS. THE REPUBLICANS SAID, I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THIS. THE REPUBLICANS PLAY A SOFTER GAME. WHEN OUR STARS, THEY WENT TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AT THE TIME. THEY ASKED FOR SUBPOENAS, LET'S TAKE IT EASY. OK. I GET THAT, TOO. SHE HANDS THEM OUT LIKE IT IS COOKIES. I HEARD A COMMENTATOR WHO HAPPENS TO BE STANDING RIGHT THERE, DOESN'T LIKE US AT ALL. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE HAND OUT SO MANY SUBPOENAS. I HAVE PEOPLE GETTING SUBPOENAS I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THEM. I SAID, WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE? IT IS A DISGRACE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DO, NOT THE REPUBLICANS AND NOT WHAT WE HAVE DONE, BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT THEY SEE, WHEN PEOPLE COME TO MY OFFICE WHICH IS NOW THE OVAL OFFICE WHICH IS YOUR OFFICE, TOO , [APPLAUSE] TRUMP: PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, KINGS AND QUEENS. I HATE TO SAY SOMETIMES, DICTATORS. CONGRATULATIONS ON WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. IT IS INCREDIBLE. YOUR ECONOMY IS THE GREATEST ON EARTH. IF MY CRICKET OPPONENT HAD WON THE ELECTION, CHINA WOULD BE BY FAR THE NUMBER ONE NATION FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. WE HAVE GONE UP TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY HAVE GONE DOWN TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE SO FAR NUMBER ONE THEY WILL NEVER CATCH US IF WE ARE SMART. BUT THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS BELIEVE ANYONE WHO OPPOSES THEM HAS TO BE CRUSHED. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST EAT THEM. THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO CRUSH THESE PEOPLE. THE ANGER, THE HATRED. ANY LIE OR CRIME OR CORRUPTION IS JUSTIFIED. SO SHIFT , SCHIFF MAKES UP THE STATEMENT. HE SAYS, WE DID NOT SPEAK TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER. THE WHISTLEBLOWER GOT IT ALL WRONG. WHO IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER? WHO IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER? WE HAVE TO KNOW. IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER A SPY? ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS LOOK AT THE TAPE OR WHAT THEY WROTE DOWN TO , THE TRANSCRIBED VERSION OF THE PHONE CALL. COMPARE THAT TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER ACCOUNT. YOU SEE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. WHY DOES THE IG ALLOW A THING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY? WHY? A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE. ONE BY ONE, WE ARE ADVANCING. ONE BY ONE. JUST LOOK AT THE CORRUPTION OF THE BIDENS. I HATE TO TALK ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW WHY? I DON'T THINK THE GUY HAS A CHANCE. SLEEPY JOE. I DON'T SEE IT. I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE THESE GREAT, BRILLIANT SENATORS OVER HERE. I DON'T TAKE HE HAS A CHANCE. I WOULD LIKE HIM TO. I WOULD LIKE HIM TO. I THOUGHT POCAHONTAS WAS GONE. THOSE EMBERS KEPT GOING TO READ IT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS DOING BETTER. I DON'T THINK JOE HAS A CHANCE. DID YOU SEE THE OTHER NIGHT, CNN, IN A TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED STATEMENT, THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS. WE ARE SO SORRY. HIS SON WALKED OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION FROM CHINA. THESE WERE NOT THE SAME CHINESE PEOPLE I JUST DEALT WITH. JOE BIDEN WAS IN CHARGE OF UKRAINE POLICY WHILE HIS SON, WITH NO ENERGY EXPERIENCE, GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY LIKE A DOG. WAS PAID MASSIVE SUMS OF MONEY BY UKRAINIAN ENERGY COMPANY. IT IS CALLED A PAYOFF, FOLKS. HE DIDN'T KNOW ENERGY AT ALL. THEY HIRED HIM, PAYING HIM MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. MUCH MORE THAN THE $50,000 A MONTH YOU HAVE HEARD OF. THAT IS A LOT. JOE BIDEN MADE HIM GO OUT AND FIRE THE PROSECUTOR ON TAPE. I HAD TO PUT IT UP IN A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE. HE WAS BRAGGING. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET THIS MONEY. THEY GOT RID OF THE PROSECUTOR. HE WAS INVESTIGATING THE SON OF THE SON'S COMPANY. THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL QUID PRO QUO. THESE CHARGES ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED. THESE ARE THE FAKE NEWS ERRS , NEWSERS. WE JUST MADE SUCH A GREAT DEAL OF CHINA. MY GUY SAID, IF WE COULD GET $20 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. THE MOST THEY EVER DID WAS $16 BILLION FOR THE FARMERS. THE MOST THEY EVER DID WAS $20 BILLION OF PRODUCT. OUR GREAT FARMERS, OUR PATRIOT FARMERS. WHO NEVER LEFT US. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE BEING TARGETED BY CHINA. THEY NEVER LEFT ME. THEY WANTED 20 AND CHINA AGREED. I SAID I WANT $50 BILLION, NOT $20 BILLION. MY GUYS SAY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. OUR FARMERS CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH, IT IS TRUE. I SAID, TELL THEM TO GO OUT AND GET BIGGER TRACTORS. JOHN DEERE. ALL-AMERICAN. ONLY AMERICAN TRACTORS. WE ONLY BY , BUY AMERICAN. CHINA HAS AGREED. THEY HAVE STARTED BUYING. HOPEFULLY THE AGREEMENT GETS SIGNED SOMETIME PRIOR TO A BIG SUMMIT WE HAVE WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHILE. THEY SAID, SIR, WE CANNOT PRODUCE $50 BILLION. I SAID, I WANT THE FARMERS TO TELL ME. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO SAY, WE JUST CAN'T STAND WINNING. TED CRUZ, THEY ARE GOING TO COME AND SAY, WE JUST CANNOT STAND THIS. IT IS TOO MUCH. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FROM THE FARMERS. I WANT THEM TO SAY, I WANT THE FARMERS TO SAY, WE JUST CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH PRODUCT. WE CANNOT DO IT, SIR. I'M GOING TO SAY, YES YOU CAN. THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE IN $50 BILLION FROM CHINA. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY STUCK WITH US. IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE TAKEN IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CHINA IS EATING THE COST. IT TENS OF DOLLARS. IT HAS COST US NOTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT I DID FOR THE FARMER? I GAVE THEM $16 BILLION LAST YEAR AND $12 BILLION THE HERE BEFORE. THEY CAME OUT OF THE TERRACE. I HAD A LOT OF MONEY LEFT OVER AND NOBODY COMPLAINED. FARMERS DID NOT WANT THE MONEY. EVERYBODY COMES FROM MONEY. EVERYBODY WANTS MONEY. THE FARMERS SAID, WE DO NOT WANT THIS MONEY. I SAID, IT IS NOT A SUBSIDY. YOU ARE BEING TARGETED. THEY SAID, IT IS A SUBSIDY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE 35 FARMERS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THEY DID NOT WANT IT. THEY SAID, JUST GIVE US A LEVEL PLAYING HOUSE. IT IS LEVEL LIKE THIS. NICE AND EASY. THE FARMERS, I CALL THEM THE GREAT PATRIOTS. THEY ALWAYS SAID, I AM IN TROUBLE. I HAVE A PROBLEM. SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MANY YEARS AGO. WE LOSE FOR MANY YEARS, $500 BILLION A YEAR WITH CHINA. THAT IS ALL CHANGING. 500 BILLION, 500 MILLION IS A LOT. WE LOSE 500 BILLION. IT IS A DISGRACE. IT WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR 25 YEARS. IT WAS A DISGRACE. NOW WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY HAVE HAD THE WORST YEAR WE HAVE HAD AND 27 YEARS. , IN 27 YEARS. BIDEN FLEW WITH HUNTER ON AIR FORCE TWO. THEY FLEW TO CHINA. HUNTER WALKED OUT OF THE PLANE AND HAD A QUICK MEETING. WALKED AWAY WITH $1.5 BILLION. THE CHARACTERS SAID, THAT IS OK. THERE IS NO PROBLEM. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF DON OR ERIC TRUMP WERE AMONG THE TRUMP, WHO IS HERE SOMEPLACE? RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] OUR GREAT FIRST LADY SAID THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING THING I HAVE SEEN IN SOME TIME. DOING A GREAT JOB. WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS DOING A GREAT JOB. BIDEN TAKES $1.5 BILLION. HE ALLOWS CHINA TO RIP US OFF. NO, CHINA IS GOOD. THEY ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. I DON'T BLAME CHINA, BY THE WAY. I BLAME OUR LEADERS FOR ALLOWING THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT AND PILLAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT WORD I AM TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? I DON'T WANT USE IT BECAUSE THEY WILL SAY IT IS A HORRIBLE WORD TRUMP USED. THE BIDENS GOT RICH WHILE AMERICA GOT ROBBED. TONIGHT, WE FORCEFULLY CONDEMN THE CORRUPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. NOBODY EVER PLATE , PAYS A PRICE. THEY NEVER PAID. MAYBE SOON, THAT WILL START. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF OBAMA PEOPLE, CLINTON PEOPLE. WE HAVE HAD SOME BAD REPUBLICANS THAT DID NOT EXACTLY LOVE US. BUT SLOWLY, THEY ARE GETTING OUT. THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF PROTECTIONS. HE SAYS, GET RID OF THEM. THEIR PARTNER IS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. THE DEMOCRATS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, IT IS A PARTNERSHIP. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME. WHEN I WON IN THE PRIMARIES, WHEN THEN I WON THE ELECTION, I WAS TREATED HORRIBLY BY THE MEDIA. AND THEN WHEN I WON THE ELECTION, WE HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED DATES IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. ALL OVER THE WORLD. I WON AND I SAID, THEY GREAT THING. TO THE FIRST LADY, I SAID TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN, IT IS SO GREAT. WE, ALL OF US, WE ARE GOING TO BE RESPECTED BY THE MEDIA. THEY GOT WORSE. WORSE THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN. THEY ARE WORSE NOW THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. THEY ARE CROOKED. THE ONLY MESSAGE THESE RADICALS , AND THEY ARE RADICAL, IT IS A CRUSHING DEFEAT. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL WIN BACK THE HOUSE. WE WILL KEEP THE SENATE. WE WILL KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE IN NUMBERS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG TIME. JOINING US TONIGHT ARE MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS. IF THEY ARE NOT, I'M NOT GOING TO INTRODUCE THEM. WE HAVE GREAT LEADERS. YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERS IN TEXAS. GREAT LEADERS. THEY LOVE TEXAS. A FRIEND OF MINE, WE HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE RELATIONSHIP. WHEN TED CRUZ HELD A RALLY IN WASHINGTON HE SAID, CAN YOU COME TO MY RALLY? EVERYBODY THOUGHT THESE PEOPLE THOUGHT, THEY SAID TO ME, WHEN IS THE FIGHTING BETWEEN THESE TWO? WHEN IS IT GOING TO START? THEY SAID, WHEN IS THE FIGHTING GOING TO START. IT IS GOING TO BE VICIOUS. IT WAS VICIOUS. NOW, WE LOVE EACH OTHER AGAIN. TED CRUZ. HE HAD A GREAT VICTORY AGAINST THE MAN WHO SPENT ALMOST $100 MILLION, THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. THANK YOU, TED. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AGAINST SOMEBODY. I KEPT THINKING MAYBE BETO WILL JUMP IN BECAUSE HE IS AT ZERO RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE HE IS GOING TO JUMP IN. REMEMBER, NO RELIGION AND NO GUNS, I THINK THAT IS NOT GOOD. I THINK HE IS PRETTY LIGHT IN OIL PRODUCTION, TOO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST. NOBODY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT JOHN. WHO IS A GOOD MAN. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONGRESSPEOPLE HERE. A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A FAN FROM THE BEGINNING. KAY GRANGER. THANK YOU. AMEN WHO IS AS SMART AS HELL. HE IS TOUGH AND HE IS MEAN AND HE IS NASTY. BUT HE LOVES THE STATE. HE IS ONLY MEAN AND NASTY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO DEFEND YOU AND ME AND THE HORRIBLE THINGS WE GO THROUGH. LOUIE GOHMERT. SHE IS A GREAT GUY. A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE. HE WOULD NOT LEAVE US, NO MATTER WHAT. HE HAD MOLAR , MUELLER FIGURED OUT BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE HAD. A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE ALLY.

A MAN I SAW ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT. DEFENDING ME. I DON'T LIKE DOING THIS BUT I TWEETED OUT AND SAID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS A GREAT DEFENSE. I APPRECIATE IT. IT WAS GREAT LAST NIGHT. I PUT A TWEET OUT BECAUSE IT IS EASIER THAN MAKING A PHONE CALL. I SAID, THANK YOU. HE WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT, TOO. A SPECIAL PERSON. THANK YOU, LANCE. THANK YOU, LANCE. HE WAS ONE OF 60 PEOPLE THAT STUCK IN THERE. THANK YOU, RON. GREAT JOB. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. ALONG WITH REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRS, HERE IS ONE. RHONDA MCDANIEL. SHE WAS THE HEAD OF MICHIGAN. IT HAD NOT IN WON BY REPUBLICAN FOR DECADES. THEY SAID, YOU CANNOT WIN. WHY? SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF MICHIGAN. I SAID, I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. SHE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. WHO IS SHE? WE WON THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WHEN IT CAME TIME, WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PICKING SOMEBODY, TO HEAD THE RNC, I SAID, WHAT ABOUT THAT WOMAN? SHE DROVE ME CRAZY FROM MICHIGAN ? THANK YOU, RHONA. SHE IS FANTASTIC. AND A GREAT GOVERNOR FROM YOUR STATE. A GREAT, GREAT MAN. A FRIEND OF MINE. TOGETHER WITH YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, YOU HAD A HURRICANE TWO YEARS AGO. THEY KEEP CALLING ME FOR MONEY. SIR, COULD YOU GIVE US ANOTHER ONE? THE GOVERNOR CALLED UP? THANK YOU FOR BEING SO GENEROUS. IT WAS A BIG ONE, IT WAS A BAD ONE. I THINK THE WORST DUMP I CAN REMEMBER. OUR COAST GUARD SAVED 16,000 LIVES. IT KEPT GOING IN AND OUT. WATER. FINALLY, I GET A CALL. I PAID BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE. I GET A CALL FROM THE GOVERNOR. WHERE IS DAN? THE TWO OF THEM CALLED ME. I HAD TED CRUZ ON MY BACK. I HAD THE CONGRESSMAN CALLING. IT WAS BRUTAL. THEY SAID, SIR, THANK YOU FOR BEING SO GENEROUS. YOU MADE A FORTUNE IN THE HURRICANE. WE WANT ONE MORE SMALL REQUEST. JUST A SMALL ONE. WE APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO US. WE WANT TO BUILD A DAM IN THE OCEAN. SO IF WE EVER HAVE ANOTHER HURRICANE, THE WATER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME IN. I SAID, HOW MUCH? $10 BILLION. 10 BILLION QUESTION MARK I SAID, RIGHT? THE WAY THEY SELL IT, IT IS SO GOOD. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE SALESMAN. THEY SAY IT IS ONLY $10 BILLION, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY. CAN I GIVE THEM $10 BILLION FOR SOME CRAZY THING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK? THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. A REAL FRIEND OF OURS. THANK YOU, TELL ME. OUR GREAT CAMPAIGN MANAGER, THE MOST SOPHISTICATED MAN WITH A COMPUTER YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. AFTER SHE LOST, THEY SAID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS SO SOPHISTICATED. SHE SPENT LIKE SIX TIMES MORE ON THIS THAN WE DID. IN THE OLDEN DAYS, MY FATHER TAUGHT ME. IF YOU CAN SPEND LESS, THAT IS A GOOD THING. IF YOU CAN SPEND LESS, , SO WE SPENT MUCH LESS THAN HILLARY. CROOKED HILLARY. CROOKED HILLARY. WHERE ARE THOSE EMAILS? THEY MAY FIND THOSE DELETED EMAILS. THEY MAY FIND THEM. 33,000 EMAILS COVERING HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. THAT IS A LOT OF EMAILS FOR A WEDDING. BUT HE DID A GREAT JOB, THANK YOU. HE WAS LIKE AMAZING. HE IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB, WILBUR ROSS. THANK YOU YOU, WILBUR. A FRIEND OF MINE, HE IS ANOTHER ONE. HE WAS NASTY. HE HIT ME DURING THE CAMPAIGN. I SAID, THAT GUY IS RUTHLESS. WHEN IT WAS OVER, THERE WAS NOBODY MORE GRACIOUS. I MADE HIM SECRETARY OF ENERGY. HE HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB. RICK PERRY, COULD NOT HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. HE IS GOING TO BE LEAVING AT THE BEGINNING , AND OF THE YEAR. HE SPENT THREE YEARS WITH US AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. WHAT A JOB YOU HAVE DONE. THANK YOU. WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE. HE WAS ALSO A GREAT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, AS YOU KNOW. AND EVERYTHING WE DO, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE FAITHFUL CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS INCLUDES PUTTING A STOP TO THE CATASTROPHIC ERA OF ENDLESS WARS. THEY DO NOT STOP. THEY GO ON FOREVER. WE BECOME A POLICEMAN. WE END UP BECOMING POLICE. WE HAVE SPENT EIGHT CHILEAN DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE SEVERELY WOUNDED. IN ALL FAIRNESS, THE OTHER SIDE HAS LOST HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THESE WARS BROUGHT CHAOS, INSTABILITY. TODAY, WE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH. WE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW. WE BUILT THE STRONGEST MILITARY BY FAR. IN GENERAL TOLD ME, WE COULD HAVE HAD A CONFLICT AND SAID, WE DON'T HAVE AMMUNITION. I SAID, I NEVER WANT TO PRESIDENT, SOMEBODY HAVE THAT STATEMENT MADE TO THEM AS PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.. WE DO NOT HAVE AMMUNITION. NO WE HAVE SO MUCH, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I GUESS YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING. I SAID, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO LEADING A DELEGATION TO MEET WITH ERDOGAN OF TURKEY. THEY GOT THERE TODAY AND IT DID WORK. WITHOUT SPILLING A DROP OF AMERICAN BLOOD, WILL NOT ONE DROP, WE HAVE ALL AGREED ON A PAUSE WERE CEASE-FIRE. IT WAS UNCONVENTIONAL WHAT I DID. I SAID, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT. PEOPLE FIND OUT HOW TOUGH THE FIGHTING IS, THESE GUYS KNOW RIGHT UP HERE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LET THEM FIGHT. YOU GOT TO LET THEM FIGHT AND THEN YOU PULL THEM APART. IT WAS UNCONVENTIONAL. THEY FOUGHT FOR A FEW DAYS AND IT WAS VICIOUS. THE KURDS, WHO ARE OUR FRIENDS, IT WAS TOUGHER. IT WAS NASTY. YOU COULD NOT MAKE A DEAL. 20 YEARS, THEY COULD NOT MAKE A DEAL. TURKEY DID NOT WANT TO BUDGE. TURKEY WAS HAVING A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAPPENING. NOW ALL OF THEY ARE FIGHTING AND IT IS NOT FUN. WE WENT THERE. WE SAID, WE WANT A PAUSE. THE KURDS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC. WE ARE GOING TO FIND MORE OF THEM. TURKEY IS ALL SET. PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WAS GREAT. I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE ECONOMICALLY SURVIVED. PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WAS A GENTLEMAN, HE UNDERSTOOD IT. BUT NOT WITHOUT A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE. WITH TOUGH LOVE, THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP LOST , PRESIDENT OBAMA LOST ONE MILLION PEOPLE. NOW WE ARE DOING, WE ARE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET IT FINALIZED AND I THINK IT WILL BE. TURKEY IS GOING TO BE HAPPY. ISIS IS GOING TO BE UNHAPPY. WE WILL DEAL WITH WHOEVER WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT WE WILL GET IT DONE. THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND MIKE POMPEO. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. THEY ARE TRAVELING BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY WILL BE BACK SOON. WE HAVE TAKING CARE OF A LOT OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. WE ADDED THAT IN. A LOT OF THINGS IN THAT AGREEMENT NOBODY THOUGHT POSSIBLE. WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR APPROACH. THAT EXAMPLE, NOBODY WOULD HAVE EVER DONE THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT TO DO WITH THAT WAY. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT EVEN FROM SOME OF OUR CONGRESSMEN, SOME OF OUR SENATORS. BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL HAPPY. I AM HAPPY WITH THEM. I AM HAPPY WITH THEM. THE DEMOCRATS WILL SAY, WHAT A TERRIBLE , ANYTHING WE SAY, THE DEMOCRATS WILL CRITICIZE. IF I SAID, WE GET BEIJING FOR ONE DOLLAR. THEY WOULD SAY, WHAT A TERRIBLE DEAL. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK WITH THEM. THE WALL, WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH THEM ON THE WALL. I REALIZED TWO WEEKS AGO, ALL I SAID WAS, WE WILL NEVER BUILD A WALL AND THEY WOULD COME THROUGH AND SAY, WE DEMAND YOU BUILD IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH EASIER. AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE CENTER OF SECTARIAN CONFLICTS. BRING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME. TRUMP: THE SAME PEOPLE PUSHING US TO FIGHT ENDLESS WARS OVERSEAS WANT US TO OPEN OUR BORDERS TO MASS MIGRATION. THEIR POLICIES WOULD IMPORT TERRORISM RIGHT ONTO OUR STORES , SHORES. THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT EVERYBODY TO FLOW IN. THEY WANT THOSE CARAVANS TO FLOW IN. THEY WOULD NOT GET RID OF THE LOOPHOLES. MEXICO HAS BEEN GREAT. MEXICO HAD 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDER. WE HAVE STOPPED THIS HORRIBLE MIGRATION. MANY OF THEM ARE BAD PEOPLE. WHEN COUNTRIES SEND THEM, THEY ARE NOT SENDING THEIR FINEST. USE YOUR HEAD. THEY ARE NOT SENDING THE FINEST. NOW WE SEND THEM BACK. ICE IS FANTASTIC. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS 13 KILLERS. NOW WE HAVE MADE DEALS WITH GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS. EL SALVADOR AND MEXICO. WE HAVE MADE DEALS WHERE WE CAN BRING BACK , THERE ARE 45,000 PEOPLE WAITING IN MEXICO, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. THEY USED TO BE NO PEOPLE WAITING IN MEXICO. OUR BORDERS ARE GETTING STRONG. THEY WILL BE AS STRONG AS ANY BORDER IN THE WORLD. MY ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IN A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE. THE BEST WAY TO KEEP FOREIGN TERRORIST OUT IS TO DENY THEM ADMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE IMPOSED AND WE WON AT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, A TRAVEL BAN ON SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRIES. IF DEMOCRATS SEIZE POWER, THEY WOULD THROW THE FLOODGATES WIDE OPEN. WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THEY SAY, COMING TO CALIFORNIA. WE WILL GIVE YOU FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION. WHY WOULDN'T THEY? I MAY EVEN MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IF THEY KEEP GOING. IT BRINGS EVERYBODY IN. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE? WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEPLETE IT AGAIN IN STUPID, SENSELESS, ENDLESS WARS. WE HAVE INVESTED MORE THAN $2.5 TRILLION RESTORING OUR ARMED FORCES. ALL OF IT WAS BUILT IN THE USA. THAT INCLUDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF STEALTH FIGHTERS. MANY OF THEM ARE BUILT RIGHT HERE IN FORT WORTH. AS WE RESTORE OUR SECURITY, WE ARE ALSO RESTORING OUR PROSPERITY. AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. OUTSIDE, THEY HAVE CLOSE TO 30,000 PEOPLE. I WONDER IF I COULD ASK THE FIRE MARSHAL , LET HIM IN. WE BROKE THE RECORD TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] GOOD PLACE. LAST MONTH, UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 51 YEARS. 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS SINCE THE ELECTION. 1.3 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY, THINK OF THAT. AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN HISTORY. OUR GREAT HISPANIC AMERICAN POPULATION HAS REACHED A POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS AN ALL-TIME LOW IN U.S. HISTORY. AFTER YEARS OF STAGNATION, WAGES FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE RISING FAST. OF NEARLY 8% SINCE MY ELECTION. EVERYBODY IN THE FAKE NEWS WOULD SAY, THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. MEDIUM INCOME , MEDIAN INCOME FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS SURPASSED $50,000 A YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE PASSED THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORM BY FAR AN AMERICAN HISTORY. BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. I DON'T MEAN A LITTLE BIT. I MEAN LIKE DOUBLE, TRIPLE. WE ELIMINATED A RECORD NUMBER OF REGULATIONS AND WE ENDED THE WAR IN A THING CALLED AMERICAN ENERGY WHICH IS WOOD FOR TEXAS. SINCE MY ELECTION, NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IN TEXAS HAS INCREASED 35%. OIL PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED 60%. THE U.S. IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. YET EVERY MAJOR DEMOCRAT WANTS TO ABOLISH OIL PRODUCTION , ALL PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. I THINK THEY WANT TO GO TO WINDMILLS. WINDMILLS, YOU KNOW. I WANT TO WATCH TRUMP SPEAK. WE CANNOT, THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING. THEY WANT TO ANNIHILATE YOUR TEXAS ECONOMY. NO MORE OIL, NO MORE NATURAL GAS. HERE WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE, RIGHT? NO GUNS, NO RELIGION. NO OIL. NO NATURAL GAS. ABRAHAM LINCOLN COULD NOT WIN TEXAS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. COULDN'T DO IT. COULDN'T DO IT TODAY. COULD NOT DO IT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, HONEST AID, COULD NOT DO IT. I USED IT TO SAY, I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL. LOOK. [APPLAUSE] I SAID I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. EXCEPT FOR HONEST ABE LINCOLN WHEN HE IS WEARING THE HAT. THAT IS A TOUGH ONE TO BEAT. IT IS MUCH EASIER BEING PRESIDENTIAL. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACT LIKE A STIFF. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF TEXAS, IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING. THE MEDIA WOULD LOVE IT. EVERYBODY WOULD BE OUT OF HERE SO FAST, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE COME IN IN THE FIRST PLACE. DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER GET THAT CHANCE. TEXAS WILL NEVER GIVE IT TO THEM. REMEMBER THE LAST ELECTION? THEY SAID, TEXAS IS IN PLAY. THEY SAID, UTAH IS IN PLAY, TOO. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT COULD NOT GET IN. THEY SAID, IT IS PHONY. THEY TRY TO GET YOUR HOPES DOWN. THIS IS JUST LIKE FAKE NEWS. THEY SAID TEXAS. THEY SAID TEXAS IS IN PLAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TEXAS IS IN PLAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP , I HAD GUYS IN FROM TEXAS AND THEY ARE WEARING COWBOY HATS. A LOT OF GUYS. THEY SAID, I KNOWS OF THE DEVOUT TEXAS. DOUBLE TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO LOSE TEXAS. , DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO LOSE TEXAS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. TEXAS IS NOT IN PLAY. AND THEN WE HAD THAT GREAT NIGHT. THE POLLS CLOSED AT 7:00. USUALLY, THEY TAKE HOURS. EVEN IF IT IS BIG, THEY TAKE HALF AN HOUR. THE TEXAS POLLS ARE CLOSED. USUALLY, IT TAKES HOURS. IF IT IS NOT SO CLOSE, IT TAKES A LONG TIME. THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE OF TEXAS. RIGHT? THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED IN UTAH. REMEMBER THE GUY WITH THE SHAVED HEAD? EVEN HILLARY BEAT HIM. NOW HE IS ON THE TALK SHOWS. EVEN HILLARY BEAT THIS GUY IN UTAH. HILLARY CAME IN SECOND. I CAME IN FIRST. THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE, TOO CLOSE TO CALL. EXCEPT, UTAH, THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED. WE WON BY A LOT. WE WON FLORIDA AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA. WE WON NORTH CAROLINA. WE WON PENNSYLVANIA. WE WON A LOT. REMEMBER THESE PHONY PEOPLE? I KEPT GOING TO MAINE, I LOVE MAINE. IT IS CUT IN HALF. I WENT THERE FOR-FIVE TIMES. THEY GOT ME UP TO 269. I WON, BY THE WAY. I ONE, , WON, TOO. I WENT THERE. A LOT. THAT IS THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE WOULD BE MUCH EASIER. I WOULD GO TO FOUR STATES AND RELAX. I WENT TO 21 STATES. I USED TO BILY LEAVE AND OTHERS. IT IS LIKE YOU ARE A TRACK STAR. IT IS A DIFFERENT FORM OF TRAINING. WE DID GREAT. THEY SAID, YOU CANNOT GET TO 200. THEY WERE RIGHT. WE GOT TO 306. AFTER DECADES OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER, I HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO CONFRONT CHINA'S ABUSES. OUR RELATIONSHIP IS FANTASTIC. GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING. THEY GET IT NOW. A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA. I USED TO CALL IT THE WORST TRADE DEAL IN HISTORY. I THINK THE WTO, A REAL BEAUTY. THAT IS A REAL BEAUTY. THEY CONSIDERED CHINA A DEVELOPING NATION. BECAUSE YOU ARE A DEVELOPING NATION, THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE A DEVELOPING NATION. WE WROTE THEM LETTERS. WE DON'T CONSIDER THEM TO BE A DEVELOPING NATION. WE DON'T CONSIDER INDIA TO BE A DEVELOPING NATION. THEY ARE RIPPING US OFF. WE DID NOT WIN ANY CASES. WE JUST WON 7.5 ALIEN DOLLARS. WE HAVE ONE , WON A LOT OF CASES. THEY KNOW I WILL LEAVE IT THEY DON'T TREAT US FAIRLY. AND THEN THE PIGGY BANK IS GONE. WE ARE REPLACING THE NAFTA DISASTER. WE HAVE TO GET NANCY PELOSI TO PUT THIS UP FOR A VOTE. THE USMCA IS A GIANT VICTORY FOR MANUFACTURERS. OIL. THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD PASS IT. OVERWHELMINGLY, THEY WILL. NOWHERE IS THE DEMOCRAT BETRAYAL OF OUR NATION MORE DRAMATIC THAN IN IMMIGRATION. DID YOU SEE THESE DEBATES? CAN YOU SEE WHAT I AM COMPETING WITH? WHEN I HAD TO COMPETE WITH TED CRUZ, THAT WAS BRUTAL. HE WAS THE NATIONAL DEBATE CHAMPION? I NEVER DID THAT? ALL THE SUDDEN, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE DEBATING TOMORROW NIGHT. I SAID, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? I CONTRIBUTED TO A LOT OF THEM. THEY USED TO TREAT ME NICELY WHEN I CAN TO BUT IT. NOT SO NICE WHEN I WAS THERE OPPONENT. I SAID, I WANT TO SEE, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A DEBATE. I NEVER DEBATED LIKE WITH A PODIUM. I SAID, WHO ARE THEY? WE HAD 17 PEOPLE. PLUS ME. REMEMBER? GILMORE? NOBODY REMEMBERS HIM. WE HAD 18 PEOPLE. I SAID, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THEY ANY GOOD AT DEBATING? I HIRED A DEBATE COACH. HE LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. I SAID, THIS GUY KNOWS LESS THAN I DO. HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING, IT IS TRUE. HE SAID NEVER INTERRUPT WHILE THEY ARE SPEAKING. I SAID, OK, COACH, PUT ME IN, COACH. AFTER COUPLE OF THOSE STATEMENTS, YOU CANNOT BEAT TED CRUZ IF YOU DO NOT INTERRUPT HIM. I SAID, LET ME SEE THE CARDS. I WANT TO SEE IT. I NEED HELP. I'M GOING TO BE DEBATING. EVERYONE IS SAYING, DO YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEBATE PROFESSIONALLY? HE WAS PRESIDENT OF HIS CLASS. ONE GUY WAS A GOOD DEBATER IN COLLEGE. HE WAS THIS, HE WAS OK. THEY GIVE ME THE FIRST CARD, TED CRUZ. IT SAYS, NATIONAL DEBATE CHAMPION FROM PRINCETON. IS THAT RIGHT? AND THEN, NATIONAL DEBATE CHAMPION FROM HARVARD. I SAID TO MY WIFE, FIRST LADY, POTENTIALLY, I'VE GOT A PROBLEM. I SAID SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE OK. THEY WERE ONLY PRESIDENT OF THE CLASS. I NEVER RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE CLASS. I LIKED PLAYING BASEBALL BETTER. I SAID, MILLENNIA , MELANIA, I HAVE A PROBLEM. TED CRUZ WAS THE NUMBER ONE GUY IN COLLEGE. HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE GUY IN COLLEGE. WE CAME OUT OK. HE WAS TOUGH. SMART AS HELL AND TOUGH. GOOD MAN. THE FIRST CARD I LOOKED AT, TED CRUZ. NATIONAL DEBATE, HE WAS THE BEST IN ALL OF COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL. IN RECENT DEBATES, YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE UP THERE. THEY ARE NOT TED CRUZ, LEAVE ME. YOU SHOULD TURN DEMOCRAT, YOU WOULD WIN. NO? I DON'T THINK SO. EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, RAISED THEIR HAND IN FAVOR OF GIVING FREE HEALTH CARE TO ALL ILLEGAL ALIENS. THEY WANT TO GIVE MORE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN THEY GIVE TO AMERICAN CITIZENS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NEVER ALLOW THE DEMOCRATS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE DOLLARS. CAN'T DO IT. IN FACT, I JUST SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ACTION TO PROTECT AMERICAN HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS. AMONG THOSE HARDEST HIT BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ARE MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ARE MILLIONS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS RIGHT HERE IN TEXAS. INCLUDING PATRIOTIC MEXICAN AMERICANS WHO PLAY BY THE RULES. STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHETHER YOU ARE A FIRST GENERATION OR 10TH GENERATION, AND EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN, YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BADLY BUT YOU WERE NOT BEING TREATED BADLY ANYMORE. WE GOT RATE OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FROM OBAMACARE. EVERY CITIZEN DESERVES A GOVERNMENT THAT DEFEND YOUR JOBS. AND IS ALWAYS LOYAL TO YOU. WE ARE LOYAL TO YOU. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS BY 60% SINCE MAY. BUT AS WITH NO HELP FROM THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WILL NOT CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. WE COULD DO IT IN 15 MINUTES. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. THE DEMOCRATS WILL NOT CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. YOU KNOW WHAT THE LOOPHOLES ARE, RIGHT? CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THEM. YOU SAY, HOW ARE YOU? COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND PHONE NUMBER. COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN ADDRESS IN HONDURAS. CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS? THEY CAN'T. THEY SAY, THAT IS OK, WE CATCH AND RELEASE. AND THEN WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. SOME ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE. SOME OF THEM ARE UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS AND BAD. WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE BAD. THEY'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF THE COUNTRY, OK? WHILE WE ARE FIGHTING FOR SHARED PRIORITIES, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN FURTHER OUTSIDE OF THE MAINSTREAM. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS PUSHING A HEALTH CARE AGENDA THAT WOULD EVISCERATE MEDICARE. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS. WE WILL PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES AND ONLY , OVER 51 YEARS. PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. THE PRESS WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE NEWS CONFERENCES. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW DISHONEST THE MEDIA IS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT SUPPORTS LATE TERM REMOTE , ABORTION. RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHERS'S RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. AND THE CRACK POT GOVERNOR FROM VIRGINIA EXECUTES THE BABY AFTER BIRTH. YOU SAID THAT, RIGHT? YOU ARE MEMBER THAT ONE FROM LAST YEAR. THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE-TERM ABORTIONS. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF CRAZY POLITICIANS, HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME. OPEN BORDERS. SOCIALISM. BLATANT CORRUPTION. THEY ARE CORRUPT LIKE SCHIFF IS CORRUPT, HE IS CORRUPT. IT IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT IS ALSO THE PARTY OF HONEST ABE LINCOLN, WE FORGET THAT. WE HAVE TO USE THAT MORE OFTEN, DON'T YOU THINK? I LIKED HONEST AID. , ABE. THANK YOU. PLAY THAT TO THEM. YOU ARE RIGHT. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 152 FEDERAL JUSTICES. NEIL GORSUCH AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE, THEY SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO, THEY SAY IT IS DEFENSE. THEY SAY FEDERAL JUDGES. HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE? I HAVE NONE. I SAID, HOW MANY FEDERAL I SAID HOW MANY FEDERAL JUDGES TO HAVE? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THAT WOULD MEAN PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T APPOINT 142 JUDGES. YOU GET NONE. OR YOU'RE DOING A BAD JOB AS PRESIDENT BECAUSE YOU'RE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY. SO I CAME IN AND I SAID NO, NO, NO. CHECK IT AGAIN. 142. WE WERE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. 142 JUDGES. WITHIN 32 MONTHS, WE WILL HAVE JOHN AND TED AND ALL OF THESE GREAT CONGRESSMAN, WE WILL HAVE PASSED 182 FEDERAL JUDGES. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN THEY SAY OBAMA WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL PRESIDENT. HOW ARE YOU A WONDERFUL PRESIDENT WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO, YOU HANDED OVER TO THE REPUBLICANS? 142? HOW IS THAT GOOD? IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, I WOULDN'T BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT NUMBER. AND WE'LL HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF JUDGES BY THE TIME OUR TERM IS OVER IN 16 YEARS, MAYBE 20. [APPLAUSE] I'M ONLY KIDDING BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DO THAT THEY SAY SEE, HE'S ASSUMING CONTROL. WE HAVE THIS CRAZY GUY ON TELEVISION. AND HE GOES, YOU KNOW, HE'S TALKING TO A GUEST. YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO WIN, DON'T YOU? YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO WIN. I MEAN, WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. HE SHOULD BE HAPPY. BUT HE SAYS OUR MILITARY, HOWEVER SCHOOLS, EVER THIS, , OUR SCHOOLS, OUR THIS, OUR EVERYTHING. HE'S GOING TO WIN. HE'S NEVER LEAVING. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? HE'S NEVER LEAVING. [APPLAUSE] AND I THOUGHT THIS WHACKO WAS GETTING. , KIDDING. HE'S A COMEDIAN. I THOUGHT HE WAS KIDDING. HE WAS SERIOUS. WE PASSED VIA ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY BEEN TRYING TO PASS IT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS. THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. BUT THOSE GUYS AND ME, WE GOT IT DONE. AND TO PROTECT AMERICA'S SECURITY, I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED I RAN NUCLEAR DEAL , IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [APPLAUSE] AND BY THE WAY, THANK YOU ROBERT JEFFERS FOR BEING HERE, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE HERE. HE MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST. IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST PERFECT CHRISTMAS. HE MAY NOT KNOW THE , PERFECT CHRISTIAN. HE MAY NOT KNOW THE BIBLE AS WELL AS SOME. WHERE IS THAT GUY? ROBERT JEFFERS. [APPLAUSE] WHERE ARE YOU? HE'S A GREAT GUY. GOT A BIG BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE ON SUNDAY MORNINGS, I CAN TELL YOU. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESORT AND MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS, THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, I LOVE IT, "MADE IN THE USA." [APPLAUSE] WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS. WE'RE DOING THAT. WHO WOULD BELIEVE? WE'RE DOING THAT. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION SPENT NO MONEY ON THAT. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WOULD END, WITHIN 10 YEARS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC? WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE WOULD ADVANCE THAT? WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE VALUES THAT UNITE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS OUR LAND AND THROUGHOUT THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. THIS IS A GREAT STATE. [APPLAUSE] WE SUPPORT, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE BEDROCK'S OF OUR SOCIETY. [APPLAUSE] LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK THIS COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. [APPLAUSE] FROM DALLAS TO EL PASO, FROM YOU HOUSTON TALK , FROM HOUSTON TO AUSTIN, FROM THE RED RIVER TO THE RIO GRANDE, THIS ESTATE WAS SETTLED BY SOME OF THE TOUGHEST MEN AND STRONGEST WOMEN EVER TO WALK ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH, TEXANS. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE STATE WHERE A SMALL BAND OF PATRIOTS HAD THE BATTLE OF GONZALES, ARMED WITH A SINGLE CANNON, STAND DOWN A FOREIGN ARMY AND DECLARED, "COME AND TAKE IT!" [APPLAUSE] AND TEXAS IS THE STATE WHERE GENERATIONS OF FARMERS, RANCHERS, PIONEERS, AND OIL WORKERS BUILT A LIFE AND A HOME WITH THEIR OWN TWO, BEAUTIFUL HANDS. [APPLAUSE] THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF LUXURY. BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY. AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. [APPLAUSE] THESE COURAGEOUS TEXAS PATRIOTS DID NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO ERASE THEIR LEGACY, DEMOLISH THEIR LIBERTY, AND DESTROY EVER PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE , OUR PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. WEASEL NEVER, EVER , WE WILL NEVER, EVER ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION, AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING. AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! THANK YOU, TEXAS.

IT'S AN EXCITING DAY, THE FIRST ALL-WOMAN SPACE WALK UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE DOING IMPORTANT WORK. THERE'S A SHORT WINDOW FOR THE DOWN LINK AND ALSO THEY'VE GOT VERY BUSY WORK TO DO, THEY'RE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STATION. WHAT A BIG DAY, WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE, MR. PRESIDENT. IT'S OVER TO YOU FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THEM. THAT'S GREAT. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S GREAT, I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE IN AN INTERESTING PLACE. WE MAY HAVE TO BE A LITTLE EMERGENCY WORK, I DON'T THINK THAT'LL EVER BE NECESSARY WITH YOU, THE JOB YOU DO IS INCREDIBLE. I'M HERE WITH VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE AND MY DAUGHTER IVANKA. WE'RE THRILLED TO BE SPEAKING LIVE WITH TWO BRAVE AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS WHO ARE MAKING HISTORY. JOINING US DURING THEIR SPACE WALK OUTSIDE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR A WOMAN OUTSIDE OF THE SPACE STATION. OUR FLIGHT ENGINEER, CHRISTINA COOK AND FLIGHT ENGINEER JESSICA MEIR. I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU, WHAT YOU DO IS INCREDIBLE. SO, YOU'RE VERY BRAVE PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO DO IT. I MUST TELL YOU THAT. BUT YOU ARE AMAZING PEOPLE. THEY'RE CONDUCTING THE FIRST EVER FEMALE SPACE WALK TO REPLACE AN EXTERIOR PART OF THE SPACE STATION. THEY'RE DOING SOME WORK. AND THEY'RE DOING IT IN A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. AN ALTITUDE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL EVER SEE. CONGRATULATIONS, CHRISTINA AND JESSICA, ON THIS HISTORIC EVENT. THIS IS TRULY HISTORIC. YOU'RE RIGHT NOW ON TELEVISION ALL OVER THE WORLD SO DON'T GET NERVOUS. [LAUGHTER] I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL EVERYONE LISTENING AND WATCHING TODAY. YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE INTERESTED IN SPACE. THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH CREDIT BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN , THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER FEMALE SPACE WALKERS BEFORE US, THIS IS JUST THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN TWO WOMEN OUTSIDE AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S INTERESTING FOR US UP HERE, BUT FOR US IT'S JUST US DOING OUR JOB. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR FOR SIX YEARS, PREPARING FOR, DIDN'T REALLY, YOU KNOW, FOR US IT'S JUST COMING UP HERE AND DOING OUR JOB TODAY. DOING THE CAREER WE'RE TASKED WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT AND WE OF COURSE WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO ALL OF THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE US. THERE'S BEEN A LONG LINE OF FEMALE SCIENTISTS, EXPLORERS, ENGINEERS AND ASTRONAUTS AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS TO GET US WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WE HOPE TO PROVIDE INSPIRATION TO EVERYBODY, NOT ONLY WOMEN, BUT TO EVERYBODY THAT HAS A DREAM AND HAS A BIG DREAM AND THAT IS WILLING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE THAT DREAM COME TRUE. SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT ALL OUR LIVES. I CAN TELL YOU THE HARD WORK DID PAY OFF. BEEN UP HERE A FEW WEEK, THREE WEEKS IN SPACE, THIS IS MY FIRST FLIGHT AND MY VERY FIRST SPACE WALK SO IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEELING, I'M SURE YOU CAN ALL MAN IMAGINE, ONE I'LL NEVER FORGET. I'M BLESSED TO BE SHARING THIS MOMENT WITH CHRISTINA COOK, WHO IS NOT ONLY A CO-WRKER BUT A DEAR FRIEND. THANK YOU. CHRISTINA, JESS CHARACTER I WOULD LIKE TO, IF I COULD, JUST THANK YOU. JESSICA, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS, WORKING HARD. CHRISTIE NARC I STUDIED YOUR RESUME, IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, WHAT YOU'VE BOTH DONE, YOUR LIVES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE AND NOW YOU'RE IN A PLACE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL EVER GET THAT EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. THAT IS A FIRST STEP BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MARS. WE'RE LAUNCHING FROM THE MOON, MOST LIKELY, THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY OF DOING IT, JIM SO WE'RE LAUNCHING FROM THE MOON. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU BOTH. YOU'RE BRAVE, BRILLIANT WOMEN AND YOU REPRESENT THIS COUNTRY SO WELL AND OUR COUNTRY IS VERY PROUD OF YOU AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL TELL YOU, WHAT YOU DO IS REALLY SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. SO FIRST THE MOON, AND THEN WE GO TO MARS. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH HAVE A GOOD TIME. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T LIKE MY MESSAGE. TWO GREAT WOMEN. TWO GREAT PEOPLE. BIG DANGER, NOT EASY, NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD TAKE A PASS ON THAT ONE. BUT THEY'RE GREAT WOMEN. I THINK I HEARD THAT. THAT'S THE LINK. THAT'S THE END OF THE LINK. THEY HEARD MY MESSAGE. AND THEY TRIED TO RESPOND. I ASSUME THEY'RE OK. I ASSUME THEY'RE OK. ANYWAY, THEY'RE ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP SO THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME. WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE TO GET PEOPLE ON AND OFF THE SPACE STATION. BUT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. BY DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT WE'LL HAVE THE FIRST MAN , OR FIRST WOMAN AND NEXT MAN ON THE MOON WILL BE AMERICANS. THE GOAL IS 2024. IF ALL THINGS GO ACCORDING TO PLAN, 2024 IS WITHIN THE REALM OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE WORKING HARD TO MAKE THAT A REALITY. THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE BUILDING A HABITAT IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON, A SPACE STATION IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON, THAT WILL BE LAUNCHING IN 2022. ONCE THAT'S DEPLOYED THAT WILL BE MODIFIED INTO A MARS SHIP THAT WILL TAKE US ALL THE WAY TO MARS AND BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE WANT TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE AT THE MOON, WE NEED TO LEARN THOUSAND LIVE AND WORK ON ANOTHER WORLD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, AND THEN WE GO TO MARS. WHEN YOU GO TO MARS, EARTH AND MARS ARE ONLY ALIGNED ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE SUN ONCE EVERY 24 MONTH, OR 26 MONTHS, SO THAT WHAT , SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE HAVE TO TO BING THERE STAY. WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE AND WORK ON ANOTHER LAND. VERY EXCITING. EXCITING TIMES. THAT WHOLE PROGRAM WAS DEAD WHEN I TOOK IT OVER. WHEN WE CAME INTO OFFICE. AND SOMETHING THAT MIKE LIKED VERY MUCH, I LIKED VERY MUCH. AND YOU'RE BOTH DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, EVERYBODY IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. IT'S BEEN TOTALLY REINVIGORATED I THINK TO A LEVEL THAT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN. AND WE'RE ALSO THINKING IN TERMS OF DEFENSE. WE HAVE THE SPACE FORCE HAPPENING THAT'S GOING ALONG VERY NICELY AS YOU KNOW. WE'RE CREATING A NEW FORCE, IT'S CALLED THE SPACE FORCE, THAT'S A BIG THING. AND THAT'LL BE WORKING ALONG VERY CLOSELY WITH YOU. SO THAT'S BEYOND GOING TO THE MOON AND MARS. THAT'S ALSO DEFENSE OF OUR NATION. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. ANYWHERE THERE'S COMMERCE NEEDS TO BE DEFENDED. WE'RE INDUSTRIALIZING SPACE, IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES, THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY POSITIVE. IT ALREADY IS. WE NEED TO GROW IT. SO WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO COMMERCIALIZE IT, MAKE IT AN EXPORT AND OF COURSE THAT REQUIRES IT TO BE DEFENDED JUST LIKE THE HIGH SEAS FOR TRADE. FANTASTIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THAT WAS VERY EXCITING. AND THESE ARE TWO GREAT PEOPLE. THEY PUT THEMSELVES AT RISK FOR OUR NATION AND BECAUSE THEY LOVE DOING IT. AND THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I WILL SAY. IT TAKES A GREAT ABILITY. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. VERY NICE. THANK YOU. I THINK HE CLARIFIED ITISM DO HAVE TO SAY. THIS WE YESTERDAY HAD A TREMENDOUS DAY IN TEXAS. WE OPENED A LOUIS VUITTON PLANT, ONE OF THE GREAT BRANDS OF THE WORLD, THEY OPENED IT RIGHT IN THE HEART OF TEXAS, THE LONE STAR STATE, THEN WE WENT TO DALLAS AND HAD AN EVENT LIKE FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN. WE HAD A PACKED ARENA WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. INCREDIBLE EVENING. GOT BACK VERY, VERY LATE. I DID ACTUALLY GET TO HEAR ABOUT AMBASSADOR KENT,S THE WITCH HUNT, YOU KNOW, THEIR CROOKED SCHIFF IS COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS HARD AS HE CAN CONSIDERING HE'S REALLY, HE'S BEEN COMPROMISED SADLY AND BADLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT, AS BECAUSE OF THE FACT, AS YOU KNOW, I THINK AS THE PRESS KNOW HE MADE A STATEMENT AND HE MADE A VIRTUAL SPEECH ABOUT WHAT I SAID AND THEN IT TURNED OUT I DIDN'T SAY ANY OF IT BECAUSE HE FRAUDULENTLY MADE THE STATEMENT TO CONGRESS. I THOUGHT WHAT HE DID WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS. I UNDERSTAND HE HAS IMMUNITY, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY WHEN HE PUTS IT ON TWITTER WHICH HE DID, HE DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNE FI WHEN HE SPEAKS TO THE PRESS, WHICH HE DID. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS AMBASSADOR KENT WHO I HAVE NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE, I DON'T BELIEVE, OF MEET, I DON'T KNOW HIM AND THEY BROUGHT HIM IN AS A WITNESS AGAINST ME EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW HIM. AND HE EXCORIATED FROM WHAT THEY REPORTED ON THE NEWS AND OF COURSE MAYBE IN THIS CASE IT WON'T BE FAKE NEWS BUT HE EXCORIATED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND JOE BIDEN AND JOE BIDEN'S SON SAYING THERE'S TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS, TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH JOE BIDEN'S SON AND THE UKRAINE. HE'S GOT TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH BIDEN'S SON AND UKRAINE AND IT'S INAPPROPRIATE AND ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS, GUCKED ET , YOU COULD GET IT, YOU COULD SEE IT, IT'S BEEN A BIG DEALISM HEARD SCHIFF IS GOING, NO, KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT HE TALKED ABILITY THAT. THAT IS A TERRIBLE WITCH HUNT. IT'S BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. I SFOKE PRESIDENT ERDOGAN OF TURKEY. WE'RE DOING VERY, VERY WELL WITH TURKEY. THERE'S A CEASEFIRE. OR A PAUSE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. THERE WAS SOME SNIPER FIRE THIS MORNING. THERE WAS MORTAR FIRE THIS MORNING THAT WAS ELIMINATED QUICKLY. AND THEY'RE BACK TO THE FULL PAUSE. WE HAVE ISIS TOTALLY UNDER GUARD. TURKEY IS ALSO GUARDING SEPARATELY, THEY'RE WATCHING OVER EVERYTHING. SO YOU HAVE THE KURDS WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH, VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, I MUST SAY. THE KURDS. AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE TURKS WATCHING JUST SECONDARILY WATCHING, WE HAVE ISIS UNDER CONTROL. WE'VE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE OIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE OIL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THE OIL THAT EVERYBODY WAS WORRIED ABOUT, WE HAVE , THE U.S. HAS CONTROL OF THAT. AND THERE ARE NO SHOTS BEING FIRED. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING A LOT OF THINGS. THAT IS A DEAL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE 15 YEARS AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THE REAL NUMBER IS OVER A MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED. WE HAVE LOST NO, NOT A DROP OF BLOOD SINCE WE'VE STARTED WHAT I STARTED. AND IT WAS SO FAR IT'S WORKING OUT. IT'S A COMPLICATED RE. MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE DOWN. I HAVE TO WATCH IN GREAT INTEREST AS I SEE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FAILING FOR THE LAST 220 YEARS, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WENT IN AND DID WHAT THEY DID. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE. BUT WE'RE DOING A VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GREAT WORK. WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS. IT'S VERY FRAGILE. IT'S BEEN FRAGILE FOR YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING EACH OTHER FOR CENTURY, LITERALLY FOR CENTURIES THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING EACH OTHER. YEARS AGO WE INJECTED OURSELVES RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT. WE WON'T GO INTO WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS A GOOD THING OR BAD THING. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. BUT WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, I THINK, OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. LITTLE BIT UNCONVENTIONAL, A LITTLE BIT OF HARD LOVE, I TOLD YOU THAT, A LITTLE , THERE WAS A LOT OF PAIN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME PAIN BEFORE YOU CAN GET A GOOD SOLUTION. BUT THE KURDS ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT ERDOGAN AND TURKEY IS SATISFIED WITH IT. AND WE ARE IN A VERY STRONG POSITION. WE ARE ALSO IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN PUT TREMENDOUS POWERFUL SANCTIONS ON TURKEY OR WHOEVER ELSE WE WANT TO. OUR COUNTRY IS A FINANCIALLY MUCH STRONGER COUNTRY THAN WHEN I TOOK IT OVER. CHINA WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT NOW THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND RIGHT NOW CHINA IS WAY BEHIND US. WE PICKED UP TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN VALUE AND THEY'VE LOST TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY'RE HAVING THE WORST YEAR THEY'VE HAD IN 57 YEARS. WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA VERY WELL. WE'VE DONE SUBJECT TO GETTING IT SIGNED AND I THINK IT WILL GET SIGNED EASILY, HOPEFULLY BY THE SUMMIT IN CHILE WHERE PRESIDENT XI AND I WILL BETH BE. BUT A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. OUR FARMERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF. OUR BANKERS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS THE LIKES OF WHICH THEY'VE NEVER HAD TO THE LARGEST OR SECOND LARGEST DEPENDING ON YOUR DEFINITIONS, ABOUT 1.4 BILLION PEOPLE, POPULATION, WHETHER IT'S INDIA OR CHINA, THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE. WE'VE DONE SOME GREAT THINGS. I WANT TO SAY, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF DALLAS, THE PEOPLE OF FORT WORTH, THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS. BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK BERNARD ARNOT, ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESSMEN OF THE WORLD FOR AGREEING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS A FIRST. HE HAS BUILT THIS INCREDIBLE PLANT RIGHT IN OUR GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SUPER LUXURY AND SUPER PRODUCT, THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED, A BIG INVESTMENT, WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT. THAT WAS DONE WITH ME, WITH THE ELECTION, EVEN PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, I SAID YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP A PLANT SOMEPLACE IN THE UNITED STATES. HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TEXAS? I SAID I LOVE TEXAS. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. I SAID IF YOU DO IT, I'LL BE THERE. AND SO I FULFILLED THAT COMMITMENT. WE THINK OVER 1,000 PEOPLE WILL SOON BE WORKING THERE. YESTERDAY WAS BIG DAY. WE HAD A GREAT TALK WITH PRESIDENT ERDOGAN AND IT'S GOING VERY WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PEOPLE WILL SOON BE WORKING [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2019] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

FOUR DAYS FROM NOW THIS STATE WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS AND VOTE TO CONTINUE OUR EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WITH YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, REPUBLICAN TATE REEVES. GREAT GUY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP JOBS ARE BOOMING, CONFIDENCE IS SOARING, WAGES ARE RISING, CRIME IS FALLING, AND OUR NATION IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE NOW AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE. WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN A POSITION LIKE IT. WE'VE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, AND WE HAVE FINANCIAL STRENGTH -- AND, BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH A THING CALLED 401(K)s -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE STOCK MARKET HIT TODAY ANOTHER ALL-TIME HISTORIC HIGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNEMPLOYMENT IN MISSISSIPPI HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. EVER RECORDED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S NOT BAD WHEN YOU'RE ON THE DEBATE STAGE AND YOU SAY WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE EVER HAD, WE HAVE THE BEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER HAD, THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WE'VE EVER HAD. MS. . [LAUGHTER] THE BEST PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 158 BRAND NEW, BEAUTIFUL FEDERAL JUDGES TO UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN A VERY SHORT WHILE, WE'LL HAVE 182 FEDERAL JUDGES. PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT US 142. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE LEFT US 142 OPENINGS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LEAVE UP IN WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE -- NONE WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE, BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. AND JUST DAYS AGO THE UNITED STATES BROUGHT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST LEADER TO JUSTICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE GREAT MILITARY, AND IT WAS VERY, VERY DEPLETED. WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, IT WAS VERY, VERY DEPLETED, BUT IT AIN'T9 DEPLETED ANYMORE -- IT AIN'T DEPLETED ANYMORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH, al-BAGHDADI, THE FOUNDER AND LEADER -- LOOK, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM FOR A LONG TIME. I KEPT SAYING, WHERE IS AL-BAGHDADI? THAT'S THE ONE I WANT. WHERE IS HE? AND THEN, BY THE WAY, FOLLOWING DAY WE GOT NUMBER TWO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT HE WAS THE FOUNDER AND THE LEADER OF ISIS, AND HE'S DEAD. AND BAGHDADI, HE WAS A SAVAGE -- [APPLAUSE] AND SOULLESS MONSTER. BUT HIS REIGN OF TERROR IS OVER. AMERICAN SPECIAL OPERATORS EXECUTED A MASTERFUL RAID THAT ENDED HIS WRETCHED LIFE AND PUNCHED OUT HIS TICKET TO HELL, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE SPENT HIS LAST MISERABLE MOMENTS ON EARTH COWERING AND TREMBLING AND CRYING IN FEAR OF THE AMERICAN WARRIOR THAT WAS RIGHT THERE GOING RIGHT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO ENEMY STANDS A CHANCE AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND MISSISSIPPI LOVES OUR MILITARY, THAT I CAN TELL YOU, AND OUR MILITARY LOVES MISSISSIPPI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN, AND AMERICA IS ALL OVER THE WORLD RESPECTED AGAIN. IT'S ABOUT TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT WHILE WE'RE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS GONE COMPLETELY INSANE. THE RADICAL LEFT IS DETERMINED TO TRANSFORM AMERICA INTO A COUNTRY YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE. WE ARE THE ONES STANDING IN THEIR WAY, AND WE WILL NEVER GET OUT OF THEIR WAY. IT WILL BE EASY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FROM EVEN BEFORE WE WON THE ELECTION, THE FAR-LEFT DEMOCRATS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA -- RIGHT BACK THERE, LOOK AT ALL OF THEM, OH. IT'S TOO BAD WE GET SUCH GOOD RATINGS, BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T, THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE. LOOK AT HOW MANY -- IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS BEFORE IT FAILED, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW WHY IT FAILED? BECAUSE THEY DISRESPECTED US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH BUT -- BUT THE MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A CORRUPT PARTNERSHIP TRYING TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL AND TO THWART AMERICAN DEMOCRACY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. FIRST, THEY ENGINEERED THE RUSSIA HOAX. THAT WAS A TOTAL HOAX. THE SINGLE GREATEST LIES EVER FOISTERRED UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEN THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT. IT NEVER ENDED. WITH 18 ANGRY DEMOCRATS AND AN UNLIMITED BUDGET, LET'S GO GET HIM, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL, DID IT? THAT FIZZLED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY. AND NOW CORRUPT POLITICIANS NANCY PELOSI -- AND SHIFTY ADAM SCHIFF, SHIFTY -- AND THE MEDIA ARE CONTINUING WITH THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT. THIS IS ONE I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE INVOLVED IN. THE WORD IMPEACHMENT, TO ME IT'S A DIRTY WORD, NOT A GOOD WORD. TOTALLY PHONY DEAL. THEY KNOW IT, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE NEVER HAD GREATER SUPPORT THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, IT'S TRUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUE. AND IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO OUTSIDE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GIVE UP YOUR SEAT, PLEASE, JUST WALK OUT -- ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE? BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS, THERE'S NO PLACE BETTER TO HAVE A RALLY, TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND TO ALSO AT THE SAME TIME BE VERY SERIOUS THAN TO HAVE A TRUMP RALLY ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS ONE ON MONDAY NIGHT, I SAID LET'S DO FRIDAY, RIGHT? YESTERDAY THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO POTENTIALLY NULLIFY THE VOTES OF 63 MILLION AMERICANS, DISGRACING THEMSELVES AND BRINGING SHAME UPON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THEY'VE BEEN NOTING TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION SINCE THE MOMENT I WON, BUT THE PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED KNOW LONG BEFORE I WON. [APPLAUSE] 19 MINUTES AFTER AFTER I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THE HORRIBLE NEWSPAPER -- FAKE, FAKE, FAKE WASHINGTON POST -- DECLARED THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT BUSH -- PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST BEGUN. AT LEAST THEY GAVE US 19 MINUTES. [LAUGHTER] YESTERDAY'S VOTE BY THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS IS AN ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY ITSELF. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE REPUBLICANS ARE REALLY STRONG, THE STRONGEST I'VE EVER SEEN THEM, THE MOST UNIFIED AYE EVER SEEN THEM. -- I'VE EVER SEEN THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE MOST UNIFIED I'VE EVER SEEN THEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH DEMOCRAT LIES, HOAXES AND EXTREMISM. THE DEMOCRATS' OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT HAS CREATED AN ANGRY MAJORITY THAT WILL VOTE MANY DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS OUT OF OFFICE IN 2020. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ING MAKE -- MAKE NO MISTAKE, THEY ARE COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ME BECAUSE I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THIS IS DIFFERENT, THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WELL, THEY'VE NEVER HAD AN ELECTION LIKE 2016 EITHER, HAVE THEY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. THEY'VE NEVER QUITE FIGURED IT OUT. AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN. SO LET'S TRY AND IMPEACH HIM, HOW ABOUT THAT CRAZY REPRESENTATIVE AL GREEN, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE WE CAN'T BEAT HIM. I DON'T THINK SO, RIGHT? I DON'T THINK SO. AL GREEN, HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY. THE DEMOCRATS, THE MEDIA EXPECT DEEP STATE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP US, AND IT'S NOT ME, IT'S US, IT'S ALL OF US. IT'S 63 MILLION, BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN 63 MILLION, MUCH MORE. AND RIGHT NOW OUR NUMBERS ARE HIGHER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE, SO, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THEY WANT TO STOP US BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE HERE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING UP SO MUCH TIME. WE'RE DRAPING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON -- DRAINING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOTHING TERRIFIES DEMOCRATS MORE THAN THE FACT THAT ALL OF THEIR SPYING -- SPYING. THEY ACTUALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I MEAN, THEY TRIED, OH, WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST CHECKING THINGS OUT. THE LYING, THE FALSIFYING. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS PLUS, BEFORE I EVER EVEN ANNOUNCED THEY WERE SPYING. I GUESS THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING TO WIN, RIGHT? BUT OVER THE PAST MORE THAN THREE YEARS IS FINALLY BEING EXPOSED. AND REMEMBER THIS, THE TRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE. DESPERATE TO CONCEAL THEIR DECEIT, THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW ATTACKING US FOR CALLING OUT THE GRAVE CORRUPTION OF THE BIDENS JUST LIKE THEY MELTED DOWN WHEN WE POINTED OUT CROOKED HILLARY'S SHOCKING AND VERY MANY MYSTIQUES. -- MISDEEDS. 33,000 E-MAILS, 33,000 E-MAILS DISAPPEARED. BUT SHE SAID THEY ONLY HAD TO DO WITH HER WORKING OUT AND HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] WE LOVE THE ENVIRONMENT, EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE CLEANEST AIR AND THE CLEANEST WATER THAT WE'VE EVER HAD AND YET WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD AND ENERGY BY FAR. I DON'T KNOW, JILL STEIN, SHE RAN LAST TIME, I KNOW SHE'S NOT AN AGENT OF RUSSIA. WHEN HILLARY MADE THOSE STATEMENTS, THEY WORK FOR RUSSIA, THEIR AGENTS bbI SAID, WHEN SHE MADE THATSTATEMENT ABOUT ME THREE YEARS AGO IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET OUT OF THAT STATEMENT. SHE MADE IT ABOUT THEM, EVERYBODY LAUGHED. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE PROVE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE ARE VERY BAD PEOPLE THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA IS WORSE THAN ALL OF THEM. [APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT THE PREPOSTEROUS HOPES THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW TRYING TO PEDDLE. LOOK. WOULD IT HAVE NOT TOO MUCH POLITICAL EXPENSE OF THE BUILT LOTS OF BUILDINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN SHOW BUSINESS, JUST DID ONE SHOW CALLED THE APPRENTICE. [CHEERING] 14 SEASONS AND WHILE I LEFT CRAZY ARNOLD TOOK OVER. IT DIDN'T DO TOO WELL. IT WAS DEAD. IT WAS DEAD FROM THE FIRST EPISODE I SAW IT I SAID IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT ARE THEY DONE TO THIS BEAUTIFUL SHOW? ARNOLD. BUT THINK ABOUT IT, WITH NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE BEAT THE CLINTON DYNASTY, THE BUSH DYNASTY, THE PRESIDENT BARACK bb AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WORKED HARDER AT DEFEATING ME THEN CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON DEAD. HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE ONLY TIME I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN HIM WORK HARD, WHEN HE CAME TO TRY TO BEAT TRUMP. IT'S TRUE. REMEMBER, HE SAID, REMEMBER, HE SAID, HE WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL. THEN THEY FIGURE THEY COULD TAKE US OUT A VERY DIFFERENT WAY, VERY DISHONESTLY. WITH THE LYING AND SPYING AND LEAKING.AND WE ARE KICKING THEIR ASS. [CHEERING] IN THE DELUSIONAL DEMOCRAT FANTASY I AM NOW SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF SOMEONE CALLED ONE PERCENT JOE. I USED TO CALM ONE PERCENT JOE BECAUSE HE COULD NEVER GET ONE PERCENT OF THE PRIMARIES THAT HE GOT BROUGHT OUT BY OBAMA OUT OF THE TRASH HEAP. BECAME VICE PRESIDENT. BOWIE NOW NAMED HIM VERY SLOW SLEEPY JOE. VERY SLOW. HE'S GOTTEN SLOWER AND SLOWER, I'M AFRAID IF HE GETS A NOMINATION HE WILL BE SO SLOW WE WILL HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF DEBATES IN HISTORY. AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGHEST RATED DEBATES IN HISTORY AGAINST CRICKET HILLARY. IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN THINK SLEEPY JOE WILL GET IT BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RUNNING SO IT SO EARLY I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CAMPAIGN. DID YOU HEAR, BETO O'ROURKE, DID YOU HEAR? POOR BETH bbHE'S PATHETIC. HE RAN AGAINST TED CRUZ, TED CRUZ WON. HE SPENT ALMOST $100 MILLION AND TED CRUZ AND I HELPED TED AND WE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER BUT I USED TO WATCH HIM BUT WHEN HE CAME ONTO THE REALLY BIG STAGE THIS CRAZY STAGE I NOTICED HE WAS FLAILING WITH THE ARMS AND STANDING ON TABLES. HE WAS STANDING ON COUNTERTOPS. I SAID DOES HE EVER STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SPEAK? HE'S WAVING HIS ARMS GOING CRAZY AND I SAID, WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? WHAT IS HE ON? REMEMBER HE MADE THE STATEMENTS THAT HE WAS BORN FOR THIS. ANYBODY THAT SAYS HE WAS BORN FOR THIS, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. I USED TO HAVE GUYS COME INTO MY OFFICE, SIR, I'M THE GREATEST SALESMAN. THE TRUTH IS, ANYBODY THAT SAYS THEY'RE GREAT SALESMAN, USUALLY THEY ARE NOT A VERY GOOD SALESMAN. IT'S TRUE. IT'S THE SNEAKY ONES IN THE BACK THAT DON'T TALK. THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, THEY ARE THE ONES. BUT BETO O'ROURKE, HE IS NASTY. HE SAID HE WAS BORN FOR IT. HE WAS BORN FROM HEAVEN HE CAME DOWN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, SOME REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU MADE A TOTAL FOOL OF HIMSELF. HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS, THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. [CHEERING] HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS A VERY HOT POLITICAL PROPERTY. AND HE WENT BACK AS COLD AS YOU CAN BE. HE WAS A NASTY GUY. HE HAD A COUPLE POLICIES THAT DON'T WORK WELL IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. HE WAS AGAINST RELIGION, HE WAS AGAINST YOU HAVING A GUN. AND HE WAS AGAINST OIL. YOU COME FROM TEXAS YOU DON'T LIKE RELIGION, YOU DON'T LIKE OIL AND YOU DON'T HAVE GUNS, THAT'S NOT A GOOD COMBINATION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. THAT'S NOT GOOD IN MISSISSIPPI EITHER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD ANYWHERE. HE WENT BACK HOME TO TEXAS AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT HIM FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S AMAZING HOW COLBY CAN GET SO QUICKLY.HE WAS A NASTY GUY. OH, ALABAMA. I LOVE ALABAMA. I GRANDMA. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. BUT IN THE GRADE TWISTED AND CORRUPT WORLD OF ADAM SCHIFF, AFTER BEATING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND THAT MEANS bbTHEY HAD MESUPPOSEDLY SENT TO MYSELF, LET'S SEE, I'VE GOT A GUY NAMED SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, KIND OF LIKE bbHOW DO I BEAT HIM? HOW DO I BEAT THIS GUY? HE IS SUCH A GREAT bbCLINTON WAS EASY. OBAMA WAS EASY. THE BUSH DYNASTY bbBUT SLEEPYJOE I'M WORRIED ABOUT. RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] SO THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, GEE, I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. LET'S CALL UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. . THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE LAST LITTLE SLIVER IN THE FIRST LITTLE SLIVER AND THEY WILL PUT IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DAMNED DISHONEST AND SAY LET'S USE UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY. IT WILL SHOW THE LAUGHTER AND THEY WILL SHOW THE SARCASM AND THEY WON'T SHOW THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONORABLE PEOPLE bbALMOST.IT'S A DISGRACE. BUT WE SAY IT ANYWAY. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, THE PEOPLE GET IT. SO THEY HAVE A BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT IN UKRAINE, GOOD GUY BY THE WAY. I'M ON A PHONE AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE PHONE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU CALL THE LEADERS OF COUNTRY MANY PEOPLE LISTEN.I'M ON THE PHONE AND THEY WANT ME TO SAY TO THIS BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT WHO JUST GOT THERE, CALLED TO CONGRATULATE HIM, PLEASE, COULD YOU HELP ME? I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME UNTIL I LOOKED DOWN THE CARD AND HE'S A NICE GUY AND HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO ROOT OUT CORRUPTION BECAUSE UKRAINE HAS TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION PROBLEMS. AND HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THE REASONS I HELD UP MONEY, VERY IMPORTANT, CORRUPTION. BUT THE OTHER REASON, WHY IS IT GERMANY AND FRANCE IN UK AND ALL THESE EUROPEAN NATIONS bb WHY ARE THEY DOING THINGS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE UNITED STATES? [CHEERING] SO I MADE THIS CALL, HAD THIS WONDERFUL CALL AND THE TRANSCRIPT PROVES IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS PERFECT. IT WASN'T LIKED ALMOST, IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. I MADE IT AT THE BEHEST OF PEOPLE TO SAY COULD YOU CALL AND SAY HELLO? I'M AN HONEST PERSON ANYWAY BUT DO YOU THINK WHEN I'M MAKING A CALL TO A NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY THAT I WOULD SAY SOMETHING IMPROPER WHEN I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE LISTENING ON THE LINE. MANY PEOPLE. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THE SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, GREAT GUY, HE'S LISTENING. TRANSCRIBERS, FORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE POLICY EXPERTS, JUNIOR AIDS, LOW-LEVEL STAFFERS, PROBABLY APPRENTICE, WHOEVER THE HELL WANTS TO LISTEN, THEY LISTEN. THEY HAVE ME MAKING SOME KIND OF A DEAL WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AND REMEMBER, THE NEW PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE IS SPEAKING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT. I GUARANTEE HE'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TOO. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. CORRUPT POLITICIAN SHIFT THE ADAM SCHIFF STOOD BEFORE CONGRESS AND STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MADE UP A CONVERSATION THAT HE SAID I HAD WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. MANY PEOPLE SAW THAT AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. HE SAID TERRIBLE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE SAID IT WAS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. THEY MUST THINK WE ARE NUTS, TO BE HONEST.IT'S ALL A PHONY DEAL THIS WHOLE IMPEACHMENT SCAM TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE 2020 ELECTION AND DELEGITIMIZE ONE OF THE GREATEST ELECTIONS, MAY BE THE GREATEST. LET'S GIVE GEORGE WASHINGTON CREDIT. EVERYBODY EXPECTED HE WAS GOING TO WIN. MY PHONE CALL, WHICH WAS TOTALLY PERFECT AND APPROPRIATE AND IF YOU WANT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT, YOU SEE HOW PERFECT IT WAS. BUT THEY DON'T QUIT. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR OF SLEEPY JOE. SO I QUOTE LET ME ACT LIKE HIM, I GOTTA SPEAK REALLY SLOW THOUGH. [LAUGHTER] I SAID, YOU'RE NOT GETTING A BILLION, I LOOKED AT THEM AND I SAID, I'M LEAVING. IN SIX HOURS. IF THE PROSECUTOR ISN'T FIRED, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. HE GOES AT THE END, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THESE KIND OF ENERGY. HE SAID WELL, SOME OF IT bHEGOT FIRED. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] [INAUDIBLE] BY THE WAY, HE IS DROPPING LIKE A ROCK. WHEN YOU ARE AT ONE PERCENT, THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON. HE SHOULD BE THERE FAIRLY SOON. AS YOU KNOW, THE UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR THAT BIDEN GOT FIRED AFTER THREATENING TO WITHHOLD I THINK IT WAS $1 BILLION OR SOMETHING. WAS THE PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING HIS SON'S COMPANY THAT WAS PAYING HUNTER BIDEN, A GUY JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY, HE WAS PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH WORKING FOR AN ENERGY COMPANY HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH ENERGY. HE KNEW LESS ABOUT IT THEN THIS YOUNG, HOW OLD ARE YOU? SIX. THIS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN FRONT OF ME. [CHEERING] SIX. IN THIS YOUNG SIX-YEAR-OLD IS SMARTER, I BASICALLY GO WITH HER. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? IT'S CALLED A PAYOFF. BUT THE FAKE NEWS, THEY APOLOGIZE. I WATCHED THIS HORRIBLE GUY, GIVES LOUSY RATINGS, ANDERSON COOPER. THE HATRED BETWEEN HIM AND FREDA YOU GOT FRITO. THAT'S CUOMO. FRITO. I CALL HIM FREDA LIKE FROM THE MOVIE. I WATCHED ANDERSON COOPER AND I WATCH HIM APOLOGIZE FOR EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION TO BIDEN. THE GOOD NEWS IS, BIDEN DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. REMEMBER BIDEN SAID, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE. HE NEVER SPOKE TO HIS SON ABOUT GETTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NUMBER HE NEVER SPOKE TO bbWE ARE DEALING WITH LIFE. YOU NEVER SPOKE TO THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT DAY, YOU KNOW THE WORLD OF THE INTERNET, AND THE WORLD OF SMART PEOPLE, THAT'S WHERE bbTHAT'S WHY BETO ISN'T SMART, HE TOLD OUR GREAT FIRST LADY TONIGHT, WHO PEOPLE LOVE. [CHEERING] WHEN HE QUIT HE QUIT LIKE A DOG I SAID YOU SEE PEOPLE THINK THIS IS EASY, THIS ISN'T EASY. IT JUST WORKED OUT THAT WAY BUT BIDEN SAID, I NEVER MET THE PEOPLE, NEVER MET THE GENTLEMAN, UNFORTUNATELY IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS A PICTURE CAME OUT WHERE THEY ARE PLAYING GOLF TOGETHER. BUT HE NEVER MET. NOW YOU ASK HIM, WE PLAYED A ROUND OF GOLF WE WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE HOURS, AND NEVER MENTION THE FACT THEY ARE PAYING MY SON MILLIONS. CRAZY ANDERSON COOPER, LOUSY RATINGS. CNN, THE WORST, THE WORST. THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF, YOU SEE! THE LIGHT WAS ON THEY JUST TURN IT OFF. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S TOUGH, FAKE CNN I TRIED NOT TO DO THAT BECAUSE I SEE THEIR LIGHT ON.WHEN LIGHT GOES ON THAT MEANS bbBUT INALL FAIRNESS, THE PICTA IS A BROADCAST, VERY FEW PEOPLE bb HERE'S THE THING, YOU HAVE THE GUY UP THERE SAYING THAT THEY ARE FAKE THAT THEY ARE NO GOOD. THAT THEY ARE LIARS AND CHEATERS. THAT THEY ARE PHONIES. IT'S HARD TO BE BROADCASTING THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NETWORK THAT HAS YOU ON. WE UNDERSTAND. THE LIGHTS OFF. [LAUGHTER] AND THEN REMEMBER THIS, bbWASSO NICE, PRIOR TO RUNNING TO FOR POLITICS HE WAS SO NICE TO ME. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HE'S A WEAK PERSON. BUT THEY ARE ALL WEEK. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE NEED HONESTY WITH OUR MEDIA. WE NEED HONESTY. BECAUSE THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND BY THE WAY, YOU PROBABLY READ IT, WE THREW THEM OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WE DON'T SHOW THEM ANYMORE. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GO WE THREW THEM OUT. THEY CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND I GOT TO IT BACK TO THE SKY, WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? HE CAME OUT AND DID THE MORNING SHOW. THAT WAS THE LAST LEASING OF HUNTER. THAT WASN'T GOOD. THE MORNING OF HIS FATHER'S VERY BAD DEBATE. BEFORE I SAY THE FINAL THING ON HUNTER AND THEN WE PUT HIM TO REST FOR A WHILE, WE GET RID OF THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES WE GET RID OF THEM. WE DON'T HAVE THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND BUY IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT. WE USED TO HAVE THEM STACKED UP. I GO IN AND SEE A MEETING WITH MY PEOPLE AND THEY ARE SOUTH KOREA OR SOMEBODY AND I GO IN AND GOING TO THESE OFFICES, I WOULD LOSE CLEC 10 OR 15 OF THEM PACKED ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE WASHINGTON POST, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE WORKS. ONE DAY IT'S TIMES, ONE DAY IT'S SUPPOSED. THEY TAP EACH OTHER IS SO BAD, SO PHONY, IN MY OPINION, IT'S VIRTUALLY CORRUPT. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. YOU NEVER HAVE A GOOD STORY. EVEN WHEN WE GOT ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI. LIKE HE WAS A RELIGIOUS PLAQUE. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? IF OBAMA WOULD HAVE DONE IT. THIS GUY BUILT ISIS. THE CALIPHATE. IT WAS THE SIZE PHYSICALLY OF OHIO THE STATE OF OHIO THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 7 MILLION PEOPLE AND THEY THE ONES THE ORANGE JUMPSUITS I CALLED ONE OF THE PARENTS AFTER WE DID THIS AND I TALKED TO THEM AND THEY WERE, HOW CAN YOU BE HAPPY? THEY WERE SO THRILLED THAT WE GOT THIS ANIMAL. THEY WERE SO THRILLED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] STORY WAS A MASSIVE STORY THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MAYBE THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING. THAT STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST. GONE. THAT'S OKAY I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE STORY. I DID IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT. [CHEERING] IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, THEY'D BE TALKING ABOUT THAT STORY FOR WEEKS. WITH ME, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO COME OF THE ACTUALLY PLAYED IT DOWN. AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS, CONAN THE DOG GOT MORE PUBLICITY THAN ME AND I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. [CHEERING] CONAN THE INCREDIBLE. HE IS COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN A FEW WEEKS. [CHEERING] DID YOU EVER SEE A STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST? IF OBAMA HAD THAT STORY, THAT THEY WOULD BE GOING ON FOR ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS. THEY BE TALKING ABOUT HIS BRAVERY. 142 JUDGES bbTHEY ALWAYS SAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IS FEDERAL JUDGES. WE GOT TWO SUPREME COURT'S. [CHEERING] GREAT ONES. GORSUCH AND KAVANAUGH, GREAT JUDGES. DID YOU EVER SEE ANY HUMAN BEING TREATED WORSE THAN NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH? DID ANYBODY EVER? DID ANY HUMAN BEING BY THESE PEOPLE THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. JUST TO FINISH, HUNTER THEN GOES TO CHINA, NOW I'M DEALING WITH CHINA RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. THEY DREAM ABOUT THE DAY WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE, AND WOULD THEY LIKE TO HAVE, HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU GET THIS SON WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE OF INVESTING GIVEN $1.5 BILLION TO INVEST, HE MAKES MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE BIGGEST GUYS AND WALL STREET GET IT, HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER PLACES ALSO I UNDERSTAND, FOLKS, IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT THE PRESS DOESN'T COVER IT FOR WHAT IT IS. IT'S A PAYOFF. AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SLEEPY JOE WITH THIS SON GETTING ALL THIS MONEY FROM CHINA BECOME PRESIDENT AND TAKE OVER THE CHINA DEAL. THEY ARE NOT LIKING ME. THEY HAD THE WORST YEAR THEY'VE HAD IN 57 YEARS. THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BROKEN UP LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL BECAUSE THOSE TARIFFS ARE GIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS NOW, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING WITH SOME OF IT? JUST A SMALL PORTION BUT 100% TAKING CARE OF OUR FARMERS GOT $16 BILLION LAST YEAR. AND $12 BILLION THIS YEAR. BECAUSE THEY TARGETED OUR FARMERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE FARMERS LOG TRUMP AND THE TRUE FARMERS LOVE TROUT.THEY TARGETED THEM AND BROUGHT THE 16 DOLLARS DOWN TO PRACTICALLY NOTHING AND THEY THOUGHT THE FARMERS WOULD SAY, WE DON'T LIKE TRUMP, THEY DID THE OPPOSITE, THEY SAID WE KNOW HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE WE BEEN RIPPED OFF FOR SO MANY YEARS. I SAID TO SECRETARY ABOUT THE AGRICULTURE, I SAID HOW MUCH DID THEY SPEND BUYING OUR CORN AND SOYBEANS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS? HE SAID, SIR, $16 BILLION. I SAID GOOD, I WILL MAKE IT UP AND WE WILL HAVE A LOT LEFT OVER. WE WILL HAVE PRETTY SOON OVER $100 BILLION IN MONEY PAID INTO THE UNITED STATES TREASURY BY A COUNTRY THAT NEVER GAVE US $0.10. THEY ONLY TOOK. WHEN I SAID TO THE FARMERS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND YOU $16 BILLION AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN SPLIT IN THE $12 MILLION THE YEAR BEFORE. THINK ABOUT THAT, $28 BILLION, AS IT COMPLEMENTS OF CHINA. AND WE HAD A LOT LEFT OVER, NOT BAD. NOT BAD. YOU THINK OBAMA WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK HILLARY DID WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK SLEEPY JOE WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ON TUESDAY THE PROUD PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI WILL SEND DEMOCRATS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS REASON AS WELL AS THE FACT YOU GOT A GREAT GENTLEMAN IN YOUR MIDST. BUT YOU HAVE TO REJECT THEIR EXTREMISM AND THEIR SOCIALISM AND THEIR CORRUPTION THAT CORRUPT, ADAM SCHIFF IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. WHEN HE MADE THE PHONY SPEECH, WHAT HE MADE UP HIS BARELY HORRIBLE SPEECH AND SAID THAT I SAID IT. I SAID I'M GOING TO SUE HIM, THEY SAID SURE, I'M SORRY CAN'T. YOU GOT TOTAL IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE MADE IT IN CONGRESS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, AT LEAST WE HAVE A FORUM. WE HAVE A PLACE WE CAN TALK SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. A BUNCH OF PHONY PEOPLE BUT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND WHY YOU HAVE TO MAKE bb [CHEERING]HE'S A GREAT GUY TOO. ALL I KNOW IS HE IS LOVED AND RESPECTED BY YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR. BECAUSE PHIL IS SOME PIECE OF WORK. PHIL IS SO CONFIDENT, I WANTED PHIL TO RUN FOR CERTAIN OFFICES AND I WANTED HIM TO DO bbI TRIED TO GET HIM. SOME GUYS bbHE SAID NO SIR I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE I LOVE THE PEOPLE. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM. HE IS THE GREATEST. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bb HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE. HE SAID, NO, SIR, I'VE BEEN DOING IT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. MOST PEOPLE ARE SO INSECURE, THEY KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING, bb REALLY A CHAMPION FOR MISSISSIPPI VALUES AND TATE HELP CUP YOUR TAXES OVER 50 TIMES INCLUDING THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN MISSISSIPPI HISTORY. [CHEERING] TATE, PRO-WORKER, PRO-JOBS, PRO-FAMILIES, PRO-LIFE. [CHEERING] TATE IS A TRUE LEADER IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE UNBORN. [CHEERING] THE OTHER SIDE IS NOT. TATE TO REEVES WILL SUPPORT OUR POLICE, UPLOAD SANCTUARY CLIQUES WHO LOVE OUR POLICE. I LOVE OUR POLICE. WE LOVE OUR POLICE. OPPOSE SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH IS JUST TERRIBLE. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. AND TATE WILL ALWAYS DEFEND YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. TATE IS RUNNING AGAINST A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT NAMED JIM HOOD. ALL I KNOW ABOUT JIM HOOD IS HE FOUGHT VERY HARD TO ELECT CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. HE WANTED OBAMA TO WIN SO BADLY AND THEN HE WANTED HILLARY TO WIN AND THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY WE NEED HERE, NOT MISSISSIPPI. HE SUPPORTED BY EXTREME LEFTISTS LIKE STACEY ABRAMS, WHO BY THE WAY WENT DOWN TO DEFEAT IN FRONT OF A TERRIFIC GENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA, BRIAN KEMP. AND THEY CAME IN WITH, THEY BROUGHT THEM ALL. THEY HAD PRESIDENT OBAMA, THEY HAD MICHELLE OBAMA, THEY HAD OPRAH WINFREY, AND ALL HE HAD WAS bbAND WE WON. [CHEERING] VERY EASILY. BUT STACEY ABRAMS WANT TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM EDUCATION THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM THIS, THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM FREE HEALTHCARE THEY WANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN CITIZENS HAVE. MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN MILITARY HAVE. JIM HOOD WANTS TO RAISE THE TAXES. HE SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION PROVIDERS. HE SUPPORTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THE WHOLE BENEFITS. AND HE OPPOSED OUR TRAVEL BAN WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO KEEP TERRORISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. JIM HOOD WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND OPPOSED YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. IF YOU DON'T WANT A FAR LEFT DEMOCRAT RUNNING MISSISSIPPI, WAIT A MINUTE, HOW IS THIS GUY bbI CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS A COMPETITIVE RACE. IT'S EMBARRASSING. I'M TALKING MISSISSIPPI. I'M TALKING TO MISSISSIPPI. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I WILL THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO BE THE RIGHT GUY. I THINK THE GUY THAT YOU WANT IS TATE REEVES. HE'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. HE WILL BE A GREAT GREAT GOVERNOR. TATE, COME ON UP. [CHEERING] THANK YOU TATE, TUESDAY GO OUT AND BUT FOR TATE, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. DON'T KID YOURSELF, YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. THAT WITH HIM, IT'S UNDER ATTACK. WE ARE ALSO JOINED TONIGHT BY A MAN WHO IS TRULY I'VE SAID A LOT, HE HAS BEEN A GREAT GOVERNOR AND HE LOVES YOUR STATE AND HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE, GOVERNOR PHIL BRIAN, WHERE IS PHIL? [CHEERING] COME UP PHIL. COME UP PHIL. THANK YOU PHIL. THANK YOU MY PHIL. WHAT A GREAT JOB. TO CONTINUE THAT WHOLE THING GOING FORWARD. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS A WARRIOR A FRIEND OF MINE. WHENEVER THERE IS A PROBLEM HE IS THERE HE IS ALWAYS THERE HE WILL BE RIGHT AT THE FRONT, HE IS TOUGH, SMART, BRILLIANT ACTUALLY. AND HE LOVES THIS STATE AND HE LOVES YOU PEOPLE. SENATOR ROGER WICKER. ROGER. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ROGER. SOMEBODY I WILL CALL HER UP BECAUSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT SHE'S RUNNING WITH ME. SHE JUST RAN I SAID SIDNEY YOU JUST RAN YOU JUST WON. SHE SAID NO I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. SHE'S RUNNING IN 2020. I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE LIKE SIX YEARS I SAID CINDY, IT'S ONLY LIKE A YEAR. CINDY HYDE SMITH, SHE'S INCREDIBLE. SHE'S TOUGH AND SMART AND STRONG AND SHE IS WITH US ALL THE WAY. CINDY HYDE SMITH. IS THIS GUY INCREDIBLE OR WHAT? [APPLAUSE] GREAT JOB. FANTASTIC WOMAN. ALSO WITH US TWO TERRIFIC FRIENDS OF MINE. MIKE ROGER AND LIKE CINDY HYDE SMITH WHO'S LIKE ALL OF THEM. IN TATE HE'S GIVEN ME RIGHT THERE WITH US. ALL FIGHTING TOGETHER. TWO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. TRENT KELLY, MICHAEL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR YOUR NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNN FITCH. YOUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE MICHAEL WATSON. GREAT PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT STATE TREASURER DAVID McRAE. STATE AUDITOR SHED WHITE. AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER ANDREW GIBSON. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MIKE CHANEY AND FORMER GOVERNOR A MAN THAT NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF IN THIS ROOM. BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S A LEGEND IN POLITICS AND A GREAT GUY HE'S A GREAT GUY. HALEY BARBOUR. GREAT GUY. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE WE ARE THE HOTTEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE CREATED OVER 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. THAT I WOULD CREATE 6.7 NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY WOULD'VE SAID HORRIBLE THINGS. THEY WOULD'VE SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 51 YEARS. SOON TO BE HISTORIC. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT JUST DROPPED TO THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED HISTORIC. REALLY UNIMPORTANT TO ME. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE LOOKED AT 55,000 MISSISSIPPI RESIDENTS OUT OF POVERTY. HOURLY EARNINGS ARE UP NINE PERCENT IN MISSISSIPPI SINCE THE ELECTION. UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS WE LOST 60,000 FACTORIES IN OUR COUNTRY UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE'VE ALREADY ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES AND MANY MORE ARE COMING IN. TO GET RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES WE PASSED MASSIVE TAX CUTS ON AVERAGE $2000-$2500 PER FAMILY. BRINGING ALMOST $1 TRILLION BACK HOME TO OUR IT SHOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING BIG COMPANIES CAN GET THEIR MONEY BACK. BOTH BUREAUCRATICALLY AND FROM A TAX STANDPOINT. THEY BROUGHT BACK ALMOST $1 TRILLION BECAUSE OF US. ALL PUT TO WORK. WE/THE LARGEST NUMBER IN HISTORY OF TOP REGULATIONS AND WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY WE ARE NOW THE NUMBER ONE REDUCER OF ENERGY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. FOR DECADES USED CORRUPT POLITICIANS TAKE MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS TO IMPOSE CATASTROPHIC TRADE VIEW. MISSISSIPPI LOST 40% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, TWO OF THE WORST DEALS EVER MADE BY OUR COUNTRY. 100,000 MISSISSIPPI JOBS WERE WIPED AWAY JUST LIKE THAT. THAT'S A BIG PRICE TO PAY FOR WASHINGTON'S DISLOYALTY TO THE AMERICAN WORKER. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.IT WAS DISLOYALTY STUPIDITY. CORRUPTION. LOTS OF REASONS. NOW YOU FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S LOYAL TO YOU AND I AM. I'M A FIGHTER FOR YOUR JOBS, YOUR WAGES, YOUR FACTORIES YOUR FAMILIES AND DIGNITY WE ARE STOPPING CHINA FROM RIPPING US OFF. WE ARE STOPPING ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE LOSE OUR MONEY, WE LOSE OUR WEALTH WE LOSE OUR JOBS WE CLOSE UP FACTORIES, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. IT'S REVERSED. WE WERE THE SUCKER COUNTRY FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT WE ARE NOT THE SUCKER COUNTRY ANYMORE AND THEY ALL KNOW IT. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA AND THAT WAS A DISASTER, NAFTA. WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT OF NANCY PELOSI WILL EVER PUT IT UP TO A VOTE. WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE. NERVOUS NANCY. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY VICTORY. SHE'S VERY BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS, HAVING FUN. THE US MCA WOULD BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR MISSISSIPPI FARMERS AND ALSO INCLUDES POWERFUL PROJECTIONS FOR MISSISSIPPI AUTOWORKERS MANUFACTURERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THE GREAT AGREEMENT. ABOUT TIME WE GOT RID OF NAFTA. THE DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP THEIR MADNESS AND PASS THE US MCA RIGHT NOW. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE U.S. OIL INDUSTRY. UNDER OUR POLICIES TOYOTA HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A $170 MILLION INVESTMENT IN MISSISSIPPI bb DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS PLACE? BLUE SPRINGS. BEFORE MY ELECTION OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AS A PIGGYBACK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PRODUCTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE TAKE CARE OF OTHER COUNTRIES BUT WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. THEY KNOWINGLY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY DEPLOYED OUR MILITARY TO PROTECT, IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY I ASK THOSE WEALTHY NATIONS NOW, AND RESPECTFULLY THE OTHER DAY SAID TO THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA. WE WILL HELP YOU BUT YOU GOT TO PAY. HE WAS GREAT BUT NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED BEFORE. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S BEN'S BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WE SAID YOU ARE VERY WEALTHY YOU HAVE TO PAY. THAT'S TRUE WITH MANY COUNTRIES BY THE WAY. THEY NEVER RESPECTED US THEY COULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN. HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE COULDN'T REALLY ANSWER IT. BECAUSE HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN. ASK CHINA HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE YOU PROTECTING? PRESIDENT XI. THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE WHAT A STUPID QUESTION. HOW MANY COUNTRIES YOU PROTECTING PRESIDENT PUTIN. HE LOOKS AND HE GOES, RUSSIA. WE ARE PROTECTING AT LEAST 94. THERE ARE SO MANY THEY CAME AND TOLD ME. I BEEN TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER FOR FOUR MONTHS. IT'S ALL BEAUTIFUL THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING. THE SAME POLITICIANS FOR PRECIOUS AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE INTO THE SANDS OF THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR FAILED RULING CLASS WAS THEIR RIGHT TO RULE OVER YOU TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR JOBS AND REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OF THE GLOBE WHEREVER THEY WANTED IT BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT. OUT LIKE THAT. THE GREAT SELLOUT HAS ENDED AND IT ENDED IT ENDED TODAY I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP FOREIGN NATIONS WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING UP OUR NATION. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. OUR POLICY OF NEVER ENDING WAR. THE REGIME CHANGE IN NATIONBUILDING BY THE CLEAR PURSUIT OF AMERICAN INTEREST. IT'S THE JOB OF ALL MILITARY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY NOT TO BE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD PROVING THE WISDOM OF THIS APPROACH WE RECENTLY SECURED A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN SYRIA WITHOUT SPILLING ONE DROP OF AMERICAN bI HAVETO BE HONEST ONE SOLDIER STEPPED ON A NAIL. IT'S TRUE. I SAID DON'T TELL THE PRESS THAT BECAUSE I SAID DON'T MENTION IT PLEASE. THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO IMAGINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. TAKE IT A LITTLE LOW-KEY. NOT A DROP OF BLOOD. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND DAVID FIGHTING FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. BUT WE DID KEEP THE OIL IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE KEPT THE OIL. WE WILL HELP OUT OURSELVES IF THAT'S OKAY. THEN THEY DEMANDED AMERICAN CITIZENS EXCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION FROM THOSE TEAR AFFLICTED NATIONS AND REGIONS. I DON'T THINK SO. WE DID NOT FIGHT THEM OVER THERE. ONLY TO INVITE THEM OVER HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES BY ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTED MIGRATION FROM TERROR PRONE NATIONS AND IMPLEMENTED THE TOUGHEST EVER VETTING PROCEDURES. NO ISSUE HAS EVER BEEN SO HORRIBLY DISCARDED BY A PARTY AS THAT ISSUE BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, WHICH MEAN CRIME. THEY WANT TO SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH MEANS CRIMES AND DRUGS AND bbAFTER PLEADING THE MIDDLE-CLASS DRIVE, DEMOCRATS THROUGH OPEN OUR BORDERS TO THE WORLD FLOODING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH POISONOUS DRUGS AND CRIMINAL CARTELS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE IN STRONG BORDERS AND SAFE COMMUNITIES. WE ARE NOW BUILDING A WALL. YOU THINK THAT'S EASY, THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT THAT, I GOT MONEY FOR EVERYTHING BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WALL ABOUT $0.10. NOT $0.10. BUT WE GAVE THE MILITARY A LOT OF MONEY AND WE TOOK IT FROM THE MILITARY AND WE TOOK IT FROM YOU WE TOOK IT FROM THERE WE HAD TO GO TO COURT IN ALL THE SUDDEN WE STARTED WINNING CASES. THE WORLD IS GOING UP RAPIDLY. IT'S GOING UP RAPIDLY THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS WORLD. EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO THEY WENT TO THE BORDER PATROL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY SAID GIVE ME THE SPECIFICATION. THEY SAID WE WOULD LIKE STEEL BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE CAN'T TAKE. I SAID WHICH ONE YOU WANT? I DID ALL THREE. BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM. WE'VE GOT IT ALL. WE ALSO NEED SEE-THROUGH SERVE. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT WE ARE DOING BUT WE SHOULD HAVE ANYWHERE FROM 400 TO ALMOST 500 MILES OF WALL BUILT BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IT WAS A TOUGH ONE. AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS BUILDING THEIR HEARTS OUT. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE IN KEEPING TERRORIST CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE DROPPED 60% SINCE MAY AND WE ARE FASTER THAN EVER SECURING THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND SOON IT WILL BE WHEN THE WALL IS COMPLETED, SECURED LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO, THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDERS AND 27,000, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THEY ARE KEEPING PEOPLE OUT AND I WANT TO THINK THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS AN EXCELLENT PERSON, GREAT MAN. AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND THE REASON IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS WON'T EVEN APPROVE THINGS CALLED LOOPHOLES. LOOPHOLES, THAT'S A HORRIBLE NAME, THAT MEANS IT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT MEANS YOU CAN COME IN ILLEGALLY AND LOTS OF THINGS, CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH, AND YOU GOT TO RELEASE THEM. BY LAW YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM. THEY WILL ARREST THE BORDER PATROL AGENT IF THEY DON'T b BUT WE COULD END THIS IN 15 MINUTES BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY ARE OBSTRUCTION, POLLUTERS AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO WITH TATE REESE. TATE IS GOING TO SEND A BIG SIGNAL BY THE WAY. IT'S GREAT FOR YOU, HE'S GONNA BE A GREAT GOVERNOR IT ALSO SENDS A BIG SIGNAL TO THESE RADICAL LEFT CRAZY DEMOCRATS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT TATE WINS. VERY IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES WITH THE HELP OF STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI, WHICH HAS BANNED SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE PHIL BRIAN SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM AND ROGER WICKER SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. AND CINDY SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. DEMOCRATS, SANCTUARY CITIES, FORCE THE RELEASE OF DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO OUR SPACE. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. I WOULD WANT THEIR JOB. MS 13 THEY WALK RIGHT INTO THOSE NESTS. THEY START SWINGING YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT. I SAID, BETTER YOU THAN ME, WHO WOULD DO GOOD? THAT GUY WOULD DO GOOD, MOST OF YOU WOULDN'T DO SO GOOD BACK THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH GUYS AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WHO WOULD DO IT? THEY ARE MOVING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MS 13 THESE GANGS ARE THE WORST PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. I SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE THIS CRAZY NANCY PELOSI SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THEY ARE NOT bb HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM? THEY SLICED PEOPLE UP WITH A KNIFE BECAUSE IT'S MORE PAINFUL THAN USING A GUN. THEN I HAVE TO DEFEND MYSELF WHEN I SAY THEY ARE ANIMALS BUT I NEVER CHANGED I DIDN'T SAY I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE, I LIKE TO APOLOGIZE CRAZY NANCY. YOU LOOK AT HER DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO, SHE SPENDING ALL HER TIME ON THIS CRAP FOR THIS IMPEACHMENT STUFF. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TENTS AND DRUGS AND NEEDLES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE FLOATING IN THE STREETS IN THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS, NANCY PELOSI, GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT NANCY. GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. [CHEERING] GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL VOTE FOR TATE REEVES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. THE DEMOCRATS HEALTHCARE AGENDA WOULD HELP OBLITERATE MEDICARE. I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ALWAYS. WE WILL ALWAYS. VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA EXECUTED A BABY, REMEMBER THAT WHOLE THING? AFTER BIRTH. AFTER BIRTH. SOME PEOPLE NEVER HEARD OF IT. HE SAID THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE STARTS TALKING TO THE MOTHER. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD.

[APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE REPRESENTATIVES AND THE JOB MATT BEVAN HAS DONE AS GOVERNOR, HE HAS DONE SOME THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO AND HAS DONE THEM UNBELIEVABLY WELL AND IT HAS SET YOU UP TO BE A ROCKETSHIP IN THE FUTURE. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO. WHEN YOU HAVE THE BEST NUMBERS YOU'VE EVER HAD IN HISTORY THE STATE, WITH THE HELP OF YOUR SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH MCCONNELL, WE HAVE CONFIRMED 157 JUDGES TO FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR POLICE AND REBUILDING THE MILITARY AND DEFEATING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] THE MONSTROUS LEADER OF ISIS IS DEAD [APPLAUSE] . [APPLAUSE] AND THE MAN WHO TOOK HIS PLACE IS DEAD, ALSO. [APPLAUSE] [USA! USA! USA!] AMERICAN SPECIAL FORCES GAVE THE WORLD NUMBER ONE TERRORIST A ONE-WAY TICKET TO HELL.

ALL MADE. [APPLAUSE] AND OUR COUNTRY IS WINNING AGAIN AND OUR COUNTRY IS HIGHLY RESPECTED AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] BUT WHILE WE ARE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TOTALLY INSANE. THEY WANT TO OBLITERATE THE RULE OF LAW, DRIVE OUT FAITH FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE, SILENCE YOU ONLINE, CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS. YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL. THE SECOND AMENDMENT, VERY IMPORTANT, VERY PRECIOUS. THEY ARE AFTER YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WITH US, NO ONE IS TOUCHING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, AND THAT INCLUDES THE GENTLEMAN RUNNING AGAINST MATT. THEY ARE AFTER YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE WANT TO INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN, DESTROY ANYONE WHO HOLDS TRADITIONAL AMERICAN VALUES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK THE BOYS FROM COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE TONIGHT. THE FAR-LEFT WANTS TO OPPOSE THEIR , IMPOSE THEIR IDEOLOGY ON THE NATION, TELLING YOU WHAT TO THINK, BELIEVE, AND HOW TO LIVE. THEY WANT TO ERASE OUR TRADITIONS, CULTURE, HISTORY, AND HEROES. THEY WANT TO SUBJUGATE YOU AND TAKE YOU TO THEIR WILL. BUT KENTUCKY WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. KENTUCKY CANNOT BE BROKEN. YOU ARE TOO STRONG AND TOO SMART. [APPLAUSE] IN THEIR CRAZE, DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TEAR HER COUNTRY APART. , OUR COUNTRY APART. FIRST, DEMOCRATS ENGINEERED THE RUSSIA HOAX, THE MOST EGREGIOUS FRAUD EVER HOISTED AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE RUSSIA HOAX. THEN MUELLER SCAM. TWO YEARS AND THEY SAID NOTHING AND THEN MUELLER TESTIFIED. A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME. [APPLAUSE] AND LAST WEEK, I DO NOT KNOW TULSI GABBARD BUT HILLARY CLINTON SAID TULSI GABBARD IS A RUSSIAN AGENT. I DO NOT KNOW JILL STEIN. JILL STEIN WAS INVASION OF RUSSIA, ALSO. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. [APPLAUSE] AND NOW NANCY PELOSI AND ADAM SCHIFF, THEY ARE CORRUPT. AND NANCY, UNLIKE KENTUCKY WHICH IS DOING GREAT, NANCY SHOULD STOP WASTING TIME, GO BACK TO HER DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO, HELP THE HOMELESS, GET RID OF THE DRUGS AND RID OF THE NEEDLES LYING ON THE STREET AND ALL THE THINGS WASHING INTO THE OCEAN THROUGH THEIR STORM STORE , STORM SEWER SYSTEM. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER PLACES RUN BY THE RADICAL LEFT IS UNBELIEVABLE. LOS ANGELES. WHEN WE LOOK AT LOS ANGELES, IT LOOKS LIKE A THIRD WORLD CITY. GO BACK TO NANCY'S AREA AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THERE HAS BEEN NO PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS GONE DOWN LIKE THE AREA NANCY PELOSI REPRESENTS. AND SHE IS WASTING ALL OF HER TIME. AND IT IS BACKFIRING. YOU SEE IT. BUT THE MEDIA HAS LAUNCHED A BRAZEN ASSAULT ON OUR NATION WITH THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT. IMPEACHMENT. TODAY, WE JUST HIT THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF THE STOCK MARKET. [APPLAUSE] LAST WEEK, THINK OF THIS. IN THE HISTORY OF COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE BETTER. IT IS NOT RICH OR POOR. IT'S FOR EVERYONE. YOUR 401(K), HOW ARE YOU DOING? [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE TELL ME THEIR WIVES AND HUSBAND, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING THERE 401(K)S FOR YEARS AND THEY TOTALLY LOST RESPECT. BUT NOW THEY THINK THE HUSBAND IS A FINANCIAL GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS UP 74% AND SHE SAYS DARLING, I LOVE YOU, YOU ARE THE MOST BRILLIANT FINANCIAL MIND. AND IF THE DEMOCRATS GET IN, IT IS GOING DOWN TO NOTHING. IT WILL BE WORTHLESS. IT WILL BE WORTHLESS. YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN. MARK MY WORDS. BUT HOPEFULLY WE DO NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. WHEN WE TOOK OVER, IT WAS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND DO NOT FORGET, THAT WAS ZERO INTEREST. PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING INTEREST ON THEIR MONEY. BUT THAT WAS WITH ZERO INTEREST. LAST WEEK, THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO TRY AND NULLIFY THE BALLOTS OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS , 63 MILLION PEOPLE, DISGRACING THEMSELVES AND BRINGING SHAME UPON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THEY HAVE BEEN PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION SINCE THE FIRST HOUR THAT WE WON, AND EVEN BEFORE, THEY WERE PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION. 19 MINUTES AFTER I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THE DISGUSTING WASHINGTON POST, LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE BACK HERE. LOOK. FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THE FAKE NEWS. LOOK AT ALL OF THEM. [BOOS] WHAT THEY DO NOT NOW IS THAT WE , IS THAT WHEN WE HANG IT UP IN FIVE YEARS, NINE YEARS, 13 YEARS OR MAYBE 17 YEARS, OR MAYBE, IF I STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH, 21 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] NOW THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. [LAUGHTER] NOW THEY ARE LIKE, SEE, I TOLD YOU HE IS A DICTATOR. HE WANTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF OUR COUNTRY. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. YOU HAVE ONE NOT JOB ON TELEVISION SITTING DOWN DOING AN INTERVIEW RECENTLY AND HE LOOKS AT THE PERSON HE IS INTERVIEWING AND HE GOES, HE IS A TOTAL DEPRESSIVE. AND HE GOES, YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO WIN, DON'T YOU? THE GUY GOES, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. NO, HE IS GOING TO WIN. HE HAS NEVER LEAVING OFFICE. HE HAS NEVER GOING TO LEAVE OFFICE. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. [APPLAUSE] BUT THE DISGUSTING NEWSPAPER RIGHT THERE, THE WASHINGTON POST, DECLARED THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST BEGUN. [BOOS] YOU CAN GET HIM OUT, IT'S ALL RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] BE GENTLE. BE VERY GENTLE. EVERY TIME I SAY GET HIM OUT OF HERE, I END UP GETTING SUED. HE SAYS, OH, HE HURT MY ARM. SO BE GENTLE. I DO NOT GET SUED. HE IS GOING HOME TO MOM. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, DO WE LOVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT? [APPLAUSE] AND IN THE WHOLE WORLD, EVEN ON A MONDAY NIGHT, I LIKE THE MONDAY NIGHTS. WE ARE 58-0, THAT IS A GOOD RECORD. EVEN ON A MONDAY NIGHT, IS THERE ANYTHING COOLER THAN BEING AT A TRUCK RALLY , TRUMP RALLY? [APPLAUSE] NOTHING COOLER. WITH LAST WEEK'S VOTE, FAR-LEFT HAS DECLARED WAR ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THESE PEOPLE ARE LUNATICS. IN THE FACE OF THESE ATTACKS, REPUBLICANS ARE THE MOST UNIFIED THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN, AND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM AND BEEN A BIG PART OF THEM FOR A LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE IT. AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WIN IN 2020. SO WHAT DO WE DO TO WIN? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH DEMOCRAT LIES, SLANDER, OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT WHICH HAS CREATED AN ANGRY MAJORITY THAT WILL VOTE THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE . [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS] PRESIDENT TRUMP: TOMORROW, KENTUCKY HAS A CHANCE TO SEND RADICAL DEMOCRATS A MESSAGE. YOU WILL VOTE TO REJECT THEIR EXTREMISM, SOCIALISM, AND CORRUPTION, AND YOU WILL VOTE TO REELECT KENTUCKY GOVERNOR MATT BEVIN, WHO HAS DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB. MATT IS A VETERAN. A PATRIOT. HE HAS DONE IT ALL. HE HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADER. HE PUT HIS WHOLE LIFE AT STAKE TO HELP THIS STATE AND THE JOB HE HAS DONE IS INCREDIBLE. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, KENTUCKY HAS CREATED OVER 57,000 NEW JOBS. [APPLAUSE] WE WORKED TOGETHER. HE IS DIFFICULT, I HAVE TO SAY. HE IS SUCH A PAIN. WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING FOR KENTUCKY LAKE MONEY, AID, LIKE HE WANTS ME TO CALL ONE OF THE MANY MANUFACTURERS NOW THAT ARE COMING INTO KENTUCKY, COULD YOU CALL THE HEAD OF SOME COMPANY IN JAPAN? I SAY, DO I HAVE TO? PLEASE. BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IN A GOVERNOR? [APPLAUSE] AND THE JOB HE HAS DONE, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. HE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. MATT IS STRONG ON CRIME AND TOUGH ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] HE IS PRO-LIFE, AND 100% PRO SECOND AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IF YOU VOTE DEMOCRAT. I WATCH WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE CALLING ME ALL THE TIME. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, I AM TELLING YOU. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING HERE , DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FAKE NEWS SAYS? THEY SAY TRUMP ONLY GOT ONE STANDING OVATION. BECAUSE THEY STOOD AT THE BEGINNING AND NEVER SAT DOWN, BUT THEY DO NOT SAY THAT SECOND PART. [APPLAUSE] GREAT SPIRIT. YOU KNOW WHY? YOU LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE TURNED THIS BIG MONSTER SHIP AROUND AND WE NEED SO BADLY, IT IS LIKE YOU PLANT THE TREE AND IT TAKES A LITTLE, WE HAVE TO GET THE ROADS TO GROW, WE HAVE THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND OUR COUNTRY AND THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND I THINK IT IS LIKE 118, I TOLD YOU WE HAVE A RECORD STOCK MARKET TODAY. I HAVE TO CHECK IT BECAUSE WITH THE FAKE NEWS IF I AM OFF BY HALF A POINT, IF IT IS 117I'M NOT 118, EVEN IF I GO UNDER, THEY REPORTED AND SAY I DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH. IT WAS REALLY 119. BUT LIKE A LOT OVER 100 WHERE WE HAD THE HIGHEST STOCK MARKET IN OUR HISTORY. INCREDIBLE. [APPLAUSE] MATT BEVIN HAS MADE RECORD INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION FOR KENTUCKY STUDENTS. EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. MATT BEVIN WILL DEFEND YOUR KENTUCKY VALUES. HE LOVES THE STATE. FROM AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT FROM THE EXTREME LEFT, NOT GOOD. I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE, HOW CAN YOU VOTE FOR SOMEONE FROM THE EXTREME LEFT? BASHIR IS A MAJOR LEFTY. ARE YOU SURE WE NEED AN ELECTION TOMORROW, MATT? HOW DOES KENTUCKY VOTE FOR A PERSON, I AM TELLING YOU, HE WILL ALWAYS VOTE FOR PELOSI AND SCHUMER AND SHIFTY ADAM SCHIFF. HE MAKES UP A CONVERSATION. HE GETS UP BEFORE CONGRESS. HE REPEATS MY CONVERSATION WITH THE HEAD OF UKRAINE, A GOOD GUY. I SAY I NEVER SAID THAT. HE MADE A HORRIBLE STATEMENT. A TOTAL LIE. AND THEN I WENT AND RELEASED THE ACTUAL CONVERSATION. AND YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER AFTER THAT. BECAUSE THE WHISTLEBLOWER SAID LOTS OF THINGS THAT WERE NOT SO GOOD. THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. SHIFTY ADAM SCHIFF. MATT IS RUNNING AGAINST THESE PEOPLE AND WOULD HAVE TO SEND THEM A SIGN. THEY ARE DANGEROUS. THE RADICAL LEFT SAYS ANDY BASHIR, WHO REJECTS EVERYTHING KENTUCKY STANDS FOR. THAT IS WHO THEY WANT TO WIN. BASHIR IT HAS OPENLY PLEDGED TO STOP THE POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP. WHAT POLICIES? TAKE CARE THE VETS, MILITARY, WE WANT JOBS, WE WANT COMPANIES TO STOP LEAVING US. THEY ARE NOT LEAVING ANYMORE. HAVE YOU NOTICED? REMEMBER YEARS AGO BEFORE I THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THIS, WHEN I SAID LET'S DO THIS, I SAID MELANIA, LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. AND ONE BY ONE WE WERE DOING GOOD AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE, IF YOU REMEMBER BEFORE WE RAN, COMPANIES WERE LEAVING KENTUCKY. THERE WERE GOING TO MEXICO. THEY WERE GOING TO CHINA AND JAPAN. ANYPLACE BUT KENTUCKY. YOU DO NOT READ ABOUT THAT NOW. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. [APPLAUSE] BASHIR WANTS TO SHUT DOWN YOUR ENERGY AND RAISE YOUR TAXES AND TAKE A GIANT WRECKING BALL TO THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY, THE GREATEST ECONOMY YOU HAVE EVER HAD, HE IS GOING TO DESTROY IT AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG. IT WILL GO QUICKLY. YOU ARE SITTING THERE AND EVERYONE HAS GOOD JOBS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU FIND ANOTHER JOB. YOU GO GET A BETTER JOB FOR MORE MONEY. BASHIR DOES NOT REPRESENT YOU. HE REPRESENTS THE WASHINGTON SWAMP AND IS BACKED BY THE SAME PEOPLE TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE LAST ELECTION. [BOOS] BASHIR FUNDED HILLARY CLINTON AND IS SUPPORTED BY PRO-ABORTION AND OPEN BORDERS FANATICS. BASHIR WANTS TO BRING SANCTUARY CITIES TO KENTUCKY. THINK ABOUT THAT ONE. RELEASING VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND ALIENS TO TERRORIZE INNOCENT KENTUCKY FAMILIES. HE WANTS SANCTUARY CITIES. HE HAS NOT LEARNED WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAD A GREAT ELECTION A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE WON TWO HOUSE SEATS AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LOSE PROBABLY BOTH OF THEM AND BEGOT THEM BY A LOT. AND I THINK WE ONE , WON BECAUSE THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNDER ASSAULT BY DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE BAD NEWS CAME OUT AND I THINK THAT WAS THE REASON WE GOT BOTH HOUSE SEATS BY A LOT. BASHIR IS LIBERAL, EXTREME, AND TOO DANGEROUS FOR KENTUCKY. TOMORROW, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO VOTE REPUBLICAN. WE HAVE TO GO REPUBLICAN ALL THE WAY. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO BRING UP A MAN WHO WORKED SO HARD. A GREAT NATURALLY BUSINESS AND HE STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AND HE WILL BE ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT'S IN THE HISTORY AND MAYBE THE GREATEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE, MATT BEVIN. COME ON UP, MATT. [APPLAUSE] MATT BEVIN: HOW DO YOU LIKE HAVING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE ARENA? [APPLAUSE] MATT BEVIN: THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FINAL FOUR IN TERMS OF ENERGY. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY. THANK YOU, KENTUCKY. IT IS CRITICAL WE GO TOP TO BOTTOM. DO YOUR ACIDIC , CIVIC DUTY AND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES THAT KENTUCKY IS LEADING THE WAY AND THAT WE SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALSO JOINTS TONIGHT BY A POWERFUL MEN IN WASHINGTON, MITCH MCCONNELL. [APPLAUSE] NOBODY WORKS HARDER FOR KENTUCKY THAN MITCH. NOBODY WORKS HARDER. AND FRANKLY, NOBODY WORKS SMARTER. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD. HE WORKS SMARTER. WHEN THE DEMOCRAT ARSONISTS IN WASHINGTON TRIED TO DESTROY AN INNOCENT MAN NAMED BRETT KAVANAUGH, NOW JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, MITCH REFUSED TO CAVE TO THE LEFT WING MOB. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MAN TREATED SO BADLY IN WASHINGTON AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. PREVIOUSLY JUDGE, NOW JUSTICE. WE GOT HIM IN AND HE HAS BEEN GREAT AND HE WILL BE GREAT. [APPLAUSE] MITCH CONFIRMED TWO TREMENDOUS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND HELP DELIVER ONE OF THE LARGEST INVESTORS , LARGEST INVESTMENTS EVER IN THE MILITARY AND PAST V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR AMAZING VETERANS. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW MITCH'S OPPONENTS BECAUSE I CAME HERE LAST YEAR, SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LOCATION, BUT THAT IS OK. STILL THE GREAT STATE OF KENTUCKY. BECAUSE AMY MCGRATH, AN EXTREME LIBERAL, WAS AGAINST ANDY BARR. AND ANDY BARR IS WITH US TONIGHT AND WE ARE GOING TO INTRODUCE HIM. [APPLAUSE] SHE SAID TO HERSELF, I FAILED IN CONGRESS, LET'S GO FOR SENATE. SHE WANTED TO GO TO THE HOUSE. NOW SHE WANTS TO GO. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. EXTREME LIBERAL, ANTI-GUN, LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AMY MCGRATH COMPARED MY ELECTION, THINK OF THIS. SO INSULTING. SHOULD I SAY IT? WHY NOT? SO INSULTING. HE WORKED SO HARD AND LOVE YOUR COUNTRY SO MUCH AND THEY GET UP TO SAY THINGS AND SHE COMPARED IT TO 9/11. SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS AND SUPPORTS THE IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT LIKE NOBODY AND WANTS TO GET RID OF ME. SHE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH ME LAST YEAR. WE CAME IN LAST YEAR AND HE ENDED A JOB ON HER. SHE WAS CAUGHT TELLING DEMOCRAT DONORS THAT SHE IS FURTHER LEFT THAN ANYONE IN HISTORY OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? NEXT NOVEMBER, THE STATE NEEDS TO DEFEND ITS VALUES AND VOTE FOR ROCK RIBBED KENTUCKY CONSERVATIVE, MITCH MCCONNELL. WE WILL BE BACK HERE MANY TIMES. MITCH. [APPLAUSE] MITCH MCCONNELL: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] MATT BEVIN IS MAKING KENTUCKY GREAT AGAIN, THANKS TO YOUR HELP TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] WORKING TOGETHER, WE ARE CHANGING THE FEDERAL COURTS FOREVER. [APPLAUSE] NOBODY HAS DONE MORE TO CHANGE THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRYMEN DONALD TRUMP , IN OUR COUNTRY THAN DONALD TRUMP. MR. PRESIDENT, WE WILL KEEP DOING IT. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT MITCH AND ME AND ALL OF US, HE LEFT 100 42 OPENINGS FOR JUDGES. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO ALLOW ANY. THEY SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO IS FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT. I CAME IN AND I SAID, HOW MANY DO WE HAVE? AND THEY SAID HOW MANY WHAT? I SAID JUDGE OPENINGS. I THOUGHT THEY WOULD SAY NONE. THEY SAID 142. I SAID, TELL ME AGAIN THAT WE HAVE 142. SO MITCH AND I AND RAND WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PRESIDENT OBAMA, BECAUSE NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN SO GENEROUS. [APPLAUSE] ALSO WITH US TONIGHT IS A GREAT WARRIOR, SMART, STRONG, LOVES YOUR STATE, AND HAS REALLY BECOME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. HE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. THAT'S OK. WHATEVER I HAVE NEEDED, WHENEVER I HAVE NEEDED HIM, HE WAS ALWAYS THERE. IT'S TRUE. SOMETIMES I WOULD SAY, I DO NOT VOTE , I DO NOT NEED YOU TO VOTE RED AND HE WOULD VOTE HIS OWN WAY. A LITTLE LIBERTARIAN TOUCH, AND THAT IS OK. THAT'S OK. [APPLAUSE] BUT WHENEVER WE NEED, AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ME, I AM TALKING ABOUT WE. HE IS SO INCREDIBLE AND HAS BECOME A REALLY GOOD FRIEND AND I WANT HIM TO COME UP FOR A SECOND. RAND PAUL. A GREAT WARRIOR. [APPLAUSE] RAND PAUL: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A GREAT COURAGE. HE FIGHTS DOWN THE FAKE MEDIA EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] BUT CONGRESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND HAVE EQUAL COURAGE TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] HUNTER BIDEN MADE 100 $50,000 A MONTH, THE DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION. WE ALL KNOW THAT HE ONLY GOT IT BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY CONNECTIONS. AND WE KNOW THE NAME OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER. THE WHISTLEBLOWER NEEDS TO COME BEFORE CONGRESS AS A MATERIAL WITNESS BECAUSE HE WORKED WITH JOE BIDEN AT THE SAME TIME HUNTER BIDEN WAS GETTING MONEY FROM CORRUPT OLIGARCHS. I SAY TONIGHT TO THE MEDIA, DO YOUR JOB AND PRINT HIS NAME. [APPLAUSE] AND I SAY THIS TO MY COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS AND TO EVERY REPUBLICAN IN WASHINGTON. STEP UP AND SUBPOENA HUNTER BIDEN AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER. [APPLAUSE] AND I SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES, IF SHIFTY ADAM SCHIFF WILL NOT LET HUNTER BIDEN, AND WILL NOT BRING THE WHISTLEBLOWER FORWARD, EVERY REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE A WALK AND SAY THIS IS A FARCE. [APPLAUSE] WOW. THAT WAS EXCELLENT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB. HE IS A WARRIOR. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT. ALSO WITH US TONIGHT, REPRESENTATIVES FROM YOUR STATE THAT ARE FANTASTIC. A COUPLE FROM OUTSIDE YOUR STATE, ALSO. THESE ARE GREAT FIGHTERS, GREAT WARRIORS, ROGERS, BRETT GUTHRIE, THOMAS MASSIE. A MAN WE JUST SPOKE ABOUT, ANDY BARR. [APPLAUSE] JAMES COMER. GREAT. AND FROM AN INCREDIBLE STATE THAT CROOKED HILLARY SAID SHE WOULD WIN THE STATE AND DID NOT COME CLOSE TO WINNING, A GREAT STATE AND WE LOVE THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA, CONGRESSMAN MARK MEADOWS. [APPLAUSE] ALONG WITH SOME OF YOUR LOCAL GREAT POLITICIANS AND THE PERSON THAT HAS DONE A REALLY SPECTACULAR JOB, AND IN MICHIGAN, A WOMAN JUST KEPT GOING. SHE JUST KEPT GOING AND REMINDED ME OF YOUR GOVERNOR FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT SHE JUST DID NOT QUIT. SHE CALLED, COULD YOU DO IT AGAIN, MAKE A SPEECH. I SAID, IS THIS THE LAST ONE? NO, A COUPLE MORE. AND BILL CLINTON TOLD HILARY YOU BETTER GET GOING, SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN MICHIGAN AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE MICHIGAN AND NO, THE POLL SAY EVERYTHING IS GOOD, AND WE WON MICHIGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. [APPLAUSE] AND I SAID WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PICKING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIR HEAD OF THE RNC, I SAID, I GOTTA GET THE WOMAN FROM MICHIGAN, RHONDA MCDANIEL, TO HEAD IT OUT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN THEY WERE SAYING HOW SOPHISTICATED HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN WAS. THE FINEST THEATER TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD, SHE PAID FOR IT, BUT SHE DIDN'T GET IT. SHE HAS REALLY FANTASTIC AND USES, , GENIUSES, BUT I HAD SOMEONE WHO WAS A LOT BETTER. HIS NAME WAS , WAS THERE EVER A DAY LIKE THAT IN TELEVISION HISTORY? AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA, BECAUSE WHEN WE DO HANG IT UP, THEY WERE ALL OUT OF BUSINESS, THEY KNOW THAT. THAT IS WHY I THINK WE WILL GET , I EXPECT TO GET A FULL PARTY UNBELIEVABLE ENDORSEMENT VERY SOWN FROM THE , VERY SOON FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE ELECTION STARTED, ABOUT ONE MONTH BEFORE I ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS GOING TO DO THIS, I SAID I AM GOING TO BECOME A POLITICIAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I LOOKED AT THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE LEAFLET THAT YOU HAND OUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. THE WIND WOULD BLOW IT AWAY. IT WAS DEAD. I CALL IT THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES BECAUSE EVENTUALLY, THEY WILL FAIL. BUT WE BUILT IT UP. THEY DO STORIES , IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, I HAD A FEW STORIES IN THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND NOW I HAVE THREE OR FOUR A DAY. WHY ARE THEY NOT COVERING ME ANYMORE? THEY CAN TAKE WHAT WE DID TWO WEEKS AGO WITH THE WORST TERRORIST IN THE WORLD AND THEY CAN MAKE IT LOOK BAD. THAT'S OK. THE WILL , THE DOG WILL BECOMING VERY SHORTLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WILL BE ENDORSING US. AND YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE CRAZY, CNN WITH THE BAD WRITINGS, THE RED LIGHT JUST ENOUGH. , BAD RATINGS, THE RED LIKE JUST WENT OFF. , LIGHT JUST ONE OF. PUT YOURSELF , THE RED LIGHT JUST ONE , WENT OFF. BUT YOURSELF AND THEIR POSITION. , PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR POSITION. PUT YOURSELF IN CNN'S POSITION. IT'S NOT ME, IT'S WE, THEY CAME FROM THE VALLEYS, THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE, THEY CAME FROM PLACES , THERE STILL , THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, WHERE DID ALL THOSE PEOPLE COME FROM? A GREAT SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE, THEY HAVE EARLY VOTERS. I WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA MAKING A SPEECH. I HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMAN FRIENDS FROM PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IN TENNESSEE, WE HAVE VERY EARLY VOTING, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE VOTE.

A LOT OF BAD THINGS THEY THINK ARE GOING TO BE REVEALED, BECAUSE THERE IS A WAY WE CAN ALLOW THEM TO GET AWAY WITH WHAT THEY, WHAT A NORMAL PERSON WOULD'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH, LET'S FACE IT. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. THANKS TO MY TARIFFS, WE WILL SOON HAVE OVER $100 BILLION FROM A COUNTRY WHO DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH US. AND I WILL TELL YOU, THEY STARTED BUYING OUR FARM PRODUCTS. THEY STARTED BUYING A LOT OF OUR PRODUCTS EVEN BEFORE THE DEALS ARE DONE. LAST YEAR, I GOT OUR FARMERS $16 BILLION, BECAUSE THEY WERE TARGETED. THE YEAR BEFORE, I GOT THEM TOLD BILLION DOLLARS , I GOT THEM $12 BILLION. I SAID, CONGRATULATIONS, FARMERS, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE OUR FARMERS. AND THEY LOVE ME.

WE ARE REPLACING THE NAFTA DISASTER WITH THE U.S. -MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT. A HUGE WIN FOR KENTUCKY FARMERS, AUTOWORKERS, AND MANUFACTURERS. UNFORTUNATELY, NANCY PELOSI SO FAR, AND THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS, THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY A VICTORY. IT IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR THIS COUNTRY. NAFTA WAS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER MADE. DEMOCRATS NEED TO PASS THE USMCA. WHEN HE DEVOTES , WE NEED THEIR VOTES. AND IT IS UP TO PELOSI TO PUT IT FORWARD, BUT SHE IS TOO BUSY WASTING HER TIME. SO EITHER PASS IT OR GO BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO AND CLEAN UP YOUR MESS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE DEALT A DEATH BLOW TO THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY, ONE OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES. MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE, I CANCELED THAT JOB-KILLING TRAVESTY. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. JUST DAYS AGO, I FORWARDED THE UAW A $1 BILLION INVESTMENT IN LOUISVILLE. $1 BILLION. BEFORE MY ELECTION, OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AS A PIGGY BANK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PROJECTS. THEY WERE GLOBALISTS. I WAS ELECTED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,. PRESIDENT OF THE GLOBE , NOT PRESIDENT OF THE GLOBE. THEY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, TELL ME, HOW IS THAT GOOD? THEY TRY AND CONVINCE YOU IT'S GOOD. WHO SIT BACK, WE LISTEN, BUT I SAY, THESE PEOPLE ARE SOMETHING , SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM. ONLY IN KENTUCKY CAN SOMEBODY BE SO PRECISE. YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT IT. THEY DEPLOYED OUR MILITARY TO PROTECT IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS, SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY. THE MONEY WE SPEND ON OTHER COUNTRIES' MILITARIES. I'M TELLING OTHER COUNTRIES, SORRY, YOU HAVE TO PAY. THEY HAVE TO PAY, AND THEY POUR ED AMERICAN TREASURES INTO THE MIDDLE EAST. WE GO IN FOR INTERNET, WE WANT ROLE ROLE, WE ARE BRINGING 5G INTO PLACES LIKE KENTUCKY, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY SERVED. WE ARE BRINGING IT IN ALL OVER THE MIDDLE WEST, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE ARE REALLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, DOING VERY WELL. PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED WHEN SOME NUMBERS COME OUT. YOU WERE VERY MUCH UNDERSERVED FOR YEARS, AND YET, WE ARE INVESTING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF. DOLLARS IN PLACES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. . , BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PLACES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. YOU , WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, THE DEEP STATE AND THE FAILED RULING CLASS ARE TRYING TO RESIST ANY CHANGES TO THEIR FAILED POLICIES. THEY BELIEVE IT IS THEIR RIGHT TO RULE OVER YOU AND TO REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL AROUND THE WORLD, NO, THANK YOU. THAT IS WHY WE ENDED THE PARIS ACCORD. THAT IS WHY WE ENDED A LOT , I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TELL YOU. BUT THE SELLOUT OF THE AMERICAN NATION ENDED THE DAY THAT I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY DEMANDED THAT AMERICA EXCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION FROM TERROR-AFFLICTED REGIONS. TAKE THE PEOPLE! TAKE THE PEOPLE! WE DEFEATED ISIS. WE, WHEN I TOOK OVER THREE YEARS AGO, WHEN WE TOOK OVER, WHEN I TOOK OVER, ISIS WAS ALL OVER. I DEFEATED ISIS. YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT. I WAS WATCHING THE OTHER NIGHT, THE GREAT LOU DOBBS, AND HE SAID, ONE TRUMP TOOK OVER,, WHEN TRUMP TOOK OVER, PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE USED TO SAY TRUMP IS A GREAT PRESIDENT, THEN HE SAID THE BEST PRESIDENT SINCE RONALD REAGAN, THEN HE SAID NO, TRUMPISM IS AN EVEN BETTER PRESIDENT THAN RONALD REAGAN , TRUMP IS AN EVEN BETTER PRESIDENT THAN RONALD REAGAN. AND NOW HE HAS ME DOWN AS THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING GEORGE WASHINGTON AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. WE LOVE YOU, TOO. BUT WE INVITE THEM OVER THERE ONLY TO INVITE THEM OVER HERE, WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. YOU SEE WHERE WE ARE GOING, WHAT WE ARE DOING, IT'S NEVER EASY. I GET HIT BY THE SWAMP 15 DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES, MY ADMINISTRATION, IMPLEMENTED THE TRAVEL BAN ON SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRIES. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE AGAINST IT. THEY SAID, ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE? COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CRIME RATES THAT ARE SO HIGH YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE. WE HAVE A TRAVEL BAN NOW, WE DON'T TAKE PEOPLE FROM THOSE COUNTRIES, I'M SORRY. AND WE WON A HISTORIC VICTORY ON THE TRAVEL BAN IN THE SUPREME COURT, ROLLED IT TOTALLY CONSTITUTIONAL. , RULED IT TOTALLY INSTITUTIONAL. DEMOCRATS BETRAYED YOU ON IMMIGRATION, THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, THEY WANT TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION, MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN CITIZENS HAVE, AND MORE BENEFITS THAN OUR OWN MILITARY GETS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN CITIZENS FIRST IS PARAMOUNT. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE DROPPED 60% SINCE MAY, THE WALL IS BEING BUILT, IT IS GOING UP RAPIDLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MADE A BIG IMPACT. I WANT TO THANK MEXICO, WE HAVE MEXICAN BORDERS ON OUR BORDER POLICING OUR BORDER, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO END LOOPHOLES. THINK OF THE WORD LOOPHOLES, THEY DON'T WANT TO END LOOPHOLES. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES, YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE TOMORROW, TO VOTE FOR MATT DEVON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE BECOMING MORE EXTREME AND LIMITED BY THE DAY, THE DEMOCRATS' PLAN, TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE, WOULD OBLITERATE MEDICARE, WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR NATION'S SENIORS, IT'S GOING TO BE PROTECTED. WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS CRAZY. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND WE WILL ALSO PROTECT YOU WITH PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIANS. HOW ABOUT THAT? JUST THOUGHT OF THAT. FIRST TIME I SAID THAT. BECAUSE UNDER THEIR PLAN, YOU DON'T GET YOUR OWN DOCTOR, YOU GET WHAT YOU GET. FIX ME UP, DOC. YOU WANT TO WORK ON MY HEART? WHO ARE YOU, DOC? I DON'T THINK SO. THANKS TO THE COMBAT ON THE OPIOD EPIDEMIC WITH YOUR GOVERNORS HELP, WE HAVE SEEN A 17% DROP IN OVERDOSES IN KENTUCKY, WHICH IS A RECORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GREAT PEOPLE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THREATENS TO ENFORCE THE CARE AGENCIES PURELY FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEVES. MY ADMINISTRATION , RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. MY ADMINISTRATION TOOK CARE OF ENDING THAT OBAMA ERA OF SALT. GOVERNOR MATT BEVIN , OBAMA ERA ASSAULT. GOVERNOR MATT BEVIN IS A LEADER IN WHAT HE HAS DONE. TOGETHER, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR AMERICAN ORPHANS, FOSTER FAMILIES, AND THE SACRED RIGHTS OF RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. HE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO ANNOUNCED LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THEIR MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREMELY TERM ABORTIONS, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH-TECH, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND IT'S THE PARTY OF THE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WE FORGOT THAT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WITH DO OUR NATION FROM THE HORRIBLE , WITHDREW OUR NATION FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. NOT THE SAME COUNTRY WHEN I CAME IN. THEY WERE IN 18 DIFFERENT SIDES OF CONFLICTION, NOW THEY ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH IRAN. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. , RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS POLITICIANS APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE NEXT STEP TO VICTORY BEGINS TOMORROW, AND IT BEGINS WITH ALL OF YOU. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS, LOOK, MAYBE YOU'LL BE LATE FOR WORK, FOR WHATEVER, SOME THINGS, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO JUST PUT IT OFF, HAVE TO GO VOTE. , YOU HAVE TO GO VOTE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT. BEYOND EVEN THE GOVERNORSHIP. IT SO IMPORTANT, BECAUSE YOUR STATE IS SETTING RECORDS. YOU HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WELL ECONOMICALLY. JOBS WISE, UNEMPLOYMENT, FACTORIES MOVING IN, EXPANSION OF YOUR CAR PLANTS, YOU HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WELL. YOU ARE SENDING THAT BIG MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, YOU HAVE TO VOTE. IF YOU LOSE, IT SENDS A REALLY BAD MESSAGE. THEY WILL BUILD IT UP. THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT LIKE, HO HUM IF YOU WIN. IF YOU LOSE, THEY ARE GOING TO SAY TRUMP SUFFERED THE GREATEST DEFEAT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. YOU CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN TO ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU WOULD BE LOSING AN INCREDIBLE GOVERNOR, BUT YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT VICTORY TOMORROW. WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN AND WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO TOMORROW, WE NEED YOU TO GO OUT AND GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET OUT AND VOTE FOR GOVERNOR AND ALL THESE GREAT REPUBLICANS TONIGHT.

TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. 2020, WE ARE GOING TO REELECT BECAUSE OF THEIR STUPIDITY. I WILL CAMPAIGN IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE STATES THAT WERE SO CORRUPT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND DON'T FORGET. OUT OF 190 FOUR, WE HAVE 194, NOT ONE REPUBLIC , REPUBLICAN LEFT US LAST WEEK. TWO REPUBLICANS, THINK OF THAT. THE OTHER THREE COULD NOT GET THERE, BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE , YOU CAN'T DO THAT. AIRPORT PROBLEMS. THEN WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATS. WE PICKED UP TWO DEMOCRATS. WE HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THAT'S UNUSUAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY ARE LOUSY POLITICIANS, THEY HAVE LOUSY POLICY, BUT THEY STICK TOGETHER. THAT'S ABOUT IT. WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IN 2020. WE WILL HAVE A GREAT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WE WILL CREATE A SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. WE WILL HAVE TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING, LISTEN TO THIS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES WITHIN LESS THAN 10 YEARS. WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT? THE PAST ADMINISTRATION, TOWARD THE END, WE HAD CERTAIN THINGS WE COULD HAVE DONE, THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING, BUT WE DID. WE HAVE IT ALL FUNDED. THINK OF THAT. AIDS, WITHIN 10 YEARS, WILL BE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. WE WILL END IT. GREAT. THEY WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE BREAKTHROUGHS THEY HAVE MADE, IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY ARE DOING. RIGHT TO TRY, BY THE WAY. SOMEBODY WHO IS TERMINALLY ILL CAN USE MEDICINES THEY WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO IN THE PAST. INSTEAD OF TRAVELING TO ASIA AND EUROPE AND ALL OVER THE WORLD, GOING HOME HOPELESS AND DYING, THEY CAN NOW USE WHAT WE CALL RIGHT TO TRY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST DOCTORS, DRUGS, THE GREATEST LABS IN THE WORLD. THEY CAN GO AND TRY. WE ARE HAVING UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS. RIGHT TO TRY. WE WILL CHART A NEW ERA OF DISCOVERY IN SPACE AND SOMEDAY SOON WE WILL LAND ON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, ONLY TO GO TO MARS. I SAY, WE HAVE DONE THE MOON. THEY SAY, SIR, WE GO TO THE MOON TO GO TO MARS. WE ARE REALLY, REALLY ADVANCED. IT IS MOVING ALONG RAPIDLY. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE CHERISHED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES AND WARRIORS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, OUR OUR HISTORY, , HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR CONSTITUTION , TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE GREAT STATE OF KENTUCKY, SETTLED BY SOME OF THE MOST DEVOTED AND COURAGEOUS PEOPLE EVER TO WALK ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THESE TOUGH PIONEER MEN AND STRONG PIONEER WOMEN BRAVED THE WILDERNESS AND DEFIED THE DANGER TO BUILD A LIFE AND A HOME. THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF LUXURY. THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES, THEY LEFT THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THESE PROUD KENTUCKY PATRIOTS DID NOT SHRED THEIR , SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS SO WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE OTHERS TRY TO ERASE THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY THEIR MAGNIFICENT , OUR LOYALTY IS TO OUR CITIZENS AND OUR DEVOTION IS TO OUR CREATOR.

THEN HE GOES AS ONE FALLS, TWO MORE WILL TAKE THEIR PLACE, REFERRING TO OUTGOING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYERS WHO BY THE WAY HAVE BEEN PUT THROUGH HELL BY THE SLEAZE BACK THERE AND BUY PROGRAM ALL EDITIONS. , POLITICIANS. , BACK THERE AND BY CROOKED POLITICIANS. AND THEN WHEN THEY HEARD MY REAL PHONE CALL, THE WHISTLEBLOWER DISAPPEARED. SHIFTY SHIFT, HE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN, SHIFT , ADAM SCHIFF DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE WHISTLEBLOWER ANYMORE. AS SOON AS I RELEASED THE PHONE CALLS, AND YOU DON'T LIKE DOING THAT WITH A FOREIGN LEADER BECAUSE YOU GOT TO DO WITH FOREIGN LEADERS, YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK , TODAY I SPOKE TO , IS HE WORRIED WE WILL RELEASE THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT WRONG? YOU CAN'T DO THAT. IN THIS CASE I HAD A PERFECT PHONE CALL. TOTALLY PERFECT PHONE CALL. ANYBODY THAT CAN READ, YOU SHOW THAT ON FOX , LOOK AT THIS. BUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER BEFORE THEY KNEW I WAS GOING TO RELEASE , HE CAME OUT WITH A WHISTLEBLOWER LIKE HE IS SOME WONDERFUL PERSON. LOOK AT THE WHISTLEBLOWER. THE WHISTLEBLOWER CAME OUT WITH THIS HORRIBLE STATEMENT ABOUT THIS CALL. I HAD NO CHOICE. TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. I SAID RELEASE IT. RELEASE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE WHISTLEBLOWER SAW IT. ADAM SCHIFF SAW IT, PELOSI, AND THEY SAID WE GOT TO , WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND THEY DISAPPEARED. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE? THE SECOND WHISTLEBLOWER. AND THE INFORMER TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER IF THERE WAS SUCH A PERSON WHICH I DOUBT, WHICH I DOUBT. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] JUST CAME OUT. JUST CAME OUT. IT IS SO BAD THESE PEOPLE ARE BAD PEOPLE, AND IT IS SO BAD WHAT THEY DO TO OUR COUNTRY, THEY RIPPED THE GUTS OUT AND IT IS A SHAME. PEOPLE SHOULD STOP. MAYBE GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. THEY GOT TO STOP IT. WE GOT A COUNTRY TO RUN AND THESE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO DO THINGS DO ILLEGAL ACTS, ILLEGAL ACT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. LAST WEEK THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO NULLIFY THE BALANCE OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, DISGRACING THEMSELVES AND DISHONORING THEIR OATS. , OATHS. REPUBLICANS WERE UNANIMOUS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE LOUSY POLITICIANS. THEY HAVE OPEN BORDERS. HOW DO YOU LIKE HAVING "AS WITH MEXICO? THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN BORDERS AND SANCTUARY CITIES. WITH THE JOHN BEL EDWARDS, YOU WILL SOON HAVE A SANCTUARY CITY. BUT THE DEMOCRATS, THINK OF IT, THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS WHICH MEANS CRIME. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN MEXICO AND I HAVE TO THANK THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. THE CARTELS ARE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM. WE ARE BUILDING A WALL AND IT IS GOING UP FAST. OUR MILITARY IS NOW BUILDING THE WALL AND IT IS GOING UP FAST. IT IS DOING GREAT. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT YEARS AGO. THEY NEVER COULD FIGURE IT OUT. I HAD 100% OF THE AUTHORITY FIGHTING ME. WE HAD A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, VERY LITTLE. WE NEEDED THEM ACROSS MOST. I SHOULD HAVE SAID I DON'T WANT THE WALL AND THE DEMOCRATS WOULD INSIST THAT I BUILD IT. FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, THEY WANTED THE WALL. IT WAS ONLY WHEN I CAME ALONG THAT THEY DID NOT WANT IT. WE HAVE GOT TO BUILD IT. THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT THE WALL ANYMORE. THEY SAID WE CAN HAVE THE DRONE TECHNOLOGY. THAT IS GREAT. WE SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO BUILD A WALL IN THEY WOULD INSIST THEY WOULD INSIST IT WOULD GET BUILT IMMEDIATELY. I CALL THEM THE DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE HAVE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY COULD SOLVE IN MINUTES. THAT IS WHEN EVERYONE YOU EVER MET COMES IN. YOUR MOTHER, GRANDFATHER, YOU'RE ON , AND , AUNT. ANY PERSON THAT EVER MET YOU. WE HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL PARK IN NEW YORK CITY AND HE KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE. THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR LEGS, THAT ARE PERMANENTLY THIS FIGURE. THEY SAID EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN SHAPE AND THEIR RUNNING ALL OVER AND THEN THIS MANIAC GOES AT AN UNBELIEVABLE SPEED AND KILLS PEOPLE AND WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. THESE ONS HINGED , THESE UNHINGED EXTREMISTS HAVE BEEN PLOTTING TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER. WE ARE SO FAR UP, YOU COULD STAY FOCUS ON THE CLOSER ONES, BUT WE ARE GOING TO COME HERE ANYWAY. THINK OF IT AS 19 MINUTES AFTER I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THE HORRIBLE AND DISCUSSING WASHINGTON POST, IT DECLARED THE CAMPAIGN. THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEGUN. THAT IS NICE. AND THEN DURING THE TERM, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN SAID YOU FIRED THE GUY YOU GET $1 MILLION, YOU DON'T FIRE THE GUY, YOU GET NOTHING. YOU TALK QUID PRO QUO. YOU DON'T FIRE, YOU GET NOTHING. THINK OF IT THAT WAY, THAT IS CALLED QUID PRO QUO. THAT WAS BY JOE BIDEN TO GET RID OF THE PROSECUTOR OF UKRAINE WHO WAS LOOKING AT HIS SON WHO JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY WHO WAS PAID MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO ENERGY EXPERIENCE. IN LOUISIANA, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HIRED HIM AND YOUR ENERGY COMPANIES WOULD HAVE PAID TO KEEP HIM OUT. HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE. HOW OLD IS YOUR SON? HOW OLD IS THAT YOUNG MAN? 8. HE KNOWS ENERGY BETTER THAN JOE BIDEN SON. THEN BIDEN FLIES TO CHINA. HE OBVIOUSLY MET WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I DID BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WELL WITH CHINA. HE FLIES WITH HIS FATHER AND IN 10 MINUTES, HE PICKS UP $1.5 BILLION. THESE ARE DIFFERENT CHINESE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH. I CALLED UP ONE OF THE TOP GUYS ON WALL STREET AND SAID CAN YOU DO THAT? HE SAID NO. HE IS LIKE ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS ON WALL STREET. NOW, THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL YOUR VOTE AND SILENCER VOICE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW BECAUSE I AM LOOKING AT POCAHONTAS. POCAHONTAS IS STARTING TO EMERGE FROM THE ASHES. I GIVE HER CREDIT, SHE IS EMERGING FROM THE ASHES, NOT A NICE PERSON. I HAVE MORE THAN SHE DOES AND I HAVE NONE. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME, I JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE NONE. , HAPPENED TO HAVE NONE , HAPPEN TO HAVE NONE. [NO AUDIO] WE WILL NOT LET THE DEMOCRATS TAKE THAT INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE AWAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH DEMOCRAT LIES, SLANDERS AND SCAMS. THE DEMOCRATS SHAMEFUL CONDUCT HAS CREATED AN ANGRY MAJORITY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE, WE ARE MAJORITY AND WE ARE ANGRY. WE MUST VOTE DEMOCRATS OUT OF OFFICE IN 2020. WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE 36 DEMOCRATS IN AREAS THAT I WON BY A LOT. PEOPLE FORGET, WE PICKED UP TWO SEATS IN THE SENATE. THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. I TRIED TO GET THEM TO TALK ABOUT IT AND BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH JUDGES AND OTHERS, BUT WITH YOUR HELP WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. RIGHT NOW, LOUISIANA HAS SENT THE RADICAL LEFT A MESSAGE THAT THEY CAN NEVER IGNORE AND DON'T FORGET IN 2016, PEOPLE CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VALLEYS IN THE RIVERS IN THE OCEANS. THE DEMOCRATS SAID WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING FROM? THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT WORK HARD, MADE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY CALL THEM THE ELITE. WE ARE THE ELITE. I KNOW THIS, SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. I WENT TO BETTER SCHOOLS MANDATED, I HAVE NICER HOUSES AND NICER APARTMENTS. I HAVE NICER EVERYTHING. YOU PEOPLE WORK YOUR ASSES OFF. YOU ARE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE. ANTIFA, THEY START HITTING A SINGLE CONSERVATIVE REPORTER, START BATTERING THEM, BUT WHEN THE TOUGH GUYS SHOW UP, ANTIFA SAYS I THINK WE WILL TAKE A PASS, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. YOU ARE SMARTER, TOUGHER, RICHER , BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME OUT DID NOT LIKE WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. THEY DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR OBAMA, BUT WHEN I RAN, SOMETHING HAPPENED. THE LINES WERE IN SOME CASES MILES LONG AND THEY SAW SOMETHING, WHAT IS GOING ON? PROBABLY THE GREATEST SELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY , GREATEST SELECTION , GREATEST SELECTION , GREATEST ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. NOW, THESE PEOPLE THROUGH CORRUPT PEOPLE LIKE ADAM SCHIFF THAT MAKES UP WHAT I SAID. HE GETS UP IN FRONT OF CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE READS MY STATEMENT, BUT I DID NOT SAY IT. HE MADE IT UP AND THEN I CALLED HIM ON IT BECAUSE HE NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RELEASE THE CONVERSATION. UKRAINE WAS CALLING UP, DO YOU MIND IF WE RELEASE THE CONVERSATION AND WE RELEASED IT. WE CAUGHT THEM IN A MIDDLE OF A LIE. IT WAS A SCAM, THEY ARE SCAMMERS. SO YOU WILL [INDISCERNIBLE] THIS IS LOUISIANA? HOW DID YOU GET A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT TO BE HER GOVERNOR? ACTUALLY, IT WAS A CONVERGENCE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR CAR INSURANCE IS THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. YOU ARE RATED NUMBER 15 IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE RATED 50 OUT OF 50? WE WANT TO , I HAVE KNOWN THIS MAN A LONG TIME. HE DOES NOT NEED THE MONEY. HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON. HE HAS THE BACKING OF RALPH AND RALPH IS A WINNER. HE HAS THE BACKING OF RALPH. I JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH RALPH ABRAHAM. HE IS AN INCREDIBLE MAN. HE RESPECTS EDDIE AND EDDIE RESPECTS HIM A LOT. THEY HAD A HEART. DEAL. THAT IS RATHER BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. IF I'M GOING AGAINST SOMEONE , I DON'T KNOW. RALPH IS A BETTER MAN THANRALPH IS A BETTER MAN THAN ME, A BETTER MAN. AND THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ALL OF HER TELEVISION TONIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO SAY RALPH SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE IS A GREAT MAN, SO HE IS NOT A CAREER POLITICIAN, HE IS A BUSINESS LEADER, HIGHLY RESPECTED, A MAN OF FAITH AND A LIFELONG LOUISIANA PATRIOT. HE WILL CUT YOUR TAXES AND YOUR CAR INSURANCE IN HALF AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CAR INSURANCE IN THE ENTIRE NATION BY FAR. YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY, HE IS GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF OR MORE IN TURN THIS STATE INTO A GIANT MAGNET FOR GREAT PAYING JOBS. THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WILL STOP AT A USED TOUGH ON CRIME, STRONG ON BORDERS AND HE WILL WORK WITH ICE AND BORDER PATROL TO GET VIOLENT CRIMINALS OFF THE STREETS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK OR PUTTING THEM IN JAIL WHERE THEY BELONG. HE IS PRO-ENERGY, PROFAMILY AND PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT. HE WILL DEFEND YOUR VALUES FROM ASSAULT BY THE EXTREME LEFT. I CALLED THEM AOC PLUS THREE. YOU ONLY HAVE 11 YEARS TO LIVE BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING SO FAST. TODAY I HEARD ONE OF THESE CRAZIES SAY , THEY ARRESTED JANE FONDA. SHE ALWAYS HAS THE HANDCUFFS ON AND IS WAITING EVERYBODY. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. REMEMBER THAT? SHE WENT TO VIETNAM TO FIND OUT HOW NICE THEY WERE. JANE FONDA, NOTHING CHANGES. EVERY 25 YEARS THEY ARREST HER. THE OPPONENT IS A RADICAL LIBERAL AND YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW WHY HE SAYS THE THINGS ABOUT ME? I SAID HE MUST BE REPUBLICAN. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. HE WILL NEVER VOTE FOR US. HE WILL NEVER SUPPORT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT TO WHERE WE NEED THE SUPPORT. HE WILL NEVER REDUCE YOUR CAR INSURANCE, NEVER GOING TO CUT YOUR TAXES. I GOT YOU A BIGGS TAX CUT , A BIG TAX CUT, THE BIGGEST EVER. DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE THIS CRAZY THEORY, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. HOW DOES THAT WORK? THEY ARE SAYING I HAVE ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR THREE YEARS. THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES AND I SAY, IT , DOES THAT WORK? NO, I WILL CUT YOUR TAXES EVEN FURTHER. YOU HAVE A RADICAL LIBERAL NAME JOHN BEL EDWARDS. HE WAS A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY CLINTON. HE BROKE HIS PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WHEN HE RAMMED THROUGH THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN LOUISIANA HISTORY. DOES EVERYONE REMEMBER THAT? HE GAVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX HIKE AND THEN SAYS I RAISED YOUR TAXES, VOTE FOR ME. I'M SAYING THIS, I GIVE YOU THE GREATEST TAX REDUCTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, GREATER THAN RONALD REAGAN MANY YEARS AGO. MAYBE THAT DOES NOT WORK IN MODERN-DAY POLITICS, BUT I'M GOING TO STICK WITH IT. YOU SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND TRAINS OF DOLLARS COMING BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. JIHADIST ECONOMIC FORCE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND TAKING IN MORE WITH A LOWER RATE, MUCH MORE MONEY THAN WE DID IT WITH A HIGHER RATE. HE VIOLATED THEIR SACRED TRUST AND CAN NEVER BE TRUSTED AGAIN. ONE OF THE BIG THINGS HERE IS CAR INSURANCE. I KEPT SEEING CAR INSURANCE, BUT HERE YOUR CAR INSURANCE IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION AND IT IS OUT OF CONTROL. NOW EDWARDS IS TRYING TO DEMOLISH YOUR STATE'S ECONOMY BY SHUTTING DOWN LOUISIANA ENERGY ON BEHALF OF THE CRAZY, RADICAL FAR-LEFT. EDWARDS IS TOTALLY OWNED BY THE TRIAL LAWYERS WERE CAUSING CAR RATES AND INSURANCE RATE TO SKYROCKET. EDWARDS HAS ALLOWED ILLEGAL ALIENS TO STEAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE FROM HARD-WORKING CITIZENS AND CARES MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THEN HE CARES ABOUT LOUISIANA CITIZENS. I LOVE OUR MILITARY, EDDIE LOVES OUR MILITARY. THEY CARE MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN TAKING CARE OF VETS AND TAKING CARE OF [INDISCERNIBLE] LOUISIANA HAS THE HIGHEST MURDER RATE. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT, BUT YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST MURDER RATE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. I DID NOT KNOW IT. EDWARDS IS BACKED BY HIS PRO-ABORTION LOBBY AND IS A COMPLETE DISASTER FOR THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND YOU CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS FAR-LEFT TRAVESTY. IT IS TIME TO REPLACE YOUR FAILED GOVERNOR WITH EDDIE RESPONDING WHO IS GOING TO DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. SO EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GET OUT AND VOTE EARLY. 40%. USUALLY, IT IS LIKE 2%. EARLY VOTING HAS STARTED, SO GET OUT AND VOTE AND DO IT RIGHT AWAY AND LET'S GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME AND DO LOTS OF THINGS. DO IT BEFORE THE GAME OR JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET IT OUT THERE AND THE ELECTION ITSELF IS GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE SATURDAY, SO GET OUT EARLY. I WANT TO BRING UP A MAN THAT I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW WELL BECAUSE HE IS A BUSINESS LEGEND IN MANY WAYS. PLEASE COME UP. EDDIE, PLEASE COME UP. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEFORE I GET STARTED, I WANT TO SAY THIS. CONGRESSMAN ABRAHAM, I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR WORKING VERY HARD, TRAVELING THE STATE TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO BETTER. LET'S GIVE HIM ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME DOWN HERE MORE THAN ONCE TO GET OUT THE VOTE, TO MOBILIZE, MAKE LOUISIANA GREAT LIKE IT DESERVES TO BE. WE NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF WE WANT TO BE DIFFERENT. WE DON'T DESERVE TO BE LAST. WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE NEED A PRO TRUMP CONSERVATIVE, AN OUTSIDER, SOMEONE WITH SERIOUS BUSINESS SKILLS, SOMETHING THAT HAS BACKBONE TO GO AGAINST THE STATUS QUO, SOMEONE LIKE TRUMP. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED AND WE WANT TO DEBATE THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING HERE AND EXPOSING JOHN BEL EDWARDS AS THE LIBERAL HE IS. THANK YOU. JOHN BEL EDWARDS WOULD WANT YOU TO BELIEVE HE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE LIBERAL LUNATICS. WE CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO HIM BY VOTING ME IN AND SUPPORTING OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP. I DID NOT THINK THEY COULD GO ANY LOWER, BUT JUST THIS SATURDAY, THEY ARE RUNNING ADS NOW ALL OVER THE STATE ACCUSING OUR PRESIDENT OF BEING A RACIST AND ME BEING A RACIST AND YOU BEING A RACIST. IT IS DISCUSSING HOW LOW THEY WILL GO. WHEN THEY START PANICKING AND WORRYING, THEY PLAY THE RACE CARD. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS HAD THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT FOR MINORITIES IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO SEND THEM A MESSAGE. LOUISIANA IS CONSERVATIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUSINESSMAN, SOMEONE WHO WOULD MAKE A NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION. WE CAN DO THAT WITH YOUR VOTE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS AMAZING. THIS MAN CAN GET THE CROWD FIRED UP AND HE CAN GET LOUISIANA FIRED UP IN WE CAN GO AND TURN THIS STATE AROUND STOP TAKING. , STATE AROUND. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT, AND NEEDS YOUR VOTE AND MY WIFE AND MY FAMILY COULD USE YOUR PRAYERS. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE LIBERTY. GO TIGERS! [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, EDDIE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[APPLAUSE] LET ME JUST? WHAT EDDIE SAID. THIS IS TRUMP COUNTRY. LET ME ADD TO WHAT HE SAID. WITH YOUR HELP, BUT ONLY WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN MAKE IT RESPONDING , RISPONE HELLO, LOUISIANA. THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT FOR VISITING OUR STATE. IN THREE SHORT YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DOUBLED THE GROWTH IN THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. IN YOU KNOW WHAT OUR DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS HAVE DONE FOR IT? SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI IS TRYING TO IMPEACH HIM. I DON'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT, BUT IT MUST SUCK TO BE THAT DUMB. LET ME TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING , THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE BACKING SPEAKER PELOSI ARE SENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SUPPORT GOVERNOR EDWARDS. [CROWD BOOING] AND ALL HE HAS GIVEN US IS DECLINE AND UNCERTAINTY. [CROWD BOOING] NOW, UNLESS , UNLESS YOU ARE HAPPY WITH CRAPPY, I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR EDDIE RISPOLI FOR GOVERNOR, AND I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR HAL ARDOIN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT WE ARE DEAD LAST AND WE MUST DO BETTER TO OUR VETERANS HERE WHOSE SHADOW WE STAND IN EVERY DAY. TO OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS THAT TILL THE LAND AND HEARD THE CATTLE FROM DAWN TO DUSK. FROM OUR INDUSTRY THAT HAS MADE US ENERGY DOMINANT TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT RUNS TOWARD THE BULLET WHEN WE RUN AWAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO ALL OF US THAT FILL UP THEIR CHURCH PEWS EVERY SUNDAY MORNING AND PRAY TO A LOVING AND CARING GOD, WE WILL WIN THIS RACE. SO, MR. PRESIDENT , MR.

SHOULD NOT BE TOUGH AT ALL, BUT THEY MADE IT TOUGH. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT TOUGHER THAN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. CLAY HIGGINS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, CLAY. AND MIKE JOHNSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS, MIKE. GREAT JOB TO ALL OF YOU. AND YOUR STATE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, SOMEONE I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME , HE'S TERRIFIC , JEFF LANDRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TWO TERRIFIC MEN ON THE BALLOT WITH EDDIE, JOHN MENTIONED THAT. KYLE ARDOIN AND YOUR NEXT STATE SENATOR, ROBERT MILLS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY LOUISIANA'S OWN BILL AND WILLIE ROBERTSON , I LOVE THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I CAN LEARN PLENTY FROM THESE TWO. COME ON UP HERE. COME ON. COME UP HERE. COME UP HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] COME UP. GREAT PEOPLE. THEY'VE BEEN WITH US FROM THE BEGINNING. RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. SMART AS CAN BE AND WONDERFUL PEOPLE. THEY HIT BIG. THEY HIT BIG. AND YOU DON'T HIT BIG UNLESS YOU HAVE IT. COME ON UP, FELLAS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GOT IT DOWN TO THIS , IF YOU ARE PRO-GOD AND PRO-AMERICA AND PRO-GUN AND PRO-DUCK HUNTING , THAT'S ALL I WANT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY AFTER FOLLOWING PHIL AND THE PRESIDENT AND EDDIE, BUT THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. YOU HAVE BEEN SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY TO SHARE LIFE WITH, TO WORSHIP WITH, AND I'M SO TICKLED TO BE HERE WITH THE PRESIDENT, THAT HE ACTUALLY CAME DOWN TO OUR COMMUNITY. LET'S GO, EDDIE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FELLAS. TWO GREAT GUYS. THEY WERE WITH ME RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. I SAID WHO ARE THEY, THEY SAID THEY ARE TWO BIG TELEVISION STARS. I SAID WOW, AND I STARTED WATCHING A LITTLE BIT. A LOT OF WISDOM THERE. REPUBLICAN POLICIES ARE LIFTING UP AMERICANS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. AMERICA IS AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE AGAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE, ACTUALLY. LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE ELIMINATED A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS, SAVING AN ESTIMATED $3000 PER HOUSEHOLD. WE ALSO PASSED THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, SAVING A TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR ANOTHER $2000, AND WE ARE BOLDLY ADOPTING A POLICY OF AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THESE FARAWAY PLACES ANYMORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WAS AT THE OPENING OF THE $10 BILLION CAMERA LNG EXPORT FACILITY IN LOUISIANA EMPLOYING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LOUISIANA WORKERS. THEY COULD NOT GET THEIR PERMITS FOR YEARS. I GOT IT REAL FAST. I SAID LET'S GO GET THEM THAT PERMIT. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, THEY TRIED TO GET THOSE PERMITS. THEY COULD NOT GET THEM. I GOT THEM VERY FAST. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BUILDING LIKE THAT ONE. THERE ARE MORE PIPES IN THAT BUILDING THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. MEANWHILE, EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS PLEDGED TO ABOLISH ALL AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, SHIPPING THOUSANDS OF YOUR STATE'S ENERGY JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S ALL THEY ARE DOING. [CROWD BOOING] BUT LOUISIANA WILL NOT GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF DISASTROUS TRADE POLICIES. LOUISIANA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. PAST LEADERS DID NOT CARE ONE BIT WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE LOUISIANA COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY WERE GETTING RICH BY SACRIFICING YOUR WEALTH TO OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU REMEMBER , WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. BUT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE GREAT BETRAYAL IS OVER. AMERICA IS NO LONGER FOR SALE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS TO MY TARIFFS, WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM A COUNTRY THAT NEVER GAVE US 10 CENTS, CHINA. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE EVER LET THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA? WOULDN'T BE TOO GOOD. LET'S GET HUNTER TO DO IT, RIGHT? COME ON, HUNTER. COME ON, HUNTER. LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO, HUNTER. CHINA WOULD LOVE IT. MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, THEY WOULD LOVE TO BE DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT. THEY ACTUALLY DO LIKE ME, BUT THEY DO NOT LIKE ME WHEN I'M DOING TO THEM , THEY ARE HAVING THE WORST YEAR THEY HAVE HAD AND 57 YEARS, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT LET OUR COUNTRY GO BACK TO THE DAYS OF BEGINNING RANSACKED AND PLUNDERED BY OTHER NATIONS. WE WILL NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ANY LONGER. BEFORE MY ELECTION, OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AS A PIGGY BANK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PROJECTS. THEY DECIMATED AMERICAN FACTORIES , YOU KNOW THIS. AMERICAN MANUFACTURING WAS BROKEN AND DECIMATED TO PROMOTE , THEY PROMOTED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY DID NOT PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY USED OUR MILITARY TO DEFEND IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS, SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATE WITH YOUR MONEY. AND THEY POURED PRECIOUS AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WHILE OUR GREAT CITIES FELL INTO DISREPAIR. $8 TRILLION WAS SPENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND YOU WANT TO FIX A HIGHWAY, THEY SAY WELL, THAT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE, RIGHT? NOT ANYMORE. BUT I WAS ELECTED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT FOR A LONG TIME. PAST LEADERS TRANSFORM FARAWAY NATIONS INTO CHAOTIC WAR ZONES. THEN THEY DEMANDED THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS ACCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION FROM THOSE TERROR-AFFLICTED REGIONS, STAMPING THEIR VISAS FOR TRAVEL STRAIGHT INTO YOUR COMMUNITIES. NOT ANYMORE. MY ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTED THE TRAVEL BAN TO BLOCK MIGRATION FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS AND DEADLY PLACES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE KEEPING TERRORISTS, CRIMINALS, AND VIRAL , VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. ON NO ISSUE HAVE DEMOCRATS MORE TOTALLY BETRAYED YOU THAN IMMIGRATION. ALL THROUGH THE YEARS, THEY THREW UP IN YOUR BORDERS TO DRUG DEALERS, AND TO VICIOUS MS 13 GANG MEMBERS, AND NOW, WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDERS, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE NOW DROPPED 70% SINCE MAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE, THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE ARE BUILDING THAT WALL FASTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BUILD, THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. WE ARE ALSO CONFRONTING THE DEADLY MENACE OF SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH RELEASE D'ANGELO CROOK , A DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS INTO YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS, SCHOOL ZONES, AND CITY STREETS. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF ICE, BORDER PATROL, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, VILE SLANDERS OF OUR POLICE WENT UNANSWERED AND UNCHALLENGED. NOW WE ARE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMNING ANTI-POLICE VIOLENCE , CONDEMNING ANTI-POLICE BIAS AND GIVING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THE RESPECT THAT THEY SO RIGHTLY DESERVE. IF YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUST PLAIN SUCCESS OF YOUR STATE IN YOUR COUNTRY, THEN VOTE EARLY FOR EDDIE REESE PONY , EDDIE RI SPONE. DEMOCRATS ARE BECOMING MORE EXTREME OTHER DAY. THE DEMOCRATS' PLANNED GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE WOULD DEMOLISH YOUR MEDICARE. I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR NATION'S SENIORS. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE WILL ALSO PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR DOCTORS. REPUBLICANS WILL STRONGLY DEFEND YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. YOU REMEMBER THAT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA , YOU KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, YOU KEEP YOUR PLAN. 28 TIMES. TIMES. IT WAS A LIE. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES IN OVER 50 YEARS. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MONTH , [CROWD BOOING] RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERS ON APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT IS ALSO THE PARTY OF THE LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. PEOPLE FORGET. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE CONFIRMED ALREADY 158 INCREDIBLE JUDGES TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN, INCLUDING TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, NEIL GORSUCH AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN REBUILDING THE MILITARY HAS INCLUDED MORE THAN READY MILLION DOLLARS TO PARK SCALE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS? BARKSDALE. WHERE'S BARKSDALE? NICE? GOOD? BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA AND $20 MILLION TO NAVAL AIR STATION JOINT RESERVE BASE IN NEW ORLEANS. I WITHDREW FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS AFTER 52 YEARS , ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS , OVERLY THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP WITH THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE NEXT STEP TO VICTORY BEGINS IN THIS STATE AND IT BEGINS WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS , AND THEY ARE CORRUPT, DO-NOTHING NOTHING DEMOCRATS , THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN. WE NEED YOU TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS, AND GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY FOR EDDIE. IF YOU DON'T VOTE EARLY, I WILL BE BACK ON THURSDAY TO GET YOU TO VOTE ON SATURDAY, OK? CHEERS IT , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS OF MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE AND INDEPENDENCE TO WORK AND PROSPERITY. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL ELECT A CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE STATE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION AND MANY OTHER THINGS. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROBABLY STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE , MADE IN THE USA.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE FIRST THREE AFRICAN-AMERICANS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE WERE REPUBLICANS. THE FIRST 21 AFRICAN-AMERICANS ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE REPUBLICANS. IT WAS A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, TEDDY ROOSEVELT, WHO INVITED BOOKER T.

I HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF , WITH THEIR GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS. WE WENT THERE TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY AND REENACTED THAT MARCH ACROSS THE BRIDGE. I HAD MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WITH ME. THOSE A DAY I'LL NEVER FORGET. WE GATHERED AND HAD A WORSHIP SERVICE IN LIKE THEY HAVE DONE 35 YEARS EARLIER, WE WALKED TO THE BRIDGE AND AS WE WERE WALKING UP, THERE WAS AN OLD PASTOR NAMED DR. F D REIS AND I WAS WALKING WITH HIM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THERE, THE BRIDGE IS ACTUALLY STEEP AND YOU HAVE TO WALK UP TO THE MIDDLE BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER SIDE AND THE PASTOR TOLD ME THEY HAD WALKED TO THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A SEA OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND POLICE AND MOUNTED OFFICERS AND I LOOKED AT HIM AS WE LOOKS DOWN ON THE SCENE 45 YEARS LATER , I SAID TO HIM DID YOU THINK ABOUT TURNING BACK? HE SMILED THE WAY WALDMAN SOMETIMES SMILE AND HE SAID WE HAD ALL PRAYED AND DECIDED TO GO ON REGARDLESS AND SO THEY DID. WHEN THAT MARCH WAS OVER, THE BRUTALITY OF THAT MOMENT WOULD INSPIRE THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND HELP TRANSFORM THIS NATION INTO A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE OF THEIR COURAGE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH. WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER OUR LOOKED AT DR. REESE AND STUCK MY HAND OUT FOR WHAT THEY DONE FOR THE COUNTRY AND HE LOOKED AT ME ONE MORE TIME AND SMILED. HE SAID DON'T THINK ME OR WHAT WE DID HERE, GOD DID SOMETHING HERE. THAT IS PAID , FAITH. THAT IS THE FAITH OF THIS COMMUNITY. FAITH THAT GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE GONE THROUGH FOR CENTURIES. IT IS STILL DRIVING US TODAY TO A MORE PERFECT UNION. FAITH THAT WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS LIBERTY. THAT MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINDS , WINS AND IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND REACH MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE WILL RENEW AND STRENGTHEN AS NEVER BEFORE THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. MEN AND WOMEN, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET YOU HEAR FROM THE ONE YOU CAME TO HEAR. HAVE CONFIDENCE, HAVE FAITH. WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR TO DO IT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF WE DO WHAT WE CAN BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY 2020, WE WILL DELIVER ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY FOR EVERY AMERICAN COME NOVEMBER 2020. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE, MAKE AMERICA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WITH YOUR HARD WORK AND TELLING OUR STORY TO EVERY COMMUNITY, WE WILL PUT PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. (music) (music) (music) THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE TO BE HERE BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WE LIVE HERE TODAY, IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO SAY YOU ARE SUPPORTING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT IS QUITE INTERESTING HOW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE AND HOW TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE AND CHANGE THEIR MINDS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. YOU GO BACK SINCE THE DAVE'S , THE DAYS OF SLAVERY. THEY TOLD THE ONES IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE YARD AND THE ONES IN THE YARD BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE FIELD AND ON AND ON IT WENT TRYING TO DIVIDE PEOPLE TODAY, THEY SAY IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE, THEN YOU ARE SOMEHOW AN UNCLE TOM, A HORRIBLE PERSON, A DEMON, WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAFT , CRAP. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME OUT. IT DOES NOT BOTHER ME ANYMORE BECAUSE I ONLY WORRY WHAT GOD THINKS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ASK ME COME UP , ASK ME, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU , WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? YOU'VE CHANGED. [NO AUDIO] AND THEN TO NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT AND THEN TO BALTIMORE, A BASTION OF LIBERALISM. THEN I DID SOMETHING THAT LIBERALS ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO. I LISTENED TO A CONSERVATIVE, I LISTENED TO RONALD REAGAN. I SAID HE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A HORRIBLE, RACIST PERSON, HE SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY MOTHER AND AT THAT POINT I STARTED THINKING FOR MYSELF. IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY MEDICAL CAREER TOO. THAT IS THE REASON THAT GOD GAVE US THESE CONFLICTS , COMPLEX BRAINS. FOR GOD GIVE YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN BE A SHEEP AND FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE OR TO THINK FOR YOURSELF? DON'T YOU FIND IT FASCINATING THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST? IT SEEMS LIKE SOME YEARS AGO, JESSE JACKSON GAVE AN AWARD IN NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE HE OPENED UP SOME MONEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK PEOPLE. IS THAT WHAT A RACIST DOES? HE IS THE ONE WHO FINALLY GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT [INDISCERNIBLE] WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE, HE BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF HBCUS THAT COULD GET MORE MONEY THAN EVER, OPPORTUNITIES SO PEOPLE COULD TAKE THE MONEY AND DIRECTED TO THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE, AND ECONOMY OR YOU HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN HISTORY AND IT GOES ON AND ON. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF THE IS A RACIST, HE'S A AWFULLY BAD ONE. HE NEEDS TO GET A LESSON FROM THE REAL RACISTS WERE PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF YOUR SKIN COLOR YOU HAVE TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY, THOSE ARE THE REAL RACISTS. THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT A RISING TIDES , RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL. THE MEDIA LIKES TO PICK ON HIM, ANY LITTLE THING. HE'S NOT PERFECT. THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS PERFECT WAS JESUS AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND ALL THE INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE MISSIONARIES. TALK TO YOUR FAMILY, TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. IF ALL THEY'RE DOING IS LOOKING AT CERTAIN MEDIA, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE AND SO THEY PERPETRATE THIS HORRIBLE IMAGE OF HIM BEING A BAD PERSON. I TRY TO WORK WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHEN WE WERE HAVING A DEBATE AND I CANNOT HEAR MY NAME, I WAS STOOD THERE , I STOOD THERE. I WAS , I COULD NOT HEAR MY NAME. I STOOD THERE AND HE WAS ONLY ONE WHO WAITED UNTIL THEY STRAIGHT WITHOUT , STRAIGHTENED IT OUT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DONALD TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU. WHAT A GROUP. THANK YOU.

I HEAR YOU KNOCKING THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE, IT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO EVERY COMMUNITY AND CAMPAIGN FOR EVERY LAST AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IN 2020. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE TOOK ON THE WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS. THEY COME AT YOU, BUT WE ARE WINNING LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER ONE BEFORE. WE TOOK ON THE CORRUPT MEDIA AND POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS FAILED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR DECADES AND WE ARE STARTING TO LEARN THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT WERE POSSIBLE. EXACTLY THREE YEARS AGO TONIGHT, THE PEOPLE SPOKE IN WE TOOK OUR COUNTRY BACK AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WON AN EXTRAORDINARY VICTORY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND ONE YEAR FROM NOW WE WILL WIN ANOTHER INCREDIBLE VICTORY AND WE WILL DO IT FROM A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FROM AFRICAN-AMERICAN PATRIOTS. ALTOGETHER, WE HAVE NEVER DONE BETTER. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS THE ORIGINAL HOME OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND NOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE RETURNING. IT WAS A 100 YEAR TRIP AND COMING BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PEOPLE FORGET IN LINCOLN WAS REPUBLICAN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 2020 CHANCE A MAKE IT A CHANCE THAT YOU TAKE . WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT VOTE FOR ME, THAT WAS TAKING A CHANCE BECAUSE I WAS NOT A POLITICIAN. NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME TRUE MUCH MORE SO. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE NUMBERS AND MAKE 2020 A YEAR OF CHANGE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY FORMER GOVERNOR SONNY PURDUE. HE HAS GIVEN AWAY A LOT OF THE MONEY FROM CHINA. HE IS THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND HE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE SENATOR DAVID PURDUE . WHERE IS HE? I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SO INSTRUMENTAL. WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING, GEORGIA WAS NOT DOING GOOD AND NOW IT IS DOING PHENOMENAL. WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR, BRIAN. THE STATE IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS. BRIAN KEMP, A LOT BETTER. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WARRIORS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE AND HAVE BEEN REP FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY HELP US WITH ALL THE WITCHHUNTS. WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE RICK ALLEN. REPRESENTATIVE, MEANING CONGRESSMAN BARNEY CARTER. JODY HEISE, YOU KNOW. AND A WARRIOR LIKE THE PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. I WATCHED HIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VERY NERVOUS WHEN HE STARTED GOING AFTER EVERYONE. SHE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE AND HE'S ALSO A SPECIAL MAN, CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. WE ALSO HAVE A FIRST LADY AT THIS. YOU HAVE A FIRST LADY IN JORDAN , GEORGIA NAMED MARTY CAMP , KEMP. LIFE IS NOT SO EASY FOR BRIAN, HE IS WORKING ALL THE TIME. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JEFF DUNCAN, FORMER TOUR OF PLAYER BY THE WAY. ATTORNEY GENERAL CHRIS CARR, THANKS. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ELECTIVE OF KENTUCKY IS HERE. WE HAD A GREAT KENTUCKY, BUT GOT NO CREDIT FOR IT. REALLY WORKS HARD AND , WORK HARD AND ALMOST ONE. WE BROUGHT HIM UP 19 POINTS IN THE MEDIA SAID THAT WAS A BAD NIGHT FOR TRUMP. WE WON FIVE OF THE SIX RACES. THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR KENTUCKY. DANIEL, HE WON BY A LOT. A LOT OF FUN FROM THE NET BEFORE. YOU SET A RECORD FOR WHAT YOU ARE RUNNING FOR. WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE THREE YEARS AGO, I LOOKED AT THE FISCAL RECORD OF THE DEMOCRATS AND ASKED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I CAME OFF THE STAGE AND THEY SAY I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE THAT. I SAID I READ A LIST. LAST IN THE ECONOMY, LAST IN WAGES, [INAUDIBLE] I HATE TO SAY THIS, I DO MY WORST WORK OFF SCRIPT AND I DO MY BEST OFF SCRIPT AND IT MAKES THINGS EXCITING. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT TO BE MADE. THEN I MADE YOU A PLEDGE THAT WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, I WOULD BE YOUR GREATEST CHAMPION AND YOU DID. YOU CAME OUT, WE DID VERY WELL. I CAME NOT AS A POLITICIAN. I CAME AS A BUSINESSMAN /TELEVISION STAR. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THE APPRENTICE AND I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO A JOB. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. THEY SEE WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH JUDGES. WE HAVE PICKED 157 AND WILL BE AT 180 SOON. I SAID HOW MANY, THEY SAID 142. TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUDGES. TO CREATE , TWO GREAT JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT WHOLE SITUATION WITH JUDGES BECAUSE WE'VE A LOT COMING. THERE ARE SOME SAYING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU DO, I SAY MILITARY AND DEFENSE. WE HAVE TOTALLY REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE DID A BIG NUMBER ON THE GOT IT LAST WEEK , AL-BAGHDADI LAST WEEK. THEY WERE PLAYING GAMES , THEY WEREN'T PLAYING GAMES. THEY DID NOT GO THROUGH THE DOOR. I'M WATCHING THIS LIKE YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND THEY BOOM, BOOM. I SAID WHY DON'T THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR? THEY SAID BOOBY-TRAPS. IT MAKES SENSE. HE KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF ISIS. THEN WE TOOK OUT HIS SECOND AND WE HAVE OUR EYES ON HIS THIRD. I VOW TO FIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR FUTURE. EVER SINGLE ONE WAS THE WORST. THEY HAD STATISTICS SAYING THIS IS BAD AND WE TOOK CARE OF IT. NIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE BEST NUMBERS YOU HAVE. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS FOR GRANTED. I THINK 100 YEARS. WHEN DETROIT LAST HAD A REPUBLICAN MAYOR IN 1962, IT HAD A STRONG, BEAUTIFUL ECONOMY AND AFTERNOON OF THE 60 YEARS OF CROOKED DEMOCRATIC RULE, IT IS ONE OF THE POOR CITIES IN AMERICA. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CITIES IN AMERICA. PHILADELPHIA, THE POVERTY RATE DOUBLED. THE CITY HAS HAD A DEMOCRAT MAYOR EVERY YEAR SINCE 1952. NATIONWIDE, 58% OF MURDER VICTIMS UNDER THE AGE OF 22 ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY WANT YOUR VOTE THEN FORGET ABOUT YOU FOR FOUR YEARS, SIX YEARS, TWO YEARS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. IDEA WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. THIS GUY ADAM SCHIFF, HE IS A CROOKED POLITICIAN. NANCY PELOSI GO BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS. OF ALL THE WASHINGTON SELLOUT THAT HAVE BOARDED , THAT HAVE WOUNDED. THE BETRAYAL OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS UNBELIEVABLE. DEMOCRATS VOWED TO DEFEAT OF SPECIAL INTEREST AND SCHOOLS, THERE WERE SCHOOLS OF ANYBODY IN THE COUNTRY BY FAR. IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. THEY SHIPPED YOUR JOBS OVERSEAS, HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. WE CANNOT GET NANCY PELOSI TO APPROVE YOU MCA , UMCA. DEMOCRATS OPENED BORDERS TO RUTHLESS GANGS, MASS IMMIGRATION WAS HURTS , WHICH HURTS THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY PASSED CRIME BILLS THAT HURT YOUR COMMUNITY. IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU HAVE STAYED SO [INDISCERNIBLE] TO BE HONEST. NOBODY KNOWS WHY. UNDER THIS IN MINISTRATION, ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED AND IT IS CHANGING EVEN FASTER. WE ARE DOING , UNDOING THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY DEMOCRAT RULE IN CREATING NEW PROSPERITY. WE HAVE DONE MORE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THREE YEARS THAN THE BROKEN WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT HAS DONE IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS. WE HAVE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT IF I WOULD'VE SAID TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. IF I SAID THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, I WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCORIATED. LAST MONTH, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HOW DO YOU LOSE THAT ARGUMENT IN A DEBATE? THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, IT WAS 60%, 70%, HAS NOW REACHED THE LOWEST NUMBER EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY RATE HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HISTORIC LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, MOST NEW HIRES ARE MINORITIES AND WOMEN. WAGES ARE RISING REALLY FAST, UP 9% SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT WAS UNTHINKABLE IN THEIR RISING FASTEST FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN? ALMOST 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING 150,000 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN. THAT IS A LOT. WHEN I HEAR 150,000, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT MEANS WE FILL THE YANKEE STADIUM THREE TIMES. WE HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB DESTROYING REGULATIONS AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A SHORT WHILE, WE PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUTS, SAVING THE TYPICAL FAMILY $2000 YEAR AND MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN CONTRACTS AND FINANCING TO MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH HAVE , HAS RESULTED IN 20,000 BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL JOBS. WITH US TODAY OUR CALPINE ENGINEER LOOKING , KELVIN KING. HE'S A GRADUATE OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY WHERE HE WAS ALSO AN ALL-CONFERENCE FOOTBALL PLAYER. TODAY, THEY OWN A GENERAL CONTRACTING BUSINESS. PLEASE COME UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. HE LOOKS SO HAPPY. HE SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVERY DAY WE ARE REVERSING TRADE POLICIES THAT HAVE SHATTERED BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS. [NO AUDIO] ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS HELD BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE TOTALLY GONE. IN THE LAST THREE DECADES, 27% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS, PHILADELPHIA LOST 74%, BUT THE DAYS OF SHIPPING AMERICAN JOBS OVERSEAS IS OVER. 10,000 PLANTS ARE BEING OPENED IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE WE TOOK OVER. ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL AMERICANS, WE ARE NOW PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE STANDING UP TO ABUSES AND REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, A GIANT VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS FROM COAST-TO-COAST. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS HAVE COME UP WITH THAT NAME. I DON'T THINK , THEY GO LET'S IMPEACH HIM, LET'S , WE CAN'T BE HIM, SO LET'S IMPEACH HIM. GOOD IDEA. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS ARE BLOCKING THE VOTE ON THE USMCA. THEY WOULD RATHER HURT THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS BEEN HURT , HELP BLACK CONSTITUENTS. WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES IN THREE YEARS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WILL STOP EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE USA. WE ARE THE HOT PLACE WITH THE HOTTEST ECONOMY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. TO KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA, I WITHDREW FROM THE HARRIS CLIMATE ACCORD. DEMOCRATS WANTED TO INVEST IN PROJECTS AND I WANTED TO INVEST IN BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. SO TRUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY ALL GO BACK, SEE HE WANTS TO BE A DICTATOR. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. WE CREATED 9000 OPPORTUNITIES, SOUTH CAROLINA WAS INCREDIBLE. 8 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVE IN OPPORTUNITIES THAT EVERY DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST. THE REPUBLICANS GOT IT PASSED, NOT EASY. WE HAD NO VOTES FROM DEMOCRATS AND NOW DEMOCRATS SAY WE HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND THEY WILL NEVER ADMIT THAT PUBLICLY. I SAID TIM SCOTT , TIM SCOTT YOUR SENATORS WERE INCREDIBLE. IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE EXTENT IT HAS HAPPENED, TO DRAW INVESTMENT TO THESE COMMUNITIES, WE SLASHED THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO ZERO BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE COMING IN WITH IRIS MONEY AND NOW THEY ARE THRILLED TO COME IN WITH MORE. PROPERTY VALUES HAVE SKYROCKETED AND VALUES ARE UP 20%, 30%. WE ARE PROUD TO BE JOINED BY AN ARMY VETERAN AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. HE IS BUILDING A NEW CONCRETE PLAN TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE HOME OF THE BRAND-NEW F-35 FIGHTER JETS AND I WILL BE IN ALABAMA TOMORROW WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. THAT WILL BE A GOOD GAME I THINK WILL STOP , GOOD GAME I THINK. COME ON UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. WHAT A JOB. HE IS DOING SO WELL IN THE CONCRETE BUSINESS, I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BE A POLITICIAN POLITICIAN WHAT A GREAT JOB. AFTER MY ELECTION, I HEARD FROM COUNTLESS AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. THEY ASKED ME TO GET INVOLVED IN A CAUSE THAT IS DEAR TO MANY OF THEM. IN THIS ROOM, I SEE SO MANY OF YOU, FOR WHOM IT WAS SO IMPORTANT, THAT IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. LAST YEAR, WITH THE HELP OF JARED. STAND UP. HE WAS INCREDIBLE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR MANY YEARS, THEY NEVER CAME CLOSE. INCLUDING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIED. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY. THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TRY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GET IT. WE NEED TO ROLLBACK THE UNJUST PROVISIONS OF THE 1994 CLINTON CRIME LAW, WHICH WAS SO UNFAIR TO YOUR COMMUNITY. WHICH SEVERELY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE ARE ALSO ADVANCING SECOND CHANCE HIRING TO GET REHABILITATED CITIZENS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD BACK TO THE JOB. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE GOING FOR US. THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD WE ARE GIVING CHANCES TODAY THAT YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE. PEOPLE ARE SO HAPPY. EMPLOYERS, PEOPLE THAT PAY THE CHECK EVERY WEEK. THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULT. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT. THEY LISTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS, WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN DOING THIS. WE SAY HIGHER AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIGHER ALL AMERICANS. , HIGER , HIRE AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIRE ALL AMERICANS. THE LAST TWO YEARS, MURDERS IN AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES HAVE DROPPED BY MORE THAN 10%. TO PROTECT THE CHURCH ROLE OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, WE INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HBCUS BY OVER $100 MILLION. [APPLAUSE] THEY DO A GREAT JOB. SOME NEEDED SOME HELP. THEY DO A GREAT JOB. WE CAN'T LOSE THEM. WE ARE DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE HARD LEFT OF REGRETS HAVE BEEN DOING NOTHING FOR YEARS. FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH ONE GOAL, OVERTURNING THE VOTES OF THE 2016 RIGGED ELECTION THAT WE HAD. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, OVERTURNING IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. FIRST IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. THAT WAS THE MUELLER REPORT. THE BIGGEST LIE EVER PERPETRATED AMONG THE , UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. RUSSIA, GIVE ME A BREAK. IT FELT BETTER BECAUSE I SAW THEM TWO WEEKS AGO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID, THAT JILL STEIN, THE HEAD OF THE GREEN PARTY, THAT WILL SEE GABBARD, I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE RUSSIAN OPERATIVES. THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF THESE WOMEN, BUT I KNOW THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. WHEN THEY SAID IT ABOUT ME, IT ME TOO USED TO GET OUT OF IT. IT WITHIN TWO MINUTES. PEOPLE SAID, WE THINK SHE IS NUTS. DERANGED, HYPER PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT, A SINISTER EFFORT TO NULLIFY THE BALANCE OF 63 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. IT'S ALL A HOAX. DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DESTROY THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND THE PILLARS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN THEIR CRAVEN PURSUIT OF POWER AND MONEY. IMAGINE IF DEMOCRATS PUT 10% OF THE ENERGY THEY DEVOTE TO ATTACKING ME AND MY ADMINISTRATION, TO INSTEAD MAKING THIS A BETTER COUNTRY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD DO? THEY DON'T CARE, BUT WE DO. THAT'S REALLY THE TRUTH. I THINK YOU ARE LEARNING THAT QUICKLY. WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA, NO. SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD OUT THE DOOR, TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. IT SHOULD HAPPEN. THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. , SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THEY ONLY WANT TO USE RADICAL SOCIALISM AND THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS SO ANYONE CAN COME IN. THEY HAVE BAD PEOPLE WANTING TO COME IN. WE HAVE STRENGTHENED THE BORDERS. WE NEED VOTES TO GET RID OF LOOPHOLES. THEY ARE CALLED LOOPHOLES. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, COURTESY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE PUBLIC BENEFITS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FOR AMERICANS. FOR THE MONEY WE SPENT ON ILLEGAL ALIENS, WE COULD REBUILD OUR ADVERSITIES , OUR INNER CITIES, FIX OUR TERRIBLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS WANT TO REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OVER THE WORLD, TO PLACES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. EVERY DAY, DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES ARE RELEASING DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS AND GANG MEMBERS LIKE MS 13 ONTO YOUR STREETS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. LAST YEAR, DEMOCRATS EVEN SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, TO PRESERVE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, NEVER HAVE THEY FOUGHT THAT HARD TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY DON'T FIGHT THAT WAY. I SEE THEM. I AM WITH THEM. THEY DON'T FIGHT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE LEGAL ALIENS COME IN, HEALTH CARE, SCHOOLS, I JOKINGLY SAID ONCE, ROLLS-ROYCE IS, EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS AN , A ROLLS-ROYCE. THE MEDIA SAID THEY ALL GET ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THIS IS A LIE. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. THEY DON'T GIVE THEM ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THEY GIVE THEM JUST SHORT OF THAT. DEMOCRATS CARE MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS OR OUR MILITARY. OR CITIZENS ALL OVER. THEY CARE MORE, AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECOME , CARE MORE , AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BECOME FORGOTTEN AMERICANS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THEY ARE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE WAGING AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON HISTORIC VALUES AND TRADITIONS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTACK LAW ENFORCEMENT ERRORS THAT KEEP US SAFE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SAFE. WE WANT SAFETY. WHEN I READ THE LIST OF 10, 1 OF THE LIST WAS THAT IS THE MOST UNSAFE, AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT. LIKE HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE. WE WANT TO BE SAFE. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE, CRUSHER RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND SILENCER PASTORS. PASTORS ARE BEING SILENCE. NOT ANY LONGER, BECAUSE OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. YOU'RE PASTORS AND MINISTERS ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. WITHOUT RETRIBUTION. AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP. THEY HAVE BEEN THE CONSCIENCE OF OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS WANT TO DRIVE FAITH OUT OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND ATTACKED CHRISTIANS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS CHERISH OUR NATIONS RELIGIOUS HERITAGE. WE WILL ALWAYS CHERISH THAT. IT MEANS SO MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY LOST THAT INCREDIBLE GROUNDING. THE VITAL AND INDISPENSABLE ROLE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES AND OUR SITE , SOCIETY. WE HAVE SOME MINISTERS HERE AND PASTORS HERE. YOU HEARD FROM ONE, HE IS AN INCREDIBLE MAN. WE HAVE MINISTERS AND PASTORS AND OTHERS THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL LOOK UP TO WHEN THEIR VOICE HAS TO BE HEARD. THEY HAVE TO BE HEARD. THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT VOICE AWAY. IT WON'T HAPPEN. DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, WHERE IT WAS AFTER BIRTH. THAT'S EVIL. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO STOP LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT. THROUGH HEAVY AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACROSS OUR LAND, YOU DON'T NOT CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALREADY LEFT YOU ALONG. , A LONG TIME AGO. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE RADICAL SOCIALISM, OPEN BORDERS, OUT-OF-CONTROL POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, YOUR JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, YOUR CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS, LIBERAL EXTREMISTS TO RUN YOUR LIVES, THEN TODAY, THEY SAY WELCOME TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HONEST ABE. REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND HARD-WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR AND CREED. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY KNOWS OUR RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND FREEDOMS , LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS ARE GIVEN TO US BY THE HAND OF GOD. GUIDED BY THAT OF TRUTH, DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR , PUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR SAFE STREETS, AND A GOVERNMENT THAT LISTENS AND ENTERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DRAINING THE SWAMP, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING THE CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS, CRONY LOBBYISTS, THEY BRING THE MEN AND THEY PAY FOR THEM. THEY ARE DISGRACING A CLASS OF PEOPLE AND A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M NOT TALKING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. I'M TALKING ALL AMERICANS. THEY ARE DISGRACING US AS A NATION. THEY HAVE DISMISSED YOU, HURT YOU, AND THEY HAVE SABOTAGED YOU FOR FAR TOO LONG. IT IS TIME TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTATORS IN FRONT. WE HAVE COMMENTATORS IN THE BACK AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME IN THE FAR BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE? THEY ARE GREAT. THEY GET IT. THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. SOME OF THEM DID NOT GET IT AT THE BEGINNING. THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THEIR DAY IS OVER. YOUR DAY IS HAS JUST BEGUN , YOUR DAY HAS JUST BEGUN. THAT'S WHY WE NEED EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND EVERY LIKE-MINDED VOTER TO TAKE PART IN OUR RIGHTEOUS CAMPAIGN TO EXTEND BLESSINGS OF ALL-AMERICA TO ALL OF OUR CITIZENS WE NEED YOU TO SHARE OUR MESSAGE OF JOBS, OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW. REACH OUT YOUR FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, CHURCHES AND COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING YOUR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, WHICH WE ARE BRINGING BACK INTO OUR NATION. WE NEED THEM. TELL THEM TO JUDGE US BASED ON THAT. AND ALL THAT HAVE ACHIEVED. WE HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN ANYBODY HAS ACHIEVED EVER. IT HASN'T BEEN DONE ON THE SPEARS FROM THE MEDIA AND LIES FROM THOSE DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO. THEY WANT TO DEFEND. THEY ARE DEFENDING THEIR TURF, BUT IT IS NO GOOD. TELL THEM YOU WERE FIERCE AND BRAVE AND PROUD AND INDEPENDENT. BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY HAS GROWN. I DROVE COULD HAVE SAID THAT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALLER AUDIENCE. PEOPLE ARE SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING. GO OUT AND ENJOY THE , JOIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. GET YOUR FRIENDS AND JOIN IT. WE WILL DO THINGS NOBODY EVER DREAMT OF FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. WITH YOUR HELP, AMERICA'S FUTURE IS OURS TO BUILD AND BUILD UPON AND MAKE EVEN GREATER THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. AMERICA'S DESTINY IS OURS TO REACH. AMERICA'S GLORY IS OURS TO ACHIEVE. WHEN MY ADMINISTRATION AND MILLIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS JOIN FORCES, WE WILL BE A TOTALLY UNSTOPPABLE FORCE. THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. REMEMBER, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LET YOU DOWN. TALKING ABOUT OVER 100 YEARS. WE WILL DELIVER A FUTURE OF JUSTICE, OPPORTUNITY, PROSPERITY AND DIGNITY TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD ACROSS THIS LAND. OUR NATION IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ECONOMY LIKE THIS BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. IT MAKES THINGS EASIER. IF OUR OPPONENT HAD GOTTEN, THIS ECONOMY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU VERY STRONGLY THE BEST IS YET TO COME. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS. I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT COULD NOT GET IN. YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. IT'S MY HONOR TO HAVE BEEN THERE WITH YOU. IT WILL TOGETHER AND ACHIEVED TOGETHER AND SUCCEED TOGETHER. , WE WILL WORK TOGETHER, ACHIEVED TOGETHER AND SUCCEED TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?466133-1/president-trump-remarks-black-voices-trump-rally	President Trump delivered remarks at a &ldquo;Black Voices for Trump&rdquo; rally in Atlanta.

WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR POLICE AND REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, INCLUDING $1 BILLION TO TOTALLY REVAMP THE LEGENDARY B-52 BOMBERS, LIKE THOSE AT THE AIR FORCE BASE. WE TOTALLY REBUILT OUR MILITARY. OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED AGAIN. WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN WARRIOR, WE ARE DEFEATING RADICAL, ISLAMIC TERRORISM. AND THE BLOOD 30 SAVAGE KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. [CHEERING] [CHANTING USA] AND SO IMPORTANT, OUR REBUILT MILITARY. WE CAN SAY WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE, NOT THAT WE EVER WANT TO DO THIS, BUT OUR ENEMIES DO NOT STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE POWER OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [CHEERING] AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AND AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN, RESPECTED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. EVERY COUNTRY THAT COMES TO SEE ME THEY RESPECT OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. WHILE WE ARE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, THE RADICAL LEFT, DEMOCRATS , [BOOING] IS RIPPING OUR COUNTRY APART. THEY ARE TRYING TO OVERTHROW AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND ERASE THE VOTES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. FIRST IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. THEN IT WAS THE MUELLER WITCHHUNT. YOU REMEMBER THAT ONE. SO FAR, MUCH MORE THAN 100% BECAUSE IT GOES HE FOR THE ELECTION EVER TOOK PLACE. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS SINCE BEFORE THE ELECTION TOOK PLACE. A BUNCH OF BAD PEOPLE. THEN ONE OF THE SINGLE GREATEST LIES EVER TOLD BY ANYBODY IN THIS GOVERNMENT, ONE OF THE GREAT SCANDALS FROM THE BEGINNING. ALL OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING. NOW, THE ABSOLUTELY CRAZED LUNATICS, THE DEMOCRATS, RADICAL LEFT, AND THEIR MEDIA PARTNERS STANDING RIGHT BACK THERE. [CROWD BOOING] ARE PUSHING THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT, BUT DOING NOTHING WRONG. WE DID NOTHING WRONG AND THEY ARE DOING NOTHING. THEY HAVE NOT DONE A THING SINCE NANCY PELOSI, THE SPEAKER. THEY HAVE NOT DONE A THING. BUT ONCE AGAIN, THERE LIES WILL BE EXPOSED, JUST LIKE THE LAST TIMES. [CROWD CHEERING] THEIR SCHEMES ARE ON ROUTE , ARE ALREADY UNVEILING , UNRAVELING. THEY ASKED TO THESE TWO NEVER-TRUMPERS, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU EXACTLY IMPEACH HIM FOR? THEY STOOD THERE LIKE, WHAT? THEY ARE UNRAVELING AND THEIR SINISTER PLANS WILL FAIL THEY HAVE ALREADY FAILED, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. [CROWD CHEERING] AS I AM GETTING OUT OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AIRPLANE, AIR FORCE ONE, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLANE, THIS JUST CAME OUT, BIG STORY. NEW REMARKS FROM TOP UKRAINIAN OFFICIAL DAMAGES DEMOCRAT'S IMPEACHMENT NARRATIVE. [CROWD CHEERING] THIS CAME OUT. I ONLY READ IT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE TO REPORT STORIES LIKE THIS. BECAUSE WE ARE FIGHTING THE DEMOCRATS, BUT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIGHT IS THE FAKE NEWS, I AM TELLING YOU. THEY ARE A PARTNERSHIP. I CALL THEM A PARTNERSHIP MADE IN HELL. UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THURSDAY, LISTEN TO THIS , THEY DO NOT EVEN WANT TO REPORT IT. UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAID ON THURSDAY THAT THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR DID NOT LINK FINANCIAL, MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO A REQUEST FOR UKRAINE TO OPEN UP AN INVESTIGATION INTO FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND CURRENT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT , CAN YOU BELIEVE? LIKE WE NEED HELP TO BEAT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN? I DO NOT THINK SO. [CROWD CHEERING] YOU KNOW, LAST ELECTION , BY THE WAY, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT I HAVE A LOT OF SPIT , EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT. THE TALENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXPERIENCE, RIGHT? I HAD NO EXPERIENCE. LAST ELECTION WE TOOK DOWN THE BUSH DYNASTY. IT IS OK. WITH NO EXPERIENCE. BUSH DYNASTY, THEN WE TOOK DOWN THE CLINTON DYNASTY. [CROWD CHEERING] SO WE TOOK DOWN BUSH, CLINTON, OBAMA, WITH NO EXPERIENCE, BUT I HAD YOU AND WE WON. SO THINK ABOUT THAT, AND THEN THINK ABOUT ME. GEE, LET'S GET SOME HELP FROM UKRAINE IN ORDER TO BEAT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. I DON'T THINK SO. JUST TO FINISH THIS UP, SO THERE WAS NOTHING, NO LINK, NO NOTHING, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SLEEPY JOE BIDEN , I ADDED THE WORD SLEEPY. THIS IS SERIOUS. HIS SON HUNTER. WHERE IS HUNTER? WHAT HAPPENED TO HUNTER? I THINK HE MADE MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN HISTORY FOR SOMEBODY WITH ABSOLUTELY NO TALENT OR EXPERIENCE. HE IS NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. OK. THE AMBASSADOR DID NOT TELL US, AND CERTAINLY DID NOT TELL ME, ABOUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ASTUTE , ASSISTANT , ASSISTA NCE AND THE INVESTIGATION. NOTHING HAPPENED. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVESTIGATION AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE. THEY HAVE SAID NOW NOTHING HAPPENED, AND YET , YOU DO NOT READ THIS. IT ONLY CAME OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO, IN ALL FAIRNESS. CAN YOU REPORT THIS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, PLEASE? [CROWD CHEERING] HE HAS THE LITTLE 10 INCH NECK. WHAT SIZE SHIRTS DO YOU NEED, ADAM? I WEAR A SIZE NINE. NINE? HE WILL NOT MAKE THE LSU FOOTBALL TEAM, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. AND THE NECK IS GONE. HE IS A BAD GUY, A DISHONEST GUY. HE IS THE GUY THAT WENT OFF AND FABRICATED A WHOLE STORY AND READ WHAT I SUPPOSEDLY SAID TO THE NEW AND VERY GOOD, I THINK, NEW UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. ADAM SHIFTY SCHIFF , THINK OF IT, HE MADE UP MY STATEMENT AND IT WAS HORRIBLE WHAT HE SAID. HE FINISHED IT BY SAYING, YOU DO NOT CALL ME, I CALL YOU. WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE IS SICK. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS. I SAID, I BETTER RELEASE THE REAL CALL. THEY HAD TRANSCRIBERS, THE CALL IS PERFECT. WE RELEASED IT AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THEM. THEY ARE DISGRACED. [CROWD CHEERING] THEY ARE JUST DISHONEST. THEY HURT OUR COUNTRY INCREDIBLY BADLY BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE TO RELEASE CALLS FROM OTHER PRESIDENTS AND PRIME MINISTERS. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT, BUT YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE HE FABRICATED , HE MADE UP THE CONVERSATION. HE IS A THIEF, CROOK. HE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN, AND FRANKLY, HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS HE HAS IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE IS A CONGRESSMAN AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS. HE MADE THE STATEMENT, HE MADE THE STATEMENT WHILE IN THAT GREAT, BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, THEREFORE HE HAS IMMUNITY. HE CAN BE CROOKED AS HELL. HE GAVE THE REPUBLICANS, WHO BY THE WAY REALLY STUCK TOGETHER , IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE. [CROWD CHEERING] SO WE DO NOT HAVE RIGHTS TO LAWYERS, WE DON'T HAVE RIGHTS TO ANYTHING. IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING. BY THEM BEING SO RIDICULOUS, PEOPLE SEE WE HAVE BEEN TAKING AWAY OUR DUE PROCESS HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. WE HAVE TRUTH, THE FACT EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, PERFECT. AND BASED ON THE POLL NUMBERS AND OTHER NUMBERS, BUT BASED ON THE POLL NUMBERS, THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT BUYING IT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING UP AND THEY ARE GOING DOWN. LET'S KEEP IT GOING FOR A WHILE. LET'S KEEP IT GOING FOR A WHILE. I HAVE ONE PROBLEM. I HAVE ONE PROBLEM. IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD ON MY FAMILY. WHOEVER HEARD , IMPEACHMENT IS A DIRTY WORD. IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD ON MY FAMILY. ME, WHAT A LIFE I LEAD. YOU THINK THIS IS FUN, DON'T YOU? BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY HARD ON MY FAMILY, VERY HARD. I HAVE FOUND REPUBLICANS STICK TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW? SIR, OUR POLL NUMBERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF, COULD WE KEEP THIS GOING? I SAID DO ME A FAVOR, COULD WE GET IT ENDED? THEY SAY, LET'S KEEP IT GOING, WE NEVER HAD A TIME LIKE THIS. I GOT A CALL FROM EVANGELICAL LEADERS THE OTHER DAY, A LOT OF THEM. THEY SAY THE CHURCH HAS NEVER BEEN MORE ENERGIZED AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO TO OUR PRESIDENT. EVER. SO WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF REPUBLICANS, BUT THEY ACTUALLY SAID, LET'S KEEP THIS SUCKER GOING FOR A WHILE. I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING NICE ABOUT ENDING IT. WITH THIS FROM THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT AND UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER, THIS IS THE WHOLE ALL GAME. IN THEORY, THEY SHOULD END IT TONIGHT, BUT THEY WON'T. THEY WILL FIND SOMETHING. THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE LAST ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION. THAT IS ALL IT IS. [CROWD CHEERING] THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON ARE TRYING TO STOP ME BECAUSE I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU, FIGHTING FOR YOU. THEY ARE ATTACKING , AND THEY DON'T. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT US. WHO SAID THAT? RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT IS RIGHT, THEY DON'T. AND THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY TALK, THEY WORK VERY HARD FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND PEOPLE DO NOT HEAR FROM THEM ANYMORE. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? THEY SAW THAT AND WE HAVE THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AND THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. RECORD. THEY ARE ATTACKING ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AN ATTACK ON THE WHOLE PARTY BECAUSE I AM TAKING ON THE BROKEN ESTABLISHMENT AND RESTORING GOVERNMENT'S LOYALTY TO THE PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT CORRUPTION LOOKS LIKE, JUST WATCH THE VIDEO OF SLEEPY JOE, AND WATCH HIM AS HE BRAGS ABOUT WITHHOLDING $1 BILLION IN AID MONEY TO UKRAINE, UNTIL UKRAINE FIRES THE PROSECUTORS, GETS RID OF THE PROSECUTOR THAT HAS BEEN GOING AFTER HIS SON AND HIS SON'S COMPANY IN UKRAINE. HIS SON GOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM A COMPANY. SEE HOW MUCH HE MADE BEFORE THE FATHER WAS VICE PRESIDENT. NO EXPERIENCE, NO NOTHING, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAID APPROXIMATELY $168,000 A MONTH, PLUS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH NO EXPERIENCE. WOULD ANYBODY HERE TAKE THAT JOB? I THINK SO. I THINK I MIGHT TAKE THAT JOB, OK. THAT IS A GOOD JOB. THEN HUNTER FLEW TO CHINA. WE ARE MAKING A GREAT DEAL WITH CHINA. OR WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND TARIFFS. EITHER WAY, THEY WANT THE DEAL MORE THAN I DO. BUT HE FLEW TO CHINA WITH HIS FATHER ON AIR FORCE 2, A SLIGHTLY SMALLER VERSION OF AIR FORCE ONE. AND WHILE THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS GOING SOFT ON CHINA, HIS SON PICKS UP $1.5 BILLION FOR HIS STUPID FUND THAT HE NEVER DID BEFORE. [CROWD BOOING] MEANING HE COULD MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. I WAS WITH THE TOP WALL STREET PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY. THEY LOVE US BECAUSE WE ARE SETTING RECORDS EVERY WEEK, VIRTUALLY. WHICH BY THE WAY, MEANS COMPANIES COMING IN AND JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. I WAS WITH THE TOP GUYS THAT DID THIS FOR LIVING. CAN YOU GO TO CHINA AND PICK UP $1.5 BILLION IN 10 MINUTES? THEY SAID, IMPOSSIBLE. SUPPOSING YOU GUYS? CAN'T DO IT. BUT A GUY WITH NO EXPERIENCE CAN DO IT AND THE FAKE NEWS DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? BUT IT WILL BECOME A MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE. IT WILL BECOME A MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE. AMERICANS DESERVE , ASSUMING HE WINS. I HOPE HE DOES , WE WILL HAVE THE LOWEST RATINGS IN THE HISTORY BECAUSE HE IS A VERY SLEEPY PERSON. HE IS EXHAUSTED. JOE IS EXHAUSTED. TIRED GUY. AMERICANS DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH, BUT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, THEY ARE COVERING IT UP LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER COVERED IT UP BEFORE, EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IN FACT, I SAW A REPORT TODAY. WE KILLED AL-BAGHDADI, WORST LEADER OF ISIS, WE TOOK 100% OF THE CALIPHATE. WHEN I TOOK IT OVER, ISIS WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE DEFEATED 100% OF THE CALIPHATE, OK? WHEN WE TOOK DOWN AL-BAGHDADI, TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY SAID, PRESIDENT TRUMP, OUT OF THE STORIES WRITTEN HAD 60 , 64% BAD PUBLICLY. HOW DO YOU GET BAD PUBLICITY? WE DID NOT LOSE ANY OF OUR TALENTED SOLDIERS. [CROWD CHEERING] AND THE FAKE NEWS GAVE ME BAD PUBLICITY. YOU CAN'T WIN. ONE OF THE PAPERS, THE WASHINGTON POST, WHICH IS A TERRIBLE NEWSPAPER, STARTED TALKING ABOUT AL-BAGHDADI AS A GREAT RELIGIOUS LEADER. O GIVE ME A , [CROWD BOOING] IF THE OTHER SIDE WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORST HUMAN BEING EVER CREATED. BUT HE WAS A BAD GUY AND WE GOT HIM, THAT IS WHY WE ARE MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING, DRAINING THE SWAMP. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE DECLARED WAR ON YOUR VALUES, AND THE VALUES OF A GREAT, GREAT PLACE CALLED LOUISIANA. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF IT? SO IN TWO DAYS YOU CAN SHOW THE FAR LEFT DEMOCRATS THAT YOU WILL NOT STAND FOR THEIR CORRUPTION. YOU KNOW YOUR 401(K)'S ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM GO DOWN, START VOTING DEMOCRAT. YOU'LL SEE THEM CUT IN HALF AND FURTHER. SATURDAY YOU NEED TO FIRE YOUR FAR-LEFT GOVERNOR. HE TALKS, BUT HE WILL NOT BE THERE. WHEN PELOSI AND ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS FROM WASHINGTON CALL HIM UP, SCHUMER, HOW ABOUT CHUCK? [CROWD BOOING] I CALL HIM CRYING CHUCK BECAUSE I SAW HIM CRYING ONCE MAKING A SPEECH. ISN'T THAT SAD? I CALL HIM CRYING CHUCK. CRYING CHUCK. LITTLE [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO ELECT A TRUE LOUISIANAN CHAMPION, EDDIE RISPONE. A REAL SUCCESS. YOU GOTTA GET OUT. [CROWD CHANTING EDDIE] IN MISSISSIPPI TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. WE ELECTED A GOVERNOR. HE WON BY MORE THAN ANTICIPATED. EVERYBODY ELECTED BY MORE THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. IN KENTUCKY WE ELECTED EVERYBODY. THE GOVERNOR GOT BROUGHT UP IN A FEW SHORT DAYS 19 POINTS. I WENT, WE MADE A SPEECH, THE WHOLE TICKET WAS THERE. EVERYBODY WON BIG. THE GOVERNOR IS A GOOD GUY. 19 POINTS IS BIG AND THEY LOST BY A FEW THOUSAND VOTES PER THE HEADLINES, TRUMP , YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A BIG WIN, OK? HE MADE A LOT OF OUR DECISIONS AND HE DID NOT WIN, BUT WE BROUGHT HIM UP A LOT. THE REST OF KENTUCKY, THEY HAD RECORD NUMBERS. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, HE IS PROFAMILY, PRO-LIFE, PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT AND 100% FROM AMERICAN. , PRO-AMERICAN. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] SO I HAVE KNOWN EDDIE FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL GUY, MADE A LOT OF MONEY. HE WENT AGAINST A PHENOMENALLY TALENTED AND WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING. WE LOVE RALPH. I WILL BRING HIM UP HERE IN A SECOND. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] EDDIE AND RALPH, THEY WANT CRIMINAL ALIENS OFF OF OUR STREETS AND DANGEROUS OFFENDERS BEHIND BARS. EDDIE IS GOING TO PRINT , CUT YOUR TAXES. YOU PAY HIGH TAXES. REDUCE YOUR REGULATIONS AND PROTECT LOUISIANA ENERGY WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE. IF ANY OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE GET IN, THERE WON'T BE ENTERED , ANY ENERGY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WILL BE DOING. I DON'T WANT ANY PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THEY DON'T WANT COAL. THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WANT WIND. TRY LIKING A WINDMILL WHEN IS 50 FEET AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE. WETRY LIKING A WANT EDDIE. I SUPPORTING EDDIE, , BY SUPPORTING EDDIE, YOU WILL DELIVER A POWERFUL REBUKE TO THE SOCIALISTS TRYING TO SABOTAGE OUR DEMOCRACY AND A RACE YOUR CHERISHED WAY OF LIFE IN LOUISIANA. , ERASE YOUR CHERISHED WAY OF LIFE IN LOUISIANA. AND YOU CAN SEND A TREMENDOUS MESSAGE BACK TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE EDDIE IS RUNNING AGAINST A FAILED LEFT MAN, JOHN BEL EDWARDS. HE HAS LET YOU SOWED THAT DOWN IN , LET YOU DOWN IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HE IS A TOOL OF NANCY AND CHUCK AND PROBABLY THAT GUY ADAM SCHIFF. I DON'T THINK SCHIFF PLAYS WELL DOWN HERE. HE IS CONTROLLED BY THE SAME EXTREMISTS WITH THE WEIGHTS , WITCHHUNT. IF JOHN BEL EDWARDS GETS INVOLVED, HE WILL PUSH IT LIKE HOW. , HELL. GOT ANOTHER ENEMY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE I HAVE SO MANY? I HAVE AN ENEMY IN LOUISIANA, , EVERYONE IS REPUBLICAN. YOU NEED A REPUBLICAN, NOT A DEMOCRAT. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] ONE OF THE REASONS HE GETS NOTHING DONE. HE IS THE CHOSEN CANDIDATE. JOHN BEL EDWARDS, HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS, RADICAL, PRO-ABORTION. POLICIES AND HE LOVES THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. YOU KNOW WHY THEY LOVE HIM? HE DOES WHAT THEY WANT, THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WANT. A VOTE FOR JOHN BEL EDWARDS IS FOR RADICAL LEFTISTS WHO DESPISE YOUR VALUES, HATE YOUR BELIEFS AND WANT TO CRUSH THE WORKERS. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT. WE ARE HAVING A GREAT SURGE LIKE WE HAVE NEVER HAD. YOU ARE RANKED NUMBER 50 ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. YOU ARE DOING FINE BUT NOT LIKE YOU SHOULD BE. THAT IS AFTER I GIVE YOU A $10 BILLION , DOWN TWO MONTHS AGO , WITH THE LNG PLANT ON THE GULF. AND NOW THEY WANT TO EXPAND IT, IT IS DOING SO WELL. EDWARDS BROKE HIS COLUMN ABOUT TO THE PEOPLE WHEN HE WENT , SOLEMN VOW TO THE PEOPLE WHEN HE PUSHED THROUGH THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR STATE. HE DOUBLECROSSED YOU, AND YOU CAN NEVER TRUST HIM. IT IS CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] TO FINISH UP, I WANT TO HIT HIM STRONG. HE HATES ME. DON'T THINK HE EVER LIKED ME ALTHOUGH HE USED TO BE NICE IN PERSON. HE USED TO SAY I LIKE THE PRESIDENT. HE WOULD GO INSIDE AND SAY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL. HE IS IN THE POCKET OF THE TRIAL LAWYERS WHO HAVE SENT YOUR CAR INSURANCE RATES TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] , HE ALLOWED ILLEGAL ALIENS TO STERILE , STEAL FROM FAMILIES AND JOHN BEL EDWARDS SUPPORTS ILLEGAL ALIENS, NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS. PRETTY SIMPLE. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE I HATE TO SAY. ON JOHN BEL EDWARDS' WATCH, LOUISIANA HAS THE HIGHEST MURDER RATE IN ALL OF AMERICA. ON SATURDAY, YOU HAVE TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT A VOTE FOR JOHN BEL EDWARDS, YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR, TAXES ARE HIGH, CAR INSURANCE A DISASTER, UNEMPLOYMENT NOT GREAT AT ALL, YOUR 50TH , YOU ARE 50TH IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND NUMBER ONE IN MURDERS, IT IS A VOTE FOR THE WASHINGTON SWAMP, A VOTE FOR THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT. GET OUT AND VOTE FOR EDDIE RISPONE WHO IS THE JOBS, SAFETY AND FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] SO WITH THAT, , THAT WAS A LONG HARANGUE, BUT I WANT TO PUT IT IN YOUR HEADS, VERY IMPORTANT. EVEN IF JOHN BEL WANTED TO DO GOOD, HE CAN'T. YOU GOT TO VOTE FOR EDDIE. CAN I ASK HIM TO COME UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS? EDDIE RISPONE.

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] NOW WE HAVE TO FIRE OUR LIBERAL TAX EXPENDING, SOCIALIST LEANING GOVERNOR, JOHN BEL EDWARDS. [SHOUTING] JOHN BEL EDWARDS HAS PASSED THE HIGHEST TAX IN THE HISTORY OF LOUISIANA. IT IS WHERE WE HAVE LOST THOUSANDS OF JOBS. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF JOHN BEL EDWARDS, AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] BUT THIS IS BIGGER THAN LOUISIANA. WE HAVE GOT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THESE LIBERAL SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WE SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT AND WE WILL NOT PUT OUT , LET'S SEND A MESSAGE TO THEM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] LIKE THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID, HOW DO WE SEND THAT MESSAGE, WE ELECT ME AS YOUR GOVERNOR AND SAY WE ARE GOING TO FIRE JOHN BEL AND WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK WHERE WE BELONG. WE ARE A RED STATE. WE WILL WORK WITH THE CONSERVATIVES AND PRESIDENT TO MAKE LOUISIANA NUMBER ONE IN THE SOUTH WITH JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY.

I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHOICE. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SPEAKING AS IF HE MIGHT RUN AGAINST JOE BIDEN. LET ME ASK YOU, WHO DO YOU THINK IS MORE PRO-MILITARY, JOE BIDEN OR DONALD? AND WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS? AND WHO DO YOU THINK, WHO DO YOU THINK , WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO PROTECT YOUR BORDERS? THERE IS ONE QUESTION.

WHAT I THANK HIM FOR HIS ALLOWING ME TO RIDE ON AIR FORCE ONE TO GET AWAY FROM THE INSANITY OF PELOSI AND SHIFTS , ADAM SCHIFF, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THE UNITED STATES MEXICO AND CANADA AGREEMENT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF OUR MILITARY AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT , AND PELOSI WILL ALLOW US TO VOTE ON THAT IN THE CONGRESS. THIS GREAT PRESIDENT HAS GOT OUR BACKS, BUT PELOSI WON'T LET US VOTE ON THAT. NOW MR. PRESIDENT , IN LOUISIANA, WE KNOW WHAT HORSE MANURE LOOKS LIKE. WE KNOW THAT THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS A TRUNK FULL OF IT. WE KNOW THAT PELOSI AND ADAM SCHIFF ARE UP TO THEIR NEXT AND IT , NECKS IT IS. I HAVE A NEW THEME SONG FOR ADAM SCHIFF. IT IS MARVIN GAYE'S HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE. YOU SAID IT, THEY CAN'T BEAT YOU AT THE POLLS, SO THEY ARE TRYING TO OVERTURN OUR VOTE IN THE LAST ELECTION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. WE ALSO SAID PRESIDENT, THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT FOR POINTING OUT THAT WE ARE LAST IN THE ECONOMY. WE ARE LAST IN JOBS. WE ARE LAST IN MURDER, EVERYTHING WE SHOULD BE FIRST IN THE LOUISIANA, WE ARE DEAD LAST. WE ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. WHILE THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT THREE MAKES A COUPLE , I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A FLUKE GOAL IS BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TELLING US , THREE MAKES TWO, THIS GREAT MAN IS WORKING EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. WE APPRECIATE YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, AND , [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND IN LOUISIANA, WE KNOW WE HAVE THE MOST , WE HAVE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY WHICH WILL RIVAL MOST COUNTRIES, AND WE HAVE A WONDERFUL PEOPLE'S INGENUITY WHO IS SECOND TO NONE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE FOOLED AGAIN, MR. PRESIDENT. GO OUT AND VOTE SATURDAY, VOTE FOR EDDIE, AND LET'S GET THIS THING DONE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] RIGHT PEOPLE. , GREAT PEOPLE. IT IS A THURSDAY NIGHT, AS WE DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. WE DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT OTHER THINGS YOU ARE DOING. I ALWAYS LIKE FRIDAY NIGHT WITH THESE THINGS BUT THIS IS SOME THURSDAY NIGHT. WOULD YOU RATHER BE ANYPLACE ELSE IVANA TRUMP RALLY? TRUMP RALLY THURSDAY NIGHT NOW. BUT WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE TONIGHT, AMERICA IS BOOMING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE HAVE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS, UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 50 YEARS. HALF A CENTURY. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE RECENTLY HIT THE LOWEST RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] NEARLY 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE RISEN OUT OF POVERTY. THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS QUITTING THE JOB THEY HATE TO TAKE A NEW JOB IS HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU ARE NOT STUCK AT A JOB YOU DON'T WANT. YOU GET MORE MONEY SOMETIMES. IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN MANY DECADES. AFTER YEARS OF PAINFUL STAGNATION AND DECLINE, WAGES AND INCOME IS RISING AT ONE OF THE FASTEST RATES IN HISTORY. REAL WAGES FOR LOW-INCOME WORKERS HAVE GONE UP NEARLY 9%. AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH AS AN EXAMPLE ROSE ONLY $400 OVER EIGHT YEARS. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA IT ROSE ONLY $975. AND UNDER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT , [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] IT ROSE $5,000 IN JUST 2.5 YEARS. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] IN ADDITION IN OUR CASE TO THE 5000 DOLLARS, WE CAN ADD ANOTHER $5,000 IN SAVINGS FROM TAX CUTS, RELATION CUTS, AND ENERGY, ENERGY PRODUCTION AND ENERGY COSTS. SO WHEN YOU ADD IT UP, IT WENT UP $400 FOR PRESIDENT BUSH, $975 UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, EIGHT YEARS AND EIGHT YEARS, AND A LITTLE MORE THAN 2.5 YEARS IT WENT UP $10,000 UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. THOSE ARE TOUGH NUMBERS. WE ARE ADOPTING A POLICY OF AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE WHICH IS GREAT FOR YOUR STATE IN PARTICULAR. TEXAS IS HAPPY ALSO. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND NORTH DAKOTA IS NOT TOO UNHAPPY. WE HAVE A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE HAPPY. AMERICA IS THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] MEANWHILE THE FAR-LEFT DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO ABOLISH THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT IDEA? HOW ABOUT THIS CLOWN BETO? HE WAS AGAINST GUNS, RELIGIOUS , RELIGION AND OIL AND LIVES IN , SOMEBODY CALL HIM AND EXPLAIN IT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA. DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. A POLITICIAN THAT COULD LOWER TAXES, WE GIVE YOU THE BIGGEST TAX DECREASE, AND IT WAS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LOT SHORTER TIME THAN MOST OF THEM, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES THAT WORK? IS THAT A GOOD THING? TAXES ARE GOING UP , DOWN STILL FURTHER. WE HAVE NOT FORM , FOUND A FORM OF ENERGY ACCEPTABLE TO THE LEFT. NO ENERGY, NO NOTHING, CLOSE DOWN EVERY BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE ENDING DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT COST THE STATE ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AND THE NUMBERS ARE HIGHER. WEAK LEADERS, CORRUPT POLITICIANS SOLD YOU OUT, LET OTHERS PLUNDER OUR FACTORIES AND STEEL THE CROWN JEWELS OF YOUR ECONOMY. PAST ADMINISTRATIONS FINANCED THE RISE OF CHINA, NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE DOING. ON THE BACKS OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THE GREAT BETRAYAL IS OVER. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES AND OUR AMERICAN DREAM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE ARE REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS IN HISTORY WITH THE U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT. WE COULD ONLY GET PELOSI TO DO SOMETHING. SHE IS NOT DOING IT. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED MONTHS AGO. ALL THE DEMOCRATS WANT , SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PUT IT UP FOR A VOTE. SHE IS TOO BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS. IT IS A HUGE WIN FOR LOUISIANA FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS. NANCY PELOSI AND THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP THE RIDICULOUS WITCHHUNTS AND PASS THE USMCA BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN AND THEY GOT TO GET BACK TO RUNNING IT. BEFORE MY ELECTION OUR LEADERS USE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AS A PIGGY BANK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PROJECTS. WE TOOK CARE OF NATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD, NATIONS YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. THEY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY USED OUR MILITARY TO DEFEND WEALTHY NATIONS, SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY. THEY POURED PRECIOUS AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WHILE OUR CITIES FELL INTO DECAY. BUT I WAS ELECTED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NOT THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] [CHANTING USA] AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] PAST LEADERS TRANSFORMED FARAWAY NATIONS INTO CHAOTIC WAR ZONES, THEN THEY DEMANDED THE AMERICANS ACCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES AND BLOCK MIGRATION FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS PLACES, I IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING THAT SOME PEOPLE LOVED AND SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE. IT IS CALLED A TRAVEL BAN. AND IT WAS RECENTLY VOTED ON VERY FAVORABLY IN A THING CALLED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, FOUND TOTALLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND WE ARE KEEPING TERRORIST CRIMINALS AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] ON NO ISSUE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS MORE TOTALLY BETRAYED YOU THEN ON IMMIGRATION. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS OPEN BORDER AGENDA INVITES VICIOUS GANGS AND DANGEROUS CRIMINALS TO POUR INTO YOUR COMMUNITIES, NEIGHBORHOODS, STATE. RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA OUR BRAVE ICE OFFICERS HAVE ARRESTED CRIMINAL ALIENS CHARGED OR WANTED FOR MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER, SEXUAL BATTERY, FRAUD, FORGERY, BODILY INJURY, DRUG DEALING, POSITION OF STEALING WEAPONS AND , POSSESSION OF STOLEN WEAPONS AND CHILD ABUSE. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS. THAT INCLUDES MS 13. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS. I WANT TO THANK OUR BORDER PATROL. I WANT TO THANK ICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT VERY , ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. WE HAVE LAUNCHED HISTORIC AND UNPRECEDENTED ACTION TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE HAVE RELEASED A BRAND-NEW BORDER EMBERS TODAY SHOWING WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED ILLEGAL CROSSINGS BY MORE THAN 70% SINCE MAY. AND I CAN PROUDLY ANNOUNCE WE HAVE ENDED CAP , TOUT TO RELEASE AND WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL FASTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] [CHANTING BUILD THE WALL] THANK YOU. IT IS BEING BUILT. GOING UP. WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR EVERY INCH. WE HAVE THE HELP OF OUR MILITARY , IT IS NATIONAL SECURITY. IT TURNED OUT IT IS NATIONAL SECURITY. OUR MESSAGE TO THOSE SEEKING TO BREAK OUR LAWS IS SIMPLE. DON'T TRY IT. YOU WILL FAIL, YOU WILL BE SENT BACK HOME. THAT IS THE WAY IT WORKS. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO SUPPORTS THAT, A GOVERNOR WHO SUPPORTS WHAT WE ARE DOING ON THE BORDER AND SUPPORTS THE HEROES OF ICE AND BORDER PATROL, YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE, TO GET OUT ON SATURDAY AND VOTE FOR EDDIE RISPONE. YOU HAVE TO. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] DEMOCRATS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXTREME BY THE DAY. THE PLANNED GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE WITH , WOULD DENY YOU THE COVERAGE YOU NEED AND THE DOCTOR YOU WANT. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE WILL ALSO PROTECT YOUR PRE-EXISTING POSITIONS. , PHYSICIANS. EVERY DEMOCRAT SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S MOM RIGHT UP , MOTHER'S WOMB UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE HAVE APPOINTED MORE THAN 160 FEDERAL JUDGES. SOON 182, INCLUDING COURT OF APPEALS JUDGES. THEY WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN INCLUDING OUR TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, NEIL GORSUCH AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND WE HAVE INVESTED $2 TRILLION IN OUR MILITARY. YOU ARE A BIG AN OFFICIAL EERIE, WITH BETTER SHIPS, AIRPLANES, BOMBERS, TANKS, MISSILES, ROCKETS, BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE, BUILT IN THE USA. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] I WITHDREW FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. FOR YEARS HE WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] THE NEXT STEP TO VICTORY BEGINS ON SATURDAY. YOUR VOTE ON SATURDAY IS YOUR CHANCE TO SHOW THE RADICAL LEFT WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS THAT LOUISIANA REJECTS THEIR EXTREMISM AND THEIR CORRUPTION. YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR VOICE TO BE SILENCED, YOUR VOTE TO BE CANCELED. YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR COUNTRY TO BE DEMOLISHED WHICH IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY GET IN.

[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA WITHIN 10 YEARS. WE STARTED THAT WHOLE PROCESS. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] ABOVE ALL WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY , NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. I BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND WE LIVE BY THE WORDS, AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE WORDS AS LONG AS I AM HERE AND HOPEFULLY FOR A LONG TIME, FOREVER, THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED A CONSONANT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM AND MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.

AS WE GATHER TOGETHER FOR THANKSGIVING -- SOME PEOPLE WANT -- THEY DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM THANKSGIVING. EVERYBODY IS USING CHRISTMAS AGAIN. REMEMBER, I SAID THAT? NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LITTLE WORK ON THANKSGIVING. PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ON WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE CALLED THANKSGIVING. EVERYBODY HERE LOVES THE NAME THANKSGIVING AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING IT. AMERICANS HAVE SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, WAGES ARE RISING, CRIME IS FALLING, AND AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'VE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCLUDING 600,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. WE'RE PROTECTING AMERICAN WORKERS, TAKING CARE OF OUR AMAZING VETERANS. YOU KNOW, THE VETERANS, FOR YEARS, I WAS A CIVILIAN, I LOVED MY LIFE. IT WAS SO MUCH SIMPLER. IT WAS SO NICE AND SOFT AND EASY. YOU BUILD A BUILDING AND HAVE FUN. I WOULD ALWAYS SEE THAT YOU TURN ON THE NEWS AND READ IN THE PAPER ABOUT OUR VETERANS BEING MISTREATED. THEY WERE DOING SUCH A POOR JOB. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT ANYMORE. OUT VETERANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ARE TAKEN CARE OF TO A LEVEL THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY BEFORE. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW WITH THE WORLD THE WAY IT IS WE ARE REBUILDING THE AWESOME POWER OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. $2.5 TRILLION AND EVERYTHING IS MADE IN THE GREAT U.S. OF A. A FEW WEEKS AGO, U.S. SPECIAL FORCES BROUGHT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST TO JUSTICE. THE BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGE KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD, FINALLY. [CHANTING] JUST THIS WEEK, I STUCK UP FOR THREE GREAT WARRIORS AGAINST THE DEEP STATE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I HAD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, SIR, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT. PEOPLE HAVE TO FIGHT. THEY SHOULDN'T SAY, GEE WHIZ. THEY WANTED TO PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR 25 YEARS. ONE YOUNG MAN WAS IN JAIL FOR 7 YEARS. HE HAD 16 YEARS TO GO. I WANT TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO THAT MAN, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD AT WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING. HE CAME OUT AND HE HUGGED HIS PARENTS. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I WILL ALWAYS STICK UP FOR OUR GREAT FIGHTERS. PEOPLE CAN SIT IN AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES AND COMPLAIN, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. THEY'RE OUT OF THAT FIELD, AND THEY ARE DOING A JOB FOR US LIKE NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN DO. THE FACT IS, AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. SO WHILE WE'RE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS AND TAKING CARE OF OUR BORDERS. WE'RE SETTING RECORDS. THE WALL IS HAPPENING. IT'S GETTING BILLED RAPIDLY AND THAT'S A REAL WALL. THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RIP OUR NATION APART. [BOOING] FIRST, IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. TOTAL HOAX. IT WAS A FAILED OVERTHROW ATTEMPT AND THE BIGGEST FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THEN THE MUELLER DEAL. YOU REMEMBER THAT MESS. THEY HAD NOTHING. TWO YEARS. THEY SPENT $45 MILLION AND THE REAL COST IS MANY TIMES THAT NUMBER. NOW THE SAME MANIACS ARE PUSHING THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT. THINK OF THIS. IMPEACHMENT. A WITCH HUNT. THE SAME AS BEFORE. THEY'RE PUSHING THAT IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT. A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO THEM. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE POLLS? EVERYBODY SAID, THAT'S REALLY BULLSHIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EVERYBODY. A LOT OF FAKE NEWS OUT THERE. THEY'RE GONNA SAY THE PRESIDENT CAME. THEY WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT THE CROWD. ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY HAD A RALLY. TWO PEOPLE SHOWED UP, TWO. TWO PEOPLE! THEY GIVE US NO CREDIT. IF SOME BUT HE HAS A RALLY LIKE 1000 PEOPLE, THEY'LL SAY, IT WAS PACKED. THEY HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE. IF WE HAVE A RALLY WITH 50,000 PEOPLE, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS, BUT YOU GO OUTSIDE, THERE ARE A LOT OUTSIDE THAT CAN'T GET IN. THE LIES OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE BEING EXPOSED. THEIR SCHEMES ARE UNRAVELING. THEIR CRIMES, AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS, CRIMES. DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS GUY, SCHIFF? HE MADE UP MY STATEMENT TO THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. HE MADE IT UP. THESE ARE CROOKED PEOPLE. THESE CRIMES ARE BEING REVEALED AND THEIR SINISTER PLANS ARE BEING UNVEILED AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT, EVEN ME, POSSIBLE. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE LAST ELECTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT WIN THE NEXT ELECTION. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED THIS -- [CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS"] WHEN I STARTED THIS, I SAID, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AND THAT, AND IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. JUST ANOTHER GUY TRYING TO GET ELECTED. IT'S TOUGH. IT'S NOT EASY. WHEN A GUY GOES OUT AND NOBODY SHOWS -- IT'S NOT EASY. IT'S NORMAL. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. YOU THINK THIS IS NORMAL? CAN I BE HONEST, IN FRONT OF THOSE FAKERS BACK THERE, SOME OF THE MOST CORRUPT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I WILL TELL YOU IN FRONT OF THESE GUYS, AND THEY'RE FAKE, THEY'RE CORRUPT. IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY SEAT. I SAY, LET'S GO TO FLORIDA, JUST GET ME THE BIGGEST ARENA. LET'S GO TO WISCONSIN, LET'S GO TO MICHIGAN, LET'S GO TO PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, MICHIGAN -- ANYWHERE. AND ALL I SAY IS, IT DOESN'T MATTER, JUST GET ME THE BIGGEST ARENA. WE GET THESE MASSIVE ARENAS LIKE THIS ONE AND THEY'RE PACKED. WE PUT THE SCREENS OUTSIDE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY LIKE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE. IN THE TWISTED WORLDVIEW OF THE WASHINGTON VERY SICK DEMOCRATS, IT WAS TOTALLY FINE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON RAN HER OUTRAGEOUS PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THEN SHE DELETED 33,000 EMAILS AFTER RECEIVING THE SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS. THAT WAS STANDARD PLAY. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT PHONE CALL -- IT'S A PERFECT CALL. THERE WAS A WOMAN BEING INTERVIEWED. THEY WERE TALKING TO WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP. [WOMEN CHEERING] NO, THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND ONE OF THOSE GRADE B NETWORKS. THEY COULDN'T FIND -- THEY GOT THESE 10 WOMEN. THEY WERE ALL FOR TRUMP. THEY ALL SAID I VOTED FOR TRUMP BUT I WON'T DO IT AGAIN. THEY SAID, WHO IS VOTING FOR TRUMP? 10 HANDS. IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY ACTUALLY SAID, AND I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS BECAUSE THEY WILL BRING IT UP, WE HAVE THE GREATEST BASE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. YOU'RE THE SMARTEST. THEY DON'T LIKE TO SAY THAT. I WENT TO GREAT COLLEGES, YOU WENT TO GREAT SCHOOLS OR COLLEGES. YOU PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL AS HELL. THEY LIKE TO TRY TO DEMEAN. WE'RE WINNING, YOU'RE SMARTER, YOU'RE BETTER LOOKING, YOU'RE SHARPER. THEY CALL THEMSELVES ELITE. IF THEY'RE ELITE, THEN WE'RE THE SUPER ELITE. IT'S TRUE. THEY TALK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE ELITE THAT ARE RUNNING. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THESE DEBATES? WHAT'S ELITE ABOUT THAT? THERE'S NOTHING ELITE. WE'RE DOING GREAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS VICTORY. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT CALL -- THINK OF IT, WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH. FORGET.AND -- AND WITH NO -- DON'T FORGET. I CAME TO WASHINGTON HAVING BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW TIMES. I'M WRITING IN WASHINGTON AND I SAY TO THE FIRST LADY, WHO IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON 17 TIMES IN MY LIFE, AND I'M LOOKING AT THE FIRST LADY AND I SAY, MELANIA, DO YOU BELIEVE IT? I'M PRESIDENT. [CHEERING] ? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AND I NEVER SAW SO MANY MOTORCYCLES AND I NEVER SAW SO MANY POLICE CARS AND WE ARE GOING SO FAST IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO GO THAT WAY -- I SAY, THIS IS COOL, WE COULD GET USED TO THIS, THIS IS OK. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF WHEN I SAID THAT I SAID, LOOK, SO I GET ELECTED, AND I BEAT THE BUSH DYNASTY. [CHEERING] I GET ELECTED AND I BE WITH NO EXPERIENCE, I HAVE TREMENDOUS WORLD EXPERIENCE, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE -- I GET ELECTED AND WE BEAT THE CLINTON DYNASTY, RIGHT? AND THEN WE BEAT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA AND WHATEVER THE HELL DYNASTY THAT IS. WE HAVE 24 YEARS OF PEOPLE PUTTING PEOPLE IN OFFICE. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SOME OF THEM ARE VERY NICE, BUT I GET STUCK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I DON'T WANT. TENS OF THOUSANDS. WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT. WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET. WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE BEFORE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY HAPPY. WE HAVE DONE MORE ALREADY. HOPEFULLY, I WILL SAY THIS TO DRIVE THEM CRAZY, HOPEFULLY WE HAVE ANOTHER AT LEAST FIVE YEARS TO GO. AT LEAST. YOU KNOW, THEY THINK, HE'S NOT LEAVING, DON'T YOU? WE HAVE FIVE YEARS AND WE WILL MAKE IT A GREAT FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE DONE MUCH MORE THAN I PROMISED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TAX CUTS AND THE MILITARY AND THE V.A. RIGHT TO TRY, HOW GOOD IS THAT? THINGS THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET PASSED. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT PHONE CALL WITH ALL OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE, WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE, THEY'VE TRIED TO CLAIM THAT IT'S AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. ONE OF THE WOMEN SAID THIS MORNING, I'M VOTING FOR TRUMP. I HAPPENED TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF HIS PHONE CALL AND HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG -- CAN YOU IMAGINE? THEY TAKE THIS PERFECT CALL AND THEY WANT TO IMPEACH YOUR PRESIDENT. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, KEVIN MCCARTHY, MEADOWS, JIM JORDAN, THE GREAT CHAMPION WRESTLER. WE GOT A COUPLE OF THEM HERE. I'LL SAVE THEIR NAMES. STEVE SCALISE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. HOW'S ELISE DOING? NEW STAR. IT'S INCREDIBLE. DEVIN NUNES, HOW GOOD HAS HE BEEN? DEVIN. SO MANY MORE. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT. A LOT OF STARS ARE BEING MADE. I WAS TOLD BACKSTAGE THAT OUR POLL NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WATCHING A SCAM. THEY DON'T LIKE WATCHING IT. THEY HAVE A SICK PUPPY, SHIFTY SCHIFF. HE IS SICK. THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENED. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING -- ONE OF THEM WAS IN DETROIT, D, DEMOCRAT 30. THAT'S NOT ONE THAT WE WILL WORK TOO HARD TO GET BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. SHE CAME OUT AND SAID, I'M NOT HERE TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, THEY DON'T LIKE THE POSITION THEY ARE IN. THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE IT LESS AND LESS AND WE WILL TAKE IT RIGHT TO NOVEMBER 3, 2020. WE'RE GONNA TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. SO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE DECLARED -- THERE WAS NO PRESSURE PUT ON ME. HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS. HE SAID IT ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. NO PRESSURE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER STATED, AND I QUOTE, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND DID NOT TELL US, AND CERTAINLY DID NOT TELL ME, ABOUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ASSISTANCE AND THE INVESTIGATION. I HAVE NEVER HAD A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE. WHAT THAT MEANS, IT MEANS, WE DID ZERO -- WE DID NOTHING WRONG. NOTHING. A GREAT SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON. A SUPPORTER OF US FROM DAY ONE. OF THE UKRAINE, HE SAID, WHO MET PRIVATELY -- AND HE MET WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND HE SAID, AT NO TIME DURING THAT MEETING WAS THERE ANY MENTION BY THE PRESIDENT -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? AT NO TIME WAS THERE ANY MENTION OR ANYTHING THAT THEY WERE FEELING ANY PRESSURE IN RETURN FOR MILITARY AID. THEY WERE DEVASTATED BY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS MUELLER WITCH HUNT DEAL. THEN MUELLER TESTIFIED. HOW DID HE DO? WASN'T TOO GOOD. THEY WERE DEVASTATED. THEY SAY, THIS WAS A DISASTER. NOW THEY SAY, GIVE US ANYTHING, WE'LL IMPEACH HIM. LET HIM GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR AND PICK AN ORANGE, FROM FLORIDA, NO LESS. WE'LL IMPEACH HIM. DURING THE TIME PERIOD AT ISSUE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HELD MANY MEETINGS WITH THE UKRAINE AND NEVER ONCE DID THE UKRAINE OR THE OFFICIAL SAY ANYTHING THAT WAS WRONG. ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M HEARING ABOUT A PHONE CALL. FORTUNATELY, THEY HAD TRANSCRIBERS. HOW ABOUT IF I DIDN'T -- WITH THESE LOWLIFES. ALL I'M SAYING, I DON'T WANT TO GO IN IT TOO LONG. IT'S A TERRIBLE HOAX. LAST WEEK, SONDLAND TESTIFIED THAT I TOLD HIM, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM THE UKRAINE? I SAID, I WANT NOTHING. NO QUID PRO QUO. I WANT NOTHING. TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, TO DO WHAT HE RAN ON. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS. EVERYBODY. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HEARD SHIFTY MAKE UP A STORY WHERE HE MADE UP WHAT I SAID. THESE ARE THE FACTS. THE CASE CLOSED, GAME OVER. TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT, IT WAS LIKE, TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. I HAVE HAD REPUBLICANS COME UP TO ME SAY, CAN WE KEEP THIS SUCKER GOING A LITTLE BIT LONGER? WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AT THE POLLS. I SAID, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE STUCK DEALING WITH SICK AND CORRECTED -- CORRUPT PEOPLE. THE FAILED WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IS TRYING TO STOP ME BECAUSE I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU AND BECAUSE WE'RE WINNING. VERY SIMPLE. THEY'RE ATTACKING ME BECAUSE I'M EXPOSING A RIGGED SYSTEM THAT ENRICHED ITSELF AT YOUR EXPENSE, AND I'M RESTORING GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT CORRUPTION LOOKS LIKE, THEN TAKE A LOOK NO FURTHER THAN SLOW, SLEEPY JOE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JOE. WHEN SLEEPY JOE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE UKRAINIAN POLICY, HIS SON, I CALL HIM, WHERE IS HE? WHERE'S HUNTER? WHAT HAPPENED TO HUNTER? WHERE'S HUNTER? HIS SON RECEIVED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM A UKRAINIAN ENERGY COMPANY -- YOU KNOW THE REPUTATION OF THAT COMPANY, DESPITE KNOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY. WHAT BUSINESS ARE YOU IN, SIR? THE MAILBOX BUSINESS? OH, BAIL BOND, WHOA. YOU KNOW HUNTER BIDEN? DO YOU KNOW SLEEPY JOE? BAIL BONDS. HMM. DID YOU EVER WORK ON ENERGY BEFORE? HE SAID NO. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ENERGY THAN HUNTER. DESPITE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS, HE MADE NO MONEY, ZERO, NOTHING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS FATHER BECOMES VICE PRESIDENT. HE'S MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS, AND THEN HE GOES TO CHINA. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO A GOOD DEAL. IF WE DON'T MAKE IT, THAT'S FINE, BUT WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE. HUNTER IS DEALING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I AM IN CHINA. AFTER 10 MINUTES, HE WALKED AWAY WITH $1.5 MILLION. I SAID TO EVERYBODY, THESE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I AM DEALING WITH IN CHINA. THEY'RE MUCH SOFTER. THAT WAS WHEN HIS FATHER WAS VICE PRESIDENT. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T WANT TO BRING IT UP. THEY PROTECT EVERYBODY. [CROWD BOOING] THE DEMOCRATS ON STAGE DON'T BRING IT UP, DO YOU NOTICE? IF HE SHOULD MAKE IT, IT WILL BE BROUGHT UP 75% OF THE TIME WE ARE DEBATING. NOBODY EVER GOT AWAY WITH A SCAM LIKE THAT. NOBODY. DAY AFTER DAY, WE ARE EXPOSING THE DEPRAVITY, DISHONESTY, AND SICKNESS OF THE CORRUPT WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT. THEY ARE ROUGH AND DIRTY PLAYERS. THEY ARE COMING AT YOU FROM EVERY SIDE, COMING AT YOU FROM NEW YORK, COMING AT ME FROM NEW JERSEY, COMING AT ME FROM EVERY DEMOCRATIC STATE. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID -- AND SEAN HANNITY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW A MAN OR WOMAN IN THE WORLD THAT COULD TAKE THE CRAP THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AT THE SAME TIME, BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. NOBODY, IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF A PRESIDENCY, HAS DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE, NOBODY. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE THE MISSION. WE ARE DRAINING THE SWAMP. ON ELECTION DATE 2020, THE CRAZY DEMOCRATS ARE GOING DOWN IN A LANDSLIDE. THAT LANDSLIDE IS GOING TO START RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU. HERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST READ ABOUT. WE LIKE THESE UPDATED STORIES. DON'T WE LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO? EVERYBODY FALLS ASLEEP. NOBODY COMES. THEY SAY, HOW WAS HE? IT WAS SO BORING. IT WAS SO BORING. I ALWAYS SAY, BEING PRESIDENTIAL IS ALWAYS EASY. THANK YOU. IT IS SO EASY. DOING WHAT I DO IS TOUGH. IT'S NOT TOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE I LIKE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING, FORGET ABOUT IT. I DO LIKE IT. WHAT WE ARE DOING TOGETHER HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. NEVER BEEN DONE. I LIKE TELLING THE STORIES THAT HAPPENED. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUT THEM IN SPEECHES. HE READ STUFF AND PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP. ON SATURDAY, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. THE WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN CALLED ME AND SAID, I COULD DO SOME OF THE PHYSICAL. I NEVER TOOK PHYSICALS BEFORE. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S GOOD. JANUARY IS A VERY BUSY MONTH FOR YOU, SIR. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? LET'S GO. WE GO TO WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER. INCREDIBLE DOCTORS. I WAS THERE FOR JUST A SHORT WHILE. I VISITED A FAMILY OF A SOLDIER. INCREDIBLE FAMILY. THEIR SON WAS IN SERIOUS CONDITION. I STAYED WITH THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I TOWARDS THE HOSPITAL. VERY SIMPLE. I TOOK A LITTLE PART OF MY PHYSICAL SO I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT IN JANUARY. I GOT BACK INTO THE MOTORCADE, THE CAR. WE HAVE MANY CARS AND TRUCKS AND AMBULANCES, UNFORTUNATELY. LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. WE ALSO HAVE A BUS, WHATEVER CARRIES THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE PRESS FOLLOWS ME WHEREVER I GO, UNFORTUNATELY. IN THE OLD DAYS, I CAN SNEAK OUT AND GO SOMEPLACE. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. THE PRESS, EVERYBODY IS THERE. WE STARTED A BEAUTIFUL THING. LOTS OF CARS AND LOTS OF ACTION. THE PRESS IS FOLLOWING ME. I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT STUPID, CORRUPT, HORRIBLE CNN THEIR RATINGS ARE TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY. AND OTHERS, AND OTHERS, AND OTHERS. CNN'S RATINGS ARE TERRIBLE. LOOK, THEIR LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. I SHOULDN'T DO IT. I SHOULDN'T DO IT. WE LOSE AUDIENCE WHEN THAT HAPPENS. THEY REPORTED SO HERE I AM. I'M THERE FOR A VERY ROUTINE, LITTLE, SIMPLE PHYSICAL. BY THE WAY, I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. IT'S VERY BIG STUFF. I WAS THERE TO SAVE A LITTLE TIME. I FEEL GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU, IF I DIDN'T FEEL GREAT, I WOULDN'T BE RANTING AND RAVING TO 22,000 PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. SO I GET BACK IN AND NOW IT'S A SHORT DRIVE. WE ARRIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I HEARD THAT THEY SAID, IT CAME OUT IN THE MEDIA, INCLUDING SOME OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT. IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS USED TO BE. YOU KNOW THE ACADEMY AWARDS? THEY WERE BIG UNTIL THEY HAVE STARTED HITTING US. NOW THEY HAVE GONE DOWN THE TUBES. LOOK AT ALL THOSE LIGHTS BACK THERE. BUT I'M GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND SOMEBODY SAYS, ARE YOU OK? I SAID, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I GO A FEW FEET FURTHER AND ANOTHER SECURITY, SIR, ARE YOU OK? I SAID, YES, I'M FINE. WHAT'S WRONG? NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED ME THAT. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE. THE MILITARY, THE SECRET SERVICE. THEY ARE THE GREATEST. BUT THEY DON'T EVER SAY, SIR, ARE YOU OK? I COULD SEE HE WAS TROUBLED. HE LIKES ME, YOU KNOW? I WALK ANOTHER FEW FEET, SIR, I HOPE YOU'RE OK. WHAT IS GOING ON? AND THEN THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. NOTHING TO JOKE ABOUT. THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. AND IT WASN'T TRUE. THEY KNEW WASN'T TRUE. SO WE HAD THE PEOPLE CALL. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. THEY ARE TOTALLY CORRUPT PEOPLE. THEY SAID IT'S UNTRUE. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN FROM A MASSIVE, UNBELIEVABLE HEART ATTACK -- IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO DO. THE WORLD -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE REST OF THE WORLD AND LEADERS LIKE AND RESPECT YOUR PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS. IT'S VERY SAD. INSTEAD, THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN A INSTEAD, THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN A NOTCH. THEY SAID, HE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL. IT'S TRUE, I DIDN'T WEAR A TIE. WHY WOULD I WEAR A TIE? THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT. SHOW US YOUR GORGEOUS CHEST. WE WANT TO SEE. WE'VE NEVER SEEN A TEST QUITE LIKE IT. SERIOUSLY, WHY WOULD I PUT ON A TIE? WE ARE THERE IN 20 MINUTES AND I TAKE IT OFF. IT'S A PHYSICAL. PEOPLE SAID, HE WASN'T WEARING A TIE WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME. MAYBE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. YOU NEVER APOLOGIZE. THEY SAID, HE WASN'T WEARING A TIE. IT'S A SIGN OF A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. WE CALLED OFF AND OUR PEOPLE DID A GOOD JOB. SCREAMING, HERE -- HE'S FINE, NOTHING HAPPENED. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO TREMENDOUS CHEST PAINS. HE HAD CHEST PAINS. ONE OF THEM SAID, THEY WERE TREMENDOUS. TREMENDOUS. THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME. AND THEN THEY SAID, A LITTLE BIT LATER, HE IS STAYING OVER IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY KNEW I CAME BACK. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY SAW ME GOT INTO THE CAR. THEY SAW STEVE. -- SAW US LEAVE. THEY SAID I STAYED AT THE GREAT WALTER REED HOSPITAL. SO, WE SAID, NO, THE CHEST PAINS AREN'T TRUE. THEY KEPT ON REPORTING IT. WE COULDN'T GET THEM TO STOP. THEY ARE CORRUPT, CROOKED. WE COULDN'T GET THEM TO STOP. THEY ARE CORRUPT, CROOKED. WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. WE HAVE A VERY DISHONEST PRESS. ON MONDAY, I FLEW TO TEXAS. I OPENED UP AN APPLE COMPUTER PLANT. THEY MAKE THE NEW, BEAUTIFUL MAC THEY MAKE THE NEW, BEAUTIFUL MAC WHATEVER. I MET WITH TIM COOK AND DID LOTS OF WORK. IT'S A LONG FLIGHT. I GOT BACK MANY HOURS LATER, IT WAS LATE NIGHT. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I JUST SET A RECORD. YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE, THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. NOW, A DAY LATER, I'M TRAVELING TO TEXAS TO OPEN UP THIS BIG PLANT. I DON'T KNOW. NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DONE THAT ONE BEFORE. SO, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAD A GREAT TWO WEEKS WATCHING THESE CROOKED POLITICIANS NOT GIVING US DUE PROCESS. NOT GIVING US LAWYERS. NOT GIVING US THE RIGHT TO SPEAK. AND DESTROYING THEIR WITNESSES. IT FELL APART. THOSE WERE THERE WITNESSES. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED ANY RIGHTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WE HAD NO RIGHTS. DESPITE THAT, WE WON. IF YOU READ THE CROOKED "NEW YORK TIMES," IF YOU READ "THE WASHINGTON POST," A HORRIBLE PAPER, WE DON'T HAVE IT ANYWHERE IN D.C. ANYMORE. WE DON'T DELIVER IT OR GIVE IT. WE USED TO BUY IT. I ENDED IT IN THE NATION. I WANT THEM TO GET CORRECT NEWS, NOT FAKE NEWS. BUT THERE BAD PEOPLES. SO WHAT HAPPENED -- BUT THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. SO WHAT HAPPENED, WE KEEP WINNING, WE WON THESE LAST TWO WEEKS SO SOLIDLY. IF YOU PICK UP THE NEW YORK TIMES, THIS CRAZY WASHINGTON POSTPOST. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT GO ON. IT PROBABLY WILL, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE NUTS. I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD THING FOR US AS A PARTY. IT WILL WALK US THROUGH THE CRAZY ELECTION, WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE ALREADY. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS. I WANT TO HAVE ONE UP ON THE STAGE, BUT THEY ARE STARS, WARRIORS LIKE THOSE THREE GUYS WE HELPED OUT, WARRIORS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR YOUR PRESIDENT AND YOUR COUNTRY. THEY LOVE THE STATE OF FLORIDA, CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ. THE MAN I JUST WATCHED LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION. HE WAS FANTASTIC. HE WAS FANTASTIC. CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL LONG. BILLY POSEY, A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT FIGHTER. COME UP, BILLY. GUS BILIRAKIS. GUS, COME ON UP. AND A MAN WHO IS AN INCREDIBLY BRAVE GUY COME A FRIEND OF MINE, SOMEBODY WHO HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AND LOVES THIS STATE. BRIAN MAST. I WANT TO INTRODUCE A FRIEND OF ALL OF OURS WHO RAN A FRIEND OF ALL OF OURS WHO RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN, WON EASILY, DESPITE A LOT OF CROOKED STUFF GOING ON WITH THOSE VOTING MACHINES. TRUE. HE BETTER NOT BE MORE POPULAR IN FLORIDA THAN ME. HERE'S A QUICK ONE. HERE'S A QUICK STORY. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT. WHAT THE HELL? RON HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE THEY WOULD HAVE TWO OR THREE JOBS. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR JOB. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, IF YOU ARE NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME GETTING UP THE MORNING, ALL YOU DO IS FIND A NEW JOB. YOU WILL GET MORE MONEY, MOST LIKELY. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SO SET. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFUL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT NOW. NEVER EVEN CLOSE. THE STATE HAS NEVER HAD THIS SUCCESS. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. RICK SCOTT IS NOW YOUR SENATOR. HE'S FANTASTIC. MARCO RUBIO, A GREAT GUY. WE HAVE TWO GREAT GUYS. MARCO AND RICK. TWO GREAT GUYS. THEY LOVE THE STATE. THE MEDIAN INCOME UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH ROSE $400 OVER AN EIGHT YEAR TIME. THINK OF THIS. EIGHT YEARS, $400. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, IT ROSE $975. YOU HAVE 400, 8 YEARS. 975, 8 YEARS. UNDER TRUMP, IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS, IT ROSE $5,000. BUT THAT'S 5000, RIGHT? NOW YOU CAN ADD TO THE $5,000. TAX CUTS, REGULATORY CUTS, AND ENERGY SAVINGS. WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. WE CAN ADD ANOTHER $5,000. IT'S $400, $975, AND LESS THAN THREE YEARS, $10,000 MEDIAN INCOME. NOBODY'S GOING TO BEAT THAT. NOBODY'S GOING TO BE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS UNTAPPED POTENTIAL. WE ENDED THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CLOSE IT UP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WILL USE. LITTLE TINY WINDMILLS. THE BIG ONES KILLED TOO MANY BIRDS. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT DEMOLISHED ONE IN FOUR -- THE NUMBER IS NOW GREATER THAN THAT. FLORIDA MANUFACTURING JOBS, YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND. YOU WILL NEVER BRING IT BACK. YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND. AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE, AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE IN THE WTO, THE WTO. FOR YEARS, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR POLITICIANS TOOK MONEY FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS TO SHIP YOUR JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THEIR CAMPAIGN COFFERS GOT FULL. THE LIVES OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WERE DESTROYED. ALL THESE COMPANIES LEFT YOU WITH THE JOBS, THEY LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING. YOU ARE HAVING THE GREATEST YEAR IN FLORIDA. A DOCTOR, PLEASE. DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE, PLEASE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU OK? YOU LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY TO ME, I'LL TELL YOU. THANK YOU. GET A LITTLE WATER OR SOMETHING. IN THE OLD DAYS, WE USED TO SHARE WATER. TODAY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO MUCH. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN FOR A LONG TIME. MAYBE EVER. NO MORE PUTTING OUR COUNTRY SECOND, THIRD, 20TH, 30TH. WE PUT AMERICA FIRST NOW. WE PUT IT FIRST. THANKS TO OUR STEEL TARIFFS, STEEL MILLS ARE NOW FIRING BACK UP ACROSS THE NATION. THEY ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL, INCLUDING A BRAND-NEW $240 MILLION INVESTMENT IN POLK COUNTY. GOOD PLACE. WE ARE REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, IF NANCY PELOSI WILL EVER SIGN IT AND SEND IT. WE ARE WAITING, FOR MONTHS. USMCA IS AN INCREDIBLE AGREEMENT. EVERYBODY WANTS IT. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY A VICTORY. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SHE WILL PUT IT. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS MOVE IT FORWARD. IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST DEALS EVER. AT A CERTAIN POINT, CANADA AND MEXICO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MANY MONTHS. THEY WILL SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT. SHE HAS TO SIGN IT. EVERYBODY WANTS IT. SHE HAS TO PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. HAVE TO PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. IT'S A TREMENDOUS WIN FOR FLORIDA FARMERS AND ALL FARMERS, FOR GROWERS AND RANCHERS FROM ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. YET SHE AND THE DEMOCRATS JUST HAVE DONE NOTHING. THEY ARE DOING NOTHING, FOLKS. THEY ARE DOING NOTHING. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. CONGRESSWOMAN RECURSIVE PAL COME AWAY SHE? CONGRESSWOMAN SHALALA. I KNOW HER WELL, NEW YORK. GET HER TO PUT IT UP. NANCY IS ON TRACK TO GO DOWN AS THE SINGLE WORST AND LEAST PRODUCTIVE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BEFORE MY ELECTION, OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AS A PIGGY BANK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PROJECTS. IT'S ALL OVER THE GLOBE. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. THEY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY USED OUR MILITARY TO DEFEND IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS, SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY. THEY SPEND TRILLIONS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BY THE WAY, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE ARE WINNING AND PULLING THEM BACK. A LOT OF FOLKS REPORTING TODAY, WE ARE DOING GREAT. WE DEFEATED ISIS, JUST A YOU UNDERSTAND. WE DEFEATED 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE. WHEN WE SEE THEM FORMING, WE GO IN AND GET THEM. OUR MILITARY IS UNSURPASSED. THEY DID THIS WHILE OUR CITIES AT HOME FELL INTO DECAY AND DISREPAIR. WE SPENT $8 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND WE WANT TO FIX A ROAD OR A HIGHWAY OR A SCHOOL, IT IS NOT EASY TO GET THE MONEY, BUT WE ARE GETTING IT DONE ANYWAY. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. IT IS ABOUT TIME. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. AS LEADERS TRANSFORM FARAWAY NATIONS INTO BLOODSOAKED WAR ZONES, THEN DEMAND AMERICANS ACCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION INTO THOSE TERRITORIES. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT ALLOW OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO BE USED AGAINST US. I WILL NOT ALLOW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS TO PUT OUR FAMILIES IN DANGER AND OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK. WE WON'T DO IT. TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM THESE GRAVE THREATS ABROAD, I IMPLEMENTED THE TRAVEL BAN. AND I JUST HEARD TODAY BY THE FAKE NEWS THAT THE TRAVEL BAN FAILED IN COURT. IT WON THE SUPREME COURT. WHAT THEY MEANT, IN AN EARLIER COURT, IT LOST. THEY SAID, HE LOST IN COURT ON THE TRAVEL BAN. THAT IS RIGHT, IN THE EARLY COURT. THEN I LOST AT THE APPELLATE DIVISION, THEN I WON AT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT. THEY FORGOT TO TELL YOU THE LAST PART. SO WE ARE KEEPING TERRORISTS, WE ARE KEEPING CRIMINALS AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE DOING GREAT ON THE BORDER. WE ARE DOING GREAT ON THE BORDER. ON NO ISSUE HAVE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS THAN IMMIGRATION. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WANTS OPEN BORDERS, WHICH IS A BETRAYAL OF EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER WHO WANTS DEADLY DRUGS TO BE KEPT OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. FIGURE THIS ONE. THEY WANT SANCTUARY CITIES, LET THE CRIMINALS GO IN. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, LET PEOPLE POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE. AND THEY WANT HIGHER TAXES. ALL MY LIFE I GREW UP, AND I HAD GREAT INTEREST IN POLITICS, FORTUNATELY FOR YOU. I SAID, GEE, THEY ARE GOING TO LOWER TAXES. GOOD. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND HAVE OPEN BORDERS. I DON'T THINK THAT PLAYS WELL. WHAT DO I KNOW? THE THREAT IS TO EVERY CHILD WHOSE SCHOOL IS UNDER SIEGE FROM THESE HORRIBLE GANGS THEY WOULD ALLOW IN, LIKE MS-13. WE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS-13 GANG MEMBERS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE BELIEVE ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING WONDERFUL LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ARE ENTITLED TO AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PUTS THEIR NEEDS FIRST. WE WANT TO LET PEOPLE COME IN, BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MERIT. BUT THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, BORDER PATROL, I.C.E, LAW ENFORCEMENT -- INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 70% SINCE MAY, AND THE WALL IS GOING UP FASTER THAN ANYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. THAT WASN'T EASY. GETTING THAT WASN'T EASY. THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GIVE ME ANYTHING, ANY MONEY, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS FOR ANYTHING, EXCEPT THE WALL. THE ONLY REASON THEY DO NOT WANT THE WALL IS BECAUSE I WANTED IT. THEY ALWAYS SAY I NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR A MISTAKE, BUT I DID. I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NOT BUILD A WALL, AND THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO BUILD THE WALL. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? WE ARE REMOVING ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AT A PACE NEVER DONE BEFORE. DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. ARE YOU OK? OKAY. DOCTOR, PLEASE. THANK YOU. HE IS STRONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTOR, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FELLAS. GREAT. DON'T FORGET, THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STANDING FOR 2.5 DAYS. THAT'S A LOT. THANK YOU. COME ON BACK IF YOU ARE FEELING WELL, OKAY? THAT IS THE MAN I ASKED A QUESTION TO BEFORE, AND HE GAVE ME A GOOD ANSWER. YOU COME BACK WHEN YOU ARE FEELING BETTER, OKAY? COME BACK. TOUGH GUY. THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU. FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT A GREAT JOB. THEY ARE RIGHT ON THE BALL, OUR PEOPLE. AMAZING. THANK YOU. BRING HIM BACK AS SOON AS HE FEELS BETTER. DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE, BORDER PATROL SEIZED 7000 MORE POUNDS OF DEADLY DRUGS THAN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. SEIZURES OF HEROIN WERE UP. THE FAR LEFT'S IN PLACE OF SANCTUARY CITIES DEMONSTRATES THEIR DISDAIN FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS. SANCTUARY CITIES HAVE ADOPTED A POLICY OF LAWLESS ANARCHY, AIMED AT INNOCENT CIVILIANS. THEY DELIBERATELY RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ONTO OUR STREETS, OUT OF OUR JAILS. IT IS CRAZY. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE CITIZENS SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES TO LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. IN THE DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE RAISED THEIR HAND AND PLEDGED TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE HEALTH CARE, COURTESY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I WILL NEVER ALLOW DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND GIVE IT TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSS. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A DETERMINED TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY YOUR DOCTOR, EVISCERATE MEDICARE, AND PUT EVERY SINGLE SENIOR CITIZEN AT RISK. REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS SAFEGUARD MEDICARE FOR OUR CHERISHED SENIORS. ALWAYS. WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIANS. WHICH THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORT TO LOWER THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DRUG PRICES HAVE DECLINED IN OUR COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS. THINK OF THAT. BUT AS WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR GOVERNOR TO BRING DRUG PRICES DOWN EVEN MORE HERE IN FLORIDA AND OTHER STATES, IF THEY WANT IT -- IT IS WHAT RON SAID, WE ARE ALLOWING YOUR STATE TO BUY THE IDENTICAL DRUG, OFTEN MADE IN THE SAME FACTORY, FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE PRICES ARE 70% LOWER. THAT IS BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS ALL SCREWED UP. I SAY, GO TO CANADA TO BUY THEM. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DRUGS. WE ARE GIVING FLORIDA THE RIGHT TO BUY AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND REMEMBER THIS -- THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WE FORGOT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO IS THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES. I SAY MAYBE THE MILITARY, BECAUSE WITHOUT THE MILITARY, WE ARE NOT SO INTERESTED IN JUDGES, RIGHT? I THINK THE MILITARY. BUT WE HAVE APPOINTED MORE THAN 160 FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING COURT OF APPEAL JUDGES, TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. AND WE WILL SOON HAVE 182, WHICH WILL BE A RECORD. WE ARE STRONGLY PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE WE WANT AMERICA TO HAVE THE CLEANEST AIR AND CLEANEST WATER ANYWHERE ON EARTH. HERE IN FLORIDA, AS I PROMISED, WE DELIVERED OVER HALF OF $1 BILLION TO FIX LAKE OKEECHOBEE. PRES. TRUMP: REMEMBER I KEPT SAYING WE ARE GOING TO DO IT? MUCH MORE THAN $500 MILLION. WE HAD IT FIXED. WE FIXED THE HERBERT HOOVER TAKE AND FIXED THE SYSTEMS IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES. WE DID THAT ALTOGETHER. THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING IT FOR YEARS. THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT IS FINISHED IN SOME CASES. ALMOST FINISHED. ALL OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN GOTTEN FOR FLORIDA. I SIGNED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING TO FIGHT RED TIDE AND OTHER TOXIC ALGAE. NOW RON HAS GOT THE MONEY HE WANTS, SO HE WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. $100 MILLION. TOGETHER WE WILL PRESERVE FLORIDA'S NATURAL MAJESTIC BEAUTY FOR EVERY GENERATION TO COME. WE ARE INVESTING OVER $2 TRILLION. THINK OF IT. UP TO $2.5 TRILLION IN OUR MILITARY, INCLUDING $200 MILLION FOR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. I LOVE THAT PANHANDLE. WOW. REMEMBER DURING THE ELECTION, THAT GREAT ELECTION NIGHT. 2016, WAS THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST EVENINGS EVER? PRES. TRUMP: AND FLORIDA WAS COMING IN SORT OF EVEN. WE ARE DOING WELL. A LITTLE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. FLORIDA WINS THE FIRST REALLY BIG STATE. EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. WE ARE PRETTY EVEN WITH CROOKED HILLARY. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HIT A THING CALLED THE PANHANDLE. IT WAS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. WE TAKE CARE OF THE PANHANDLE. WE LOVE THE PANHANDLE. WE ALSO SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE IN TAMPA. IN PANAMA CITY, WE ARE BUILDING BIG, BEAUTIFUL SHIPS FOR OUR INCREDIBLE COAST GUARD. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN TEXAS WITH THE HURRICANES, PUERTO RICO. THIS STATE WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE SIXTH BRANCH OF OF THE U.S. MILITARY, THE SPACE FORCE. PRES. TRUMP: THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO STOP IT, BUT I THINK WE ARE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. THAT IS THE NEW FRONTIER. YOU LOOK AT CHINA. YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA. IT IS ABOUT SPACE. WE ARE BEHIND. WE WILL NEVER BE BEHIND LIKE THAT AGAIN. SPACE FORCE. BRAND-NEW. I WITHDREW FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRES. TRUMP: I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S THROUGH CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. PRES. TRUMP: AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT DONE FOR 52 YEARS. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON JERUSALEM AND THE EMBASSY IN THE CAPITAL FOR MANY MANY PRESIDENTS. EVERYBODY SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO IT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. NEVER GOT DONE. WE HAVE A MAN WITH US TONIGHT, THE AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, AMBASSADOR DAVID FREEMAN. WHERE IS HE? DID I DO A GOOD JOB FOR ISRAEL, DAVID?  GREAT AMBASSADOR. GREAT SUCCESS STORY. HERE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, WE ARE CONFRONTING THE BRUTAL MENACE OF COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM. WE ARE PRESENTLY SUPPORTING THE GREAT PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. YOU KNOW THAT. AND FOR THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO IMPOSE THE HORRORS OF SOCIALISM ON OUR COUNTRY, I SAY TONIGHT, AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN TURNING BACK TO THE PAST OF AMERICAN DECLINE. WE WERE DECLINING. WE WERE NOT RESPECTED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE WERE NOT RESPECTED. EVERYONE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS GENTLEMAN SAID WE WERE FOR SALE. WE ARE NOT FOR SALE ANYMORE. BUT NOW WE ARE CONTINUING FORWARD TO A FUTURE OF AMERICAN STRENGTH AND DOMINANCE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOMINANCE -- LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING. NOBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO SEE THIS. AND AMERICAN PROSPERITY. IT IS A CHOICE WHETHER OUR COUNTRY IS RULED BY CORRUPT POLITICIANS. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THEY THINK IT IS EASY. THEY HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED FOR A LONG TIME, SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. OR WHETHER WE WILL BE RULED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. THEY DON'T WANT TO APPROVE LOOPHOLES. THEY DON'T WANT TO APPROVE ANYTHING. THEY WANT PEOPLE TO POUR IN TO OUR COUNTRY. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY BAD PEOPLE. WITH THE HELP OF OUR GOVERNOR AND GREAT CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS, WE WILL FIGHT TO GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS. THEY ARE COMING ALONG GREAT. WE JUST FINISHED OUR THE DEAL WITH JAPAN. WE JUST DID OUR DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. WE MADE THEM INTO GOOD DEALS, FAIR DEALS. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, THAT IS OK, WE WILL JUST TARIFF THE PRODUCT THAT POURS INTO YOUR COUNTRY. WE ARE ENACTING TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, "MADE IN THE USA." WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA WITHIN 10 YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WE NOW HAVE THE SCIENCE TO DO IT. AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED BEFORE MY ADMINISTRATION, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE? WHEN THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THAT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, I SAID I DID NOT KNOW THAT. THE DOCTORS SAID THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. THEY WILL END THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN 10 YEARS. WE WILL CHART A NEW ERA OF SPACE. WE WILL SOON LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON THE SURFACE OF MARS. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SHOOTING FOR. NASA IS DOING A GREAT JOB. WE HAVE SOME PRIVATE RICH GUYS. THEY LOVE ROCKET SHIPS. WE SAID, GO AHEAD, ELON, PLAY YOUR GAMES, JUST PAY US SOME NICE RENT, PLEASE. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE AND ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE, BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. WE WILL ALWAYS LIVE BY THE WORDS -- AND NOBODY WILL TAKE THEM AWAY -- NOBODY -- OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. NOBODY IS TAKING THEM AWAY. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED THE CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, LANDED MEN ON THE MOON, AND MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE TAKING IT BACK FROM SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION, AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION, UNDER GOD. OUR BEAUTIFUL AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. TRUE. WE WILL, TOGETHER, MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. THAT IS HAPPENING. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. THAT HAS HAPPENED. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN. THAT IS HAPPENING AND HAS HAPPENED. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

[APPLAUSE] IN MY BOOK. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYER. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR THIS INCREDIBLE CROWD. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET IN.

EVANGELICALS FOR TRUMP. [CROWD CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW HOW WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO. HARD TO BELIEVE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO, BUT THE NUMBERS WERE PHENOMENAL AND THE LOVE TODAY IS GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN MY REMARKS TODAY BY EXTENDING PROFOUND THANKS AND GRATITUDE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE BY FAR THE BEST AND GREATEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THERE IS NOBODY CLOSE. IN RECENT WEEKS, AMERICAN WARRIORS EXECUTED A DARING RAID THAT KILLED THE SAVAGE LEADER OF ISIS, AL BAGHDADI. HE WAS A DEPRAVED BUTCHER WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN HURT ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON. LAST NIGHT AT MY DIRECTION, THE UNITED STATES MILITARY EXECUTED A FLAWLESS STRIKE THAT TERMINATED THE TERRORIST RINGLEADER FOR RESPONSIBLE -- RINGLEADER RESPONSIBLE FOR GRAVELY WOUNDING AND MURDERING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS, AT LEAST, OF AMERICANS, QASSEM SOLEIMANI HAS BEEN KILLED AND HIS BLOODY RAMPAGE IS NOW FOREVER GONE. [APPLAUSE] HE WAS PLOTTING ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICANS, BUT NOW WE HAVE ENSURED THAT HIS ATROCITIES HAVE BEEN STOPPED FOR GOOD. THEY ARE STOPPED FOR GOOD. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, BUT HE WAS PLANNING A VERY MAJOR ATTACK, AND WE GOT HIM. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE A PEACELOVING NATION, AND MY ADMINISTRATION REMAINS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING PEACE AND HARMONY AMONG THE NATIONS IN THE WORLD. WE DO NOT SEEK WAR. WE DO NOT SEEK NATION BUILDING. WE DO NOT SEEK REGIME CHANGE. BUT AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NEVER HESITATE TO DEFEND THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU. [APPLAUSE] SO LET THIS BE A WARNING TO TERRORISTS. IF YOU VALUE YOUR OWN LIFE, YOU WILL NOT THREATEN THE LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS. [APPLAUSE] AMERICANS HAVE MANY BLESSINGS, BUT PERHAPS THE GREATEST AMONG THEM IS THE BLESSING OF BEING PROTECTED BY THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL AND VIRTUOUS MILITARY ON THE FACE OF GOD'S EARTH. THIS EVENING WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY MANY INCREDIBLE FAITH LEADERS, INCLUDING JUST A TERRIFIC MAN I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW, AND HIS WIFE. I DON'T KNOW, I THINK SHE MIGHT EVEN BE BETTER THAN HIM. JAMES AND SHIRLEY, WHERE ARE YOU JAMES? THANK YOU, JAMES. GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL. A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS ON TELEVISION BEFORE I KNEW HIM, AND HE KEPT SAYING, HE MIGHT NOT KNOW THE BIBLE AS WELL AS I DO ARE FRANKLY, AS WELL AS A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT HE IS A LEADER AND HE LOVES GOD, AND HE IS A GREAT CHRISTIAN, AND HE SAID, I WILL LOVE HIM AND WANT TO HIM TO DO A TERRIFIC JOB AND FRANKLY, I THINK I HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. ROBERT JEFFRESS, THANK YOU, ROBERT. I THINK I HAVE. SISSY LYNCH.

I WOULD LIKE TO THINK APOSTLE MALDONADO. WHAT A GREAT GUY. WHAT A GREAT GUY. WHAT A CROWD. I THINK I'M GOING TO COME TO US SUNDAY SERVICE ONE OF THESE DAYS. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF FUN. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WELCOMING US HERE TO L RAY JESUS CHURCH, THE LARGEST HISPANIC CONGREGATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE BEST IN OUR COUNTRY. GLAD TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY EXTERNAL HISPANIC AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS LIFTING OUR NATION TO CREDIT A HEIGHTS. THINGS ARE HAPPENING LIKE TO HAVE NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BEGIN THE NEW YEAR THAN HERE WITH MANY FRIENDS AND FAMILIES, PASTORS AND PATRIOTS WHO BELIEVE IN THE MAGISTRATE OF CREATION AND THE LOVE AND GRACE OF JESUS CHRIST. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IN 2016, EVANGELICALS OF A CHRISTIANS HELPED US, AND THEY WENT OUT. EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS WENT OUT AND THEY WORKED HARD AND PRODUCE NUMBERS LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND BASED ON WHAT PAUL A TOLD ME AND SISSY TOLD ME WE ARE GOING TO BLOW THOSE NUMBERS IN 2020. HI, CHARLIE. HI, CHARLIE. HE COULD BE A PASTOR, HE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD PASTOR. EVERY DAY SINCE, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING. WE REALLY HAVE ACHIEVED RESULTS NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THINGS WERE LOOKING BLEAK FOR A LONG. OF TIME, THINGS WERE LOOKING VERY BLEAK. EVEN A THING LIKE MIRACLES WHERE ICE TO GO AND RUN INTO SUMMER AND I WOULD SAY WE ARE GOING TO SAY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO SAY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. AND NOW THEY ARE ALL STAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN, RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] YOU GO TO THESE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES THREE YEARS AGO, FOUR YEARS AGO AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE SNOW AND THE RED AND THE WHITE AND THEY WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING. BUT THEY WOULD NOT TAKE CHRISTMAS. I WOULD SAY WHERE IS MERRY CHRISTMAS? AND THEY WOULD SAY WE CANNOT SAY IT. THEY ARE ALL SAYING IT AGAIN. THEY ARE SAYING IT PROUDLY. [APPLAUSE] EVANGELICALS, CHRISTIANS OF EVERY DENOMINATION AND BELIEVERS OF EVERY FAITH, HAVE NEVER HAD A GREATER CHAMPION, NOT EVEN CLOSE, IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAN RIGHT NOW AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IN ANY OTHER WAY OTHER THAN JUST LOOK AT THE RECORD BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. TOGETHER WE ARE NAUGHTILY DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS BUT WE ARE DEFENDING RELIGION -- WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE. WINNING. BUT WE CANNOT LET ONE OF OUR RADICAL FRIENDS COME IN HERE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE WILL BE GONE IN SHORT ORDER, THEY CAN TAKE IT AWAY QUICKLY, IT IS A POWERFUL POSITION. A SOCIETY WITHOUT RELIGION CANNOT PROSPER, A NATION WITHOUT FAITH CANNOT ENDURE, BECAUSE JUSTICE, GOODNESS AND PEACE CANNOT PREVAIL WITHOUT THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL. [APPLAUSE] FOR AMERICA TO THRIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, WE MUST RENEW FAITH AND FAMILY AS THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LIFE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THESE BLIPS ARE OUTDATED BUT WE KNOW THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE. OUR TRADITIONS AND OUR VALUES ARE TIMELESS. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING. RIGHT? THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE MISSING. OUR FAITH IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. WHILE CERTAIN FADS COME AND GO, IT IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH THAT FAITH AND FAMILY LEAD TO THE STABILITY HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY OF NATIONS. YET AS WE SPEAK, EVERY CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS TRY TO PUNISH RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS AND SILENCE OUR CHURCHES AND OUR PASTORS. WELL, WE CAN SMILE BECAUSE WE ARE WINNING. WE CAN SMILE. I WILL LET YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A PROBLEM, I WILL LET YOU KNOW, I MAY COME BACK AND SAY GET OUT. VOTE EVERYTHING A ONE OF YOU, BUT I WILL SAY THAT ANYWAY. OUR OPPONENTS WANT TO SHUT OUT GOD FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE TO IMPOSE AN EXTREME ANTIRELIGIOUS SOCIALIST AGENDA. I'VE BEEN WATCHING. I HAVE WATCHING. I FEEL IT IS MY OBLIGATION, MY JOB. I GOTTA WATCH P I CANNOT DO IT. I CANNOT GET THROUGH. I DID ONCE. THE FIRST ONE. I SAID I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. I MEAN, BETO, REMEMBER BETA? HE COMES FROM TEXAS AND HE WAS SUPPOSED BE A GOOD. REMEMBER HE SAID I WAS PUT ON EARTH TO DO THIS. TO DO WHAT, TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT? HE GOT OUT AT ZERO. TO YOUR WHEN BETO, AND I AM ATTACKING HIM ONLY BECAUSE HE IS GONZO, DO YOU EVER WHEN BETO ESSENTIALLY SAID HE IS AGAINST RELIGION? AGAINST GUNS? AND AGAINST OIL? AND HE COMES FROM TEXAS. ABRAHAM LEAKING CANNOT WIN IN TEXAS WITH THOSE THREE THINGS. NO BIBLE, NO GUNS, NO OIL. I COME FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS, I DON'T THINK SO. BUT HE IS GONE. CAN I TELL YOU. BUT YOU HAVE WORSE. YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE FOR RELIGION. LOOK AT ALL THIS PEOPLE WITH THE RED HATS ON. YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT -- TO MOBILIZE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR LAND, ON NOVEMBER 3, 2020, WE ARE GOING TO WIN ANOTHER MONUMENTAL TREE FOR FAITH AND FAMILY, GOD AND COUNTRY, FLAG AND FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE RADICAL AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. AND HOLD THE SENATE AND OF COURSE KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IF WE TAKE BACK THE HOUSE AND YOU SEE HOW CRAZY THIS IS, THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY, THERE'S NO CRIME, NO NOTHING. I SAID READ THE TRANSCRIPTS, THEY DO NOT WANT TO READ THEM. NEVER HAPPENED. ANYTHING LIKE THIS, THEY COULDN'T BE TO. THINK OF HOW BAD IT IS. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. AND WE DO NOT LOSE ONE REPUBLICAN VOTE. WE GAINED THREE DEMOCRATS. AND ONE OF THEM LEFT THE PARTY AND BECAME A REPUBLICAN. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] 196 TO NOTHING. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT? THE REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING TOUGH, IT IS GOOD AND THE SENATE, THE SAME THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I HOPE. THIS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE SENATE, WE HAVE GREAT, GREAT SUPPORT. BUT WE HAVE SUPPORT BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF A TERRIBLE HOAX PERPETRATED ON OUR COUNTRY LIKE NO HOAX EVER. FROM THE DAY I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR. FROM THAT DAY. AND THOSE THAT SAVING BEFORE THAT DAY, I HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM. BEFORE ELECTION, RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS WERE UNDER ASSAULT, SO MANY LEADERS HERE. FAITH-BASED SCHOOLS, CHARITIES, HOSPITALS, DOPSON AGENCIES, BUSINESS OWNERS, PASTORS, OR SYSTEMATICALLY TARGETED. IN ORDER TO ABANDON RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. DAD TOOK OFFICE GOT SWORN IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WAR ON RELATION CAME TO AN ABRUPT END -- SORE ON RELIGION CAME TO AN ABRUPT END. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKE DECISIVE ACTION TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. AS I PROMISED IN THE CAMP, WITH STOPS THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT, TO TAKE AWAY TAX-EXEMPT STATUS AND LIBERATE OUR PARTNERS BY GETTING RID OF THIS JOHNSON AMENDMENT. I COULD TELL YOU BRIEF STORY, SHOULD I? I AM IN TROUBLE TOWER, RUNNING -- IN TROUBLE TOWER -- TRUMP TOWER, RUNNING. HE SAID I'VE BEEN IN NINE RACES AND 17 OF THEM -- AND ONE SEVEN OF THEM. I'M IN THE OFFICE WITH 50 FAITH LEADERS, PAULO IS THERE, SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE WERE THERE, THAT'S RIGHT. I KNEW THEY LIKED ME. WE WERE AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE 60TH FLOOR LOOKING DOWN. I SAID, OK, LET'S TALK TURKEY. I WOULD LIKE YOUR ENDORSEMENT. THEY LOOKED AROUND AND THERE IS GREAT LOVE BUT A LOOK ROUND AND SAID WE CANNOT DO THAT. I WAS SHOCKED. YOU KNOW IN 70 LIKES YOU, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW WHEN 70 DOESN'T LIKE YOU, I KNOW ABOUT THAT TOO. WE HAD A GREAT FEELING. IN THEIR I SAID WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? THEY SAID WE CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT AND IF WE GO POLITICAL, IF WE ENDORSE SOMEBODY OR IF WE EVEN SPEAK STRONGLY, AND YOU ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO HEAR FROM, THEY'RE NOT MANY, BUT YOU'RE THE PEOPLE I AND ALL OF THESE FOLKS WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU, IF WE GO AND START TELLING PEOPLE WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO DO, THEY WOULD TAKE AWAY OUR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS AND OUR CHURCHES IN MANY CASE GOODS GO OUT OF BUSINESS. IT IS SO HARSH. I SAID YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. I NEVER HEARD OF THAT. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. AND ACTUALLY LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW MANY PEOPLE DOWN ON FIFTH AVENUE. THEY LOOK LIKE ANTS. SO MANY OF THEM. BUT THEY ARE SO SMALL WHEN YOUR HIGH. -- WHEN YOU ARE HIGH. THAT MEANS ANY PERSON DOWN THERE HAS MORE POWER AND MORE TO SAY EVEN TO THE PUBLIC THEN YOU DO. AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE I WANT TO HEAR FROM. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS. WE HAD A SECOND MEETING TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE SAME PLACE, THE SAME PEOPLE, EVEN MORE. I SAID, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM. YOU CANNOT SPEAK UP BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT AND WE DID. IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT THROUGH AND MAKE IT PERMANENT. [APPLAUSE] AFTER A CERTAIN. OF TIME, WHETHER 16 YEARS OR 20 YEARS OR 24, BOY THAT IS A LOT OF PRESS BACK THERE, LIKE ACADEMY AWARDS. BEFORE THEY STARTED SPEAKING BADLY OF US. I DO THAT ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE, THIS WACKY GUY ON TELEVISION. HE IS DOING AN INTERVIEW, BIG SHOW.

NO NO, WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT HIM HARD, THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE, NO KNOW HE IS GOING TO WAIT, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO, AND AFTER FOUR YEARS HE'S NOT LEAVING, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT, HE IS STAYING IN ANYTHING LONGER. I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING BUT HE WAS SERIOUS. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M ONLY KIDDING BACK THERE. I SAID 12 YEARS, 16 YEARS, 20 YEARS, IT CRIES THEM CRAZY. BUT THEY DRIVE US CRAZY. DISHONEST PEOPLE. MAY BE MORE HONEST IN THIS GREAT CHURCH DO THINK SO, PASTOR? MAYBE WILL GET A GOOD SHAKE. BUT I DOUBT IT. THINK OF IT, WE HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT MEDIA SO WE HAVE ONE PARTY AGAINST US. AND MAY ONE.

AND THE WHOLE PLACE GOT IT. EVEN PEOPLE THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH US. THEY ALL GOT IT. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT. THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED, THAT CAME OUT. THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING I THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE. IT JUST CAME OUT. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT.

ABOVE ALL ELSE WE KNOW THIS, IN AMERICA, WE DO NOT WORSHIP GOVERNMENT, WE WORSHIP GOD. [APPLAUSE] SADLY, SINCE 2016, AND YOU SEE THIS, IS THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. IF YOU REMEMBERED DURING THOSE DEBATES, HE SAY HE WILL NOT ADHERE TO THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, LECTURING ME. I SORT OF SET I WOULD, MAYBE I COULD BEEN STRONGER ON. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY. THAT'S THE GAME. AND SHE TURNED OUT TO BE THE ONE THAT US AND ACCEPTED. BUT IT WAS SORT OF INCREDIBLE. SINCE 2016, A RELENTLESS CRUSADE AGAINST CHRISTIANS AND AMERICANS OF ALL FAITH AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, THE INTOLERANT CAMPAIGN AGAINST RELIGION, LOOK AT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS WE HAVE TAKEN OFF, LOOK AT MEXICO CITY, MEXICO CITY. DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD SEE THAT, MEXICO CITY? I DON'T THINK YOU EVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE THAT. DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE OF IS THAT IF HAVE WORKED TO REMOVE THE WORDS, SO HELP ME GOD, FROM THE OATH. RIGHT? HOW ABOUT THAT? SO HELP ME GOD. IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] NOT HAPPENING. NOT AS LONG AS I'M HERE. NOW SOMEBODY ELSE, I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM. THEY DON'T EVEN TRY, THEY HARDLY TRY. BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. NEW YORK STATE PASSED A LAW THAT REQUIRES FAITH ORGANIZATIONS TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT WROTE OPPOSE THE RELIGIOUS VALUES. WEEKS AGO THE ACLU, THAT IS A GROUP OF BEAUTIES, FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THAT TENNESSEE COUNTY AREA, THIS BEAUTIFUL AREA IN TENNESSEE, I LOVE TENNESSEE. FOR ALLOWING PRAYER IN SCHOOLS.

HE PRETENDED HE WAS MICHAEL JACKSON BUT NOBODY CAN MOONWALK LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON. [LAUGHTER] AND HE WANTED TO TRY. TO SHOW THAT HE WAS REALLY TELLING THE TRUTH. AND HIS LIFE SAVED HIM. NOT BY MUCH. BUT SHE SAID DO NOT DO IT. DO NOT DO IT BECAUSE NOBODY BUT MICHAEL CAN DO IT. YOUR MEMBER WHAT HE SAID, RIGHT? HE SAID YOU HAVE THE BABY AND YOU TALK TO THE MOTHER AND THEN YOU MAKE A DETERMINATION. ON WHETHER NOT TO EXECUTE. THIS IS AFTER THE BABY IS BORN. SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT. SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HAD BUT I HAD NEVER KNOWN THAT EXISTED. BUT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS. AND HE SAID IT STRONGLY. BY THE WAY, IF HE WERE A REPUBLICAN, HE WOULD'VE BEEN OUT OF OFFICE. WHAT HE SAID. WHAT HE DID. TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SPENT PRO-LIFE VOTERS. AND WE IN THEIR PUBLIC PARTY PROUDLY WELCOME THESE VOTERS WITH WIDE OPEN ARMS AND WE HAVE MANY OF THEM COMING. STAND UP, THAT IS MY FRIEND. STAND UP. [APPLAUSE] HEH, THANK YOU, GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. SO MANY PEOPLE JOINING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND IT IS A DIFFERENT PARTY. IT IS BECOMING A PARTY OF THE WORKERS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC, ASIAN. VERY DIFFERENT PARTY. EVERY CHILD IS MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF GOD. THAT IS WHY I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE-TERM ABORTIONS [APPLAUSE] AS I SAID DURING MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE I REINSTATED THE MEXICO CITY POLICY. THE PEOPLE SITTING IN THESE ROWS HERE AT KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND CANNOT BELIEVE IT HAPPENED OTHERS DO NOT DO THAT. RONALD REAGAN DID TO A LESSER EXTENT. WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE DONE IT. WE ARE VICIOUS FINAL RULE TO PROHIBIT TITLE X FUNDING. [APPLAUSE] WE STOPPED FEDERAL FUNDING. FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH -- WE STOPPED FEDERAL FUNDING OF FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH WHICH EVER BUT HE FELT WAS SO IMPORTANT, THEY? YEARS -- WAS SO IMPORTANT, A BIG QUESTION MARK FOR YEARS.

WHO SAID THAT? STAND UP, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. FOR NEARLY 2.5 CENTURIES AGO, THE MOVEMENT FOR INDEPENDENCE BEGAN IN THE PULPITS OF AMERICAN CHURCHES. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT, THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW THAT IN MANY CASES BUT THAT IS THE WAY IT , WAS. THE MOVEMENTS TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND SECURE CIVIL RIGHTS STARTED IN THE CHURCHES. TODAY IN CHURCHES ALL ACROSS OUR LAND, BELIEVERS ARE DEFENDING OUR GOD-GIVEN FREEDOMS. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE PERSON HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOUR FAMILIES, TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND SHARE OUR MESSAGE OF NATIONAL RENEWAL. WE NEED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO HELP ENCOURAGE EVERY SINGLE CHURCH MEMBER TO GO OUT RIGHT NOW AND REGISTER TO VOTE. THAT IS A BIG, BIG DEAL.

SO DO WE HAVE ANY PACKER FANS HERE TONIGHT? [RAUCOUS CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE A GREAT QUARTERBACK THAT IS A GOOD GUY. AS WE BEGIN THE YEAR, THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, POVERTY IS PLUMMETING, CRIME IS FALLING, AND AMERICA IS THE ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN OUR HISTORY, OUR MILITARY HAS BEEN TOTALLY REBUILT, LET'S IMPEACH HIM. BUT WE HAVE CREATED 7 MILLION JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, INCLUDING MORE THAN ONE MILLION MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS. NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. AND WE WILL SOON BE REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, FRANKLY, WITH THE INCREDIBLE USMCA, CANADA, MEXICO. A GIANT VICTORY FOR WISCONSIN WORKERS, FARMERS, AND DAIRY PRODUCERS. A TREMENDOUS VICTORY. AND WE MAKE IT THAT ALL TAKING CARE OF THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK, IT JUST NEEDS ONE MORE VOTE AND WE WILL GET THAT OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE. THE REPUBLICAN SENATE WILL BE GREAT. TOMORROW WE WILL ALSO BE SIGNING OUR PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA, MASSIVELY BOOSTING EXPORTS OF PRODUCTS MADE AND PRODUCED RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO AFTER YEARS OF DEVASTATING DEFENSE CUTS, WE HAVE FULLY REBUILT THE UNITED STATES MILITARY TO APPOINT THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE, AND IT IS FAR MORE ADVANCED, MORE LETHAL, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LAST YEAR, OUR GREAT AMERICAN WARRIORS , BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE, AND THEY LOVE IT, THEY LOVE IT, THEY LOVE DOING THAT, THEY WOULD NOT TRADE PLACES WITH ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. [LAUGHTER] THEY WOULD NOT TRADE PLACES WITH ALL OF OUR GREAT WISCONSIN POLITICIANS, THEY WANT TO BE A MILITARY WARRIOR. AND WE DON'T WANT THEM FOR THAT, WE WANT THEM DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT OUR GREAT WARRIORS CARRIED OUT A DARING NIGHTTIME RAID AND TERMINATED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, THE ANIMAL KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD, AND THE WICKED CALIPHATE IS 100% DESTROYED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WILL TELL YOU , WHEN WE TOOK OVER A LITTLE LESS THAN THREE YEARS AGO, ISIS WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. NOW THE CALIPHATE IS 100% DESTROYED , YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WANTED TO LEAVE AND IT WAS AT 90%? I SAID SOME OF , LET SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES FINISH THEM OFF. THEY SAID NO, SIR, LET US FINISH THEM OFF, SO WE FINISH THEM OFF 100%. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A FEW DAYS AGO WE TOOK BOLD AND DECISIVE ACTION TO DEFEND AMERICAN LIVES AND DELIVER AMERICAN JUSTICE. AT MY DIRECTION, THE UNITED STATES MILITARY LAUNCHED A FLAWLESS PRECISION STRIKE THAT KILLED THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST, NUMBER ONE TERRORIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS , QASEM SOLEIMANI. THE NUMBER ONE TERRORIST. SOLEIMANI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WOUNDING THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND WAS ACTIVELY PLANNING NEW ATTACKS, BUT WE STOPPED HIM COLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FRANKLY, THEY ALREADY STARTED THE ATTACK, AS YOU SAW, IN BAGHDAD, ON OUR VERY LARGE EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD. THAT WAS ALREADY STARTED. I SAID TO OUR GENERALS, GET THERE NOW, WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER BENGHAZI ON MY WATCH OR ON ANY WATCH. THEY SAID SIR, WE WILL BE THERE TOMORROW, I SAID YOU HAVE TO BE THERE RIGHT NOW, GET THEM OVER THERE NOW. NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, THEY WERE SOLDIERS, IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CROWD, THAT WAS NOT PROTESTERS, THAT WAS SOLDIERS. THEY WERE SURROUNDING RA MISSY IN BAGHDAD, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SEE THESE , SURROUNDING OUR EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SEE THESE BEAUTIFUL NEW APACHE HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INTO THAN THEY SEE OUR GREAT MILITARY. YOU SAW THEM IN THE PLANE, RIGHT? SOME OF THEM WERE GETTING OUT OF THEIR PAJAMAS , I SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, WE WON'T PUT THAT ON. BUT THEY WERE SITTING THERE AND THEY WERE CALLING THE ROLL CALL IN THE PLANE AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. THESE GUYS WERE BETTER THAN TOM CRUISE. [SHOUTING] [BOOING] WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE WANTING TO GET IN AND THEY CAN'T BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE GOT HERE FIRST. SO HERE IS YOUR HEADLINE, TOMORROW, "PROTESTERS DISTURBED THE RALLY." ONE PROTESTER, A VERY WEAK VOICE. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, IF YOU PEOPLE WOULDN'T GO CRAZY EVERY TIME YOU SEE SOMETHING, YOU WOULD GO RIGHT THROUGH AND NOBODY KNOW , WOULD KNOW SHE WAS THERE. SHE HAS GONE HOME TO MOM, WHERE SHE WILL BE IN BIG TROUBLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE WILL BE VOTING FOR TRUMP TOO. I AM ONLY KIDDING. WE DRIVE THEM CRAZY. THEY SAY YOU KNOW HE IS NOT LEAVING, DON'T YOU? THEY SAY HE IS GOING TO WIN AND NEVER GOING TO LEAVE. IT IS CALLED TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, IT REALLY IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT IF FOR ANY REASON AFTER FIVE YEARS WE DO LEAVE, WHICH WE WILL, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THAT STUFF, RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR INDUSTRY? THEY WILL ALL DIE AND FOLD UP AND IT WILL BE VERY BORING OUT THERE, VERY BORING. THAT'S WHY I SAY AT SOME POINT, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WILL BE ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY PUT THIS BIG AMERICAN FLAG ON THE STREET, AND THE IRANIANS, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF IRANIANS, WERE SUPPOSED TO TRAMPLE IT AND BEAT THE HELL OUT OF IT AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WENT AROUND THAT FLAG. THEY LIKE TRUMP, THEY LIKE YOU. I AM JUST REPRESENTATIVE. THEY LIKE US. THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN A LONG TIME. DID YOU SEE IT? THEY WENT AROUND THE FLAG, THEY DID NOT WANT TO TOUCH IT, THEY LOVE AMERICA, THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS CALLED PROGRESS. [CHEERING] BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DISPARAGE WHAT WE DID WITH THE HIT ON THIS MONSTER. YOU KNOW, MANY OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN YOU SEE WALKING AROUND WITHOUT ARMS OR LEGS WERE DOWNED BY SOLEIMANI. THAT'S WHAT HE LOVED, THE ROADSIDE BOMB, THAT'S WHAT HE LOVED. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, ROADSIDE BOMBS, HE WAS THE KING OF THE ROADSIDE BOMB. GREAT PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE LEGS RIGHT NOW AND ARMS BECAUSE OF THIS SON OF A BITCH, OK? [CHEERING] AND THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE OUTRAGED BY SOLEIMANI'S EVIL CRIMES, NOT THE DECISION TO END HIS WRETCHED LIFE. THEY ARE SAYING HE WAS A GENERAL, HE WAS THIS, HE WAS THAT , NUMBER ONE, HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, HE WAS A DESIGNATED TERRORIST BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, AS USUAL. AS USUAL. [BOOING] HERE IS THE STORY WITH THE DEMOCRATS. IF I DIDN'T KILL HIM AND LET SAY WE LOST 3, 4, 5 EMBASSIES OR BASES FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OR TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED, THEY WOULD HAVE SAID TRUMP SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT. ANYTHING WE DO, THEY GO THE OPPOSITE, SO WE KILL HIM, AND THAT WAS PRECISION. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WENT MUCH TOO FAST. TOO FAST. SO WE KILL HIM AND THEY SAY WHAT A HORRIBLE , IF WE DID NOT KILL HIM, THEY WOULD SAY WHAT A HORRIBLE THING. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, YOU KNOW THAT? [CHEERING] BECAUSE YOU KNOW, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WELL, YOU KNOW THAT, YOU WILL SEE THAT, IT WILL WORK OUT. IT IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY. NOW THEY SAY HE IS BUILDING THE WALL, BUT MEXICO DID NOT , MEXICO WILL PAY. YOU WILL SEE THAT, IT WILL COME OUT. WE WILL DO IT SOMETIME DURING THE DEBATE, THE REAL DEBATE, THAT PEOPLE WILL WATCH. BECAUSE NOBODY IS WATCHING. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DOING GREAT ON THE DEBATES, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. BUT WE ARE BUILDING THIS WALL, WE ARE OVER 100 MILES RIGHT NOW. WE ARE GOING TO BE EXPANDING THE LIFE, YOU HAVE 1978 MILES, YOU NEED 500 MILES, BUT 700 WOULD BE GOOD, 750 OR SO WOULD BE GREAT. WE HAVE ALL OF THE FINANCING. YOU THINK IT IS EASY GETTING FINANCING , I COULD NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM, I COULD GET ANYTHING I WANTED IN TERMS OF MONEY EXCEPT A WALL AND I MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE. I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THEM, WE WILL NOT BUILD THE WALL, WE DON'T WANT THE WALL, THEY WOULD HAVE INSISTED WE BUILD IT AND WE WOULD'VE HAD ALL THE MONEY WE WANTED. I MADE A MISTAKE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I MADE A BIG MISTAKE. NOW WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, IT IS GOING UP, IT IS GOING UP RAPIDLY, AND VERY SOON WE WILL BE BUILDING ABOUT ONE MILE A DAY, AND WOULD SHOOT , AND WE SHOULD BE OVER 400 MILES BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER IT WILL BE FINISHED. IT IS ALREADY HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. BERNIE AND THE RADICAL LEFT CANNOT PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AND THEY CANNOT PROTECT OUR COUNTRY, NOR DO THEY WANT TO, I THINK. ACCORDING TO ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS WARREN , [BOOING] REMEMBER? WE HIT HER HARD, BUT I HIT HER TO EARLY, BUT SHE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. BUT BERNIE SAID , ACCORDING TO HER, BERNIE SAID , AND I DON'T BELIEVE THIS, I DON'T KNOW HIM, I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE HIM, HE IS A NASTY GUY, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE HE SAID THIS, IT'S NOT HIS DEAL VIEWED YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY. SHE SAID THAT BERNIE STATED STRONGLY THAT A WOMAN CANNOT WIN FOR PRESIDENT. FORTUNATELY , [LAUGHTER] THAT COULD HAPPEN, WHO KNOWS? BUT SHE SAID THAT BERNIE SAID A WOMAN COULD NOT WIN AND I DON'T BELIEVE BERNIE SAID THAT , NOT THE KIND OF THING HE WOULD SAY. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, JUST VOTE REPUBLICAN, WE ARE DOING SO WELL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE A GREAT TIME, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MORE PORTLY, WE GET THINGS DONE, WE ARE GETTING EVERYTHING DONE. BUT EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OWN FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, A HIGHLY RESPECTED GENERAL NAMED JIM JONES, PRAISE OUR ACTION TO TAKE OUT SOLEIMANI, AND SAID IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT THING TO DO. I AM SURE THEY LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE SOUNDS LIKE OUR KIND OF A GUY. IF THEY GIVE YOU A HARD TIME, COME OVER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE IS A RESPECTED GUY, HE SAID THEY DID THE RIGHT THING. HE SAID, WAS THE ATTACK IMMINENT? DOES THE FACT THAT HE HAS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND HORRIBLY KILLED AND WOUNDED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS , THAT DOESN'T MATTER. WAS THE ATTACK IMMINENT? I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO START A NEW INVESTIGATION, WAS THE ATTACK , BY THE WAY, HE WAS IN A COUNTRY HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE IN, WE DON'T MENTION THAT, BECAUSE HE WAS DESIGNATED HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE THERE. AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH, AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WEDDINGS AND WORKING OUT. [LAUGHTER] SO LAMANNA , SOLEIMANI INTO THE HEAD OF HAS THE LAW , HEZBOLLAH, TALKING ABOUT WEDDINGS AND, LIKE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE BACK OF THE AIRPLANE. [BOOING] THEY MAY HAVE SAID YOU COULD STAY ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR HELP, BUT , REMEMBER, THEY TALKED ABOUT GOLF AND GRANDCHILDREN, RIGHT? 45 MINUTES. YOU KNOW, I LIKE GOLF AND I LOVE MY GRANDCHILDREN, I DON'T THINK I COULD TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THEM FOR 45 MINUTES THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILD, HE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL, HE IS SO GREAT. OK, WHAT ELSE AM I GOING TO SAY? LET'S TALK ONE OR TWO, HOW IS TIGER DOING, THIS ONE, THAT ONE. THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THE OTHER 45 , 35 MINUTES? MAYBE I TALK ABOUT SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS, ETC. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. AT THIS MOMENT, THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IRAN ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS IN NUMBERS LIKE NOBODY HAS SEEN BEFORE AND THEY ARE REALLY PROTESTING THE REPRESSIVE REGIME AND THE A BETTER FUTURE. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE, THE GREAT PEOPLE OF IRAN, THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE, THEY GET IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE TIRED OF WATCHING THEIR LEADERS PLUNDER IRAN TO STOKE VIOLENCE AND DEATH AND WAR. IRAN HAS HAD THESE PROBLEMS FOR 40 YEARS. REAGAN HAD IT, IRAN-CONTRA, CARTER HAD A, 42 , 52 HOSTAGES. THAT DESTROYED , HE WAS DESTROYED BEFORE THAT, BUT IT DID NOT HELP, IT PROBABLY GOT REAGAN ELECTED. CARTER HAD IT, 52 HOSTAGES. REAGAN HAD IRAN-CONTRA. OBAMA HAD, HE WAS BEGGING THEM FOR EVERYTHING, BUT OBAMA GAVE $1.8 MILLION IN CASH. [BOOING] HE GOT ZERO OUT OF IT, HE GOT ZERO. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT MONEY BACK, IT IS A LOT OF MONEY. THE AYATOLLAH AND THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN, I WARNED THAT THEY MUST NOT HARM, HURT OR KILL ANY PROTESTERS. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING, IT IS WATCHING. [CHEERING] THEY HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS. WE SUPPORT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR COURAGEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM, IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE, IT REALLY IS. BUT WE ARE WATCHING, WE ARE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY. AND WE WERE READY. THAT NIGHT, WHEN THE ATTACK WAS MADE ON US, THE ATTACK WAS MADE ON US , REMEMBER THIS, THEY KILLED AN AMERICAN AND THEY KILLED OTHER PEOPLE JUST BEFORE THAT. SO WE DID WHAT WE DID, RIGHT? THEY SAID IT IS OUR TURN NOW. I SAID YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SAY IT IS OUR TURN, BECAUSE WE HAD DESIGNATED TARGETS , IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM 30 YEARS TO REBUILD IF THAT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [WHISTLING] WE SAW THOSE MISSILES LAUNCHED AND THEY WERE BIG AND FAST, AND THEY WERE ACCURATE. FOUR OF THEM WENT BAD, THEY FELL WAY SHORT, BUT 12 OF THEM HIT, AND I SAID MAN, THEY ARE QUICK, THEY KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THEY WERE, AND THEY SAW THOSE MISSILES HIT. BAD, THEY FELL WAY SHORT, BUT 12 OFI SAID, HOW BAD IS IT? THEY HIT A BASE, AND AN HOUR LATER OR SO, WE GET A CALL BACK AND I SAID, HOW MANY KILLED? NOBODY, SIR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND I SAID, THEY JUST SAVED THEMSELVES $1 TRILLION AND A LOT OF LIVES. IT IS TRUE. $1 TRILLION, NOT $1 BILLION, A TRILLION. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR REGIME CHANGE, THEY TRIED THAT WITH LIBYA. HILLARY CLINTON, LIST GET RID OF LIBYA, LET'S GET RID OF QADDAFI. HOW IS THAT WORKING OUT? RIGHT? LET'S GET RID OF QADDAFI, THERE WAS A HILLARY DEAL. THEN YOU HAD BEEN GAUZY. , BENGHAZI. THEY DID NOT RESPOND. [SHOUTING] THEN THEY WENT INTO IRAQ, THE GENIUSES GO INTO IRAQ, IRAQ DID NOT KNOCK DOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN CASE ANYBODY HAD ANY QUESTION. THIS GUY DID KILL , HE WAS NOT ATHIS GUY DID KILL , HE WAS NOT A SWEETHEART, HE WAS A BAD GUY IN EVERY WAY, BUT HE DID KILL TERRORISTS, RIGHT? AND IT BECAME HARVARD UNIVERSITY FOR TERRORISTS. BUT THEY DID GO AFTER HIM THAT HE DID NOT KNOCK DOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BAD THINKING. WE ARE DOING A GOOD JOB, WE ARE GETTING OUT, AND YOU DON'T , WE DID SOMETHING IN SYRIA, WE WERE GUARDING THE SYRIAN BORDER BETWEEN TURKEY AND SYRIA, IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR MANY YEARS UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. I SAID I AM GETTING OUR SOLDIERS OUT OF THERE, I DID, I TOOK THEM OUT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID WITH THE SOLDIERS? THEY DON'T TELL YOU THE TRUE STORY BECAUSE THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CORRUPT PEOPLE BACK THERE. [CHEERING] [BOOING] I TOLD TURKEY, YOU GOT TO DEFEND YOUR OWN BORDER, WE WILL NOT DEFEND YOUR BORDER. WE GET ALONG WITH TURKEY, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR , BY THE WAY, I CALL IT A SAFE ZONE. THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS SAISON IN THE WORLD. [LAUGHTER] , MOST DANGEROUS SAFE ZONE IN THE WORLD. [LAUGHTER] THERE ARE ABOUT THREE OF YOU WHO WANT TO BE THERE, YOU ARE VERY TOUGH PEOPLE. SOMEDAY IT MIGHT BE A SAISON BUT I TOOK OUR SOLDIERS OUT, BECAUSE WE HAD A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE AND THEY WERE GOING TO FIGHT. I SAID IF THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE THEY HAVE FOR HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS, CENTURIES, LET THEM FIGHT, BUT WE ARE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF THERE, OK? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T TELL YOU THE RIGHT STORY. BUT THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T TELL YOU THE RIGHT STORY. BECAUSE WHAT I DID IS I TOOK OUR SOLDIERS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID, I MOVED THEM TO THE OIL AREA AND WE NOW CONTROL THE OIL. SO THEY SAID TRUMP STATE IN SYRIA. PEOPLE SAID TO ME, WHY ARE YOU STAYING IN SYRIA? BECAUSE WE KEPT THE OIL. WHICH FRANKLY WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN IRAQ, OK? A LONG TIME AGO. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE THINGS AND THE DECISIONS I HAVE SEEN. THEY SAY TRUMP IS IN SYRIA, HE DID NOT PULL OUT , I DID PULL OUT. WE HAVE THE OIL REALLY SECURE AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT, WE CAN HELP OUR FRIENDS THE KURDS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY GOT THEIR WEALTH, AND ULTIMATELY IT WAS WITH ISIS, BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS WITH THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ALSO GOT RID OF REMNANTS OF ISIS. WHILE WE ARE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WASTING AMERICA'S TIME WITH DEMENTED HOAXES AND CRAZY WITCHHUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON, BY THE WAY, FROM THE DAY I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH OUR FUTURE FIRST LADY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SOMEBODY SAID TO ME RECENTLY, PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT, IT WAS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO USED TO CALL ME DONALD , DONALD, LET'S HAVE DINNER , NO HE CALLS ME PRESIDENT. I TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE. THEY ALWAYS CALL ME PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT, TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING, WHAT IS GOING ON, HOW IS IT ALL GOING? YOU ARE DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB. I SAID TO ME A FAVOR, CALL ME DONALD. I CAN'T. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, RESPECT FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. BUT THAT'S WHY THIS NOVEMBER, WE ARE GOING BACK AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX , IT IS A TOTAL HOAX , JUST THINK OF THIS, THIS IS BASED ON A PERFECT PHONE CALL. DID ANYBODY READ THE TRANSCRIPTS? IT IS A PERFECT CALL. IN FACT, IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT LYNDON JOHNSON, ALL OF THEM , YOU KNOW, LYNDON JOHNSON WAS A TOUGH GUY, CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS PHONE CALLS? HE IS PROBABLY LOOKING DOWN OR LOOKING UP , [LAUGHTER] AND HE IS IS PROBABLY SAYING THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY, THAT'S THE NICEST CALL , SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD BE SO NICE ON A TELEPHONE CALL. IT IS BASED ON A SIMPLE TELEPHONE CALL THAT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON US, THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS, THEY WANT TO IMPEACH. IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OVER A PERFECT PHONE CALL. IT IS THE GREATEST HOAX EVER PERPETRATED ON OUR COUNTRY, EVER. BUT WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK, AND BECAUSE OF IT, IT WAS CONSTANT , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN , INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND I THINK VOTERS INCLUDING DEMOCRATS MOVING OVER, WE JUST GOT 190 5-0, THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE. NANCY PELOSI SAYS IT MUST BE NONPARTISAN. AND SHE SAID IT HAS TO BE CLEAR-CUT. NUMBER ONE, NEVER HAPPENED, NO PROBLEM. NUMBER TWO, LOOK AT THE VOTE. THREE DEMOCRATS VOTED WITH US. SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT WAS A NONPARTISAN VOTE BECAUSE THEY VOTED WITH US. BUT WE ARE GOING BACK AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE SENATE AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE, WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A FRIEND OF MINE, A WORLD CHAMPION , HE CLIMBS, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? IS SEAN HERE? GET UP HERE, I LOVE CHAMPIONS. HE WOULD CLIMB THAT SUCKER, THE BEST OF THE WORLD, RIGHT HERE FROM WISCONSIN, RIGHT? CONGRESSMAN SEAN DUFFY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU MISS HIM. YOU KNOW HE SIGNED WITH CNN, THEY PAID HIM A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY DON'T PUT HIM ON. WHY? BECAUSE HE IS PRO-TRUMP. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS PAID HIM MONEY TO SILENCE HIM BECAUSE HE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT VOICE. [BOOING] I THINK HE IS OK WITH IT, HE GETS HIS CHECK, THEY REFUSED TO PUT HIM ON ANY SAYS GOOD THINGS ABOUT TRUMP, WE DON'T WANT YOU ON. THAT IS CNN RIGHT THERE, TURN THE CAMERA OFF. [BOOING] THANK YOU. THIS IS A GREAT GROUP OF REPUBLICAN PEOPLE, BUT MORE IMPORTANT, IT IS A GREAT GROUP OF WINNERS. THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT, THEY HAVE WORKED SO HARD, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE RAN A TOUGH CAMPAIGN IN WISCONSIN AND I WAS TIRED. I HAD TO TAKE SUNDAYS OFF. YOU KNOW WHO DID NOT TAKE ANY DAYS OFF? PRESIDENT TRUMP. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MAN WORK HARDER, BEING SO DEDICATED, SO IN LOVE WITH AMERICA, THAT IS WHY WE ALL NEED TO MAKE SURE HE WINS A SECOND TERM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM 64 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFETIME SEEN A MAN GET ELECTED PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WHERE THERE WASN'T SOME MEASURE OF WELL WISHES, SOME HONEYMOON PERIOD WHERE AMERICA GATHERED AROUND THAT INDIVIDUAL AND SAID MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS A BIG JOB AND WE WISH YOU WELL, KEEP US SAFE, MAKE THIS COUNTRY PROSPEROUS. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. THAT'S BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS SIMPLY WON'T ADMIT HE BEAT THEM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE HAS BEEN TORMENTED SINCE THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, BUT HE HAS HELD STRONG, IT HASN'T BOTHERED HIM, HE HAS JUST PRESSED FORWARD, HE HAS MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT, OUR ECONOMY IS IN GREAT SHAPE. HE DESERVES TO GET REELECTED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LIKE ALL OF YOU, LIKE ALL OF YOU, HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND WILL DO EVERYTHING TO DEFEND IT. WE LOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP, GOD BLESS YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, RON. A GREAT GUY. THANKS TO STRONG REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP LIKE RON, LIKE ALL THE YOU JUST SHOCK, AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN, AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN AND AMERICA IS THRIVING AGAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE ARE DOING GREAT. WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. AND UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE NOW HAVE THE LOWEST AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND IN YOUR GREAT STATE, WISCONSIN , YOU EVER NOTICE WITH BIDEN, HE IS ALWAYS CALLING THE WRONG STATE? IN YOUR GREAT STATE OF IOWA? IT IS WISCONSIN. I MEANT WISCONSIN, I DID NOT KNOW I WAS IN WISCONSIN. HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE DONE THAT? LOTS OF TIMES. GREAT TO BE IN THE STATE OF OHIO. NO SIR, YOU ARE IN FLORIDA. [LAUGHTER] MANY TIMES. THE SAD PART ABOUT , SLEEPY JOE IS RIGHT. WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU CAN'T REALLY RECOVER. YOU COULD BE WINSTON CHURCHILL AND MAKE THE FINEST REMAINDER OF REMARKS, BUT YOU CAN'T KILLED, AND HE DOES IT EVERY TIME. THE FAKE NEWS GIVES HIM A TOTAL PASS AND THAT IS OK, IT IS ALL RIGHT. [BOOING] IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ALL OF US SOMEDAY. DOES ANYBODY GET THAT YET? IN WISCONSIN, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW IS THAT FOR A SOUNDBITE? HOW DO YOU BEAT THAT SOUNDBITE, RIGHT? SO NOW THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN , THE STATE SET A RECORD, MOST SUCCESSFUL IN HIS EVER BEEN, AND BY THE WAY THAT'S BECAUSE WE GOT A LOT OF HELP FROM A GUY CALLED SCOTT WALKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] RON JOHNSON, ALL THOSE GUYS. IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN SO QUICKLY. HOW DO YOU BEAT THAT? YOU HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE YOU HAVE EVER HAD AND THEN SOMEBODY SAYS WE WILL DO A BETTER JOB. REALLY? THE LOWEST IN HISTORY BY FAR, NUMBER ONE ECONOMIC NUMBERS BY FAR, LET'S PUT SOME OF THE ELVES AND AS PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK SO, RIGHT? HERE'S THE ONE I LOVE THE MOST. AFRICAN, HISPANIC AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH, YOU KNOW IT WAS SO HIGH, IT WAS SO HORRIBLE. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW IN RECORDED HISTORY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE ONLY QUESTION, ARE YOU AT 70, 80, 90%, HIGHER? WHAT IS YOURS? 100%, NOT BAD. I KNOW WHO HE IS VOTING FOR. BUT THINK OF THIS, THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. THESE COMPANIES, THESE BIG PUBLIC COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE, BY EVERYBODY. THEY ARE OWNED BY RICH PEOPLE, AND EVERYBODY. WE HAVE SET 141 RECORDS ON THE STOCK MARKET, HIGHEST LEVELS EVER IN RECORDED HISTORY. 141 RECORDS. THAT MEANS IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS, FOR 141 DAYS, WE SET A RECORD. 141 RECORDS. WHO THE HELL COULD DO THAT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND IF OUR OPPONENTS HAD WON THE ELECTION , WE ARE CLOSE TO 30,000 ON THE DOW, NOBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS POSSIBLE INCLUDING THE FIGURES BACK THERE , THE FAKERS BACK THERE. I REALLY BELIEVE BECAUSE REGULATION SO IMPORTANT, TAX CUTS SO IMPORTANT, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF BEING UP MASSIVELY, WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS, BUT DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE CHANGES, IT'S WAY OVER 60, 70, 80, YOU GUYS KNOW. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN 50, 60, 70. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN AT A LEVEL , YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE EXTREMELY DEPRESSED RIGHT NOW. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT ALL OF THOSE BRAND-NEW "KEEP AMERICA GREAT" HATS. DON'T WORRY, WE ARE NEVER GETTING RID OF MAGA. WE DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO GET RID OF MAGA, THE GREATEST CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY. BUT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THOSE HATS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE MONEY, BUT NOW YOU CAN BUY THEM. LET'S DO IT REAL FAST , THE POLE, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR KEEP AMERICA GREAT? WE ARE GOING TO DO IT QUICK. READY? WHO LIKES MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. SO IT SURPRISES ME EVERY, SINGLE TIME, BUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, MAGA, HAS NEVER WON ONE OF THESE POLLS. BECAUSE WE HAVE CUT TAXES AND REGULATIONS, STOCK MARKET. WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH. THESE DEMOCRATS, THEY SPEND $1 MILLION ON A POLL. THEY WILL INTERVIEW 203 PEOPLE 203 PEOPLE WILL GET IT WRONG. BECAUSE I AM ALWAYS SURPRISED , MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN I THINK IS THE GREATEST PHRASE EVER USED IN POLITICS, RIGHT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO TO SWITCH IT MIGHT BE CRAZY, SO WE WILL USE THEM BOTH, WHAT DO YOU SAY? BUT UNDER THE TRUMP ECONOMY, THE LOWEST EARNERS ARE REAPING THE BIGGEST GAINS, YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT? THIS IS A BLUE-COLLAR BOOM. THEY DON'T LIKE TELLING YOU THAT. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, THE GROWTH AND NET WORTH FOR THE BOTTOM HALF OF WAGE EARNERS HAS INCREASED 15 TIMES MORE THAN UNDER THE THREE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. THAT IS PRETTY AMAZING. BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER. THE POOR ARE DOING THE BEST I HAVE EVER DONE. EARNINGS FOR THE BOTTOM 10% ARE RISING FASTER THAN EARNINGS FOR THE TOP 10% PROPORTIONATELY. UNDER EIGHT YEARS OF THE BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA ADMINISTRATION , [BOOING] WHICH ADMINISTRATION LOVED SPYING ON PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, COULD YOU IMAGINE IF IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND I SPIED ON HIS CAMPAIGN? WHAT WITH THESE FAKE NEWS PEOPLE BE DOING? MORE THAN 300,000 PEOPLE UNDER OBAMA, 300,000 PEOPLE LEFT THE WORKFORCE. UNDER JUST THREE YEARS OF MY ADMINISTRATION, 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE WORKFORCE AND NOBODY BELIEVES THAT, WISCONSIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 370 COMPANIES HAVE SIGNED OUR PLEDGE TO AMERICA'S WORKERS, PROVIDING MORE THAN 14 MILLION AMERICANS WITH NEW TRAINING AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE TRAINING THEM. WE ARE GETTING THEM , WALMART, SO MANY GREAT COMPANIES, THEY ARE TRAINING PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY CAN TRAIN THEM BETTER THAN GOVERNMENT. 14 MILLION , YOU KNOW WHO WORKED HARD ON THAT? EVERYBODY HAS HEARD OF IVANKA, RIGHT? SHE HAS SUCH A PASSION FOR IT. SHE IS VERY SMART. SHE SAID I WANT TO GET PEOPLE WORKING AND HELP FAMILIES. LOOK, SHE IS SMART, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, IT IS OK. SHE HAD HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SHE WAS GOING TO GET TRAINED IN COMPANIES, SO SHE CALLED WALMART, EXXON, THESE GREAT COMPANIES. ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE HIT A MILLION, THEN SHE HIT 9 MILLION , DON'T FORGET, SHE WANTED TO DO 500,000. 10 MILLION. SHE JUST HIT 14 MILLION PEOPLE BEING TRAINED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 14 MILLION. IVANKA. 14 MILLION, YOU BELIEVE THAT IS POSSIBLE? THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND THE BEST EMPLOYMENT RATES. VERY CLOSE TO 160 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES. NOBODY HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE LISTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF FEDERAL WELFARE PROGRAMS. REAL MEDIAN INCOME IS NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, THINK OF THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] REAL MEDIAN INCOME. AFTER THREE YEARS , HE REALLY HAD EIGHT YEARS, BUT WE HAD LESS THAN THREE. UNDER EIGHT YEARS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOMES GREW $400, EIGHT YEARS. UNDER EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, HOUSEHOLD INCOMES GREW 975 DOLLARS. EIGHT YEARS. UNDER THREE YEARS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS RISEN $10,000. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY WE ARE DOING WELL, THE CONSUMER. $3100 FOR REGULATORY CUTS, $2000 FOR THE TAX CUTS , IT IS AXLEY HIGHER THAN THAT. 2005 HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ENERGY SAVINGS, AND $5,000 IN REAL WAGE GAINS. $10,000. THE CHILD TAX CREDIT ALONE, WHICH EVERY DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS OPPOSED, IS DELIVERING $2200 A YEAR TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY. WHO IS IN FAVOR OF THAT CUT? WHO WAS IN FAVOR OF HAVING THAT? PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, THEY THINK THE DEMOCRATS GAVE IT , THE DEMOCRATS GIVE NOTHING, THEY ARE TOO BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. THEY ARE TOO BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS. WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE ON EARTH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. SAUDI ARABIA, RUSSIA, BUT WE ARE NUMBER ONE BY FAR. IF I GET SOME ADDITIONAL PIPELINES APPROVED, WHICH I WILL VERY QUICKLY, INSTEAD OF WAITING 20 YEARS TO GET THEM APPROVED, IT WILL INCREASE US BY ANOTHER 22%, BUT WE WILL GET THEM DONE QUICKLY. AND THEY WILL BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND ALL OF THAT, I BELIEVE IN THAT. WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB DESTROYING REGULATIONS. I BROUGHT BACK THE OLD LIGHTBULB. BETTER LIGHT FOR MUCH LESS MONEY IF YOU WANT IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT IS HARD TO MAKE AN ELEGANT SPEECH , I BROUGHT BACK THE LIGHTBULB. THE NEW LIGHTBULB COSTS YOU FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AND MAKES YOU LOOK ORANGE. I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE ORANGE THAT I WAS THE COST. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU WANT, YOU HAVE IF YOU'D THE NEWBOLD, , THE NEW BULB IS HAZARDOUS WASTE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A CERTAIN DUMP AND GINGERLY PUT IT IN BECAUSE IT IS LOADED WITH GASES. I SAID TO SUMMARY TODAY IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, HOW MAY PEOPLE DO THAT IN THE COUNTRY? THEY THROW IT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN. I AM ALSO APPROVING NEW DISHWASHERS THAT GIVE YOU MORE WATER, SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY WASH AND RINSE YOUR DISHES WITHOUT HAVING TO DO IT 10 TIMES. [APPLAUSE] DOES ANYBODY HAVE A NEW DISHWASHER? I'M CIPHER THAT. THEY ARE USELESS. SO LITTLE WATER. YOU END UP USING IT 10 TIMES. THEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT AND DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. YOU ARE SPENDING 10 TIMES THE ELECTRICITY, SO I AM PUTTING THE WATER BACK. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THAT. DISHWASHERS NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE AS MUCH AS YOU EVER HAD. YOUR DISHES WILL BE BEAUTIFUL. I'M SORRY THAT YOU JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE BRAND-NEW PIECES OF GARBAGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WEIGHT. , WAIT. IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED FROM SOUTH KOREA , THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE BUILDING MAJOR REFRIGERATOR AND WASHING MACHINE PLANS , PLANTS IN THE U.S. YOU KNOW WHY? THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE TARIFFS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING USA] IT IS SO INELEGANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I AM TALKING ABOUT DISHWASHERS. I AM TALKING ABOUT REFRIGERATORS , BUBBLY , REFRIGERATORS. YOU CANNOT MAKE A BRILLIANT SPEECH, WHERE THEY SAY THAT WAS AN ELEGANT SPEECH WHEN I AM TALKING ABOUT DISHWASHERS, TOILETS, LIGHT BULBS. TOILETS AND SHOWERS. YOU DO NOT GET ANY WATER. THEY PUT RESTRICTIONS ON THEM AND NOW THEY ARE PERMANENT. TRY DOING AND BUYING A NEW FAUCET. TURN IT ON AND NO WATER COMES OUT. WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT TOILETS, BUT YOU KNOW THAT STORY. WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. THE ONLY SUBJECT THE EVER TALK ABOUT IS TOILETS, SO I NEVER MENTION IT. HOW ABOUT THE SHOWER? I HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL HEAD OF HAIR. I NEED A LOT OF WATER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU GO INTO THE SHOWER AND YOU TURN ON THE WATER. DRIP. DRIP. I CALL THE GUY, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS? NO, SIR, IT IS JUST THE RESTRICTOR. IT IS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE. WE ARE GETTING RID OF THE RESTRICTORS. IF YOU EVER GO TO THE FAUCET WHEN YOU WASH YOUR HANDS, IT TURNS ON SO EASILY. ZERO PRESSURE BEHIND IT. IT FLIPS ON. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. IN CALIFORNIA, THIS GOVERNOR, WHO HAS NO CLUE. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SENDS ALL THE WATER OUT TO THE PACIFIC. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS. HE CAME UP WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS STARTING SOON. IF YOU ARE A PERSON LIVING IN CALIFORNIA, YOU ONLY GET 50 GALLONS OF WATER. THEN IT GOES DOWN TO 47, 46, 45. YOU PAY THE HIGHEST TAXES OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK, WHERE THEY ARE NOT DOING GOOD. EVERYONE IS LEAVING NEW YORK FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTS LIKE FLORIDA BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. WE HAVE TO GET THEM DOWN. OTHER THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN, SO GAVIN NEWSOM, YOU HAVE THE WATER POURING DOWN FROM UP NORTH. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF GALLONS. THEY DIVERTED IT TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WE MUST BE IN WISCONSIN. MILLIONS OF GALLONS COMING DOWN. THIS IS A SERIOUS VALVE AND THEY TURN IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TINY LITTLE FISH THAT IS DOING VERY POORLY WITH OR WITHOUT THE WATER , SO IN THE MEANTIME, IF YOU OWN A HOME IN BEVERLY HILLS, THEY SCREAM AT YOU, IF YOU WATER YOUR GRASS A LITTLE BIT. THEY DIVERT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF GALLONS. WE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE ON A FEDERAL BASIS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO DIVERT THAT WATER ANYMORE. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE DO. THE LAST ONE, WE ARE WORKING ON CARS AND MAKING THEM LESS EXPENSIVE AND SAFER. WE ARE GIVING THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE FUEL AND YOU CAN SAVE $3500. YOU CAN HAVE A HEAVY CAR. WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK. THE NUMBER IS 12. THEY WILL ALL BE TRADING IN THEIR CARS TO GET THE NEW CARS, WHICH THEY DO NOT DO RIGHT NOW. ULTIMATELY, WE WILL WIN THAT ONE. NOT A BAD COMBINATION. TO LIFT UP FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES. JOBS AND INVESTMENT ARE POURING INTO 120 NEWLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT HERE IN WISCONSIN. TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA HELPED. THEY ARE DOING GREAT. FOR DECADES, POLITICIANS WERE PROMISING TO DEFEND WISCONSIN WORKERS, BUT THEN THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON AND LINED THEIR POCKETS WITH SPECIAL INTEREST CASH, AS THEY SHIPPED YOUR JOBS AND DREAMS TO COUNTRIES THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, COUNTRIES THAT YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. THEY LOWERED OUR ECONOMIC DEFENSES AND ALLOWED OTHER NATIONS TO STEAL YOUR FARMS. NO ESTATE TAX ON THOSE BEAUTIFUL FARMS. SO NOW, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS OR A FARM, YOU HAVE NO SAFETY NET. IF YOU DO NOT LOVE YOUR CHILDREN , ANYBODY IN HERE WHO DOES NOT LOVE THEIR CHILDREN? THEY ARE BRATS. HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS. THE FACT IS THAT NO ESTATE TAX, IT IS A TREMENDOUS THING BECAUSE YOU WERE LEAVING THE BUSINESS TO YOUR KIDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN THEY MORTGAGED THE HELL OUT OF THE PLACE AND ENDED UP LOSING IT TO THE BANK, BUT WE GOT RID OF THE ESTATE TAX ON FARMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. STUFF THAT WE NEVER SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO, BUT THESE PEOPLE WERE RANSACKING YOUR COMMUNITIES. WE ARE DEFENSELESS NO MORE. AT LONG LAST, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO PUTS AMERICA FIRST. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME, SIR? THEY ARE TRADERS, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT , TRAITORS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. DEMONSTRATING THEIR CONTEMPT, SCORN AND STAIN FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS, THESE JURISDICTIONS RELEASED DANGEROUS, VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS OUT OF THEIR JAILS AND DIRECTLY ONTO YOUR STREETS, WHERE THEY ARE FREE TO ROB, ATTACK AND MURDER AMERICAN CITIZENS. LAST YEAR, ICE , I LOVE THEM. I THINK THEY ARE SO GREAT. THEY MOVED THOUSANDS OF MS 13 OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. I OFFICERS ARRESTED NEARLY 7000 ILLEGAL ALIENS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS. 7000 ILLEGAL ALIENS HAVING CRIMINAL RECORDS, INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF MURDER, BURGLARY, ROBBERY, DRUG CRIMES, KILLINGS IN THE MOST VIOLENT WAY. RIGHT HERE IN WISCONSIN, CITY IS RUN BY FAR-LEFT POLITICIANS ARE RELEASING THEM OR RUSH DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS WHO THREATEN INNOCENT CHILDREN. [BOOING] LAST YEAR, THE SANCTUARY COUNTY OF MILWAUKEE RELEASED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL WITH MULTIPLE CHARGES FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD. THINK ABOUT THAT, OF CHILDREN. HE IS NOW AT LARGE AND THEY ARE SEARCHING ALL OVER. HE IS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER VICTIM. HE IS ALLOWED TO GO FROM YOUR SANCTUARY CITY. IN THE CITY OF MADISON, POLICE ARRESTED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN FOR ASSAULT AND AFTER AUTHORITIES RELEASED HIM, HE COMMITTED VIOLENT BATTERY, ONLY TO BE RELEASED ONE MORE TIME. THEY ARE NOW LOOKING FOR HIM. ISN'T THAT NICE? THE SAME ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS ARRESTED FOR A THIRD TIME IN SEPTEMBER AND CHARGED WITH MULTIPLE SEXUAL ASSAULTS, INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD. NOW THAT CRIMINAL IS ONCE AGAIN IN WISCONSIN JAIL, AND I CALL ON YOUR WET , LEFT-WING OFFICIALS TO STOP THE MADNESS AND WORK WITH ICE TO MAKE SURE HE IS DEPORTED THE HELL BACK HOME. GET HIM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS STAND FOR CRIME, CORRUPTION. REPUBLICANS STAND FOR LAW, ORDER AND JUSTICE. IT IS TRUE. WE BELIEVE WISCONSIN SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIEN. WE ARE REMOVING THESE ILLEGAL CRIMINALS AND GANG MEMBERS BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS, AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM BACK. WE MADE A DEAL WITH GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR, MEXICO, WHERE THEY ACCEPT THEM BACK. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THEY BRING THEM BACK. WE ARE NOT TAKING THE BACK. BUT WITH US, THEY TAKE THEM BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT HELPS A LOT WHEN WE WERE PAYING THEM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. I SAID, WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM ANYMORE. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE OUR GANG MEMBERS BACK. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS SEVEN STRAIGHT MONTHS AND A ROPE, AND WE ARE BEING HELPED BY OUR 200 MILES PLUS OF WALL. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 78% SINCE MAY, AND WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE. OUR VERY BIG AND POWERFUL BORDER WALL IS GOING UP AT RECORD SPEED . WE ARE FULLY FINANCED NOW, ISN'T THAT NICE? THAT WAS NOT EASY. WE ARE ADDING NEW MILES EVERY WEEK. WE ARE ON TRACK TO SOON BUILD THAT WALL. YOU WILL HAVE A WALL LIKE NO OTHER. IT WILL BE A POWERFUL, TERRIFIC WALL. REMEMBER THE DEMOCRATS? YOU DO NOT NEED WALLS. THEY WANTED US TO IMPLEMENT DRONES, TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYBODY. ILLEGAL ALIENS WITH DRUGS ON THEIR BACK WERE CLIMBING THE WALL. THAT PANEL ON TOP IS CALLED A CLIMB RESISTOR. IT IS VERY SLIPPERY AND HIGH. THEY GOT STUCK ON THE WALL. THEY COULD NOT GET OFF. DID YOU SEE THAT? I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS. I SAID, ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT? THEY COULD NOT GET OVER THE WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY HAD TO GET THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO GET THEM DOWN. 30 FEET UP. THAT IS ALMOST A FOUR-STORY BUILDING. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME THAN THEY ARE NOW. THEY ARE GOING CRAZY, TOTALLY LOONY. HER DISTRICT IS SO FILTHY DIRTY. WITH ALL OF THE THINGS , THE NEEDLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THESE ARE AREAS THAT WERE THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY AND NOW THEY ARE DISGUSTING. SHE SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO, TAKING CARE OF HER COMMUNITY, INSTEAD OF WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TAKING THEIR CUES FROM SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE. LIBERAL LAWMAKERS ARE PUSHING A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD STRIP 180 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. MANY OF YOU HAVE GREAT INSURANCE. REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. I DO NOT LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW. I WOULD RATHER WAIT 6, 7, 8 MONTHS AND THEN TALK. I SHOULD NOT EVEN BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE. WE WILL PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE NOBODY ELSE, AND WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIANS, WHICH YOU HAD TO GET RID OF AND WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO GET RID OF WHEN THIS PLAN DOES NOT HAPPEN. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT IT. THERE IS ONE THAT COSTS A FORTUNE. VIRTUALLY, EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES. THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. HOW DOES THAT WORK? I AM OLD-FASHIONED. I HAVE ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR THREE YEARS. I SAID, I HAVE DONE ONE. WE ARE ALL SMART PEOPLE. HOW IS IT GOOD WHEN THEY SAY, WE ARE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES RUSSIAN MARK THEY SAY, WE ARE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES AND OPEN BORDERS. WE WILL PAY FOR EVERYBODY'S HEALTH INSURANCE AND SCHOOLING. I ONCE SAID WE ARE GOING TO GET EVERYBODY A ROLLS-ROYCE. I SAID EVERY ILLEGAL ALIEN WILL HAVE A ROLLS-ROYCE AND THEY SAID, HE LIED TONIGHT. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. BUT THEY ARE THE PARTY OF LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM AND CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AMERICAN DREAM AND HONEST ABE LINCOLN. REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR CITIZENS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR AND DECREE. THIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE NOBODY ELSE HAS SEEN BEFORE. ANYTHING THAT I SAY THAT IS BOTH , SLIGHTLY FALSE, IT IS IN THE HEADLINES. THIS IS ONE OF THE , I WOULD SAY THIS. THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. RIGHT? THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GREAT MOVEMENTS, WHERE SOMEBODY CAME ALONG OUT OF NOWHERE, WON SOUTH CAROLINA, WON SOME STATES, BUT WE WON 32 STATES. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. WE ARE A MOVEMENT FOR ALL AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS, JUSTICE, EQUALITY, OPPORTUNITY AND SAFETY. WE ARE A BIG TENT AND WE ARE A PARTY OF BIG IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. THAT IS WHY AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE JOINING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LIKE NOBODY EVER THOUGHT EVEN POSSIBLE. THEY LOVE US AND WE LOVE THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO GIVE FORMER PRISONERS A CHANCE AT LIFE, WE PASSED , IT WAS US, NOT THE DEMOCRATS. I GOT IT DONE. I CALLED REPUBLICANS THAT MAYBE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO INCLINED. SOME OF THEM VERY CONSERVATIVE WERE VERY MUCH INCLINED, BUT I THOUGHT THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEEDED. NOBODY COULD DO IT, BUT I GOT IT APPROVED. FROM THE DAY IT WAS APPROVED, I GOT NO THANKS OR CREDIT. BUT WE PASSED BIPARTISAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, AND THAT HAS HELPED 70 PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE STORY OF ALICE JOHNSON AND SO MANY DIFFERENT STORIES. THIS HAS HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THIS HISPANIC COMMUNITY. TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, WE HAVE CONFIRMED 187 FEDERAL JUDGES, A RECORD, WHO WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LAST SPRING, WISCONSIN VOTERS ELECTED A GREAT JUDGE TO YEAR SUPREME COURT. THIS WAY, YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO ELECT ANOTHER TERRIFIC JUDGE, DANIELLE KELLEY , JUSTICE DANIELLE KELLEY. , DANIEL KELLY. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, AND WE HAVE DONE GREAT WORK. WE HAVE DONE NUMBERS THAT NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. IN 20, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS SELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, INCLUDING BY 10% IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, 17, 18, 19, EVEN 21% IN A COUPLE OF STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CHINA IS NOW PUTTING A BIG STOP, A BIG LID ON SENTINEL , FENTANYL. PEOPLE ARE DYING, YOU HAVE TO DO IT. WE ARE FIGHTING HARD FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. IT IS MOVING ALONG WELL. THE FIRST SCHOOL CHOICE PROGRAM 30 YEARS AGO TO FREE CHILDREN FROM FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS. NOW MY ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING TO GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT. AS WE CONTINUE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, WORKERS ARE BUILDING BRAND-NEW HUMVEE REPLACEMENT. IN OSHKOSH, A MAGNIFICENT, NEW , A LOT OF SHIPS. A LOT OF HUMVEES. ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND BE OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI 70 OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET FOR 52 YEARS. FOR YEARS, HE WATCHED AS POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOU, THE PEOPLE OF THIS CONSTANT. THE SURVIVAL OF THE NATION. WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING, THEY WILL DESTROY OUR NATION. OUR LAST ELECTION WAS SO IMPORTANT. MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT EVER. IT WAS SO IMPORTANT. I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION WILL BE JUST AS IMPORTANT. WE NEED TIME FOR THAT TREE TO GROW. YOU PLANT A TREE AND IT TAKES TIME. WE HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR TO SECURE, WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY IN 2020. ONLY THIS WAY CAN WE SAVE THE AMERICA THAT WE LOVE AND DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP ONCE AND FOR ALL. I HAVE BECOME THE EXPERT ON THE SWAMP. I USED TO SAY DRAIN THE SWAMP AND I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD NEED THAT BAD, BUT WE ARE HERE AND WE ARE WINNING. DISHONEST, BAD PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS OUT OF POVERTY AND INTO PROSPERITY. WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO SUSTAIN A SYSTEM OF , A SYSTEM. WE ARE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF IT. LIKE VISA LOTTERY. WE PUT NAMES IN A LOTTERY AND THEY BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS. DO YOU THINK THEY ARE GIVING US THEIR FINEST? THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. CATCH AND RELEASE WAS A VERY BIG THING AND WE DID THAT WITH NO DEMOCRAT HELP. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO END LOOPHOLES? DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN MEDICINE, FINDING CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE STAND WITH INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE VICTORY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FATE AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HIS THREE AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. WE WILL NEVER LET THEM REMOVE IT. THOSE WORDS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. FROM MILWAUKEE TO MUNRO. FROM WEST END TO WEST DALLAS, WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN TO EVER WALK ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. OUR AMERICAN ANCESTORS CROSSED THE OCEAN, SETTLED THE CONTINENT , TAMED THE WILDERNESS, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, LANDED MEN ON THE FACE OF THE MOON AND MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING USA] USA] PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, DEVOTION AND DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, KEEP ON FIGHTING AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT .

BECAUSE WORKING TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN, AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

CSPANDT241202032	Donald Trump	2020-01-24	"March for Life" Rally	Well, thank you very much and thank you, Jeanne. It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life. (Applause.) We're here for a very simple reason: to defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential. (Applause.) For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life. And today, as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you. (Applause.) I want to welcome tens of thousands - this is a tremendous turnout - tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides - (applause) - to be here in our nation's capital. And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in. If anyone would like to give up their spot, we can work that out. (Laughter.) You have a tremendous group of people outside. Thousands and thousands wanted to get in. This is some great success. (Applause.) Young people are the heart of the March for Life, and it's your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation. (Applause.) The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens. You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer, and motivated by pure, unselfish love. You're grateful - and we are so grateful - these are incredible people - to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway. (Applause.) Thank you. And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here. James, Mike - thank you, fellas. And Representatives Steve Scalise - (applause); Chris Smith - (applause); Ralph Abraham - (applause); Warren Davidson - (applause); Bob Latta - (applause); John Joyce - (applause); Lloyd Smucker - (applause); Brian Fitzpatrick - (applause); and Brad Wenstrup. (Applause.) Thank you, all. (Applause.) And I have to say - and I look at it - I see it exactly - we have many, many more politicians in the audience. But, if you don't mind, I won't introduce them all. (Laughter.) All of us here today understand an eternal truth: Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God. (Applause.) Together, we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life. (Applause.) When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God's creation. (Applause.) When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul. One life changes the world. From my family - and I can tell you, I send love and I send great, great love. And from the first day in office, I've taken a historic action to support America's families and to protect the unborn. (Applause.) And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding. (Applause.) I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life. (Applause.) At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. (Applause.) Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. (Applause.) And as the Bible tells us, each person is "wonderfully made." (Applause.) We have taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty -- so important. Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world, and, frankly, very strongly attacked in our nation. You see it better than anyone. But we are stopping it, and we're taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. (Applause.) We are preserving faith-based adoption. (Applause.) And to uphold our founding documents, we have confirmed 187 federal judges - (applause) - who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. (Applause.) We are protecting pro-life students' right to free speech on college campuses. (Applause.) And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your First Amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don't, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay. (Applause.) Sadly, the far-left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win. (Applause.) We all know how to win. We all know how to win. You've been winning for a long time. You've been winning for a long time. (Applause.) Together, we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to abortion, Democrats is a - and you know this, you've seen what's happened - Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years, and decades - and you can even say "for centuries." Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth. Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb right up until delivery. Then, we had the case of the Democrat governor in the state of Virginia - the Commonwealth of Virginia. And we love the Commonwealth of Virginia, but what is going on in Virginia? What is going on? The Governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth. You remember that. Senate Democrats even blocked legislation that would give medical care to babies who survive attempted abortions. That's why I've called on Congress - two of our great senators here, so many of our congressmen here - and called upon them to defend the dignity of life and to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in their mother's womb. (Applause.) This year, the March for Life is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which forever enshrined women's rights to vote in the United States - (applause) - and given by the United States Constitution. Such a big event. (Applause.) Today, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the right, and all of their rights, as given in the Declaration of Independence -- it's the right to life. To all the women here today: Your devotion and your leadership uplifts our entire nation, and we thank you for that. The tens of thousands of Americans gathered today not only stand for life - it's really that they stand for it so proudly together, and I want to thank everybody for that. You stand for life each and every day. You provide housing, education, jobs, and medical care to the women that you serve. You find loving families for children in need of a forever home. You host baby showers for expecting moms. You make -- you just make it your life's mission to help spread God's grace. We celebrate you, and we declare that mothers are heroes. (Applause.) That's true. Your strength, devotion, and drive is what powers our nation. And, because of you, our country has been blessed with amazing souls who have changed the course of human history. We cannot know what our citizens yet unborn will achieve, the dreams they will imagine, the masterpieces they will create, the discoveries they will make. But we know this: Every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting. (Applause.) And above all, we know that every human soul is divine, and every human life -- born and unborn -- is made in the holy image of Almighty God. (Applause.) Together, we will defend this truth all across our magnificent land. We will set free the dreams of our people. And with determined hope, we look forward to all of the blessings that will come from the beauty, talent, purpose, nobility, and grace of every American child. I want to thank you. This is a very special moment. It's so great to represent you. I love you all and -- (applause) - and I say with true passion: Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.)	https://www.c-span.org/video/?468482-1/march-life-rally	President Trump addressed the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.

IN THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE, OVER 300,000 WORKING AGE PEOPLE LEFT THE WORKFORCE. THEY HAD NO CHOICE. IN JUST THREE YEARS, OF MY ADMINISTRATION, 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE WORKFORCE. NOBODY BELIEVES IT INCLUDING THE FAKE NEWS. [CHEERING] IF I WOULD'VE SAID THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THAT WE WERE GOING TO PROTAS NUMBERS LIKE THIS, THE FAKE NEWS WAITED BEEN HITTING ME. HE'S EXAGGERATING, HE'S LYING. PINOCCHIO, PINOCCHIO. [BOOING] THE PRESS IS VERY DISHONEST. MORE THAN 2 MILLION MILLENNIAL'S HAVE GOTTEN JOBS AND THEIR WAGES HAVE GROWN BY NEARLY 5% EVERY YEAR, WHICH IS A RECORD. A RECORD NUMBER OF AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 34 ARE NOW WORKING ANOTHER RECORD. UNDER THE TROMP ECONOMY, THE LOWEST PAID EARNERS ARE REAPING THE FASTEST GAINS OF ANYBODY. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A BLUE-COLLAR BOOM. [CHEERING] IT'S ABOUT TIME, IT'S ABOUT TIME. IT'S BEEN MANY, MANY DECADES.

[BOOING] FOR EIGHT YEARS, IT WAS A $975. SO EIGHT YEARS, EIGHT YEARS 450, 975. UNDER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT,. [CHEERING] AND WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE TAX CUTS, THE REGULATION CUTS THAT NOBODY'S EVER CUT TAXES LIKE THIS. AND NOBODY'S EVER CUT REGULATIONS, THAT'S WHY ALL THESE JOBS ARE BEING FILLED. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THREE YEARS, THE NUMBER IS ALMOST $10000. AND THAT'S JUST IN THREE YEARS. IT'S GOING UP. [CHEERING] THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT. NEW BUSINESS APPLICATIONS IN NEW JERSEY HAS JUST SOARED TO A RECORD HIGH. [CHEERING] AND WE HAVE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE NATIONWIDE OFF OF FEDERAL WELFARE. THEY ARE OFF FEDERAL WELFARE. NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THESE NUMBERS. SOME DAYS THEY WILL WRITE THE TRUE STORY. OUR CHILD TAX CREDIT ALONE IS DELIVERING $2200 A YEAR TO 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE ENDED, SO IMPORTANTLY FOR YOU, THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] WE DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE'S ENERGY ANYMORE. THAT IS SO NICE. [CHEERING] WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH ENERGY IS INCREDIBLE. BUT EXTREME LIBERALS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO SHUT DOWN U.S. ENERGY, INCLUDING THROUGH THE SO-CALLED GREEN NEW DEAL. [BOOING] BECAUSE YOUR FACTORIES, GET RID OF YOUR COWS, YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY COWS IN WILDWOOD, BUT THEY ARE GONE. WE WILL NEVER SACRIFICE AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO GET THERE AND WE REALLY PICKED IT UP OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. PIPELINES OLIVER, PIPE LINES ARE GOOD THEY ARE UNDERGROUND AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND. TO LIFT UP FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED INVESTMENTS, THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY HAVE SUFFERED. WEEK CREATED WITH THE HELP OF A GREAT GENTLEMAN FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU KNOW I'M TALKING ABOUT? KIM SCOTT? WRITE SENATOR TIM SCOTT. HE IS AN INCREDIBLE GUY. HE REALLY IS. HE CAME TO MY OFFICE AND SAID HE HAD THIS IDEA THAT HE'S WANTED TO DO FOR A LONG TIME. SENATOR TIM SCOTT, OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS AND INVESTMENTS ARE NOW POURING INTO NEARLY 170 NEWLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES RIGHT HERE IN NEW JERSEY. ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOT GOVERNMENT DOLLARS. THEY ARE FLOWING INTO THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND INTO AREAS WHERE INVESTMENT WAS DEAD. [CHEERING] AND FOR DECADES, POLITICIANS RAN FOR OFFICE PROMISING TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS. BUT THEN THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON AND THEY LINED THEIR POCKETS WITH SPECIAL INTEREST CASH AND THEY SHIPPED AMERICAN JOBS AND DREAMS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY CLOSED UP YOUR FACTORIES. [BOOING] THEY GOT RID OF YOUR JOBS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES. GLOBAL POLITICIANS LOWERED OUR ECONOMIC DEFENSES THAT ALLOWED OTHER NATIONS TO ROB OUR FACTORIES, STEAL OUR FARMS, AND RANSACK OUR COMMUNITIES. NOT ANYMORE. [CHEERING] NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE WE ARE DEFENSELESS NO MORE BECAUSE AT LONG LAST, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO PUTS AMERICA FIRST. IS THAT OKAY? [CHEERING] COLLAPSE. [CHEERING] THE UNITED STATES , LISTEN TO THIS NUMBER, AND IF IT WAS WRONG THE FAKE NEWS OF THE OLIVER. AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR THREE YEARS. THE UNITED STATES LOST 60000 FACTORY PLANTS , YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE A STUPID TRADE DEALS. BECAUSE OF BAD LEADERSHIP, DURING THE 16 YEARS OF THE TWO PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS UNDER JUST THREE YEARS OF MY ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW ADDED 12000 NEW FACTORIES AND MANY MORE ARE BEING BUILT AND THEY ARE POURING BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE ACTION IS. THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. THEY ARE POURING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. NEW PLANTS AND FACTORIES, YOU SEE THEM ALL OVER. I PASSED TWO OF THEM, BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL PLANTS AND FACTORIES. THEY ARE POURING BACK IN BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION IS IN ITS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. I SEE THE LEADERS IN THEY SAY IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR COUNTRY. DON'T SAY THAT WE WANT YOU TO HAVE YOUR COMPANIES BUILD YOUR PLANTS IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER PLACES, AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. [APPLAUSE] THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS THOROUGHLY WENT AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. LEFT WEIGHING, RADICAL POLITICIAN SUPPORT DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. [BOOING] AND REMEMBER SANCTUARY CITY IS A JURISDICTION THAT REFUSES TO HAND OVER CRIMINAL ALIENS THAT ARE IN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CUSTODY. INSTEAD THEY ORDERED THEM TO BE RELEASED INTO YOUR COMMUNITY. WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT IS GOING ON? [BOOING] AND WHAT SET LOOSE THESE CRIMINAL ALIENS THEY ARE FREED TO GO AGAINST THEIR CRIME SPREE AGAINST INNOCENT AMERICANS. RIGHT HERE IN NEW JERSEY, YOUR STATE'S DEMOCRATIC LEADERS HAVE INSTITUTED SANCTUARY POLICIES THAT RESULT IN DANGEROUS PREDATORS BEING SET FREE INTO YOUR COMMUNITY. [BOOING] FOR EXAMPLE, CUMBERLAND COUNTY, WE ALL KNOW CUMBERLAND COUNTY VERY WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THIS ONE. THEY RELEASED IN ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH MULTIPLE CHARGERS FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD. HE IS NOW AT LARGE, FREE TO SEARCH FOR A NETHER INNOCENT VICTIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM TO ICE, AND I WANT TO THANK ICE BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE THEY TAKE AN INCREDIBLE JOB THEY DO. [CHEERING] RIGHT HERE, ANOTHER CRIMINAL ALIEN WAS ARRESTED FOR A VIOLENCE ASSAULT IN NEW JERSEY , THE SANCTUARY JURISDICTION OF ANOTHER COUNTY DEFIED ICE REQUEST TO DETAIN HIM. LOCAL AUTHORITIES RELEASED HIM AND HE WENT ON TO COMMIT A GRUESOME TRIPLE MURDER. [BOOING] I COULD READ THESE CASES, HONESTLY, I COULD READ IN STATE THESE KAT CASES TO YOU ALL NIGHT. I CAN STATE THESE CASES TO ALL NIGHTS. NO AMERICAN SHOULD EVER BE HURT, HARMS, OR KILLED BECAUSE LEFT-WING POLITICIANS, DEMOCRATS DECIDED TO SHIELD AND SHELTER CRIMINALS. LOOK, YOU HAVE CRIMINALS THAT ARE ON THE STREETS THAT SHOULD BE IN JAIL. YOU HAVE CRIMINALS THAT ARE ON THE STREETS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND BROUGHT BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND BY THE WAY, ICE HAS REMOVED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF MS 13 YANG MEMBERS. THE MOST BRUTAL PEOPLE. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT JOB. MAYBE YOU DO, THERE'S A COUPLE OF TOUGH PEOPLE AT THERE. ANYBODY WANT TO BE WITH ICE? THERE IS A LOT OF TOUGH PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY. NEW JERSEY'S DIFFERENT. [CHEERING] THESE ICE PEOPLE, THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY, THEY ARE PROUD AND TOUGH PEOPLE. THEY WILL GO RIGHT INTO A PACK, THEY CAUGHT A PACK, THEY START SWAYING IN, EVERYBODY'S SWINGING IN AND OF STANDING UP AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO?

AND I WANT TO THINK OF MEXICO BECAUSE , YOU KNOW IT'S HAPPENING, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AT THIS MOMENT 27000 SOLDIERS FROM MEXICO PROTECTING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. [CHEERING] I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENTS. DEMOCRATS SAID FOR CRIME, CORRUPTION, AND CHAOS. REPUBLICANS STAND FOR A LAW, ORDER, AND JUSTICE. IN SALES YOU WANT, BUT THOSE ARE THE FACTS. [CHEERING] AND WE ARE REMOVING THESE ILLEGAL CRIMINALS AND YANG MEMBERS. WE ARE LITERALLY TAKING THEM BY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND BRINGING THEM BACK. THANKS FOR TIRELESS EFFORTS OF BORDER PATROL TO SECURE OUR BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS SEVEN STRAIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS DOWN BY 75% SINCE SPRING.

IF I WANTED TO SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING LOOK WITH THE MILITARY GOT TRUE TRILLION DOLLARS. ALL MADE IN AMERICA. THEY'RE THE BEST PLANES, BEST MISSILES BEST EVERYTHING. MADE IN AMERICA. IF I WANTED TO DO ANYTHING, THE ONLY THING THEY PUT THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE PARTIES THEY DID NOT WANT TO SALVE THE WALL. THEY VOTED FIVE YEARS AGO TO BUILD THE WALL. THEY DID KNOW HOW TO BUILD IT AND I DO. [CHEERING] WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE'S A SERIES OF COURT CASES AND OTHER THINGS, THE MONEY IS ONE, AND WE ARE NOW BUILDING THAT BEAUTIFUL WALL. [CHEERING] AND THIS POWERFUL BORDER WALL IS GOING UP IN RECORD SPEED AND WE JUST REACHED OVER 100 MILES OF WALL. AND BY NEXT YEAR WE WILL BE OVER 400 MILES, AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER IT WILL BE COMPLETE. [CHEERING] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE DIDN'T BUILD THE WALL, HE DIDN'T BUILD A WALL. WHEN YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH OF A PARTY THAT HAS THE HOUSE, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THE HOUSE FOR LONG. [CHEERING] THEY WILL HAVE A WONDERFUL NEW SPEAKER. WE WILL GET RID OF NANCY PELOSI. [CHEERING] NERVOUS NANCY. NERVOUS NANCY. WE'LL HAVE KEVIN MCCARTHY HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE. THE WALL , IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT OF AN ENTIRE PARTY AND THEY CONTROL THE HOUSE. IT'S NOT EASY. AND WE DID IT. AND FRANKLY WE WERE BUILDING THE WALL TO THE HELP OF THE MILITARY, THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ANYWAY. BUT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE MONEY AND IT IS GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY. [CHEERING] AND ALL THE RESPECT TO MEXICO HE GOT ALONG WITH THEM VERY WELL. HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION BUT HE'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. THAT MEXICO IS IN FACT, SOON YOU WILL FIND OUT, PAYING FOR THE WALL. [CHEERING] I'LL HIT YOU WITH THAT. THE WALL IS ULTIMATELY IN VERY NICELY BEING PAID FOR BY MEXICO. AND IT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR MEXICO TO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. THE WALL IS A VITAL BARRIER FOR BLOCKING DEADLY DRUGS FROM POURING INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS STOPPING DRUGS AT A RECORD NUMBER. STILL ANYTHING THAT COMES OFFERS TOO MUCH. WE ARE BLOCKING IT AT A RECORD NUMBER AND I'M ALSO VERY PROUD TO REPORT THAT WE WON A CRITICAL SUPREME COURT VICTORY YESTERDAY ON IMMIGRATION. : THEY WERE KILLING OUR COUNTRY PERK OUT KILLING OUR COUNTRY PERK A WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. THEY TAKE THEIR CUES FROM SOCIALIST LIKE BERNIE THEY ARE PUSHING A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE TO STRIP 180 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR PRIVATE HEALTHCARE PLANS WHICH MANY PEOPLE LIKE. THE PLAN THAT EVERY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WOULD DEMOLISH THE ECONOMY OF NEW JERSEY AT SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE EMPLOYMENT COMPANIES AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING GREAT HEALTHCARE IT HAS BEEN SO LONG IT IS :-) WORKING AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL NEVER LET IT HAPPEN. WE ARE SAVING YOUR HEALTHCARE WHILE DEMOCRATS TRY TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE. TAKE AWAY YOUR DOCTORS. TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE GOOD CARE AND WE FOUGHT HARD AND NOW WE ARE DOING BETTER. BY THE WAY SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL HAVE A NEW MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT. A VERY BIG ONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT WE ARE MAKING HEALTHCARE BETTER AND MUCH MUCH CHEAPER WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB TO RUN IT AND WE'VE GIVEN YOU A LOT OF ALTERNATIVES. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WILL. [APPLAUSE] PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE SAVED IT. WE ARE STOPPING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING AND MAKING EVERYTHING TRANSPARENT THAT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT IS STARTING IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS FROM NOW. YOU CAN SEE PRICING YOU CAN PRICE OTHER HOSPITALS AND OTHER DOCTORS IT WILL BE INCREDIBLE. NOBODY BELIEVES I WAS ABLE TO DO IT BUT WE DID IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND THE PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE WE ARE LOWERING DRUG PRICES THE DEMOCRATS ARE INCREASING DRUG PRICES. WE ARE FIGHTING THE LOBBYIST AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND HOW ARE WE DOING? WE ARE DOING GOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT BECAUSE OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY WE ARE GETTING IT DONE WE ARE APPROVING MORE GENERIC DRUGS THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THEY COME IN FRANKLY JUST AS BIG AS THE BIG NAMES BUT SELL 80 PERCENT LESS IN SOME CASES WE ARE UNLEASHING INNOVATION FOR DISEASES OF ALL TIMES AND CUTTING OUT THE RICH MIDDLEMAN AND DELIVERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMERS THESE ARE THINGS WE HAD TO FIGHT LIKE HELL TO GET. [APPLAUSE] LESS PAPERWORK FOR YOUR DOCTORS AND GIVING YOU EASY CONTROL OF YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH IS A BIG DEAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE ARE PROHIBITING HOSPITALS FROM HIDING PRICES AND CHARGING HIDDEN COST YOU SAY I'M FEELING BETTER THAN THE DOCTOR SEND YOU A BILL FOR 25000. THAT'S THE END OF THAT. NOW THE DOCTOR WASN'T SO GOOD. WE ARE MAKING COMPANIES COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS. WE ARE REPEALING BURDENSOME TAXES. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THEIR TERM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY FAR. NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE HAVE PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS, 60 PERCENT CHEAPER THAN OBAMA CARE AND WE HAVE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS TREATING KIDNEY DISEASE, HIV, PEDIATRIC CANCER AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH PROGRESS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE JUST PAST THE THING I THINK IS GREAT FOR 45 YEARS BEEN TRYING TO GET A PAST WE JUST PAST THE RIGHT TO TRY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST DOCTORS THE GREATEST TECHNICIANS AND LABS IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A DRUG LOOKING GOOD BUT IT WILL TAKE 12 YEARS WE BROUGHT THE TIMING DOWN TO HALF OF THAT SIX YEARS TO GET IT APPROVED IF THEY HAVE MONEY THEY GO TO ASIA OR EUROPE ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOKING FOR HELP IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY THEY GO HOME BUT THEY DIE. WHAT WE DID IS RIGHT TO TRY. PEOPLE SIGNED SOMETHING AND THEY DON'T HOLD THE COUNTRY RESPONSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] THEY DON'T HOLD THE DRUG COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] SO RIGHT TO TRY AND THEN THEY GET THE NEWEST AND THE BEST AND THE LATEST MEDICINE WHERE IT'S LOOKING GOOD BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT FOR FIVE MORE YEARS AND THEN THEY DO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE SOON. THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. LET THEM HAVE IT. WE SAT DOWN WITH A GREAT GROUP OF LEADERS, REPUBLICAN LEADERS AND HONESTLY WE HAD SOME BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WE GOT IT DONE THEY BEEN TRYING TO DO IT 45 YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE GOT IT DONE. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE RESULTS AND I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE RESULTS. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. WE HAVE TRANSFORMED VETERANS HEALTHCARE INCLUDING THROUGH V.A. CHOICE. [APPLAUSE] FOR 48 YEARS THEY BEEN TRYING TO GET VETERANS FOR I THOUGHT IT HAD THE GREATEST SECRET SO FOUR YEARS AGO I'M CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT BUT FOR 45 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT SO I COME BACK ONE DAY AND SAY TO MY PEOPLE I'M SO SMART. BECAUSE THE VETERANS ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR TWO WEEKS, THREE WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS, TEN WEEKS. SOME OF THEM ARE OKAY AND THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL BY THE TIME THEY SEE THE DOCTOR. IT IS TOO LONG BUT I HAVE THE GREATEST IDEA. I'M SO SMART. HERE'S WHAT WERE GOING TO DO. [LAUGHTER] WERE GOING TO SEND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE A DOCTOR DOWN THE ROAD TO PRIVATE DOCTORS AND PAY THE BILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY LOOK BACK AND SAID WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT CONCEPT FOR 45 YEARS WE CANNOT GET IT APPROVED BUT I GOT IT APPROVED ABOUT 11 MONTHS AGO. AND THE V.A. IS DOING FANTASTIC. THAT WAS A BIG THING WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE PEOPLE COULD MISTREAT OUR VETERANS AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THEY COULD BE SADISTIC , SO MANY OTHER THINGS THEY COULD STEAL OR ROB AND WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. NOW WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY IF YOU LOOK AT THEM YOU SAY GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW YOU CAN FIRE THEM THEY HAVE LET GO OF MORE THAN 8000 BAD PEOPLE WE HAVE REDUCED OPIOID DEATHS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND VERY SUBSTANTIALLY AND 30 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE MODERNIZING CRITICAL VACCINES AND DOING A GREAT JOB WITH VACCINES. WE ARE CREATING A PATHWAY TO BUY DRUGS FROM CANADA THAT ARE MUCH MUCH CHEAPER IN FLORIDA THE GOVERNOR CAME TO ME AND SAID SIR SIR, THE SYSTEM IS SO BAD AND YOU CANNOT FIX IT THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO GIVE US BACK THE HOUSE. THEY SAY SIR WE CAN BUY THE DRUGS IN CANADA FOR 50 PERCENT LESS THE SAME DRUG MADE IN THE SAME FACTORY MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY. 50 PERCENT AND WE CAN GIVE THE BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FLORIDA OR COLORADO OR NEW JERSEY OR WHEREVER YOU ARE. THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME NO PRESIDENT HAS WANTED TO DO IT. I SAID IF YOU CAN SAVE 50 PERCENT OR 25 PERCENT OR 15 PERCENT, BUY IT. DO IT. GO. AND I GAVE THEM AUTHORIZATION. DO IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE PROTECTING MEDICARE FOR OUR NATION SENIORS. THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAID MEDICARE TO FUND BENEFITS. AND WE ALL HAVE A HEART. BUT WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY THEY WILL COME. AND THEY THINK THEY WILL GET FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTHCARE. THEY WILL COME. IF YOU DON'T SAY THAT THEN WHO WOULD EVEN THINK THIS BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT NOW SUPPORTS LATE TERM ABORTION RIPPING THE BABY STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. [BOOING] THAT IS WHY HIGH HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO LIMIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEIR CITIES LOS ANGELES IS SO SAD WHAT YOU SEE IS SO SAD WITH THE HOMELESS AND THE WAY THEY DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE HOMELESS, SAN FRANCISCO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CITIES RUN BY DEMOCRATS. IT IS A DISASTER THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN DREAM.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN TO KEEP IT GOING LIKE A GIANT TREE PLANTED BUT IT TAKES TIME. WE NEED THIS NEXT ELECTION SO BADLY. THE GOOD NEWS IS IT IS MUCH EASIER BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT I HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN I PROMISED I NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT SPACE FORCE FOR QUITE NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE ARE A BIG TENT PARTY BIG IDEAS AND A BIG POTENTIAL TOGETHER IF WE DON'T BLOW IT TO GIVE PRISONERS A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE WE PASSED BIPARTISAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THEY COULD NOT GET IT PASSED INCLUDING MANY CONSERVATIVES.

HOW ABOUT BUTTIGIEG? THEY CALL HIM MAYOR PETE. BECAUSE NOBODY CAN PRONOUNCE HIS LAST NAME. HE PRESIDES OVER A CITY THAT IS FAILED. IN A STATE THAT IS HAVING THE GREATEST YEAR THEY HAVE EVER HAD. THEY HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. THEY HAD A GREAT GOVERNOR. YOU JUST HEARD FROM HIM. THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA. WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THEM. WHAT HAPPENED TO MINI MIKE?

WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A HARD TIME, JUST THINK OF THE SONG, "YMCA." IS IST IS A MASSIVE WIN FOR IOWA WORKERS AND FARMERS. IT CREATES FAIRNESS WITH CANADA, WITH MEXICO. PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REASON IRAN IS THE UNFAIR TRADE I HAVE SEEN. ONE AFTER ONE, CHINA, MEXICO, CANADA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, WE HAVE MADE ALL OF THESE DEALS AND WE HAVE PLENTY LEFT OVER. [CHEERING] EUROPE IS NEXT. I WANTED TO FINISH CHINA BEFORE WE STARTED ON EUROPE. I LIKE TO DO THEM ONE AT A TIME. I AM A VERY ORGANIZED PERSON. WEEKS AGO, WE SIGNED A TERRIFIC NEW TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WILL BOOST AMERICAN AGRICULTURE BY $50 BILLION EVERY YEAR. [CHEERING] AND MANY OTHER BUSINESSES LIKE MANUFACTURING, BANKING, FINANCE. I HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART FOR THE FARMERS. I SAW THE AMBASSADOR WHO WAS IN CHARGE WHO WAS FANTASTIC. HE WAS GETTING READY FOR THE FINAL DEAL. I ASKED SONNY PERDUE, WHAT IS THE BIGGEST NUMBER THAT CHINA HAS EVER DONE WITH THE FARMERS? HE SAID, $16 BILLION. THEY TARGETED YOU. NOW WE ARE FRIENDS WITH CHINA. MAYBE WE HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP. WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY ON THE CORONAVIRUS. WE ONLY HAVE FIVE PEOPLE. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL BE GREAT. THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A PROBLEM. HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL BE GREAT. WE ARE WORKING WITH CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES VERY CLOSELY. IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH. [APPLAUSE] I SAID TO SONNY PERDUE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, YOU ARE TARGETED. I DON'T BLAME CHINA. THEY ARE SMART. THEY TARGETED TRUMP STATES. IOWA, NEBRASKA, WISCONSIN. THE FARMERS CAME TO SEE ME AND THEY SAID, SIR, YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. WHEN THE FAKE NEWS WOULD INTERVIEW FARMERS, THEY WOULD SAY, NO, HE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO. [CHEERING] YOU COULD NOT HAVE MADE IT BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH MONEY. I PUT A 25% TARIFF ON EVERYTHING COMING IN FROM CHINA. THEN MORE TARIFFS ON THINGS BEYOND THAT. WE TOOK IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEN WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE FARMERS? THEY CAME TO SEE ME. 36 FARMERS. THEY SAY, WE DO NOT WANT ANYTHING. EVERYBODY WANTS MONEY. THEY SAID, WE JUST WANT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE BEEN TREATED BADLY FOR YEARS. I SAID, YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR YEARS. IN THE MEANTIME, I WILL GIVE YOU $12 BILLION OUT OF THESE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE ARE COLLECTING. YOU GOT $28 BILLION OVER THAT SHORT TIME. I TOLD SONNY, I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE SMALL FARMERS, TOO.

THANKS TO THE COURAGE OF AMERICAN HEROES, THE ISIS CALIPHATE HAS BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED AND ITS FOUNDER AND LEADER IS THAT. -- DEAD. CRAZY NANCY PELOSI SAID, DO NOT CALL HIM AN ANIMAL, HE IS A HUMAN BEING. NO, HE IS AN ANIMAL. TWO WEEKS AGO, THE MILITARY DELIVERED ANOTHER HISTORIC WIN FOR AMERICAN JUSTICE. OUR BRAVE WARRIORS LAUNCHED A FLAWLESS PRECISION STRIKE THAT KILLED THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST. HE WAS THE MASTERMIND OF THE ROADSIDE BOMB. WHEN YOU SEE GREAT SOLDIERS OF OUR COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES WALKING AROUND, THEY DON'T HAVE LEGS, ARMS, YOU SEE THEM WALKING AROUND OR WRITING AROUND, THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE GREATEST ENERGY. I GO TO WALTER REED AND SEE THEM. A YOUNG MAN, HIS LEGS WERE BLOWN OFF. HE SAID HE WANTS TO GET BACK. THE SPIRIT OF THESE PEOPLE. IT MAY EVEN TOP THE FARMERS. [CHEERING] HE WAS RESPONSIBLE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, 90%, THEY SAY, OF THESE ROADSIDE BOMBS. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE. HE TOOK A HARD HIT. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDERING AND MAIMING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS. AND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE. NOT ACCEPTABLE. HE WAS ACTIVELY PLANNING NEW ATTACKS, BUT WE ENDED HIS BLOODY RAMPAGE. [CHEERING] YET WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS LIKE CRAZY BERNIE AND NANCY PELOSI OPPOSED OUR DECISION TO ELIMINATE HIM. AND TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. WHILE WE ARE PROUDLY CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ARE CONSUMED WITH PARTISAN RAGE AND OBSESSED WITH A WITCH HUNT HOAX. [BOOING] WE ARE HAVING PROBABLY THE BEST YEARS WE HAVE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND I JUST GOT IMPEACHED. CAN YOU BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE? THEY IMPEACH TRUMP. WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE VETS. AND THEY IMPEACH A PRESIDENT. NO, THAT WILL NOT WORK. WATCH. JUST WATCH. THEY WANT TO NULLIFY YOUR BALLOTS, POISON OUR DEMOCRACY, AND OVERTHROW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. [CHEERING] WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS TRYING TO OVERTURN THE LAST ELECTION. WHY AM I NOT WORRIED? REMEMBER NIXON, IT WAS A DARK TIME. WITH CLINTON, IT WAS NOT GOOD. WITH JOHNSON, A LONG TIME AGO, NONE OF US REMEMBER, IT WAS A VERY DARK TIME. THIS IS SAID -- A HAPPY PERIOD FOR US. [CHEERING] [CHANTS OF U.S.A.!] IT IS A HAPPY PERIOD BECAUSE WE CALL THIS IMPEACHMENT LIGHT. CRAZY SCHIFF. SHIFTY SCHIFF. HE IS A SICK PUPPY. TODAY, I HIT MY HIGHEST BALL NUMBERS SINCE I GOT ELECTED. -- POLL NUMBERS SINCE I GOT ELECTED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD KNOW IT IS A HOAX. WE HAVE A GREAT PARTY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY WILL TREAT US VERY RARELY. THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE LAST ELECTION. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY FACE ANOTHER CRUSHING DEFEAT. NOVEMBER 3, MARKET OFF. WAS THAT A GREAT DAY? 2016. [CHEERING] REMEMBER, HE IS NOT GOING TO DO WELL WITH THIS GROUP. I DID WELL. HE WILL NOT DO WELL HERE OR THERE. EVEN THE EXIT POLLS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID NOT KNOW? WHEN PEOPLE ARE LEAVING, THEY ARE ALWAYS VERY ACCURATE. WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR? I AM VOTING FOR TRUMP OR CLINTON. BUT THIS TIME SOMETHING HAPPENED. WHAT AN WE LIKE TO RUN AGAINST HER? WHO IS TOUGHER, HER, CRAZY BERNIE, BIDEN, BUTTIGIEG? WHO WOULD BE THE TOUGHEST? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE WE TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT CRAZY HILLARY, WOULD THAT BE OK? [CHEERING] SHE WAS SO EASY. REMEMBER THAT SPEECH TALKING ABOUT DEPLORABLES? REMEMBER DEPLORABLES? THEY SAID THAT IS TERRIBLE. BUT SHE SAID ANOTHER WORD THAT IS WORSE. IRREDEEMABLES. I SAID, SHE IS IN TROUBLE. SHE SAID OUR PEOPLE ARE IRREDEEMABLE. IT WAS NOT THAT WORD THAT CAUGHT ON. IT WAS DEPLORABLE. THE NEXT DAY I AM SPEAKING IN WOMEN ARE WALKING AROUND, I AM DEPLORABLE. I THINK SHE MADE A BAD SPEECH LAST NIGHT. IRREDEEMABLE, REMEMBER? SHE CALLED THEM DEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE. A LOT OF THINGS GOT HER, LIKE LACK OF ABILITY. TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE. HOLD THE SENATE. AND KEEP THAT BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS, INCREDIBLE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING] PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS IS A LOT OF WORK. I JUST LEFT MICHIGAN. MICHIGAN IS BOOMING NOW BECAUSE OF ME. I MET WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE. I SAID YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, YOU HAVE THESE MASSIVE DEFICITS FOR OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP PLANTS IN MICHIGAN. COUNTRIES ARE COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY ARE COMING TO MICHIGAN, IOWA, THEY ARE BUYING YOUR STUFF AGAIN. THEY ARE GOING TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. FLORIDA. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. I RAN ON THE ISSUE OF TRADE. I USED TO SAY, HOW DO WE ALLOW THESE COMPANIES TO CLOSE AND FIRE EVERYONE? MAKE THE PRODUCT AND SELL THE PRODUCT INTO OUR COUNTRY. WHO THE HELL WOULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN? I WENT TO SOUTH KOREA AND SAID, WE HAVE TO MAKE A NEW DEAL. THEY GAVE US $500 MILLION. THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. THEY WILL PAY MORE. THEY MADE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES. HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN CHARGE OF THE DEAL. WE RENEGOTIATED THE DEAL. NOW WE HAVE A GOOD DEAL. [CHEERING] THIS DEAL IS GOING TO PRODUCE 250,000 JOBS. FOR SOUTH KOREA. SHE DID NOT LIVE. SHE LIED ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. HOW IS SHE TAKING HER DEFEAT? OK? REMEMBER THE DEBATE? DO YOU PROMISE, IF YOU LOSE, THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THE WINNER? I DID NOT EXACTLY SAY YES. I DID NOT SAY YES. I GOT LIKE 68% THERE. I THINK SLEEPY JOE, CRAZY BERNIE, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO PUT BUDDHA JOE'S IN. I THINK THEY WOULD BE TOUGHER THAN HER. THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IOWA HAVE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE LUNACY AND THE MADNESS OF THE TOTALLY SICK LEFT. SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD. I DON'T THINK THE WAY IT SOUNDS GOOD. I'M NOT LOOKING TO HAVE THEM LOOK GOOD. TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RUN BY LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS WHO WANT TO MASSIVELY RAISE YOUR TAXES, INCREASE REGULATIONS, CANCEL YOUR HEALTH PLAN, RAISE MEDICARE, SHUTDOWN AMERICAN ENERGY, DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. [BOOING] ELIMINATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. PUNISH FREE SPEECH. CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS. ABOLISH YOUR BORDERS. AND INDOCTRINATE AMERICA'S CHILDREN WITH HATEFUL, LEFT-WING IDEOLOGY. OTHER THAN THAT, THEY ARE OK. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN AMERICAN FREEDOM AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE BECAUSE AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERING] WE CAN'T DO IT. [CHANTS OF U.S.A!] THEY ARE ALL WATCHING TONIGHT, SITTING IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THIS CROWD. THE PRESS NEVER TALKS ABOUT MY CROWDS. IN NEW JERSEY, WE HAD SIGN-UPS FOR 175,000 PEOPLE. WE HAD AN ARENA THAT HELD ABOUT 9000 PEOPLE. WE COULD'VE SOLD IT OUT MANY DIFFERENT TIMES. THEY DO NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY SAY, DONALD TRUMP. IF BERNIE OR SLEEPY JOE HAD A CROWD THAT WAS SO SLOW, THEY WOULD SET UP A ROUNDTABLE. THEY WERE IN A GYMNASIUM. PEOPLE OF BEING ASKED, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SOCIALISM? THEY SAID, I JUST WANT TO BE HERE TO WATCH A SPEECH. THEY NEVER MENTION CROWDS. THEY NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING. USMCA, THE BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER SIGNED IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT BARELY GOT ANY MENTION. THEY TALK ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF. BUT THE TRADE DEAL THAT WILL CHANGE OUR COUNTRY, BRING GROWTH . GROWTH WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL. IN THE PAPERS AND ON THE FAKE NEWS CABLE SHOWS, NBC IS HORRIBLE. THE NBC NIGHTLY NEWS IS TERRIBLE. PEOPLE DON'T WATCH IT LIKE THEY USED TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. MSDNC. CNN, TOTAL FAKE STUFF. THEIR CAMERA JUST WENT OFF. THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS. AMERICANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WERE DISGUSTED BY THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, THE PARTISAN HOAXES, THE WITCH HUNTS, THE CON JOBS. THEY DO NOT LOVE OUR COUNTRY. YOU LOOK AT NANCY PELOSI'S DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND NOW IT IS A DISGRACE. NEEDLES ALL OVER THE PLACE, I WILL NOT GET INTO IT. WASHING DOWN INTO THE OCEAN. ON TO THEIR BEACHES. PEOPLE LIVING IN TENTS IF THEY ARE LUCKY. LIVING ON THEIR MOST IMPORTANCE ENTRYWAYS INTO WHAT WAS A GREAT CITY. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? ALL SHE DOES IS WORK ON THE HOAX. THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. [CHEERING] REGISTERED DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS ARE LEAVING THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IN DROVES. AND WE ARE WELCOMING THESE PEOPLE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH WIDE OPEN ARMS. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY A LOT OF YOUR GREAT LEADERS. I WILL NOT MENTION ALL OF THE NAMES. ONE THEY DO NOT MIND IS GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. COME UP, KIM, COME UP. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. SHE WAS DRIVING ME A LITTLE BIT BATTY. WHAT ABOUT ETHANOL? I SAID, KIM, I AM DOING A LOT FOR THAT. WE WANT ETHANOL. WE WANT BIOFUEL. SHE IS ASKING FOR THINGS I NEVER HEARD OF. WE GOT THEM ALL. WHATEVER THE HELL SHE ASKED FOR. JONI ERNST AND THE GREAT CHUCK GRASSLEY ARE RIGHT NOW IN WASHINGTON FIGHTING FOR FAIRNESS. FIGHTING THE HOAX. FIGHTING FOR ALL OF US. THEY CALLED AND SAID, DO YOU MIND IF WE DO NOT GO TONIGHT? I SAID, I WANT YOU TO BE WHERE YOU ARE. THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR US. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. [CHEERING] CHUCK GRASSLEY, JONI ERNST, THEY WOULD CALL AND SAY, WE HAVE TO HELP OUR FARMERS. THE SPEAKER OF THE IOWA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, A MAN WITH REALLY FANTASTIC GENES, ALTHOUGH YOU HAD AN X GOVERNOR HERE WHO HAD GREAT GENES. THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE PAT GRASSLEY. THOSE TWO YOUNG MEN HAVE THE GREATEST GENES ANYONE HAS EVER HAD FOR POLITICS. [CHEERING] HIS FATHER IS THE AMBASSADOR TO CHINA. DO THINK HE IS HAPPY? I THINK HE IS HAPPY. GREAT GOVERNOR. LONGEST-RUNNING GOVERNOR IN HISTORY. WE HAVE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF IOWA. WE HAVE THE WORLD'S TALLEST CAMPAIGN MANAGER. WHAT A JOB HE DID NEGOTIATING. WE HAVE SOMEBODY YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. SOMEBODY WHO IS A FANTASTIC PERSON. SOMEBODY NAMED SARAH SANDERS. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HER? [CHEERING] COME HERE, SARAH. COME ON. [CHEERING] THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. WE HAVE A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER FROM IOWA, MATT WHITAKER. THANK YOU. VERY POPULAR. SHE WAS A TERRIFIC PERSON. GREAT PERSON. THANKS TO REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, AMERICA NOW HAS THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. NOT EVEN CLOSE. EVERY PRIME MINISTER, PRESIDENT, KING, QUEEN, DICTATOR, THEY ALL SAY, HOW DO YOU DO IT? THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED 7 MILLION NEW JOBS. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION IS LOWER THAN ANY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING] AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, AND ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED. MORE THAN 2 MILLION MILLENNIALS, YOUNG, GREAT PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF FUTURE, THEY HAVE JOBS AND THEIR WAGES HAVE AROUND BY NEARLY 5% ANNUALLY. THAT IS A RECORD. [CHEERING] ANOTHER RECORD IS THAT BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 34, PEOPLE ARE NOW WORKING. THAT IS A RECORD. [CHEERING] UNDER THE SO-CALLED TRUMP ECONOMY, THE LOWEST PAID EARNERS ARE REAPING THE FASTEST GAINS OF ANY GROUP. THAT IS A GREAT THING. THIS IS A BLUE-COLLAR BOOM. THAT IS A GOOD THING. EARNINGS FOR THE BOTTOM 10% ARE RISING FASTER THAN EARNINGS FOR THE TOP 10% FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. INCLUDING THE TAX CUTS, WHICH ARE MASSIVE. AND ALL OF THE REGULATORY CUTS AND OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE GOTTEN. $10,000. IT IS UNTHINKABLE. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE ECONOMY IS DOING SO WELL. LET THE PEOPLE DOWN THE ROAD TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. THOSE TRACTORS THAT I TOLD YOU TO BUY, THEY WILL BE 60 YEARS OLD IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. THEY WILL BE OLD, TIRED, EXHAUSTED. YOUR LAND WILL BE EXHAUSTED. YOU WILL BE EXHAUSTED. WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THE U.S. IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE ON EARTH. BY FAR. WE ARE ALSO PROUDLY PROMOTING AMERICAN ETHANOL. [CHEERING] BIOFUEL, ALSO. THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS WANT TO SHUT DOWN AMERICAN ENERGY. THEY REPRESENT -- SUPPORT REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE IO CORTEZ -- OCASIO-CORTEZ. [BOOING] I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE IT. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, WHICH WOULD CRUSH OUR FARMS, DESTROY OUR WONDERFUL COWS. I LOVE CAL'S. -- COWS. THEY WANT TO KILL OUR COWS. THAT MEANS YOU ARE NEXT. THEY WANT TO WIPE OUT IOWA ETHANOL. BUT WE WILL NEVER LET THAT SIDE GET IN. THAT IS THE LEAST OF IT. I DON'T WANT TO ATTACK THE GREEN NEW DEAL. THEY MIGHT CHANGE IT. I SAID, IT SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY. WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT CLOSELY. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT UNTIL TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY DON'T TELL YOU HOW TOTALLY INSANE IT IS. HOW ABOUT THIS CRAZY SENATOR FROM HAWAII? SHE SAID SHE WAS TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. THAT WOULD MEAN THERE ARE NO MORE AIRPLANES. THEY STARTED SCREAMING AT HER AND HAWAII. HOW THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO GET TO HAWAII? THEY FLY AROUND AND BRAND-NEW GOLF STREAMS ALL OVER THE PLACE -- GULFSTREAMS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. JOBS AND INVESTMENT ARE NOW RUSHING INTO NEWLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. RICH PEOPLE ARE INVESTING VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY. SENATOR TIM SCOTT CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND SAID, I HAVE AN IDEA I'VE WANTED TO DO FOR YEARS. BUT WE HAVE NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT WHO COULD PULL IT OFF. WE DID IT AND THERE IS NOTHING ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN LIKE THIS. MONEY IS BEING POURED INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS INCREDIBLE. POLITICIANS RAN FOR OFFICE PROTECTING -- PROMISING TO PROTECT WORKERS AND FARMERS. BUT THEN THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON AND LOOKED AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL MARBLE COLUMNS AND THE GORGEOUS CEILINGS, THE WAY THEY USED TO BUILD THE BUILDINGS. THEY DON'T BUILD THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WE ARE BUILDING A WALL. OVER 100 MILES LONG ALREADY AND MOVING FAST. THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON AND THEY SOLD YOU OUT. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. GLOBALIST POLITICIANS ALLOWED OTHER COUNTRIES TO ROB OUR WORKERS AND RANSACKED OUR COMMUNITIES. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER. NOW WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, WASHINGTON LOOKED THE OTHER WAY WHILE CHINA'S GOAL ARE -- CHINA STOLE OUR SECRETS. THOSE SECRETS WERE BEING STOLEN. MANY OTHER PLACES WHERE STEALING YOUR SECRETS. OUR NEW AGREEMENT WITH CHINA WILL PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PRY OPEN VAST NEW MARKETS FOR AMERICAN BEEF, POULTRY, PORK, SEAFOOD, RICE, DAIRY, AND SO MUCH MORE. [CHEERING] IT IS TRUE, CHINA IS SO BIG. 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE. WE ARE JUST TOUCHING IT. YOU HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD. IF IT ALL WORKS OUT, IT WILL KEEP EXPANDING. 250 BILLION DOLLARS WILL END UP BEING MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN THAT. [CHEERING] WHEN WE WERE SIGNING, WE WERE ALMOST FINISHED. I ASKED, HOW MUCH ARE THE FARMERS GETTING? THE AMBASSADOR SAID, WE PUT $20 BILLION. I SAID, MAKE IT $50 BILLION. EVEN PEOPLE SAID, WE CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, THAT IS A GOOD PROBLEM. I SAID YOU BETTER MAKE IT 50. I WANT THOSE FARMERS TO COME BACK AND SAY, SIR, WE CANNOT DO IT. WE CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I DON'T THINK THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED. I SAID, THEY WILL FIGURE A WAY. THE USMCA IS ANOTHER COLOSSAL VICTORY FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE, LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE. WE SUFFERED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. THEY SAID, DON'T EVER USE THE WORD SUBSIDY. WE WILL INCREASE TOTAL AGRICULTURE EXPORTS BY MORE THAN $2 BILLION ANNUALLY. INCLUDING HUGE DAIRY AND IOWA DAIRY AND PORK AND POULTRY ALONE. JUSTIN THOSE SMALL AREAS. IT IS CALLED PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. [CHEERING] LAST TIME I CAME, I NEVER DID THIS BEFORE, I NEVER RAN, SO THEY ALL SAID, YOU CANNOT DO THIS. ONE BY ONE THEY STARTED DROPPING OUT. THEN I WAS LEFT WITH ONE, HILLARY CLINTON. THAT WORKED OUT VERY NICE. HE CANNOT GET TO 270. I WENT TO MAINE. A LOT. MANY TIMES. THEY SAID MAYBE, IF YOU HAVE A GREAT NIGHT, 269. BUT I GOT 306. [CHEERING] THEY WERE RIGHT. YOU CANNOT GET TO 270. YOU CAN GET TO 306. IN THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE MY ELECTION, NET FARM INCOME PLUMMETED. IF YOU LOOK AT A CHART, FOR 15 YEARS, IT IS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. SOYBEANS, TAKE A LOOK AT IT ALL. IT WAS A ONE-WAY STREET. EVERYBODY WAS RIPPING OFF THE AMERICAN FARMER. NOW YOU WILL SEE NUMBERS THAT WILL BE GREAT. IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT IS GOING ON. I LOVE IT. YOU DESERVE IT. YOU SUFFERED A LOT. WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE STUPID. THEY WERE STUPID. UNDER THREE YEARS OF MY ADMINISTRATION, NET FARM INCOME HAS ALREADY GONE UP NEARLY 50% AND WILL NOW BE RISING EVEN FASTER. ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR BERNIE? HERE I AM ON THE DEBATE STAGE. NET INCOME HAS GONE UP FOR THE FARMERS 50%. HOW THE HELL DO I LOSE THIS DEBATE? BASED ON THE POLLS, I GUESS I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE IN THE STATE OR ANY OTHER STATE. [CHEERING] THIS IS REALLY TRUE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER, NOT JUST IOWA. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COSTS OUR NATION HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, DRAINS PUBLIC SERVICES, OVER CROWDS OUR SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, AND THREATENS INNOCENT AMERICAN LIVES AT A NUMBER THAT YOU WOULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE. BUT WE HAVE IT CLOSED UP. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. RIGHT HERE IN DES MOINES, A TWICE SUPPORTED -- DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS CHARGED WITH SHOOTING AND KILLING A IN THIS REGION OF THE COUNTY ALONE, 4000 ILLEGAL ALIENS WERE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF ROBBERY, RAPED, AND MURDER. PEOPLE WOULD COME IN BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE. MANY ARE FINE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THAT, BUT SOME ARE STONE COLD RAPISTS AND MURDERERS AND PEOPLE THAT THEIR COUNTRIES DON'T WANT. GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR, AND EVEN MEXICO. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOVE AFFAIR WITH MEXICO BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WOULDN'T GIVE US WHAT WE NEEDED, MEXICO IS GREAT, THEY PUT UP 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. THE NUMBERS ARE PLUMMETING. 87% DOWN. SO THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS DOING A GREAT JOB. AND WE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY? YOU CATCH A CRIMINAL, YOU TAKE THEIR NUMBER, AND YOU RELEASE THEM AND THEY NEVER COME BACK. WE SAY COME BACK, PLEASE, IN THREE YEARS. COME BACK IF YOU DON'T MIND IN THREE YEARS. WE RELEASED THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY. TOTALLY ENDED IT. CATCH AND RELEASE. MAY WE PLEASE HAVE YOUR ADDRESS AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER? WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES. NOW WE ARE GOING TO RELEASE YOU. IN THREE POINT FIVE YEARS WE WILL SCHEDULE A COURT APPEARANCE FOR YOU. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PERRY MASON, YOU TAKE THEM TO COURT. OTHER COUNTRIES THEY CATCH YOU AT THE BORDER AND SAY SORRY, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT. WE SAY, CAN I HAVE YOUR INFORMATION, WE ARE TAKING YOU TO COURT. TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY VILIFIES THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PLEDGES TO DISSOLVE IMMIGRATION CONTROL ENTIRELY. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. THEY WON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY. AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STONE COLD KILLERS. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE CARAVANS. I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME. THEY DON'T GIVE ME CREDIT FOR ANYTHING. THEY DON'T GIVE ME CREDIT FOR FAKE NEWS. THEY TURN THE TERM AROUND. LEFT-WING POLITICIANS EVEN SUPPORT DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE CRIMINAL ALIENS DIRECTLY INTO AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. WE DON'T WANT THEM. IN NEW YORK CITY, THE SANCTUARY POLICY RECENTLY RE-FORCED -- FORCED THE RELEASE OF AN L.A. -- AN ALIEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. THE ICE WARRIORS ARE VERY TOUGH AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE TAKING MS 13 GANG MEMBERS, THEY ARE ABOUT AS TOUGH AS YOU GET. THEY ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. BY THE THOUSANDS. THAT'S A TOUGH JOB, BUT THEY LOVE TO DO IT. SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES ARE IMMORAL AND LETHAL AND THEY REALLY ARE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE STOPPED. THEY HAVE TO BE STOPPED NOW. THANKFULLY HERE IN IOWA, YOUR GREAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS GOVERNOR REYNOLDS, SIGNED A STATEWIDE BAN ON SANCTUARY CITIES. THANK YOU, KIM. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS NATIONWIDE TO END SANCTUARY CITIES IN ALL 50 STATES. THANK YOU, KIM REYNOLDS. YOU KNOW, I ENDORSED HER. SO I WANT TO TAKE FULL CREDIT FOR THE JOB SHE IS DOING. I ENDORSED HER VERY EARLY. SHE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. DEMOCRATS STAND FOR CRIME, CORRUPTION, AND CHAOS. REPUBLICANS STAND FOR LAW, ORDER, AND JUSTICE. WE ARE FINDING THE ILLEGAL GANG MEMBERS, DRUG DEALERS, AND THROWING THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, IDEALLY. WE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM IN PRISON BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS. BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO, THEY ARE TOO DANGEROUS AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS SEVEN STRAIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW AND THEY ARE GETTING LOWER. AND SHOCKINGLY, AS THAT WALL GETS LONGER, THE CROSSINGS GET LESS. REMOVER THE DEMOCRATS, YOU DON'T NEED A WALL. YOU DON'T NEED IT. SEVEN YEARS AGO THEY ALL WANTED A WALL, THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD IT. THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT, BUT I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. THE PROBLEM WAS WE COULDN'T GET THE MONEY, BUT WE'VE GOT ALL THE MONEY WE NEED NOW. AND YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME THEY DIDN'T REALLY FIGHT US ON THE WALL. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY LEARNED IT'S A REALLY BAD ISSUE FOR THEM. BUT I MADE ONE MISTAKE WITH THE WALL. I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NEVER, EVER BUILD A WALL. THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH MONEY TO BUILD THE WALL. BECAUSE I USED TO GO, WE WILL BUILD THE WALL, AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE. WISHED SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NEVER, EVER BUILD A WALL AND THEY WOULD HAVE FORCED US TO BUILD IT AND I WOULD HAVE SAID OK. AND BY THE WAY, IN ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL, RIGHT? THROUGH REMITTANCE, ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM MEXICO ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. 100%. BECAUSE WHEN I SAY SOMETHING, I MEAN IT. I SAID I WAS GOING TO BUILD A WALL. WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTY THAT CONTROLS THE HOUSE, YOU'VE GOT TO END THAT. THEY SAID THEY PICKED UP THE HOUSE IN 2018, BUT I DIDN'T RUN IN 2018. THEY PICKED UP SOME SEATS. I DIDN'T RUN, BUT I'M RUNNING THIS TIME, AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. KEVIN MCCARTHY WILL BE A GREAT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WATCH. BUT GETTING SOMETHING BUILT WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTY THAT CONTROLS ONE OF THE THREE, GETTING IT BUILT -- HONESTLY, I DON'T WANT TO BRAG. NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE DONE IT. AND IT'S THE REAL DEAL, IT'S THE WALL THAT BORDER SECURITY WANTED. REMEMBER I THOUGHT I COULD JUST BE -- BUILD CONCRETE SLABS BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT. THIS IS THE BEST VERSION. IT IS REALLY SOMETHING. DID YOU OTHER -- DID YOU SEE THE OTHER DAY WHEN DRUG DEALERS GOT CAUGHT AND THEY COULDN'T GET OVER IT? WE HAD TO GET THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET OVER IT. IT'S VERY HOT AND VERY TOUGH. IT'S A VERY HARD PANEL TO CLIMB. THEY SAID IT'S ANTI-CLIMB PANEL. OK, LET'S PUT IT UP. THE WALL IS THE TOP OF THE LINE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED. IT'S MAXIMUM AND IT'S REALLY DOING A BIG TRICK. IT'S INCREDIBLE. 99.9%, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS NOW ARE DOWN 75% SINCE LAST SPRING. AND THE POWERFUL BORDER WALL, PRETTY SOON WE WILL BE SETTING RECORDS AND SPEED. IT IS GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY AND YOU ARE SEEING IT ALL OVER AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING. IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE IT, BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. THEY SAID WE COULD HAVE DRONES. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, DRONES FLYING AROUND. AND THEY KNOW BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL FOR IT. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE ALL AGAINST IT. THE DRONES ARE POLICING THE WALL . IN TERMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING, PEOPLE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. THE WORST IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN. BUT WHEN WE HAVE THIS BORDER, IT MAKES IT VERY TOUGH FOR THEM TO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH WOMEN AND WITH CHILDREN STUFFED IN TRUNKS IN THE BACK OF A CAR. AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. 132 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE TO TAKE OVER HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD STRIP ALL OF THOSE 180 MILLION RATE AMERICANS OF YOUR PRIVATE COVERAGE. YOU WANT THAT. YOU GOT GREAT DEALS. YOU ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE, KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, KEEP EVERYTHING YOU WANTED. NOW THEY WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. REPORT TO AN OPERATING ROOM WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD AT YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK IT BECAUSE I WANT BERNIE TO BRING IT RIGHT UP TO THE END AND WE WILL DEBATE IT THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE ARE SAVING YOUR HEALTH CARE WHILE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE. SLEEPY JOE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. HONESTLY, THAT POOR GUY IS SO LOST. IT WAS OVER FOR HIM A LONG TIME AGO. NOW IT'S REALLY OVER. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND CHEAPER. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST UNPOPULAR -- WHICH ESSENTIALLY KILLED OBAMACARE. AND WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WE ALWAYS WILL, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE ARE STOPPING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING AND MAKING EVERYTHING TOTALLY TRANSPARENT, AND I SIGNED IT ALREADY. EVERYTHING NOW IS GOING TO TRANSPARENCY FOR HOSPITALS, DOCTORS, EVERYBODY HAS TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH THINGS ARE COSTING. WATCH THOSE PRICES COME DOWN. I HAVE AN EXPERT ON HEALTH CARE. HE SAID TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE IT IS A BIG DEAL. TRANSPARENCY IS BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE PRICES TUMBLING LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. PEOPLE GO IN FOR A BLOOD TEST AND GET CHARGED $2700. DOWN THE ROAD THEY GET THE SAME EXACT TEST FOR $57. IT'S CRAZY. YOU WATCH. A REAL EXPERT SAID THIS IS BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WON'T RELEASE START KICKING IN UNTIL AFTER -- YOU WON'T REALLY START KICKING IN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. YOU BETTER LET ME WIN. CAN YOU IMAGINE? I DID TRANSPARENCY, AND THEN I'M GOING TO WATCH SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS DIDN'T HE DO A GREAT JOB OF TRANSPARENCY? I WANT THE CREDIT FOR THAT ONE. WE ARE BUYING CHEAPER DRUGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR, WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR PLAN. REMEMBER OBAMA, 28 TIMES, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. YOU CAN ALSO KEEP YOUR PLAN. YOU CAN KEEP IT, YOU CAN KEEP. 28 TIMES HE LIED. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. ESSENTIALLY IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BECAUSE THAT REALLY TOOK THE GUTS OUT OF IT. DO WE RUN IT WELL OR DO WE RUN IT POORLY? IF WE RUN IT POORLY, EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BLAME ME. IF FREE -- IF WE RUN IT WELL, EVERYONE WILL GIVE ME THE CREDIT. WE WILL HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE ARE FIGHTING THE LOBBYISTS AND THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE. THANKS TO OUR BOLD REFORMS WE ARE NOW OFFERING HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE 60% CHEAPER THAN OBAMACARE. WE ARE OFFERING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AND WE HAVE JUST PASSED RECENTLY, 10 MONTHS AGO, RIGHT TO TRIAL. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL AND THEY CANNOT USE MEDICINE. THEY BEEN TRYING TO PASS THIS FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS. WE HAVE THE GREATEST DOCTORS, LABS, HOSPITALS IN THE WORLD. THEY COME UP WITH THE MEDICINES BUT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE FDA PROCEDURE. THEY WON'T LET YOU USE IT. NOW I HAVE YOU SIGN AN AGREEMENT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SUE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY CAN USE IT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE RESULTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE RESULTS. FOR ME, IT WAS SIMPLE. I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT HURTING SOMEBODY. THESE PEOPLE ARE DYING. THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL. THEY ARE ADMITTING THEY ARE TERMINALLY ILL, AND YOU WON'T LET THEM USE A DRUG THAT MAY WORK. LET THEM USE THE DRUG, AND WE ARE LETTING THEM USE THE DRUG, AND IT'S WORKING IN A LOT OF CASES. WE HAVE TRANSFORMED VETERANS HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING BE A CHOICE, THE BEST. I THINK I AM A TOTALLY BRILLIANT HUMAN BEING. SO I CAME UP WITH A PLAN. I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA BECAUSE EVERYBODY KEPT COMING UP TO ME AND SAYING IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH HEALTH CARE. WE ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR TWO WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS, SEVEN WEEKS. THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL BEFORE THEY SAW THE DOCTOR. SO I CAME UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE PLAN. ONLY I COULD THINK OF THIS. HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. IF YOU CAN'T GET TO A DOCTOR QUICKLY, YOU GO OUTSIDE, GO LOCALLY, YOU GET YOURSELF A DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL. I WENT BACK AND TOLD MY PEOPLE, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SMART I AM? THEY SAID WE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THAT PLAN FOR 52 YEARS, WE JUST COULDN'T GET IT APPROVED. I SAID TOO BAD, I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT. BUT I GOT IT APPROVED AND PEOPLE ARE USING IT. AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF I WOULD DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS BUT WE ARE MAKING SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RURAL HEALTH. WE ARE COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 31 YEARS. THAT'S A GREAT THING. AND OUR GREAT FIRST LADY IS HELPING US WITH THAT. THAT IS SUCH A BIG THING FOR MALANI A. SHE IS REALLY INVOLVED. AND WE WILL NEVER LET THE DEMOCRATS GIVE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SAY COME IN, COME IN, WE WILL GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE. LIKE IN CALIFORNIA, THIS WACKY GOVERNOR, HE SAYS COME IN, WERE GOING TO GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION, WE WILL GIVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL ROLLS-ROYCE. ONE OF THE NEWSCASTER SAID DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA PROMISED A ROLLS-ROYCE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THIS WAS A LIE AND MISREPRESENTATION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE HUMOR. THEY CAN'T TAKE IT. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THEY ARE SICK. THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE. AND SHIFTY SCHIFF IS A SICK PERSON. HOW MY GOING TO GET HIM, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG? WHAT IS SICK GUY HE IS. VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT SUPPORTS LATE TERM ABORTION, RIPPING A BABY FROM ITS MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND THE LATE, GREAT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN. REMEMBER I ALWAYS SAID I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY OTHER PAST PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN PERHAPS ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHEN HE IS WEARING THE HAT. BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL BUT I ONLY HAVE ABOUT THREE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME. GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IS EVERYTHING OK IN IOWA? THE WORLD IS RIPPING YOU OFF? THERE'S NOT A THING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. DOING THIS TAKES FAR MORE TALENT THAN DOING THAT. DOING THAT IS VERY EASY. THIS IS NOT EASY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST LEFT MICHIGAN AND YOU JUST LEFT OTHER PLACES. AND YOU HAVE MANIACS DOING A NUMBER ON YOU ALL THE TIME. YOU'VE GOT THE MANIACS FOR THREE YEARS. BEFORE I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH OUR FUTURE FIRST LADY, THESE PEOPLE ARE MANIACS. SO YOU ARE FIGHTING THAT AND YOU ARE DOING FARM BILLS. WE GOT YOUR FARM BILL APPROVED, BY THE WAY. I DON'T EVEN MENTION THAT BUT IT'S PEANUTS COMPARED TO THE CHINA DEAL. REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR CITIZENS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, AND TREE. -- AND CREED. IT'S TRUE. REMEMBER I USED TO SAY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? THE WORST IN CRIME, THE WORST IN EDUCATION. THEY GOT 10 DIFFERENT THINGS, ALL HORRIBLE. ONE DAY I'M IN FRONT OF THIS TREMENDOUS GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M READING THIS LIST. AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE THE HIGHEST CRIME RATE, THE WORST EDUCATION, THE WORST SCHOOLS. STAY WITH ME BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH THE DEMOCRATS FOR 100 YEARS OR MORE. STAY WITH ME. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? AND YOU KNOW WHAT? REMEMBER THAT? AND NOW THEY HAVE THE BEST EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. THEY HAVE THE BEST POVERTY NUMBERS. THEY HAVE NUMBERS THAT NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE. IT IS SO GREAT TO SEE IT. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, AFRICAN-AMERICAN. IT'S BEEN GREAT. WE ARE ASKING ALL AMERICANS TO JOIN OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. WE ARE A BIG TENT AND A BIG PARTY WITH BIG, BOLD, BEAUTIFUL IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. WE ARE WHAT THE COUNTRY WAS BASED ON ORIGINALLY. IT WAS CALLED GREATNESS. AND DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK, WE CONTINUE OUR FIGHT TO RESCUE CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS. IOWA BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO PASS SCHOOL CHOICE. THAT WAS OVER 10 YEARS AGO. GOVERNOR REYNOLDS, SENATOR ERNST, SENATOR GRASSLEY AND MORE THAN 100 SENATORS ARE SUPPORTING OUR PLAN TO GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT. IT'S A GREAT THING. TO GIVE FORMER PRISONERS SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE, WE PASSED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THAT. WE HAD A LOT OF GREAT CONSERVATIVES WHO WANTED IT. LIBERALS WANTED. THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. PRESIDENT OBAMA EVEN COME CLOSE. HE DIDN'T TRY VERY HARD. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 191 FEDERAL JUDGES WHO WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION. AND TO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, BY THE WAY. TWO GREAT ONES. AS PART OF MY COMMITMENT TO REBUILD OUR LUKE PERRY WE SECURED AN $8.5 MILLION FACILITY TO SUPPORT OUR IOWA GUARDSMEN AT CAMP DODGE, RIGHT HERE IN DES MOINES, IOWA. RIGHT HERE, CAMP DODGE. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOAL LINE HEIGHTS. AND YESTERDAY WE JUST RELEASED A HISTORIC NEW PLAN FOR PEACE AND WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET THAT DONE. ONE OF THE TOUGHEST DEALS, BUT WE HAVE A SHOT AT IT. FOR YEARS HE WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR OUR COUNTRY. THEY WOULD SAY I'M SORRY. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF IOWA. WE ARE STANDING UP FOR IOWA. AT STAKE IN OUR PRESENT BATTLE IS THE SURVIVAL FRANKLY OF OUR NATION. I COULD MAKE THIS SPEECH REALLY SHORT. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SAY HELLO, I WILL. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE, YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BUILT FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE WILL BE GONE. GOODBYE, IOWA. INSTEAD, I'M WORKING MY ASS OFF UP HERE. YOU THINK THIS IS EASY? THIS ROOM WASN'T DESIGNED FOR THIS MANY PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR, THEN WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARD VICTORY IN NOVEMBER OF 2020. WE HAVE TO. AND BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE BEAUTIFUL FARMERS THAT WANT TO LEAVE HERE, SMALL FORMS OR BUSINESSES TO YOUR CHILDREN, BECAUSE OF OUR GREAT TAX BILL, THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, THE BIGGEST, THAT YOU BENEFIT BY. BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS NO DEATH TAX OR INHERITANCE TAX ANYMORE. I ALWAYS SAY, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, THAT'S A GREAT THING. IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, DON'T LEAVE IT TO THEM. AND THAT PARTICULAR TAX WON'T MATTER. IS THERE ANYBODY HERE THAT DOES NOT LOVE THEIR CHILDREN? IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO LOVES THEIR CHILDREN? IT IS IOWA, YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN. IN THE OLD DAYS, MEANING BEFORE TRUMP, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, YOU WOULD LEAVE YOUR FARM, THEY WOULD ASSESS YOUR FARM FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT, AND THEY WOULD END UP LOSING THE FARM. AND THEY DID THAT TO PAY THE TAX. NOW YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FARM AND NOT PAY INHERITANCE TAX IN THE STATE. SO WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN AT YOUR CHILDREN, YOU SAY, DID YOU GET LUCKY. LOOK AT THEM, THEY ARE ENJOYING LIFE. BUT IN ONLY THIS WAY CAN WE SAVE THE AMERICA WE LOVE AND DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP ONCE AND FOR ALL. I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD BE THIS SICK AND DEGENERATED. IT IS A DEGENERATE SWAMP. I HAD NO IDEA THE SWAMP WAS THAT PEOPLE, BUT WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE WINNING BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENACT NEW TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS MADE, RAISED, FARMED, AND GROWN RIGHT HERE IN THE USA. WE WILL EACH -- WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS. WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. SHOULD HAVE BEEN STARTED IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. INCREDIBLE. SHOULD HAVE BEEN STARTED EARLIER, BUT WE STARTED IT. IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WILL BE ERADICATED, WILL BE GONE. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE? WHEN THEY CAME IN AND TELL ME THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I SAID REALLY? WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY, THE DEMOCRATS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE ARE ONE GREAT AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAMILIES AND FAITH, NOT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY.

IVANKA HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING, THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO HER. THIS AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE READY TO WORK AND SHE HAS CREATED OVER 15 MILLION JOBS FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, ONE OF THE REASONS EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE THE BEST EVER. 50 MILLION AND I WOULD SAY THIS ISSUE MAY BE CLOSEST TO OUR HEART BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF EVIL YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IS EVEN POSSIBLE IN THE MODERN AGE, THE LEVEL OF EVIL IS INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BOTH OF THE THINGS YOU FOCUSED ON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, APPRECIATE IT. 50 MILLION JOBS, GOING TO BE 500,000. DADDY, I THINK WE CAN DO 500,000 WITHIN A WEEK, SHE BROKE THAT IT IS UP TO 15 MILLION, IT IS FANTASTIC. I'M NOT SURPRISED, MIKE, NOT SURPRISED. WE ARE ALSO HONORED TO HAVE WITH THE SEVERAL EXTRAORDINARY SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU WILL COME UP WHEN WE SIGN IT WILL BE MY GREAT HONOR TO SAY HELLO AND SHAKE YOUR HAND IN YOUR COURAGE INSPIRES US ALL I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. IS THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS ROOM NOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE. WORLDWIDE PROBLEM HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS WORSE THAN EVER BEFORE AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. I HEARD FROM WILLIAM BARR AND OTHERS THE INTERNET HAS CAUSED LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO HAPPEN LOTS OF REALLY BAD THINGS IN THIS IS THE WORST OF THE BAD THINGS AND IT IS AN INCREDIBLE THING, ESTIMATED 25 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TODAY ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE, AND A BELATED, ABUSED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. IN 2018 ALONE THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE IDENTIFIED OVER 23,000 HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES, 65% OF THESE VICTIMS WERE WOMEN, MORE THAN ONE IN 5 WERE CHILDREN, HUMAN TRAFFICKERS PRAY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS AND PEOPLE, THEY ARE VICIOUS, THEY ARE VIOLENT. MY ADMINISTRATION IS FIGHTING THESE MONSTERS PERSECUTING AND PROSECUTING THEM AND LOCKING THEM AWAY FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS TRACK RECORD, THE BEST TRACK RECORD IN A LONG TIME. WE ARE DISMANTLING THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE LARGE-SCALE HUMAN TRAFFICKING POSSIBLE. IN MY FIRST MONTH IN OFFICE I INSTRUCTED FEDERAL AGENCIES TO GO OUT AND JUST DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, ALL FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY DO TO IDENTIFY AND DESTROY THESE GROUPS AND WE ARE DESTROYING A LOT OF THEM. THEY COME BACK QUICKLY IN DIFFERENT FORM. IN 2018 THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHUTDOWN THE LEADING SITE FOR ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING, THE DOJ PROSECUTED A NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES. THAT IS NOW A RECORD NUMBER. ISIS ARRESTED OVER 5000 TRAFFICKERS. THESE ARE GREAT GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE BRAVE AND LOVE OUR COUNTRY. OVERSEAS WE HAVE SEEN HISTORIC PROGRESS WORKING WITH US AND USING OUR INTELLIGENCE WITH THEM. ISIS CONTROL 20,000 SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY AND PERPETRATED SOME OF THE MOST HEINOUS FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE TOTALLY DEFEATED THE ISIS CALIPHATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND IT IS 100%. WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS, ISIS PRISONERS AND IT HAS REALLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN RATHER INCREDIBLE AND WE DID THAT RATHER QUICKLY BECAUSE WHEN WE CAME IN AS AN ADMINISTRATION IT WAS ALL OVER AND WE HAVE 100% OF THE CALIPHATE. THEY ARE BLOODTHIRSTY, THEY ARE HORRIBLE, THE FOUNDER AND LEADER, OUR BAGHDADI, TRYING TO REBUILD ISIS IS NOW DEAD, GOT HIM AND THAT WAS A BIG THING. THAT WAS A BIG THING AND NOT AN EASY THING. HE WAS HIDING A HAVE BEEN AFTER HIM FOR 15 YEARS BUT WE GOT HIM. MY ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE ON TRAFFICKERS AT HOME AND ABROAD AND WE ARE FREEING INNOCENT VICTIMS AT EVERY SINGLE TURN. I WAS PROUD TO BE THE FIRST COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO ATTEND A MEETING OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ESTABLISHED BY THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2000. IN NOVEMBER I WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE ON MISSING AND MURDERED AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES, JUST SIGNED IT. AND THIS HAS A SPECIAL FOCUS ON WOMEN AND GIRLS, AN INCREDIBLE THING THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING, WE JUST SIGNED IT. I HAVE SIGNED 9 PIECES OF BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION AIMED AT HUMAN TRAFFICKING, DOMESTICALLY AND AROUND THE GLOBE AND IN 2018 I SIGNED LEGISLATION STRENGTHENING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S. CAMPAIGN WHICH UNIFIED THE DEPARTMENT'S FIGHT AGAINST THIS CRISIS AND INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE HAVE SIGNED MORE LEGISLATION ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION HAS EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT. WE AND ACTED - WE , [APPLAUSE] , AND WE WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY AND WE WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY. THERE'S NOTHING MORE HORRIBLE THAN THIS. WE ENACTED BILLS TO FIGHT SEX TRAFFICKING, INCREASE SUPPORT FOR SURVIVORS AND RAISE THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WE JUDGE WHETHER OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MEETING THEIR DUTY TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING, YOU HAVE COUNTRIES THAT TALK AND THEY TALK, THEY ARE LIKE POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, THEY KEEP TALKING, THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AND WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND WE LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. IN SOME CASES PROBABLY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB AND THAT IS A PRETTY BAD THING. WE AUTHORIZED $430 MILLION TO FIGHT SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING AND WITH THE HELP OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, I HAVE HELD FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO ADDRESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING BY IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND POWERFUL RESEARCH. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALSO PRIORITIZED INCREASING FUNDING FOR ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS IN MY 2021 BUDGET ALLOCATING $70 MILLION TOWARD ENHANCED PROSECUTIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND WE ARE SPENDING $123 MILLION TOWARD SUPPORTING STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS ALL NEW FUNDING AND THESE FUNDS WILL BENEFIT THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES WHO ARE TASKED WITH BRINGING DOWN THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS TERRIBLE CRIME SO THE KIND OF MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS FAR GREATER THEN YOU HAVE HAD IN THE PAST, LET ME GIVE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK SO HARD IN THIS ADMINISTRATION CREDIT BECAUSE THEY HAVE WANTED TO DO IT MORE THAN THE PEOPLE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING ADMINISTRATION AND YOU CAN READ WHAT YOU WANT, YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT BUT NOBODY HAS DONE MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. [APPLAUSE] TODAY ON THE LAST YEAR OF NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH I WILL TAKE ANOTHER VERY DECISIVE ACTION IN A FEW MOMENTS. I WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CHILD EXPLOITATION ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A VERY BIG ONE. THIS ORDER WILL BUILD ON AN INCREDIBLE WORK, THE UNBELIEVABLE WORK SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE BEEN DOING AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND INCREASINGLY IS BEING DONE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE HAVE. I HAVE MANY ISSUES, ECONOMIC, WE HAVE ALL DIFFERENT ISSUES. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH ENTHUSIASM FOR A SINGLE ISSUE AS I HAVE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO SAY THAT STARTS WITH WILLIAM BARR AND CHRIS RAY, THE FBI, STARTS WITH ALL THE PEOPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, SO IMPORTANT, SOMETHING PEOPLE REALLY DO APPRECIATE SO THEY COLLECT AND THEY COORDINATE, SHARE VITAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH OTHER PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND VERY IMPORTANT, WE HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT, THE PROBLEM IS IT IS SO MASSIVE, SO MANY PEOPLE, SO MANY COUNTRIES, WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. IT WILL BE POSTED ONLINE ALONG WITH A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES, ALL OF THE THINGS WE DO AND WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS ORDER EXPANDS PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAMS, PROMOTE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SURVIVORS AND PRIORITIZES THE REMOVAL OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL FROM THE INTERNET. [APPLAUSE] AND TAKES THE VITAL STEP OF DESIGNATING A FULL-TIME POSITION AT THE WHITE HOUSE DEDICATED SOLELY TO COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO PEOPLE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND IN CONSULTATION WITH INDUSTRY ON A SET VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLE. WE HAVE A SET OF VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLES TO TACKLE ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE AND THE LEVEL OF DETAIL, THE KIND OF THINGS THEY ARE PUTTING IN, NOBODY HAS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. PEOPLE WORKING ON IT DO IT WITH HEART AND LOVE AND WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE WASTING TIME LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MANY YEARS EVEN PEOPLE IN THIS POSITION, HAVE BEEN WASTING TIME AND NOT A LOT OF MONEY. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY. WE ARE NOW SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO LAUNCHING THESE PRINCIPLES IN THE COMING MONTHS. WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE HAVE STOPPED EVERY LAST HUMAN TRAFFICKERS LIBERATED EVERY LAST SURVIVOR. [APPLAUSE] GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR ORGANIZING THIS IMPORTANT EVENT. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT. AT AGE 13 I WAS BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY. I SURVIVE TRAFFICKING WITH 19 OTHER GIRLS. "AFTER WORDS" I WAS PLACED IN FOSTER CARE BUT THIS NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE IN MY PAST SHOULD NOT WHOLLY DEFINE WHO I AM TODAY. TODAY I AM A COLLEGE GRADUATE, AND AMERICAN CITIZEN AND I STAND BEFORE YOU AS THE REST MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. [APPLAUSE] THE COUNCIL IS COMPOSED OF SURVIVOR LEADERS TO BRING EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT, TASK FORCE, TO MONITOR AND COMBAT TRAFFICKING, WE REPRESENT A DIVERSE RANGE OF BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCES AND WE ARE SINCERELY GRATEFUL TO THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND IMPROVE TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. WE VIEW THIS AS BIG FOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS COUNCIL IS A MODEL FOR SURVIVOR EMPOWERMENT AND SURVIVORS APPROACHING OTHER COUNTRIES, STATES AND LOCALITIES WE LEARN FROM AND ADAPT. THIS COUNCIL SHOWS A REAL AND TANGIBLE WAY HOW SURVIVORS CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT TRAFFICKING EFFORTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. TO TRULY BE INFORMED MEANS NOT ONLY PRIORITIZE THE SERVICE DELIVERY, MUST ALSO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION TO STAY INFORMED OF DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VERY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT US. NO SURVIVORS SHOULD BE VIEWED BY THE LATEST APPEARANCES. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRIDES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING AS WELL AS THAT OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH A TASK FORCE TO REALIZE THE GOALS OF THE TV PA AND WE ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO REVIEW OUR ANNUAL REPORT WHICH WILL BE RELEASED IN APRIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. TO END I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A STATEMENT FROM THE HONORABLE JUDGE ALONE ROBERTS TO THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OUT THERE. IT IS NEVER YOUR FAULT NO MATTER WHAT SO LET GO OF THAT SHAME. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU. YOU ARE NEVER TOO OLD, TOO LOST OR TOO BROKEN TO BEGIN HEALING TODAY. HOPE STARTS AS SMALL AS A MUSTARD SEED, IT WILL SAVE YOU AND MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU ARE NOT ALONE, YOU ARE NOT ALONE, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] MISTER PRESIDENT, ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, IVANKA, CABINET SECRETARIES, MEMBERS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC CORPS INCLUDING AMBASSADOR GINGRICH, DISTINCT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR SO MANY YEARS WITH SUCH HEART AND COMPASSION, MEMBERS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND FAITH LEADERS AND MOST ESPECIALLY BELLA AND COURAGEOUS SURVIVORS WHO JOIN US HERE TODAY, IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ON THIS HISTORIC DAY.

THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS HIT THE LOWEST RATES IN HALF A CENTURY. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION IS LOWER THAN ANY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE? THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING. THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN-AMERICANS HAS REACHED RECORD LOWS, ALL-TIME, NEVER BEEN LOWER THAN WHAT IT IS NOW. AND BY THE WAY, OUR POLL NUMBERS, WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS, WITH HISPANIC AMERICANS, WITH ASIAN AMERICANS, THE OTHER SIDE'S GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS, BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE ROCKET SHIPS, THEY ARE GOING UP. AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, SO IMPORTANT, IT WAS A HORRIBLE NUMBER IF YOU YEARS AGO. A TERRIBLE THING THAT WAS HAPPENING. IT'S JUST REACHED THE LOWEST IN THE HISTORY, LOWEST, THE BEST NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND AFRICAN AMERICAN POVERTY NUMBERS HAVE HIT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. WAGES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS HAVE INCREASED BY $2400 PER YEAR, ALSO A RECORD. AND YOU KNOW THIS, FOR DECADES, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BETRAYED AFRICAN AMERICANS, THEY BETRAYED US ALL, THEY BETRAYED ALL OF US, BUT WE ARE DELIVERING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, WE ARE DELIVERING FOR ASIAN AMERICANS, AND HISPANIC AMERICANS LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER DONE, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR GREAT JOBS, GREAT SCHOOLS, GREAT HEALTH CARE AND A TRULY GREAT FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR THEM. WE ARE THE PARTY OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS. TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES, WE HAVE REDUCED THE COST OF CHILDCARE, EXPANDED PAID LEAVE, AND GIVEN 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AND AVERAGE OF $2200 MORE IN THEIR POCKETS THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE CUT MORE JOB KILLING REGULATIONS THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION, YOU KNOW THIS ONE, SO YOU GO BACK FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS, IN ONE CASE, LONGER THAN EIGHT YEARS, WE HAVE CUT MORE JOB KILLING REGULATIONS THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND WE ARE NOT FINISHED. AND WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR ENERGY AWAY, THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR WEALTH AWAY, THEY WANT TO GIVE US WIND, WIND, IF IT BLOWS WONDERFUL, IF IT DOESN'T BLOW YOU HAVE PROBLEMS. WIND. THEY WANT TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY SITES AND PUT WINDMILLS ALL OVER. WATCH YOUR HOUSE GO DOWN IN VALUE. YOU EVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS? THEY BUILD A WINDMILL BETWEEN A DISTANCE OF YOUR HOUSE, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT YOUR HOUSE. YOU CAN JUST SAY, THAT WAS THE END OF THAT INVESTMENT. YOU WANT TO SEE A BIRD GRAVEYARD? GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE , OF A WINDMILL, TAKE A LOOK. IT'S A GRAVEYARD FOR BIRDS, THEY KILL ALL THE BIRDS, LOWER UTILITY BILLS, REDUCING PRICES AT THE PUMP, THAT'S WHAT WERE DOING , THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE REVERSED DECADES OF KILOMETERS TRADE POLICY, WASHINGTON POLITICIANS, YOU KNOW THIS, THEY SHUTTERED NEW HAMPSHIRE FACTORIES. YOU ARE ONE OF THE WORST EXAMPLES. WHAT NAFTA DID TO YOUR COMMUNITIES AND TO YOUR STATE IS INCREDIBLE, SHATTERED YOUR COMMUNITIES AND SACRIFICED YOUR JOBS ON THE PROMISE OF GLOBALISM, YOU CAN FORGET GLOBALISM, WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NEW HAMPSHIRE ALONE LOST ONE IN FOUR MINUTES AFTER AN JOBS FOLLOWING THE DISASTER OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, ONE OF THE TRULY BAD DEALS EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FOR DECADES, POLITICIANS CAMPAIGNED ACROSS THE STATE PROMISING TO REPLACE NAFTA. THEY LIED. THEY NEVER DID IT, THEY DIDN'T TRY TO DO IT. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ANYWAY. BUT THEN THEY GOT ELECTED AND THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER POLITICIANS. I KEEP MY PROMISES. WE TOOK CARE OF IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LAST MONTH, YOU SAW , BING, BYE BYE. I SAY DONALD J. TRUMP, BYE-BYE NAFTA. WE ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, AND I SIGNED A BRAND-NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR MANUFACTURERS, OUR FARMERS, GREAT FOR EVERYBODY, GREAT FOR OUR WORKERS. THE USMCA WILL BRING JOBS BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, RIGHT WHERE THEY BELONG, THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE. PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I RAN FOR OFFICE. I AM ONE FOR ONE, I HAVE FRIENDS, SOME OF THESE GREAT SENATORS, LOOK AT LINDSEY OVER THERE, LOOK AT RAND. GREAT SENATORS. I SHOULD RUN FIVE TIMES. OTHER SENATORS SAID, SURE I WON SEVEN TIMES SIR, I'VE WON SEVEN TIMES SIR, AND I'VE WORKED FIVE OF THOSE DAMN CONTESTS. I SAID I RAN ONCE, AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN TWICE. ALTHOUGH THEY THINK WE ARE GOING TO RUN, IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF THE FAKE NEWS, I WILL TELL YOU. THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE. I ALSO TOOK THE STRONGEST EVER ACTION TO CONFRONT CHINA'S MASSIVE THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS. AND OUR STRATEGY WORKED. MASSIVE TARIFFS, AND TARIFF MONEY IS POURING IN AND HAS POURED IN BY THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS. WE NEVER TOOK IN TEN CENTS FROM CHINA, THEY RIPPED US SO MUCH YOU AND BELIEVE, IT NOW THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. LAST MONTH, WE SIGNED A GROUNDBREAKING, TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WILL DEFEAT SO MANY OF OUR OPPONENTS. THE MONEY THAT IS POURING IN, PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW, AND BY THE WAY, THE VIRUS, THEY'RE WORKING HARD, IT LOOKS LIKE BY APRIL, YOU KNOW IN THEORY, WHEN IT GETS A LITTLE WARMER, MIRACULOUSLY IT GOES AWAY, I HOPE THAT'S TRUE, BUT WERE DOING , WE ARE DOING GREAT IN OUR COUNTRY. WE SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT XI. THEY ARE WORKING VERY HARD. IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT FINE. THEY'RE ALL GETTING BETTER BUT OUR TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA WILL DEFEND OUR WORKERS, PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND BOOST EXPORTS OF AMERICAN MADE MADE GOODS, ISN'T THAT NICE? AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. ON NO ISSUE OF WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS THOROUGHLY SOLD OUT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE THING CALLED IMMIGRATION, RIGHT? BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE, THE FAR-LEFT'S POLICY OF OPEN BORDERS ALLOWED DEADLY DRUGS TO FLOW FREELY INTO OUR COUNTRY, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. I SEE THEM CAMPAIGNING RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. IT'S REALLY BORING TO WATCH, BUT I TRY AND WATCH. I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO WATCH, REALLY BORING STUFF. BUT THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. THEY WANT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT THE BORDER INTO OUR COUNTRY. MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR, OK? I MEAN, MURDERERS, RAPISTS, AND SOME OTHER THINGS, THEY'RE GOING TO BE POISONING OUR CHILDREN WITH DRUGS, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND YOU HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRUG PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTRY. WE BROUGHT IT DOWN 18%, BUT WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. 18%. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS PUT THE NEEDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEFORE THE WELL-BEING OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY WANT TO LET ANYONE INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, JUST COME ON IN FOLKS, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU FREE HEALTH CARE, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU FREE EDUCATION. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE THAN OUR VETERANS ARE GETTING, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU EVERY FAMILY WILL GET A FREE ROLLS-ROYCE. YOU KNOW I SAID THAT, MATT, I SAID THAT TO THEM, AND SOME OF THE FAKE NEWS PICKED IT UP, AND THEY SAID, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID EVERY FAMILY COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY GETS A BRAND-NEW FREE ROLLS-ROYCE. HE LIED, HE LIED, HE LIED , THEY GAVE ME A PINOCCHIO. THEY DON'T GET IT, ACTUALLY THEY GET BETTER THAN WE UNDERSTAND, THEY GET IT VERY WELL, THEY GET IT, THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THE WALL IS BEING BUILT, I WILL TELL, YOU THE WALL IS BEING BUILT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW, THEY WENT AFTER US, SAYING EVERYBODY KNOWS THE WALL IS GOING UP. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING, YOU DO KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL, DON'T YOU? REDEMPTION FROM ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT ARE COMING IN. THE REDEMPTION MONEY IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. IT'S SO SAD TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE , FINALLY, THEY GO, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ENTIRE PARTY, SAYS THEY WILL GIVE YOU ANYTHING I WANT MILITARY WILL REBUILD ITS TOO PREFECTURAL AND DOLLARS. IT CAN BE ANYTHING, BUT NOT $.10 FOR THE WALL. THEY SAY WE LIKE DRONES. WHERE GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS DRONE. NO GOOD. SO WE HAVE NOW BUILT OVER 100 MILES OF WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE THAT WALL BUILT, YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT DON'T COME IN. THEY CAN'T COME IN, THEY DON'T COME IN. WE HAVE OVER 100, SUBSTANTIALLY OVER 100 MILES OF WALL, AND WE HAVE CLOSE TO 500 MILES OF WALL IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. AND BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE TO SEE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT WALL GOES UP. YOU HAVE TO SAY THE NUMBERS CHANGE LIKE MAGIC. THEY CHANGE LIKE MAGIC. IT'S CALLED , YOU KNOW, DO YOU EVER HEAR THE THING, WITH ALL THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY, ALL OF THE NEW COMPUTERS, THE NEW, EVERYTHING CYBER, THIS CYBER THAT, TWO THINGS NEVER CHANGE, I , A WHEEL AND A WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RIGHT? A WHEEL AND A WALL. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF BRILLIANT PEOPLE WORKING OVER THE YEARS, THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO REPLACE THE WHEEL OR THE WALL. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING IN, COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, VERY FEW ARE GETTING IN RIGHT NOW. MEXICO HAS BEEN TERRIFIC. WE HAVE 27,000 MEXICAN SOLDIERS AT THE BORDER, AND THE NUMBERS WENT DOWN 87% FROM THIS YEAR AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND SUPPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WE COULD REBUILD THE CITIES IN AMERICA. PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING TO ME FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE RALLIES, READ THE SNAKE. THE SNAKE. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT? SHE KNOWS, SHE'S BEEN STANDING OUTSIDE FOR FOUR DAYS, NO WONDER. AND YOU LOOK GOOD, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. FOUR DAYS OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN AND SNOW , LOOK AT THESE FRONT ROW PEOPLE. THESE ARE WARRIORS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY ARE WARRIORS, TOO, LIKE MY CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS. THEY MENTIONED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THIS IS ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THIS IS A SONG FROM THE 1950'S, AL GREEN. THEY MENTIONED LITTLE CHANGES TO IT, THAT'S OK, BUT THEY MENTIONED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, RIGHT? I USED TO DO THIS A LOT. PEOPLE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A WHILE. I THOUGHT I WOULD DO IT TONIGHT, BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE EVE OF GIVING US AN OPPONENT, AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WANT OPEN BORDERS, THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, AND WE DON'T WANT OPEN BORDERS. WE WANT VERY STRONG, CLOSED BORDERS. AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY WANT TO COME IN THROUGH MERIT, AND WE WANT THEM TO COME IN LEGALLY, RIGHT? THROUGH MERIT AND LEGALLY. RIGHT? SO WE WILL DO THIS QUICKLY, THIS IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT'S CALLED , OH, LISTEN TO HOW QUIET IT IS. LISTEN TO HOW QUIET. WATCH HOW QUIET IT GETS. IT GETS SO QUIET. BUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT , I LOVE YOU, TOO. IT WAS A GUY THAT SAID THAT, BUT I LOVE HIM, TOO. I LOVE EVERYBODY. READY? SO IMPORTANT, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, ON OUR WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH, ALONG THE LAKE, A TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HIS PRETTY COLORED SKIN HAD BEEN ALL FROSTED, WITH THE DUE, POOR THINGS SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN, AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED THE VICIOUS SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP ALL COZY IN A COMFORTER OF SILK AND LAID HIM BY HER FIRESIDE WITH SOME HONEY AND SOME MILK, SHE HEARD HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT. , SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT, AND AS SOON AS SHE ARRIVED, SHE FOUND THAT PRETTY SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD BEEN FULLY, FULLY REVIVED. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED THAT VICIOUS SNAKE. SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO HER BOSOM, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL SHE CRIED, BUT IF I HADN'T BROUGHT YOU WIN , YOU IN BY NOW, YOU TRULY WOULD HAVE DIED. SHE STROKE HIS PRETTY SKIN AGAIN AND KISSED, HIM AND HELD HIM TIGHT, BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU, THE SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. I SAVED YOU, CRIED THE WOMAN, AND YOU HAVE BEEN MAY, BUT , BITTEN ME, BUT WHY? YOU KNOW YOUR BITE IS POISONOUS, AND NOW I'M GOING TO DIE. SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN, SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIN. YOU KNEW DAMN WELL I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOTTA COME IN LEGALLY AND THROUGH MERIT UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE FINALLY TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN CITIZENS FIRST, INCLUDING MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC AMERICANS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN THIS REGION OF THE COUNTRY ALONE, LAST YEAR, ICE OFFICERS , WE LOVE OUR ICE OFFICERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE THEM. THE DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE. ICE OFFICERS ARE THE TOUGHEST HUMAN BEINGS. THEY LOVE THE COUNTRY AS MUCH AS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. LAST YEAR ALONE, THEY ARRESTED OVER 2000 CRIMINAL ALIENS, CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF DANGEROUS OFFENSES, INCLUDING ROBBERY, RATE, AND MURDER OVER 2000 ACCUSED OF MURDER. YET LEFT-WING POLITICIANS SUPPORT SANCTUARY CITIES. RELEASE CRIMINAL ALIENS DIRECTLY INTO THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ONE OF MY GUESTS IN THE STATE OF THE UNION WAS AMERICAN CITIZEN, JODY JONES , JODI JONES, HIS BELOVED BROTHER, ROCKY, WAS MURDERED BY A CRIMINAL ALIEN IN CALIFORNIA, SHOT HIM EIGHT TIMES , CLOSE RANGE, WOULD NOT STOP. ROCKY'S KILLER HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED MANY MANY TIMES, BUT UNDER CALIFORNIA'S TOTALLY INSANE AND OUTRAGEOUS LAW, AUTHORITIES WERE ORDERED TO SET HIM FREE. TRAGICALLY, LEFT-WING POLITICIANS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRY TO REPLICATE CALIFORNIA'S DISASTROUS POLICIES. LAST YEAR, THE DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED NEW HAMPSHIRE HOUSE BLOCKED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED SANCTUARY CITIES IN YOUR STATE. AND BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. HE IS ON TOP OF IT. HE IS ON TOP OF IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND HIS FATHER IS A GREAT GUY. HIS FATHER DIDN'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH IF YOU YEARS AGO. ONCE, HE WAS GOOD, HE FOUGHT LIKE HELL FOR US, ALL OF US, GREAT FAMILY. CHRIS IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN SANCTUARY CITIES, IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR LOVED ONES, YOU MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN IN 2020, NOVEMBER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS EIGHT STRAIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN NOW AT RECORD NUMBERS, AND WE HAVE ENDED CATCHER RELEASE. YOU KNOW WHAT CATCH AND RELEASE THIS? YOU CATCH AN ILLEGAL ALIEN BY LAW, YOU THEN TAKE HIS NAME AND ADDRESS, WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS? WHAT? THEY DON'T HAVE ADDRESSES. THEY COME INTO THE COUNTRY, THEY DON'T HAVE ADDRESSES. THEY TAKE HIS THEM, THEN YOU HAVE TO RELEASE HIM INTO THE COUNTRY. AND YOU SAY, WE WILL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS FOR YOUR COURT CASE. WE NEVER SEE THEM. THEY NEVER COME BACK. WE HAVE DEPORTED RECORD NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS, MS-13 BY THE THOUSANDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE DONE MORE TO SECURE THE BORDER OF OUR COUNTRY THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY. REMEMBER THIS. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. TAKING THEIR CUES FROM CRAZY BERNIE. 132 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER THAT WOULD STRIP 180 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR VERY, VERY COVETED PRIVATE COVERAGE. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WANTS TO RUN YOUR HEALTH CARE, BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN RUN A CAUCUS IN IOWA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, IT IS A WEEK. A WEEK. I TURNED ON AT 7:00, I WANTED TO SEE WHO WON, THEY SAID THERE IS A LITTLE PROBLEM. LITTLE DID THEY KNOW, THERE'S ANYBODY WHO WON IOWA. I DON'T KNOW, DOES ANYBODY KNOW? DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO WON IOWA? LINDSAY, YOU ARE A TOTAL PRO. NOBODY KNOWS. FLIP A COIN. FLIP A COIN. FLIP A COIN, THEY'RE GONNA RUN YOUR HEALTH CARE. UNBELIEVABLE, NOBODY KNOWS WHO WON. ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM BERNIE AGAIN. I THINK BERNIE CAME IN SECOND, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY ARE DOING IT TO YOU AGAIN, BERNIE, THEY ARE DOING IT TO YOU AGAIN. WE ARE SAVING YOUR HEALTH CARE WHILE THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND MUCH, MUCH CHEAPER. YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE DID. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WE ALWAYS WILL. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ALWAYS WILL. ALWAYS WILL. [APPLAUSE] AND WE GOT RID OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR THING AND THE HEALTH CARE WORLD, THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. WE HAD TO PAY A FORTUNE NOT TO HAVE , YOU PAID A FORTUNE NOT TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR BAD HEALTH CARE. WE GOT RID OF IT. WE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE STOPPING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS AND MAKING EVERYTHING TRANSPARENT. THAT IS BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE, TRANSPARENCY. THAT WILL GO UNFORTUNATELY, INTO EFFECT RIGHT AROUND THE ELECTION TIME. IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD GET IN EARLIER, BUT IT'S ALL DONE. IT'S ALL SIGNED. BECAUSE ONE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE PRICES ARE, THOSE PRICES ARE GOING TO COME TUMBLING DOWN. THE BLOOD TESTS IS AN EXAMPLE. ONE HOSPITAL HAS THEM FOR $53. ANOTHER HOSPITAL, THE SAME TEST, $2415. SAME EXACT TEST. IT MAY BE EVEN BETTER. WHO KNOWS? MORE GENERIC DRUGS THAN EVER BEFORE AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS GOOD. WHERE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN. REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA? YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR , THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT VERY GOOD. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM FOR THAT. WHY ARE WE NOT IMPEACHING HIM? 20TH EIGHT TIMES, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. WE SHOULD IMPEACH PRESIDENT OBAMA. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME. OPEN BORDERS, LATE TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND THE LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. RIGHT? ABRAHAM.

AND WE ARE THE PARTY THAT PEOPLE LIKE. WE ARE THE HOT PARTY. WHERE THE PARTY WITHOUT ALL THE ENTHUSIASM. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE, BECAUSE NO PARENT SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE PASSED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM TO GIVE FORMER PRISONERS IS SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. PRISONERS NEVER REALLY HAD A SHOT. THEY GET OUT, THEY COULDN'T THAT I DON'T KNOW MATTER WHAT THEY DID. THEY WOULD GO BACK TO THEIR WAYS. IN MANY CASES, I GUESS THEY HAD NO CHOICE. IT WAS A DISASTER. NOW THEY ARE GETTING OUT. AND BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY IS SO GOOD AND BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND OTHER THINGS LIKE OPPORTUNITY ZONES, ETC., THEY ARE GETTING JOBS, AND EMPLOYERS ARE LOVING THEM. THEY ARE DOING GREAT. THEY ARE DOING GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY ARE DOING GREAT, FIRST TIME EVER THEY ARE NOT GOING BACK.

I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. AND WEWE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT FOR 52 YEARS AND WE GOT IT DONE. FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED , THEY WENT OUT , I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THE UNITED STATES. NO, NO, WE DON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE] NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] AT STAKE IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. IF YOU WEREN'T YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR TO SECURE, THAN WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY NOVEMBER 3, 2020. ON THE THIS WAY CAN WE SAVE THE AMERICA WE LOVE AND DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND IT WILL TELL YOU, THAT SWAMP IS MUCH WORSE THAN I THOUGHT WHEN I WAS OUT HERE INNOCENTLY CAMPAIGNING. LET'S DRAIN THE SWAMP. IT IS A LOT WORSE THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT. THAT SWAMP IS A DIRTY SWAMP. [CHANTING "DRAIN THE SWAMP!"] THAT IS A DIRTY SWAMP. SOME REALLY EVIL, DIRTY, HORRIBLE PEOPLE.

WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAMILIES, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AND AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [CHEERS] AND WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, "IN GOD WE TRUST."

WE HAVE NOT HAD AN EMPTY SEAT SINCE YOUR GREAT FIRST LADY CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH ME AT TRUMP TOWER A LONG TIME AGO. FROM OUR RULE COMMUNITIES TO OUR INNER CITIES, WE ARE EXPANDING THE BLESSINGS OF AMERICA TO ALL OF OUR CITIZENS. WE ADDED 225,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH ALONE. YOU SAW THAT. YOU SAW THAT LAST MONTH THAT WE ARE DOING , THEY WERE DOING PREDICTIONS ON ONE OF THE SHOWS. I THINK 60,000. I THINK 100,000. I THINK 84,000. THESE ARE THE ONES THAT TELL YOU ALL ABOUT HOW TO INVEST. AND THEN THEY CAME OUT, 225,000 AND THE MARKET GOES UP AGAIN. 225,000, SO MANY MANUFACTURING JOBS. REMEMBER THIS, WE ARE PAYING INTEREST. THE PAST ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PAY INTEREST. THEY PUMPED MONEY AND LIKE IT WAS CANDY AND WE DID NOT PUMP MONEY AND, WE TOOK MONEY OUT. NOT THAT I WAS HAPPY ABOUT THAT. IF WE KEPT THE OLD PRACTICE, WHICH, FRANKLY, SOME PEOPLE CAN DISPUTE, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN UP ANOTHER 10,000 POINTS IN THE DOW AND WE HAVE SET 144 RECORDS ON THE STOCK MARKET IN THREE YEARS. 144 RECORDS. 144 RECORDS, RECORD STOCK MARKETS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? THAT IS YOUR 401(K)S ARE UP. GUYS COME UP TO ME AND SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU, MY WIFE USED TO LOOK LIKE ME LIKE I WAS A TOTAL LOSER, SIR. EVERY YEAR WE LOST MONEY. SHE SAID, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, HENRY? THIS YEAR, SIR, I AM UP 92%. SHE LOVES ME AGAIN AND SHE THINKS I'M A GENIUS. 92%, 401K. SHE THINKS I'M A GENIUS. SHE LOVES ME AGAIN AND IT SHOWS WHAT MONEY CAN DO. THAT MAKES 7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE WE WERE ELECTED. WE WERE ELECTED. WHEN I TOOK OVER, I WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE IMMEDIATELY STARTED , WE HAVE DESTROYED 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE. WE HAVE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS. HE IS DEAD. AND WE JUST TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S TOP TERRORIST, ENDING HIS EVIL REIGN OF TERROR FOREVER. THE FAKE NEWS DOES NOT WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU. REMEMBER THE DOG CONAN. WHEN WE TOOK OUT AL-BAGHDADI, CONAN GOT MORE PUBLICITY THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT'S OK. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AL-BAGHDADI FOR 16 YEARS AND WE FOUND HIM AND TOOK HIM OUT. LAST WEEK, WE KILLED ANOTHER ONE, THE HEAD OF AL QAEDA. GONE, DEAD. AND AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN, RESPECTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN. WE ARE NO LONGER THE LAUGHINGSTOCK THAT GETS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF EVERY COUNTRY, INCLUDING BY OUR ALLIES, WHO TAKE MORE ADVANTAGE THAN OUR ENEMIES. THEY TAKE BIG ADVANTAGE BUT NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE WINNING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS KEEP ON LOSING THEIR MINDS. THEY HATE THE FACT THAT WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE WINNING BIG. WE ARE WINNING, WHINING, WHINING. WINNING, WINNING. THAT IS WHY MANY REGISTERED VOTERS EARLY , ARE LEAVING THEIR PARTY TO JOIN OUR MOVEMENT. THEY ARE JOINING OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY IN DROVES. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME. I JUST SPOKE TO SOME OF YOUR LEADERS. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN RALLIES LIKE THAT. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN THE OTHER DAY HAD 68 PEOPLE.

HE SPENT $500 MILLION SO FAR AND I THINK HE HAS 15 POINTS , HEY, FAKE NEWS, HOW MANY POINTS DOES HE HAVE RIGHT NOW? THEY WON'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH. THEY WON'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH. MSDNC IS WORSE THAN CNN. THEY ARE OWNED BY A COMPANY CALLED COMCAST. YOU CAN HAVE COMCAST, A BUNCH OF PHONIES. MSDNC IS WORSE THAN CNN , AND THEY ARE ALL PRETTY BAD. THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH A POLL A LITTLE WHILE AGO. MINI-MIKE WAS AT 15 AND CRAZY BERNIE WAS AT 31. THE DNC IS GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM BERNIE AGAIN. THAT'S OK BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE WHO THE HELL IT IS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN. LET ME TELL YOU THESE CROOKED POLITICIANS, THEY REALLY TOOK AWAY THREE YEARS FROM US BECAUSE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE DONE MORE IN THREE YEARS WITH THE TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS IN THE MILITARY, WE HAVE DONE MORE THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY. WE HAVE DONE MORE. THINK OF IT. WE DID IT WITH PHONY WITCHHUNTS. WE DID IT WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX OVER OUR HEAD THE WHOLE TIME. WE DID IT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOULD NEVER, EVER HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT AGAIN. WITH YOUR ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM THIS NOVEMBER, WE WILL TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE WILL HOLD THE SENATE.

HER OPPONENTS, I HAVE TO SAY THIS, MARTHA, A GUY NAMED MARK KELLY, EVEN THE DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE HIM MUCH. HE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, OPEN YOUR BORDERS, GIVE AWAY FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, AND HE WANTS TO OBLITERATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THE RADICAL LIBERAL DEMOCRATS FROM CALIFORNIA, MASSACHUSETTS, THEY ARE POURING MONEY INTO HIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE IS A RUBBERSTAMP FOR CRYING CHUCK AND NERVOUS NANCY WACKO PELOSI. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NEW SPEAKER. THAT IS WHY MARTHA HAS MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL SUPPORT AND ENDORSEMENT AND WE HAVE TO GET OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE THAT MARTHA MCSALLY , SHE IS A WARRIOR. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. THIS ONE IS TOUGH AS HELL AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. WELCOME BACK TO THE GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA. GIVE IT UP.

PRESIDENT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR AT THAT AMAZING STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS YOU GAVE. IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES. YOU WERE HONORING OUR VETERANS AND REIGNITING , REUNITING FAMILIES. I HEARD YOUR CALL. I WILL INTRODUCE A BILL LAST WEEK TO GET THAT DONE, TO HELP AMERICANS LOWER THE COST OF DRUGS. ARIZONA IS ON FIRE THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE, PEOPLE ARE LIVING , WE ARE GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE SIDELINES AND THE ECONOMY IS DOING SO GREAT AND WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. MY OPPONENT SAID HE WOULD VOTE TO CONVICT AND REMOVE YOU FROM OFFICE AND REMOVE YOU FROM THE 2020 BALLOT. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT? AND THEN HE SAID LAST WEEK THAT HE WAS , HE WOULD SUPPORT BERNIE SANDERS IF HE IS THE NOMINEE AND HIS SOCIALIST AGENDA. ARIZONA IS TIRED OF INVESTIGATIONS, TIRED OF OBSTRUCTION, THEY DON'T WANT SOCIALISM. THEY LOVE OUR FREEDOM. MARK KELLY IS FLYING ON BERNIE SANDERS THINGS AND I AM FLYING ON YOUR WING, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND WE WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MARTHA. SHE'S RIGHT. HOW ABOUT THAT CONGRESSMAN AL GREEN? WE CANNOT BEAT THEM SO WE HAVE TO IMPEACH AND THAT'S IMPEACH HIM. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG ELECTION VICTORY. I DON'T THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS EVER BEEN MORE UNIFIED THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO FOR MARTHA, WE NEED HER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, MARTHA. APPRECIATE IT. TOGETHER, WE ARE BUILDING THE WORLD'S MOST PROSPEROUS ECONOMY AND THE MOST INCLUSIVE SOCIETY ANYWHERE. THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WE ARE INCLUSIVE. RIGHT? RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, IN ARIZONA, WE HAVE CREATED 240,000 NEW JOBS. INCLUDING OVER 60,000 NEW MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS HERE. NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. YOU HAD THE BEST YEAR THAT YOU HAVE EVER HAD. ARIZONA, YOU HAVE HAD THE BEST YEAR, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR YOU HAVE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. THE BEST YEAR YOU HAVE EVER HAD. I AM GOING TO TAKE ALL THE CREDIT AWAY FROM YOUR GOVERNOR, I DON'T CARE. WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM WITH DOUG AND EVERYBODY ELSE. NUMBER ONE YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR STATE. A CREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT , INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT. THIS HAS TO BE PRETTY GOOD STUFF FOR THE DEBATE STAGE. IN MANY STATES, THE BEST YEAR THEY HAVE EVER HAD. LET'S GET A NEW PRESIDENT. I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO WORK SO EASILY. THE COUNTRY HAS HAD THE BEST YEAR AT AS EVER HAD, LET'S GET A NEW PRESIDENT. LET'S PUT IN CRAZY BERNIE. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FROM MY ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN THREE YEARS, IS THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. PRESIDENT IN RECORDED HISTORY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS, AND LATINO AMERICANS IS THE YOUNGEST , LOWEST IN HISTORY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SOON TO BE HISTORIC. AND VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT HAS DROPPED TO A RECORD LOW. WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR VETERANS, WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR DISABLED AMERICANS HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] WORKERS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA, WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM, THE LEFT EYE SCHOOL, THEY SAID, "I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED." THEY LEFT, THEY CAN'T GO BACK, THEY LEFT. WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA EVER RECORDED IN U.S. HISTORY. ISN'T THAT GREAT? [APPLAUSE] GREAT NUMBERS. HISPANIC AMERICANS RIGHT NOW, MORE THAN 500,000 OWN A HOME. MORE THAN 500,000 MORE OWN A HOME. AND WE HAVE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF THE WELFARE ROLLS. THINK OF THAT. 10 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE COME OFF OF THE WELFARE ROLLS. AND HAPPILY. NOT THAT WE DID ANYTHING. THEY HAVE JOBS AND THEY LOVE IT AND THEY ARE MAKING MUCH MORE MONEY AND THEY LOVE GETTING UP AND GOING TO WORK. AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE THAT JOB, THEY CAN GET ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STARVING TO GET GREAT EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE STARVING TO GET GREAT EMPLOYEES. SINCE MY ELECTION, THE NET WORTH OF THE BOTTOM HALF OF WAGE EARNERS HAS INCREASED BY 47%, THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THE INCREASE FOR THE TOP 1%. [APPLAUSE] MEDIAN INCOME , THINK OF THIS , THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL , MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH, IN EIGHT YEARS, IT WENT TO $450 MORE. UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA , [CROWD BOOING] IN ONLY THREE YEARS, INCLUDING REGULATION CUTS AND TAX CUTS, BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES RAISED TAXES, WE CUT TAXES BY RECORD AMOUNT, IT WENT TO $10,000 PER PRES. TRUMP: A RECORD. A RECORD. THAT IS WHY OUR CONSUMER RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE BOOMING WITH CASH. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR ECONOMY IS DOING SO MUCH BETTER. CHINA HAD THE WORST YEAR IN THE LAST 67 YEARS. ASIA IS DOING POORLY. EUROPE IS DOING POORLY. THE UNITED STATES IS DOING GREAT. WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE HAVE EVER DONE. [APPLAUSE] THE BEST WE HAVE EVER DONE. TO LIFT UP FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED INVESTMENT AND THESE ARE REALLY COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST , WE CREATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES. WE WORK WITH TIM SCOTT, THE GREAT SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] HIS IDEA. HE CAME IN AND SOLD ME. I SAID, LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. NOTHING HAS WORKED OVER THE YEARS, BUT THIS HAS REALLY WORKED. JOBS AND INVESTMENT ARE POURING INTO 168 NEWLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES RIGHT HERE IN ARIZONA ALONE. FROM APACHE TO NAVAJO AND MARICOPA COUNTY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES. WE ARE DOING A JOB WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WE ARE DOING SOMETHING NOBODY HAS EVER DONE TO THIS EXTENT. REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AN AVERAGE OF $2200 IN THEIR POCKET THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. [APPLAUSE] OUR HISTORIC REGULATORY REDUCTION CAMPAIGN IS RESTORING AMERICAN LIBERTY AND CUTTING THROUGH JOB KILLING REDTAPE LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER CUT REGULATIONS BEFORE. WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY, LOWERING UTILITY BILLS, REDUCING PRICES AT THE PUMP, AND ELIMINATING OUR RELIANCE ON HOSTILE FOREIGN SUPPLIERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. AMERICA IS NOW ENERGY INDEPENDENT. SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE FOUGHT WARS, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD. WE USED TO TAKE THE STRAITS AND EVERYBODY ELSE BENEFITED. WE KEEP THEM CLEAR SO OTHER COUNTRIES COULD TAKE OIL FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. NOBODY PAID US. NOW THEY ARE STARTING TO PAY US A LOT OF MONEY, FOLKS. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF US. BUT WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE MADE SUCH PROGRESS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH PIPELINES. THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. KEYSTONE XL. I APPROVED IT. THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. I APPROVED IT. 48,000 JOBS. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES. THE WORST TRADE DEALS ANY HUMAN BEING HAS EVER SEEN. I SAY, WHO MADE THESE DEALS? THE WORST, STUPIDEST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY WERE GOOD FOR OTHER NATIONS IF YOU LIKE OTHER NATIONS, THAT IS GREAT. BUT WE ARE NOW PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. IT IS SIMPLE. [APPLAUSE] FOR YEARS, WASHINGTON POLITICIANS TOOK MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS, GLOBAL CORPORATIONS , REALLY, THE MOST CORRUPT SPECIAL INTERESTS ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN , TO SHIP OUR JOBS AND OUR FACTORIES TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WE LOST OUR TAXES, WE LOST OUR WORKERS, WE LOST OUR COMPANIES, AND WE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, WE. HAVE DONE A LOT ABOUT IT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE POURING BACK IN. [APPLAUSE] AMERICA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS FOLLOWING THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA, THE WORST DEAL EVER MADE , THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE AND ONE THAT WAS ALMOST AS BAD AND GAVE CHINA AN ENTRANCE INTO BEING A ROCKETSHIP WHEN THEY ENTERED THE WORLD TRADE, WORLD TRADE, WTO, ONE OF THE WORST DEALS THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN THIS. BY THE WAY, WE JUST WON $7.5 BILLION IN A LAWSUIT WITH WTO. WE WERE NOT WINNING ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] WE WERE NOT WINNING ANYTHING. THEY SAID, I THINK THIS GUY IS GOING TO PULL OUT. THEY TREATED US SO UNFAIRLY. WE WERE ALWAYS IN THE MINORITY POSITION. WHO THE HELL NEGOTIATED THESE DEALS? THEY LOOK AT US AND THEY SAY, WE ARE FAILING IF YOU ARE GONE. WE JUST WON $7.5 BILLION. $7.5 BILLION! DID YOU KNOW THAT, DOUG? $7.5 BILLION. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE GREAT BETRAYAL IS OVER, AMERICA IS NO LONGER FOR SALE, AMERICA IS NO LONGER FOR SALE, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. [CHEERING] AND TWO GENERATIONS OF POLITICIANS CAME AND WENT PROMISING TO REPLACE NAFTA. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THAT? PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I RAN FOR OFFICE. ARE WE GLAD I RAN FOR OFFICE? [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY, I WAS WATCHING THE DIFFERENT , I FIND IT FASCINATING , I'M WATCHING THE DIFFERENT RETURNS COMING IN. I'M WATCHING IS MUCH AS I CAN OF THIS STUFF. I LOVE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT VERY WELL. THE CRAZY NEW YORK TIMES, IT WAS DEAD WHEN I RAN. A MONTH BEFORE IRAN, DOUG, I HELD UP THE NEW YORK TIMES, IT IS WHAT , LIKE WHAT YOU GET THROWN IN THE FACE AT THE SUPERMARKET. IT WAS NOTHING. NOW IT IS DOING VERY WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMEDAY, WE WON'T BE HERE. WHEN WE ARE NOT, THOSE PAPERS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE. BUT THIS THING WAS A DEAD NEWSPAPER. BUT I WAS WATCHING AND THEY HAD AN ARTICLE THIS WEEKEND ABOUT PEOPLE THAT SPENT THEIR OWN MONEY AND HOW THEY ARE DOING. THEY HAVE MANY MIKE , MINI MIKE WHO SPENT $411 MILLION. HE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. MINI MIKE, $411. THEN THEY HAD THIS IDIOT, STEE YER. WE CALLED HIM IMPEACHMENT STIER. HOW DID THAT WORK OUT? HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY. HE SPENT $210 MILLION. HE GOT ONE THIRD OF 1% IN IOWA. [LAUGHTER] I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HIM. I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HIM. I TURN ON EVERY TIME FOR YEARS, I'M TURNING ON, IMPEACH HIM, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REASON. IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT! THE GUY SPENT A FORTUNE ON THIS STUFF. IT WORKED OUT PRETTY GOOD. ANYWAY. I GO AND I LOOK. SO IT HAS , QUESTION MARKS , I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE ANSWER, BUT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE QUESTION MARKS , THEN YOU GO DOWN AND THEY HAD OTHER PEOPLE. SOME ARE LIKE THAT ROSS PEROT, IT WAS A TOUGH DAY FOR BUSH WHEN HE JOINED THE CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE CLINTON DIDN'T WIN. ROSS PEROT TOOK AWAY 19% OF THE VOTE. [CHEERING] DIDN'T CLINTON GET 41% OR 43%, SO GIVE ME A BREAK, BUT WHATEVER. ROSS PEROT SPENT LIKE $100 MILLION, WHICH IS PROBABLY DOUBLE IF YOU BRING IT UP TO TODAY'S DOLLARS. YOU HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE WHO RAN, STEVE FORBES WHO RAN TWICE, HE WAS IN FOR A LOT. THEN YOU HAD DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS YOUR OWN MONEY. THIS IS YOUR OWN MONEY. I SAID, I SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN MY PRIMARIES, WE WILL SEE HOW THE HELL WE DO. ONCE YOU WIN, THE MONEY COMES IN, LIKE IT COMES IN PRETTY FAST. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT? BUT SO IN THE MIDDLE THEY HAD TRUMP. THEN THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE THAT WERE BEHIND ME. A LOT OF MONEY SPENT. LOSS, LOSS, LOSS, LOSS, LOSS. IN THE MIDDLE, THEY HAVE DONALD TRUMP. IT DID NOT SAY $500 MILLION AND IT DID NOT SAY $250 MILLION. IT SAID $70 MILLION OF MY OWN MONEY. IT SAID DONALD TRUMP WON THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WON! MY FATHER WOULD TEACH ME, IF YOU CAN SPEND LESS AND WHEN, THAT IS SPENDING , BETTER THAN SPENDING A LOT AND WINNING. CROOKED HILLARY SPENT AT LEAST THREE TIMES MORE THAN WE DID AND LOST. [BOOING] [CROWD CHANTING "LOCK HER UP!"] CROOKED AS HELL. SHE IS CROOKED AS HELL. WE HAVE A DOUBLE-SIDED JUSTICE THAT IS VERY UNFAIR WHAT IS GOING ON. VERY UNFAIR, BUT LET'S SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS OUT, FOLKS. LET'S SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS OUT. I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY. I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DISHONEST SLIMEBALLS OUT THERE. DISHONEST SCUM. DIRTY COPS. A LOT OF DIRTY COPS. BY THE WAY, THE FBI, THOSE GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE, BUT THE ONES AT THE TOP, THEY WERE ABSOLUTE SCUM. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO, IF THAT HAPPENED TO OBAMA OR A DEMOCRAT OR ESPECIALLY A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, THEY WOULD BE IN JAIL FOR 50 YEARS AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE TWO YEARS AGO ALREADY. [APPLAUSE] THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN, REMEMBER THAT. AFTER THEY SPIED, WE WON. AFTER WE WON, THEY TRIED TO GET US OUT OF OFFICE. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE CAN NEVER, EVER EXCUSE IT. WE CAN NEVER LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THAT. [CHEERING] NEVER LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. BUT WE KEEP OUR PROMISES AND WE WORK HARD AND OUR ECONOMY IS GREAT. LAST MONTH, WE ENDED , LOOK, YOU SAW IT , THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE. THAT IS WHAT IT WAS. WE ENDED THAT CATASTROPHE. AGAIN, I REALLY RAN BECAUSE OF NAFTA. I SAID, HOW STUPID. ALL OVER THE PLACE. IN YOUR STATE, BUT YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, EMPTY FACTORIES, EMPTY BUILDINGS, STILL YOU HAVE EMPTY BUILDINGS. WE LOST 60,000 FACTORIES AND PLANTS. I SIGNED THAT BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. [CHEERING] THE USMCA IS A GIGANTIC VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND MANUFACTURERS ALL ACROSS THE GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA. AND YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY, FOR PEOPLE WITH THE SMALL FARMS, THE SMALL BUSINESSES, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU CAN NOW LEAVE YOUR COMPANY'S, YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FARMS, YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR RANCH TO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY, THEY DON'T PAY A DEATH TAX, THEY DON'T PAY AN INHERITANCE TAX. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. SO, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, IT IS GOOD. IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, IT DOESN'T MATTER. DON'T LEAVE IT TO THEM IF YOU DON'T LOVE THEM. LET THEM GO OUT AND WORK LIKE HELL. DOES ANYBODY IN THIS INCREDIBLE AUDIENCE , THIS IS A BIG BUILDING , DOES ANYBODY NOT LOVE THEIR CHILDREN? ANYBODY? DO I HAVE A HAND? THERE'S A HAND. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. SO THEN YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TAX. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HE SAYS, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT ONE. YOU LOOK LIKE A NICE GUY. HE IS TOUGH. YOU WOULD LOVE TO BE HIS KID, WOULDN'T YOU? [LAUGHTER] LAST MONTH, WE SIGNED A GROUNDBREAKING TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WILL DEFEND OUR WORKERS, PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND BOOST AMERICAN EXPORTS. CHINA WILL INVEST $250 BILLION A YEAR INTO THE UNITED STATES AND BY OUR PRODUCTS AND CREATE JOBS. NOTHING LIKE THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS THE WAY WE WANT IT. [APPLAUSE] IN NO ISSUE HAVE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS MORE THOROUGHLY SOLD OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAN IMMIGRATION. YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY, DOUG, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON YOUR BORDER. WE ARE STOPPING THAT BORDER. THAT BORDER IS CLOGGED. WE HAVE STARTED THE BIG WALL RIGHT IN ARIZONA. THAT IS THE BIG ONE. THAT IS THE BIG ONE. TOP-OF-THE-LINE. BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE, THE FAR-LEFT'S POLICY OF OPEN BORDERS ALLOW DEADLY DRUGS TO FLOW FREELY INTO OUR COUNTRY, POISONING OUR CHILDREN, INCLUDING AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL RIGHT HERE IN ARIZONA. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS PUT THE NEEDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEFORE THE WELL-BEING OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY WANT TO LET ANYONE FROM AROUND THE WORLD SIMPLY WALK ACROSS THE BORDER AND THEN THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM A LIFETIME OF FREE WELFARE, HEALTH CARE, EVERYTHING. THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING. [CROWD BOOING] FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME , AND YOU KNOW THIS, BEFORE I CAME , THEY WERE TREATED FAR BETTER THAN OUR VETERANS WERE TREATED. NOW, OUR VETERANS ARE TREATED GREAT. [APPLAUSE] TRUE. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COST ARIZONA TAXPAYERS MORE THAN $2 BILLION EVERY YEAR. $2 BILLION YOU ARE PAYING, NEARLY 20% OF ARIZONA'S ANNUAL BUDGET IN GENERAL FUNDS GOES TOWARD THIS BIG PROBLEM. FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND SUPPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WE COULD REBUILD OUR CITIES ALL THROUGHOUT AMERICA, WHICH IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE FINALLY TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN CITIZENS. [APPLAUSE] INCLUDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WHO FOLLOW OUR LAWS, PAY THEIR TAXES, AND ARE ENTITLED TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTS THEIR FAMILIES EVERY DAY, DEMOCRATS' OPEN BORDERS POLICIES ARE HARMING AND KILLING INNOCENT LIVES. IN ARIZONA ALONE LAST YEAR, ICE OFFICERS ARRESTED OVER 4500 CRIMINAL ALIENS CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF DANGEROUS OFFENSES, INCLUDING ROBBERY, RAPE, AND MURDER. RIGHT HERE IN PHOENIX, AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CHASED A MAN THROUGH PARKING LOT AND SHOT HIM IN COLD BLOOD, THEN WALKED OVER TO THE VICTIM AND SHOT HIM FOUR MORE TIMES RIGHT IN THE FACE AS HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET. THIS SAVAGE ANIMAL HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEPORTED AFTER SERVING SIX YEARS IN PRISON. AND HE WAS IN PRISON SIX YEARS, HE WAS THERE SIX YEARS AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY WANT TO PROTECT HIM. LAST YEAR IN TUCSON, ANOTHER ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS FOR REPEATEDLY RAPING A VULNERABLE YOUNG WOMAN, YET LEFT-WING POLITICIANS OPPOSED ALL THE TENSION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS, EVEN CONVICTED CRIMINALS , AND THEY SUPPORT DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE THESE CRIMINAL ALIENS DIRECTLY INTO AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES. [CROWD BOOING] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IN CALIFORNIA, I JUST LEFT CALIFORNIA, I STARTED OFF WITH A SPEECH IN NEVADA AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING. I THEN WENT TO CALIFORNIA AND MADE TWO SPEECHES, I THEN WENT SOMEPLACE ELSE. I SAID, AM I FINISHED? NO, YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO ARIZONA AND SPEAK IN FRONT OF LIKE 45,000 PEOPLE. I SAID, THAT'S OK, THAT'S OK! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I SAID, THAT'S OK. NO, I SAID THAT'S OK BECAUSE I LOVE THIS UNBELIEVABLE ENERGY IN THIS CROWD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY, THIS TREMENDOUS ENERGY IN OUR NATION, THIS TREMENDOUS ENERGY IN OUR NATION. GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FOR EIGHT STRAIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW, WHICH WILL SOON BE A RECORD. [APPLAUSE] ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 75% SINCE LAST SPRING. THE MONTH OF JANUARY SAW THE FEWEST ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS INTO YEARS. AND WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, A HORRIBLE DEMOCRAT POLICY THAT WE GOT TERMINATED. [APPLAUSE] BORDER PATROL, GREAT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE SEIZED THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF DEADLY NARCOTICS EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THIS YEAR. WE HAVE DEPORTED RECORD NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS, INCLUDING THE WORST GANG OF ALL, MS 13. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROWN THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE DONE MORE TO SECURE THE BORDER THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, AS I SAID, FASTER THAN EVER. IT WILL SOON BE ALMOST ONE NEW MILE A DAY. WE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. TAKING CUES FROM CRAZY BERNIE SANDERS. HOW WAS HE DOING TONIGHT? 132 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER OF THE WORLD. THINK OF THIS. 180 MILLION AMERICANS ARE GOING TO LOSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE UNDER THIS PLAN. BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M NOT GOING TO CRITICIZE IT TONIGHT. LET THEM KEEP GOING AND I WILL START TALKING ABOUT IT ABOUT TWO WEEKS OUT FROM THE ELECTION, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM TO CHANGE. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE. SAME WITH DEGREE NEW DEAL. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, I CAME UP WITH THE NAME POCAHONTAS TOO EARLY. FORTUNATELY, SHE SELF-DESTRUCTED ANYWAY. DID YOU EVER SEE A PHONY LIKE THAT STOOD MARK SHE IS A PHONY. SHE LOST BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT KEEP IT STRAIGHT ON HER OWN HERITAGE. SHE SAID SHE IS AN INDIAN. I SET I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THEN YOU HAVE AND I HAVE NONE. [LAUGHTER] AND SHE PANICKED. SHE PANICKED AND SHE HAD A TEST. YOU KNOW THE RESULTS. 1/124TH. I THINK I WIN THE BET? SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE I THINK I WIN. NO, SHE , I DID IT TOO EARLY. I WOULD HAVE SAVED IT, BUT I GUESS IT WAS EFFECTIVE. SHE IS ESSENTIALLY GONZO. WHILE THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY AMERICAN HEALTH CARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROTECTING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR MEDICARE, AND IS FIGHTING TO GIVE YOU GREAT HEALTH CARE AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GETTING. RIGHT. ONE OF THE BIG SECRETS. THE DEMOCRATS WON'T LET US SAY IT. THEY WANT TO KEEP THAT AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE. LOOK WHAT THEY GAVE YOU, THE WORST HEALTH CARE AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE, WE HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THINGS. EVERYBODY IS HAPPY, WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND MUCH CHEAPER. PREMIUMS DOUBLED IN THE LAST YEAR BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE ARE OFFERING PLANS THAT ARE UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THEY WERE. AND IT IS BETTER HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS. THEY THINK THAT IS THEIR ISSUE. THEY FAILED IN HEALTH CARE. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WILL. BY THE WAY, WE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF OBAMA CARE, BUT WE ARE MANAGING IT INCREDIBLY, WE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT SO WE CAN GIVE YOU A GREAT HEALTH CARE PLAN AND PROTECT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. REMEMBER THAT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. BUT WHILE WE ARE HAVING IT, WE ARE MANAGING IT REALLY MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID. THEY BUILT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR WEBSITE. REMEMBER THAT? IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST $5 MILLION, IT COST $5 BILLION. YOU COULD GET A KID OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, I HAVE A SON, 13 YEARS OLD, HE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM A HEALTH CARE WEBSITE , I WOULD HAVE SAID HE WOULD HAVE CHARGED THEM $100, BARON. IT WOULD HAVE WORKED, HE IS SO GOOD. HI, DAD, HOW ARE YOU DOING, DAD? BING BONG. I SAID, DON'T PLAY WITH THAT WHILE YOU ARE TALKING TO ME. WHAT'S GOING ON, DAD? THESE KIDS ARE INCREDIBLE. THEY MAKE US LOOK LIKE BABIES WITH THAT. HE COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A GREAT WEBSITE FOR ABOUT TWO DOLLARS. THEY SPENT $5 BILLION ON A WEBSITE THAT NEVER WORKED. SPEAKING OF THAT, HOW DID THEY DO WITH THEIR VOTE COUNT IN IOWA? [LAUGHTER] AND I HEAR, I HEAR, I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT, I DON'T WANT TO JINX THEM BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO DO WELL, BUT I DO, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING, NOBODY IS RUNNING AGAINST US IN SO MANY STATES. IT IS SORT OF NICE. WE CAN SAVE THE THUNDER. I HEAR THAT IN NEVADA, I'M HEARING BAD THINGS ABOUT THEIR VOTE COUNT. I HEAR A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, I TURNED ON THE OTHER NIGHT IOWA. BY THE WAY, WE SET A RECORD IN THE HISTORY OF IOWA. WE HAD MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY HAS EVER HAD AS AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. SAME THING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A GOOD SIGN. IT IS A GOOD SIGN. BY A LOT. BY THE WAY, BY A LOT. I'M HEARING , I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE CASE , WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO WON IN IOWA. I HEARD COMING OVER HERE, THEY ARE STILL WORKING ON THE COUNT. I THINK WE DID WIN. VERY GOOD. THAT IS VERY GOOD. I WILL HAVE TO THINK OF THAT ONE. THAT IS VERY GOOD. LOOK, WE ARE WINNING BIG. WE HAVE FAKE POLLS OUT THERE. THEY ARE FAKE POLLS. [CROWD BOOING] I HAD A POLL, IT IS JUST LIKE IT WAS IN 2016. HERE ARE THESE POLLS. I HEAR WOMEN DIDN'T LIKE ME AND I DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. I HEAR EVERYONE DIDN'T LIKE ME, NOBODY LIKES ME. THEN WE WON. [CHEERING] THANK YOU, WOMEN. NOBODY LIKES ME. 2016. I HEAR , REMEMBER, WOMEN DIDN'T LIKE HIM. HE DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. HE DID GREAT WITH THIS, HE DID GREAT WITH EVERYBODY. WE. DID GREAT WITH EVERYBODY 306 TO 223. THAT IS A SLAUGHTER. REMEMBER, THEY SAID, HE CANNOT GET , THERE IS NO PATH. TO 270. THEY SAID THERE IS NO CHANCE. I WAS AT 269. I WENT TO MAINE. I WON MAINE. I WENT THERE FOR FIVE TIMES. I WANTED TO. THERE IS NO PATH TO 270. BUT THERE WAS A PATH TO 306. [CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SAID, THERE IS NO PATH, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THERE IS NO PATH FOR DONALD TRUMP. THEN THEY SAID THE EVENING OF THE ELECTION, IT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY SHORT NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP. WE GOT RID OF THIS GUY, THANK GOD. BECAUSE THEY DID THE EXIT POLLS GOING OUT, RIGHT? I WAS EVEN TOLD, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN HISTORY OF PEOPLE THAT SAID VERY NASTY LANGUAGE IN NOT GOING TO USE THAT BECAUSE THEY WILL KILL ME IF I USE IT, SO I WON'T USE IT. IT IS A MUCH BETTER STORY IF I USE IT. HOW DID YOU VOTE? USUALLY THEY SAY, I VOTED FOR CLINTON OR TRUMP. HOW DID YOU VOTE? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I'M BEING NICE. I WILL KEEP IT THAT WAY. OTHERWISE, WE WILL RUIN THE WHOLE EVENING. EVEN THIS TOUGH GUY IN THE FRONT. HOW DID YOU VOTE? I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU. HOW DID YOU VOTE? NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS. HOW DID YOU VOTE? IT WAS LIKE THIS MASSIVE NUMBER, MASSIVE. EVERYBODY, THEY JUST DIDN'T COUNT THAT. THEY SAID, THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING UNBELIEVABLY WELL FOR CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. THEY ARE LOOKING UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY SHORT EVENING FOR DONALD TRUMP EVERY AT WE FINALLY WILL BE RID OF THIS GUY. AND THEN THE NUMBERS STARTED COMING IN. [CHEERING] THE NUMBERS STARTED COMING IN. AND IT STARTED WITH THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. DONALD TRUMP HAS ONE THE STATE OF FLORIDA , WON THE STATE OF FLORIDA. [CHEERING] AND THEN THAT BEAUTIFUL CONVENTION CENTER, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STAGE OF EVER SEEN, AND THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PAY THE FINAL PAYMENT FOR THE FIREWORKS TWO WEEKS BEFORE. [LAUGHTER] EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE MY AREA WAS. WE WERE AT A HOTEL IN MIDTOWN, WE LIKE THE LOCATION BETTER THAN WHERE SHE CHOSE. REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL STAGE? IT WAS SHAPED LIKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? DID YOU EVER SEE MORE UNHAPPY PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] SO, THEY GO DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. THEY GO WOAH! THEY OUTSPENT ME LIKE 521. ONLY NEGATIVE ADS, THEY ARE ALL NEGATIVE. BY THE TIME PEOPLE GOT INTO THE VOTING BOOTH, THEY ONLY KNEW ONE THING, SHE HATED DONALD TRUMP. THEY SAID, WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE STAND FOR? WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE DO? EVERY AT WAS A NEGATIVE AT. NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST ME ARE NOT SO GOOD. THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVE. THEY SPENT LIKE $2 BILLION ON NEGATIVE ADS. HER HUSBAND SAID SHE WAS GOING TO LOSE. HER HUSBAND IS A PROFESSIONAL. HER HUSBAND SAID, YOU BETTER GO TO MICHIGAN. BECAUSE I WAS THERE AND THEY HAD A TRUMP-PENC SIGN ONE EVERY LAWN I HAVE EVER SEEN. AND YOU BETTER GO TO WISCONSIN, YOU BETTER GO TO WISCONSIN. SHE SAID, WE HAVEN'T LOST WISCONSIN IN 36 YEARS. NO, YOU'VE GOT TO GO THERE. I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? HE IS A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN. SHE WASN'T. IT IS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PROBLEMS IN LIFE. THEN IT CAME IN AND THEN WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA. RIGHT? AND WE WERE LEADING PENNSYLVANIA BY SO MUCH THAT IF I LOST , REMEMBER, 2% OF THE VOTE LOST , IF I LOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE, I WIN BY A LOT. THEY REFUSED, THE FAKE NEWS REFUSED TO CALL IT. I KEPT SAYING, WE WON PENNSYLVANIA, WHY DON'T THEY CALL IT? IT WAS VERY LATE IN THE EVENING, BECAUSE THEY ARE FAKE, THEY ARE CROOKED, THEY ARE FAKE. I SAID, I SAID , [CROWD BOOING] I SAID, WHY DON'T THEY CALL PENNSYLVANIA? BUT SOME BEAUTIFUL THINGS HAPPENED. BY THE WAY, OHIO, WE WON BY ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGINS EVER. THE GREAT, GREAT, GREAT STATE OF OHIO. [APPLAUSE] REMEMBER? REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY A YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION, THEY SAID, NOBODY CAN WIN UNLESS YOU WIN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO? WE WON THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO AND WE WANTED BIG. WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO WIN IT AND NOW WE WERE UP A LOT MORE THAN WE WERE UP THEN. BECAUSE WE ARE BRINGING BACK JOBS, WE ARE BRINGING BACK FACTORIES, EVERYBODY IS WORKING, NOBODY HAS EVER HAD A BETTER YEAR THAN WE HAVE BEEN HAVING AND WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT. DON'T LET THEM TRY TO TAKE CREDIT BECAUSE IF THEY CAME IN, WE WOULD HAVE ENDED UP IN A MASSIVE RECESSION OR WORSE. THE D WORD, DEPRESSION. BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO PUT MORE AND MORE AND MORE REGULATIONS ON. I TELL YOU, MAY BE THAN EVEN THE TAX CUTS, FOR THE REGULATION CUTS. WE FREED UP OUR NATION TO GO BACK TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] SO, THEN WE WON WISCONSIN. AND THEN WE WON MICHIGAN BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES, NOW THEY ARE POURING BACK IN, THE AUTO COMPANIES ARE POURING BACK IN, AND WISCONSIN IS DOING GREAT WITH THE FARMERS. YOU KNOW, CANADA WAS CHARGING OUR FARMERS 287% TARIFFS FOR DAIRY PRODUCTS. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS. WE ARE WORKING ON HEALTH CARE, WE ARE FIGHTING, I JUST SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER OPPOSING PRICE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, THOSE PRICES FALL VERY FAST. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE NEW GENERIC DRUGS WHICH ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE BRAND DRUGS, BUT THEY COST A TINY FRACTION. WE HAVE TOTALLY TRANSFORMED VETERANS HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING GETTING V.A. CHOICE NVA ACCOUNTABILITY, WHICH THEY SAID COULD NOT BE DONE. [APPLAUSE] AND WE PASSED THE SPECTACULAR RIGHT TO TRY, SO IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE, AND I HOPE NOBODY IN THIS MASSIVE ARENA IS IN TROUBLE, BUT IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE, YOU CAN GO AND GET WHATEVER THE NEW DRUG OR WHATEVER THEY WERE, YOU GET IT. THE LUCK WE ARE HAVING, WE ARE SAVING SO MANY LIVES IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT IS HAPPENING. PEOPLE WOULD GO TO EUROPE, THEY WOULD GO TO ASIA, THEY HAD NO MONEY THEY WOULD GO HOME AND DIE. NOW, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE OUR DRUGS BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED. THINK OF THAT. BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED. [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE VERY IMPORTANTLY COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS, THE OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 34 YEARS AND LIFE EXPECTANCY IS RISING AGAIN IN OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE LAUNCHED ALL NEW INITIATIVES COMBATING KIDNEY DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS AND WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN RESEARCH. NEONATAL RESEARCH, THINK OF THAT. THE NUMBERS ARE INCREDIBLE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS INCREDIBLE. TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENTS AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN DOING SO. ALL OF THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES HAVE DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY, IN MY STATE OF THE UNION, I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE-TERM ABORTION OF BABIES BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. [CHEERING] THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION, AND THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. [BOOING] THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, THE SECOND AMENDMENT, AND THE LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, RIGHT? [CHEERING] REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR CITIZENS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND, EVERY COMMUNITY, AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. WE ARE THE PARTY OF BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM, EXCITEMENT, ENERGY, AND ENTHUSIASM. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS ENERGY, TREMENDOUS ENERGY. [APPLAUSE] EVERYBODY SAYS TO ME, WHERE DO YOU GET THE ENERGY? BECAUSE I LOVE WHAT WE ARE DOING , I SEE THE RESULTS, AND THEY ARE HAPPENING FASTER THAN YOU EVEN THINK. THEY ARE HAPPENING FASTER THAN YOU WOULD EVEN THINK. WE ARE ASKING ALL AMERICANS TO JOIN OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. WE ARE THE BIG TENT, WE HAVE THE BIG PARTY, WE ARE THE PARTY WITH BIG IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. [APPLAUSE] TO KEEP OUR AMERICAN , RIGHT? TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE AND GIVE FORMER PRISONERS A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE, THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS, I PAST CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, NOT THE DEMOCRATS , I DID IT WITH THE REPUBLICANS. THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BY ANYBODY BUT ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT DO IT. THEY COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT. [APPLAUSE] AND THIS IS A RECORD. AND AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOMINATED AND WE HAVE CONFIRMED 2 GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, NEIL GORSUCH AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. [APPLAUSE] AND FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. YOU SAW THAT. THEY APOLOGIZED. NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] AT STAKE IN OUR PRESENT BATTLE IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT, IT IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR TO SECURE, THEN WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARD VICTORY. IN NOVEMBER OF 2020. [CHEERING] YOU ARE THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE KNOW MORE. YOU ARE NO LONGER , RIGHT? NO DEPLORABLES. NO DEPLORABLES. WHO KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A DISASTER? BUT SHE USED A WORSE WORD. WHAT WAS THE WORD SHE USED? IRREDEEMABLE'S. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. DEPLORABLES. WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW ABOUT POLITICS? SHE SAID YOU ARE IRREDEEMABLE AND DEPLORABLE. I SAID THAT IRREDEEMABLE IS TERRIBLE. THE NEXT DAY PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP, I MAY DEPLORABLE. [CHEERING] MUCH WORSE THAN I THOUGHT, BUT WE ARE GETTING THERE. NOT PLEASANT. A BUNCH OF REALLY BAD PEOPLE, VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL WORDS AND PHRASE, I LOVE THE PHRASE, "MADE IN THE USA," "MADE IN THE USA." [APPLAUSE] WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA WITHIN NOW NINE YEARS, WE STARTED A YEAR AGO. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? [APPLAUSE] WE ARE DOING THAT AND IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT? WE WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND BECOME THE FIRST NATION IN THE WORLD TO PLANT OUR FLAG ON MARS. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH , AND YOU KNOW THIS , YOU KNOW IT IS UNDER SIEGE , RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. WE WILL DEFEND IT. [CHEERING] IT IS UNDER SIEGE. IT IS UNDER SIEGE. YOU SEE IT IN VIRGINIA. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY THE GUNS. ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE, BEAUTIFUL AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] FROM TUCSON TO TOMBSTONE, RIGHT? DO YOU AGREE? THIS GUY. NO MORE CENSORSHIP IS RIGHT. NO MORE PEOPLE, NO MORE CRIMES. YOU'RE RIGHT. FROM YUMA TO MESA AND FROM FLAGSTAFF TO RIGHT HERE IN PHOENIX! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF RED-BLOODED AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO POURED THEIR HEARTS, SWEAT, AND SOULS TO SECURE OUR LIBERTY AND DEFEND OUR FREEDOM.

OF COURSE, DIDN'T THEY SAY THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON, WHEN HE WENT AT THE BACK OF THE PLANE, IT WAS 120 ONE DEGREES THAT DAY? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WAS DOING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL? HE SAID, I JUST HAPPENED TO SEE, I WAS HERE TO PLAY GOLF, IT WAS 120 DEGREES OUT. [BOOING] I DON'T KNOW. A LOT OF CORPORATE STUFF WENT ON. I WONDER WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT SHE WOULD BECOME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE GOING TO EXTEND HER TENURE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. SHE WAS A REAL BEAUTY. I'M SURE IT WAS NOTHING. THEY SPENT 45 MINUTES ON THE PLANE TALKING ABOUT GOLF AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN, RIGHT? [BOOING] CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN, FOLKS! CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. YOU FOUGHT THE BATTLES AND HELP TO MAKE THIS THE GREATEST NATION EVER TO EXIST ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER EVERY SINGLE DAY THAN EVER BEFORE.

THAT'S WHY. NO, BUT THEY HAD THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR MADE IN SOUTH KOREA. THEY MAKE ENOUGH STUFF FOR US, RIGHT? THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. WE ARE MAGNEIFICALLY, MAGNIFICENTLY ORGANIZE WITH THE BEST OFFICIALS IN THE WORLD ARE YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALL AMOUNT TO VERY LITTLE. THAT IS WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN WE HAVE THE FLU AT 35,000 PEOPLE AND THIS ONE IS, WE HAVE TO TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE WORST. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN MODERNISTIC TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS ILLNESS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE READY. WE ARE READY. TOTALLY READY. [CHEERING] ON JANUARY 31, I ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF FOREIGN NATIONALS WHO HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IN CHINA FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] AN ACTION WHICH THE DEMOCRATS LOUDLY CRITICIZED AND PROTESTED AND NOW EVERYBODY'S COMPLEMENT IN ME SAYING, THAKNHNK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE 100% CORRECT. COULD'VE BEEN A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. I SAID, LET'S GET THIS RIGHTA. A VIRUS STARTS IN CHINA, BELIEVED ITS WAY INTO VARIOUS COUNTRIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD, DOES NOT SPREAD WIDELY AT ALL IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE EARLY ACTIONS THAT MYSELF IN MY ADMINISTRATION TOOK AGAINST A LOT OF OTHER WISHES. AND THE DEMOCRATS SINGLE TALKING POINT, AND YOU SEE IT, IS THAT IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT, RIGHT? NOW, JUST THINGS THAT HAPPEN. THINGS HAPPEN. WHOEVER THOUGHT OF THIS. TWO WEEKS AGO WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GOING ON, FOUR WEEKS AGO? BUT THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE AND YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND YOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE AND HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND GET IT. MY GUYS, WE HAVE THE BEST PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORLD, THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE SO READY. AT THE SAME TIME THAT I INITIATED THE FIRST FEDERALLY MANDATED QUARANTINE IN OVER 50 YEARS, WE HAD TO QUARANTINE SOME PEOPLE. THEY WERE NOT HAPPY. THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT SO HAPPY BUT AFTER TWO WEEKS THEY GO HAPPYT. YOU KNOW WHO GOT HAPPY, THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM GOT HAPPY/ I ALSO CREATED A WHITE HOUSE VIRUS TASK FORCE. IS A BIG THING. I REQUESTED $2.5 BILLION TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED. THE DEMOCRATS SAID THAT'S TERRIBLE. H'ES DOING THE WRONG THING. HE NEEDS 8.5 BILLION. I ASK FOR $2.5 BILLION. I SAID, I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE IT. NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE. AND I NEVER HAD IT. WE WANT $2.5 MILLION. THAT'S PLENTY. WE DEMAND YOU TAKE 85. .5. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT VOTER SECURITY IS ALSO HEALTH SECURITY. [CHEERING] AND YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE WALL IS GOING UP LIKE MAGIC. IT'S GOING UP LIKE MAGIC. YOU KNOW THINK WAS AN EASY ONE? THAT WAS NOT AN EASY ONE. IT'S GOING UP GREAT AND WE ARE UP NOW 132 MILES. AND THIS IS , THE EXACT WALL THAT BORDER SECURITY WANTED, EVERYTHING. THIS IS EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. 132 MILES ALREADY. WE WILL HAVE 500 MILES BUILT BY VERY EARLY NEXT YEAR SOMETIME. [CHEERING] ONE OF THE REASONS THE NUMBERS IS NO GOOD. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP THE INFECTION AND THOSE CARRYING THE INFECTION FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WHETHER IT IS THE VIRUS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR MANY OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS, THE DEMOCRAT POLICY OF OPEN BORDERS IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALL AMERICANS. NOW, YOU SEE IT WITH THE CORONAVIRUS. YOU SEE IT. YOU SEE IT WITH THE CORONAVIRUS. YOU SEE THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS VIRUS OR ANY OTHER VIRUS OR ANY OTHER PROBLEM COMING IN, NOT THE ONLY THING THAT COMES IN THROUGH THE BORDER AND WE ARE SETTING RECORDS NOW AT THE ORDER. NOW, JUST USING THIS, SO IMPORTANT, RIGHT? SO IMPORTANT. I'M DOING WELL IN THE POLLS DESPITE THE WORST FAKE NEWS AND WORST PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE GOT PHENOMENAL NUMBERS. [CHEERING] IT'S TRUE. THE WORST PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT IN HISTORY. WE HAD A GREAT EVENT YESTERDAY. AN EVENT THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. YOUNG, AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. ONE OF THE THINGS I ASKED THEM , I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME , GREAT PEOPLE, SOME OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT , DO YOU LIKE THE NAME AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR BLACK? AND THEY SAID BLACK ALL AT THE SAME TIME. TRUE. BECAUSE YOU SAY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR BLACK. THEY SAID ALMOST IMMEDIATELY LIKE BLACK. BUT WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS NBC, WITH SUCH A LOVEFEST. IT WHEN ON FOR 45 MINUTES. IT WAS A LOVEFEST. NBC TURNED , THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. C[R[CROWD BOOING] THEY TURNED DOWN , COMCAST WHICH OWNS NBC. WE CALL IT MS-DNC. BUT NBC, I THINK IS WORSE THAN CNN. I ACTUALLY DO. AND COMCAST, A COMPANY THAT SPENDS MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR IMAGE, I'LL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DESTROY THEIR IMAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE , THEY ARE TERRIBLE. [CHEERING] THEY ARE A TERRIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. THEY PIADAID ME A FORTUNE FOR YEARS FOR "THE APPRENTICE." THEY PAID ME A FORTUNE. WHEN I LEFT THE SHOW, WAS DOING GREAT, WHEN I LEFT THE SHOW, 14 SEASONS, THINK OF THAT. GOT A BIG MOVIE STAR. WHEN NOT TELL YOU HIS NAME , WILL NOT TELL YOU HIS NAME. NOBODY WOULD KNOW HIS NAME BECAUSE HE WAS ON FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME. BUT THE SHOW WENT DOWN THE TUBES VERY QUICKLY. BUT THE COUNTRY AND FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, FIVE YEARS OR NINE YEARS OR 13 YEARS , [CHEERING] OR 18 YEARS. 10 MORE YEARS. NAW. THEY GO CRAZY WHEN YOU SAY IT. WHEN YOU SAY, WHEN YOU SAY TO THEM FIVE MORE YEARS. FIVE. BUT YOU THEN SAY, MAYBE NINE, MAYBE 13, MAY BE 17, MAYBE 21, WHO KNOWS? [CHEERING] MAYBE 20. LET'S DO THIS. LET'S TERM LIMIT OURSELVES THAT 25 YEAR , AT 25 YEARS. NO MORE THAN 25. THEY'LL PASS SOMETHING IN THE SENATE. CAN PASSIVE IN THE SENATE WITH LINDSAY. A 25 YEAR TERM LIMIT, PLEASE. NO. WE'RE LOOKING TO DO A GREAT JOB. WE NEED THAT EXTRA FIVE TO GET EVERYTHING SOLIDIFIED. YOU KNOW, IT IS LIKE YOU TAKE A TREE, ANY PLANTED. NEED SOME TIME TO GRAB ON. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. WE HAVE INCREDIBLE THINGS WE HAVE DONE. THINGS WE STILL CAN DO, BUT WE HAVE DONE MUCH MORE THAN WE EVEN PROMISED WE WOULD DO IF YOU THINK, ALL OF THAT. [CHEERING] WHILE THE EXTREME LEFT HAS BEEN WASTING AMERICA'S TIME WITH THESE VILE HOAXES, WE HAVE BEEN KILLING TERRORISTS, CREATING JOBS, RAISING WAGES, AND ACTING FAIR TRADE DEALS, SECURING OUR BORDER AND LIFTING UP CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, CRAND CREED. WE ADDED ANOTHER 225,000 LAST MONTH ALONE. AND THAT MAKES 7 MILLION JOBS SINCE OUR ELECTION, 7 MILLION. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU EVER HEAR THAT? [CHEERING] NOW, SLEEPY JOE WOULD SAY THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO , NO, NO, YOUR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. JOE, YOUR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. NO, NO. SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS NOT OHIO. OK. HE GOES, DID YOU SAY IOWA? NO. NO. HE DID THAT LIKE SEVEN TIMES. IF I DID THAT ONCE IT WOULD BE THE END OF THE ROAD, RIGHT? THEY'D THINK TRUMP HAS LOST IT. I LIKE TO SAY THAT ANYONE. THESE. PEOPLE ARE BAD PEOPLE SLEEPING JOE. HE'S RUNNING TOMORROW. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE MISTAKES WEEK YOU , MISTAKES HE MAKES, EVERY SPEECH. I WAS WATCHING HIM WHEN HE SAID ABOUT HALF THE POPULATION WIPED OUT WITH GUNS. I SAID, THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING. THAT IS THE END OF HIS EVENING, THAT IS THE END OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER. THEN, AFTER THE DEBATE THEY ARE REVEALING, JOE BIDEN HAD A GREAT NIGHT LAST NIGHT. I DON'T GET IT, TIM. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAS FALLEN TO 2 .3%, THE LOWEST RATE IN YOUR STATES HISTORY. [CHEERING] THE LOWEST RATE IN ALL OF AMERICA. TRUE. THE LOWEST RATE IN ALL OF AMERICA. I SAID TO A FRIEND OF MINE, A DEMOCRAT, HOW'S THE RACE GOING TOMORROW? WHO IS GOING TO? HE SAID SOMETHING, THIS GUY IS A LITTLE POLITICAL PRO, EVEN THOUGH HE IS A DEMOCRAT. I SAID, WHO IS GOING TO WIN? HE SAID, HONESTLY, SIR. IT DOES NOT MATTER. YOU ARE SO FAR AHEAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA THAT IT IS MEANINGLESS. MEANINGLESS. THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID. AND IN NORTH CAROLINA, TOO. IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE'VE DESTROY THE ISIS TERRITORIAL CALIPHATE. [CHEERING] WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS. AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEAD! HE'S DEAD! AND WE RECENTLY TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S TOP TERRORIST, CAPS ON SOLOMON , QUASSAM SOLEIMANI, ENDING HIS EVIL RAIN OF TERROR FOREVER. BUT AS, WE KEEP IN WINNING, WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS KEEP ON LOSING THEIR MINDS. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. I MEAN, NERVOUS NANCY P ARE CRYING CHUCK SCHUMER. BUNCH OF LOSERS. THE GOOD CITIZENS OF SOUTH CAROLINA. HAVE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE EXTREMISM OF THE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATES, WHETHER IT IS THIS CHARACTER THAT NOBODY EVER HEARD OF. I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL THE WEALTHY PEOPLE. THIS GUY TOM STEYER, MR. IMPEACHMENT. HOW DID THAT WORK OUT, TOM? HEY, HE SPENT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IOWA. MILLIONS. HE GOT LESS THAN 1%. 1/3 OF 1%. I WROTE A NOTE. IT SAID, TOM, IT IS NOT SO EASY DOING WHAT I DID, IS IT? NOT SO EASY. [CHEERING] NOT SO EASY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK MINI MIKE. HE WAS IN THERE FOR A FORTUNE. HE WISHED HE NEVER STARTED. MINI MIKE. HE WISHED HE NEVER STARTED. HE SAID, WELL, TRUMP CAN DO IT. I'M GOING TO DO IT, TOO. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT WORKING OUT TOO WELL. WAS THAT THE WORST DEBATE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORY? [LAUGHTER] I TURNED ON , YOU KNOW THEY HAD A BIG AUDIENCE. EVERYBODY WANTED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS DOING WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING UP HERE .TURNED OUT TO BE A TOTAL CATASTROPHE. A HAD 35 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT IS A BIG AUDIENCE. VERY BIG. WHAT A KILLER. BUT THIS GUY STEYER, HE SPENDS ALL THIS MONEY. HE IS NOT THAT WEALTHY. HE SPENDS ALL OF THIS MONEY AND HE YOU SHOULD NOT , YOU SHOULD NOT WASTE YOUR VOTE ON HIM TOMORROW. I HAVE TO BE HONEST. BY THE WAY, OTHER REPUBLICANS ALLOWED TO VOTE ANYWAY? ARE YOU READY? YOU READY? LET'S DO IT TOGETHER. I ASSUME THIS IS OK FOR MY CAMPAIGN FINANCE STANDPOINT. LINDSAY, TIM, OUR GREAT CONGRESSMAN. ARE WE ALLOWED? AM I ALLOWED TO REQUEST? FIRST WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD BE THE WEAKEST CANDIDATE AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THEN, IF IT IS LEGAL, IF IT'S PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY LITTLE BOOBY-TRAPS BUT THEY ONLY LIKE GETTING THE REPUBLICANS. DEMOCRATS SKIRT, RIGHT? WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ABOUT THAT. BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS, LINDSAY, TIM. YOU ARE PROS. THESE ARE TWO OF THE GREATEST GUYS I KNOW. SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RECORD ATTENDANCE IS IN THIS ARENA, BUT I WAS TOTALLY BROKEN BY A LOT. , BROKE IT BY A LOT. YOU GET THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. ARE WE ALLOWED TO TELL THEM WHO WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO VOTE FOR? SO, WAIT A MINUTE. LET'S DO A POLL. WE DO THIS FOR THE FAKE NEWS BACK THERE. READY? WHO WOULD BE THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR US, NOT FOR THEM? READY? READY? SO, LET'S GO THROUGH THEM JUST QUICKLY. WE WON'T INCLUDE STEYER BECAUSE HE IS A LOSER. HE'S OUT. WE WON'T INCLUDE HIM. WHO WOULD BE THE BEST? THIS IS A REAL POLL. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FAKE POLL , TAKEN BY, FOX, THE WORST POLLSTER. THIS GUY, THIS POLLSTER HATES TRUMP'S GUT. I WAS LOSING THE LAST ELECTION BY A FORTUNE. HE DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. EVERYTHING WAS RUN. THEY NEVER REPLACE THIS GUY , EVERYTHING WAS WRONG. FIRST WE WILL GO. LET'S SAY SLEEPY JOE. SO, RIGHT? THEN WE WILL GO CRAZY BERNIE THEN WE GO MINI MIKE. I THINK MINI MIKE IS OUT OF IT. I THINK HE IS OUT OF IT. SHOULD WE INCLUDE MINI MIKE? HE'S GONE. HE IS NOT IN YOUR ELECTION ANYWAY. SO, MINI MIKE. I HEAR MINI MIKE, HAS LEFT, HE IS BASICALLY GIVEN UP. HE GAVE UP! HE GAVE UP! [CHEERING] NOW, I HOPE WHAT I JUST SAID KEEPS HIM IN. HE'LL STAY IN BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO BE WRONG. MIKE, IT IS TIME TO GO HOME. GO HOME AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE. SPEND SOME MONEY ON SOMETHING. LET'S JUST GO. DO YOU AGREE? POCAHONTAS, WE CAN FORGET ABOUT HER, RIGHT? POCAHONTAS. I CAME OUT WITH THAT NAME FAR TOO EARLY. BECAUSE , BERNIE. LINDSAY, SO HORRIBLE TO PEOPLE. THEY SAID, SHE IS NOT DUMB. BUT SHE IS JUST SO DAMN MEAN. WE CANNOT VOTE FOR HER. SHE IS MEAN. SO, POCAHONTAS, DO WE LEAVE HER IN OR OUT? HOW ABOUT KLOBUCHAR? NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO, REALLY, WE'RE DOWN TO TWO CANDIDATES, RIGHT? SLEEPY JOE BIDEN AND CRAZY BERNIE. SO, THIS IS THE POLL. I GUARANTEE YOU THIS. AS MUCH AS THEY HATE ME, THEY ARE GOING TO HATE ME. WE HAVE A POLL OF LIKE IT 30 5,000 PEOPLE INSIDE OUT. ARE YOU READY? WHOSE THE WEAKER OF THE TWO. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHO DOES BETTER. WAIT. SO, READY? IN OTHER WORDS, WHO DO I WANT TO RUN AGAINST? MEANING, MEANING VERY SIMPLE, WE PUT IT INTO SIMPLE LINKAGE. WHO, LANGUAGE. WHO THE HELL IS EASIER TO BEAT? FOR US TO BEAT? CRAZY BRENIE? , CRAZY BERNIE? [CHEERING] OR SLEEPY JOE? [CHEERING] I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MAY BE CRAZY BERNIE HAS LITTLE BIT =-. ONCE MORE, JUST QUICK. READY? HE SAID, IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU WILL BEAT THEM UP. I HOPE SO. SO, WHO IS EASIER TO BEAT? CRAZY BERNIE? [CHEERING] OR SLEEPY JOE? [CHEERING] THEY THINK BERNIE IS EASIER TO BEAT. SO, WHETHER IT IS BERNIE SANDERS PLANS TO ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. ELIZABETH WARREN'S PLAN, I TOLD YOU I HAD MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN M E, THAN HER, EVEN KNOW I H AVE NONE. ZERO. I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THAN SHE HAS. AND SHE CHOKED. SHE HIGHER THIS COMPANY AND WENT OUT AND DID A BLOOD TEST. 1000. SO, THAT MEANS I PROBABLY WON SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE ONE MILLION YEARS AGO. I'M TELLING YOU. THAT WAS HORRIBLE. SHE CHOKED. WE DO NOT WANT A PERSON WHO WINS THAT CHOKES. WE DON'T WANT A DHCHOKE ARTIST. ONE THING HE WILL SAY ABOUT ME AS I AM NOT A CHOKER. THEY ARE AFTER ME FOR YEARS. WE CANNOT HAVE CHOKERS AS YOUR PRESIDENT. ELIZABETH WARREN'S PLAN TO ELIMINATE AMERICA'S BORDERS OR MINI MIKE'S PLAN TO ELIMINATE THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS? HOW ABOUT THAT? MINI MIKE ONCE A TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. THE INSANITY OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS WHY MILLIONS OF REGISTERED DEMOCRAT VOTERS ARE JOINING OUR MOVEMENT. THEY ARE JOINING OUR GREAT NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. [CHEERING] THIS NOVEMBER WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE SENATE. AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING] I WONDER WHAT THEY SAY WHEN THEY GO DOWN THE ROAD NAC THESE GROUPS OF 200 , AND THEY SEE THESE GROUPS OF 200 PEOPLE. . SERIOUSLY I WONDER WHAT THEY SAY UH, JOE BIDEN HAD A FABULOUS CROWD TODAY. SO FABULOUS THAT THERE IS LIKE FIVE PEOPLE. THEY'LL LEAVE AND THEY WILL SAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE. THEY USE THE WORD SMATTERING A LOT. LET'S LET THEM HEAR IT. THIS IS NOT A SMATTERING. THIS IS A BIG. THIS IS NOT A SMATTERING. TURN THE CAMERAS. THAT'S NOT A SMATTERING. [CHEERING] THAT IS NOT A SMATTERING. I HATE IT. THEY SAY, DONALD TRUMP IT IN INDIA, HATE TO SAY THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE 129,000 SEAT STADIUM. DID YOU SEE IT? THE PLACE WAS PACKED. HE GAVE ME CREDIT FOR 100,000. THAT WAS NOT BAD. 129. A FIELD ABOUT THREE TIMES , THE BIGGEST STADIUM, IT'S CRICKET. I WAS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA, MODI, GREAT GUY. LOVED BY THE PEOPLE OF INDIA AND WE HAD AN AMAZING THING. AND HERE IS THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A BIG CROWD. NORMALLY I LIKE TALKING ABOUT MIKE ROSS BECAUSE I GET CROWDS LIKE , BUT I JUST GET BACK FROM 140 OR 150,000 AND NOW I AM COMING HERE. WHAT IS THIS PLACE HOLD, 15? IT IS HARD TO BE ENTHUSED. YOU UNDERSTAND TO THAT. I MAY NEVER BE EXCITED AGAIN ABOUT A CROWD AFTER GOING TO INDIA. BUT THEY HAVE , THINK OF THIS, THEY HAVE 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE 350. WE'RE DOING PRETTY WELL. BUT I LOVE THIS CROWD. AND I LOVE THAT CROWD, TOO. TELL YOU, THEY HAVE A GREAT LOVE , THEY HAVE A GREAT LOVE. THEY HAVE A GREAT LEADER AND THEY HAVE A GREAT LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. .THAT WAS REALLY WORTHWHILE TRIP . WITH US TONIGHT ARE BOTH OF YOUR INCREDIBLE U.S. SENATORS, TWO INCREDIBLE FRIENDS, TWO WARRIORS. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM AND SENATOR TIM SCOTT. COME UP HERE. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] YOU KNOW AS THEY'RE DOING THAT, I WAS ALMOST GOING TO DO A POLL. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. UBTBUT LINDSAY IS A TRUE FIGHTER OF YOUR STATE. AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? HERE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SO IMPORTANT. SO IMPORTANT. SENATOR GRAHAM HAS BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE TO HELP US CONFIRM A RECORD NUMBER OF JUDGES TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION. [CHEERING] AND LINDSAY WAS AMAZING, YOU REMEMBER FOR JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. REMEMBER HOW BADLY , GREAT JOB, LINDSAY. GREAT JOB, MAN. THANK YOU. SENATOR SCOTT IS A LEADING , SUPER STAR. [CHEERING] HE IS A SUPERSTAR. BUT HE IS A LEADER IN LOWERING HEALTH CARE COSTS LIKE NOBODY HAS DONE IT. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW BUT IN THE LAST YEAR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES CAME DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 51 YEARS. [CHEERING] AND THAT WAS WITH NO DEMOCRAT HELP. IF WE HAD THEIR HELP WE COULD LOW INVITE 50%. , LOWER IT BY 50%. BUT WE WILL GET THEIR HELP. ONE OF THESE DAYS THEY ARE GOING TO GET SMART. SENATOR SCOTT PROVIDES WORLD-CLASS CARE FOR OUR VETERANS. WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR OUR VETERANS IS INCREDIBLE. AND BRINGING INVESTMENTS TO DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THROUGH OPPORTUNITY ZONES, INCLUDING 135 RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. TIM SCOTT CAME WITH TO MY OFFICE WITH AN IDEA. OPPORTUNITY ZONE. TIM, WHAT THE HEALTH IS THAT? HE WENT TO THE WHOLE THING. I SAID, THIS BABY COULD WORK. WE TRIED IT. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS. AND WHAT HE IS DONE FOR THIS COUNTRY IS INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. LINDSAY, WE'LL START WITH LINDSAY. SAY A FEW WORDS, PLEASE. WELCOME TO SOUTH CAROLINA, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE GOING TO WIN? YOU HAVE BEEN A A DAMN GOOD PRESIDENT. THANK YOU FOR 200 CONSERVATIVE JUDGES. THANK YOU FOR JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND JUSTICE GORSUCH. THANK YOU FOR REBUILDING THE MILITARY AND KILLING THE TERRORISTS. THANK YOU FOR THE STORM AS THE ECONOMY IN MY LIFETIME. AND THANK YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR PUTTING UP WITH THE NEVER ENDING BULLSHIT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH. [CHEERING] WELL, THAT WAS QUITE A DISPLAY, WASN'T IT? NOW, THERE IS A LOT OF LOVE IN THIS ROOM. A LOT OF PEOPLE, FRIENDS OF MINE THEY ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL THEY SAY, HOW DO YOU SPEAK IN FRONT OF 25,000 PEOPLE AND 10,000 PEOPLE IN ALL OF THIS? YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE IS SO MUCH LOVE IN THE ROOM IS EASY. NO, IT'S TRUE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I SAY THERE IS SUCH UNBELIEVABLE LOVE IN THE ROOM THAT IT IS EASY TO DO. VERY EASY. [CHEERING] IT IS SORT OF EASY TO DO. WE'RE ALSO THRILLED TO BE JOINT BY MANY MORE GREAT LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS SOME OF YOU MAY BE KNOW, I LIKE THIS GUY FOR A LONG TIME, GOVERNOR HENRY MCMASTER. COME UP, HENRY. COME UP, HENRY. REPRESENTATIVE JOE WILSON. JEB , WILLIAM TIMMONS, RALPH DOHRING, TOM RICE, AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY DREW MCKISSICK. [CHEERING] HI, FELLAS. AND, AS I INTRODUCE SOMEBODY, I'LL JUST SAY STAY THERE BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT BUT HE GOT HIT HARD. HE'S A VERY SPECIAL MAN, RETIRED MARINE CORPS MAJOR GENERAL. AND MOST OF YOU KNOW, HE RECEIVED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR, JAMES E. LIVINGSTON. JAMES, JUST RELAX. WHERE'S JAMES? HE GOT HIT HARD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, JAMES CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER. THANK YOU, JAMES. THEY ARE GREAT, BRAVE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR, AND WE HAVE THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM. AND THEY ARE BOTH THE HIGHEST AWARDS, ONE CIVILIAN, ONE IS MILITARY AND I WOULD SAY GETTING THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM IS MUCH LESS PAINFUL, BECAUSE WHEN A READ THEM OFF, LIKE WITH JAMES AND WITH SO OF , SO MANY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONORS, MANY ARE NOT LIVING. I'LL READY WHE WHERE ONE OF THEM GOING UP A HILL HIT 19 TIME SPINE GUNFIRE, GRABBING FOUR PEOPLE, GETTING ONTO A HELICOPTER, FALLING OUT OF THE HELICOPTER, HITTING A TREE ON THE WAY DOWN. HITTING A TREE. THEY WENT BACK AND SAVED HIM, BUT HE DIED LATER. I MEAN, THOSE ARE TOUGH DEALS. THOSE ARE TOUGH DEALS. WE HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE WHO IS LIVING. WE HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE WHO IS LIVING. BUT THEY ARE TOUGH. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND MAYBE I COULD ASK OUR GOVERNOR, OUR GREAT GOVERNOR OF THIS INCREDIBLE STATE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. PLEASE, HENRY? WHO IS THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOM WE LOVE MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD? THEY LOVE YOU. NOW, WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE PRESIDENT WHO LOVES YOUR. VERY MUCH. AND WHERE IS ALLEN. IS YOUR SON HERE, YOUR GREAT SON ATTORNEY GENERAL? ALLEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM, OK? THANK YOU, ALLEN. THANKS TO REPUBLICANS ALL OVER AMERICA WE ARE NOW WORKING ON THINGS THAT NOBODY EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. SINCE BY ELECTION, OVER 121,000 NEW JOBS THAT IN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. , HAVE BEEN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'VE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF WELFARE, INCLUDING 7 MILLION OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. THEY ARE WORKING, THEY HAVE GREAT JOBS AND THEY LOVE GETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND THEY ARE MAKING MUCH MORE MONEY. AND IT COSTS OUR COUNTRY NOTHING. WE MAKE MONEY. THEY PAY TAXES. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE NATIONWIDE HAS HIT THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 50 YEARS. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR MY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. PRESIDENT IN RECORDED HISTORY. HOW ABOUT THAT ONE? THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS AND ASIAN AMERICANS HAS REACHED RECORD LOWS. BLACK YOUTH ON A PLUMBING HAS REACHED , UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. BLACK POVERTY LEVELS ARE THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FOR DECADES DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BETRAYED AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THEY FORCED THEIR CHILDREN INTO FAILING SCHOOLS. THEY SHIPPED THEIR JOBS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY PUSH THEIR ON FAIR SENTENCING POLICIES, YOU KNOW ABOUT ALICE. YOU KNOW ALICE? AND THEY FAVORED ILLEGAL ALIENS OVER THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS. YOU KNOW THAT. THAT IS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LONG , MY ADMINISTRATION IS REVERSING THESE FAILED POLICIES AND DELIVERING RECORD GAINS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN. WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE FOR EVERY SINGLE VOTE IN 2020. AND WE EXPECT IT WIN AN , TO WIN AN HISTORIC SHARE OF THE BLACK VOTE COME ELECTION DAY. [CHEERING] WE ARE SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES BY FIGHTING PAID , WE GOT SOMETHING NOBODY THOUGHT COULD HAPPEN. PAID FAMILY LEAVE, REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICANS AN AVERAGE OF $2200 IN THEIR POCKET THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. REPUBLICAN, NOT DEMOCRAT. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT DECIMATED MANUFACTURING ALL ACROSS YOUR STATE IN ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. FOR YEARS POLITICIANS SOLD YOU OUT TO GLOBAL SPECIAL-INTERESTS, ENRICHING OTHER COUNTRIES AT YOUR EXPENSE. THAT ENDED. THAT ENDED. BUT I AM NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE FLGLOBE. I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT THE WORLD. I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LAST MONTH WE FINALLY ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE. I SIGNED THE BRAND-NEW U.S. -MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. THE USMCA IS A TREMENDOUS GIANT, BEAUTIFUL VICTORY FOR SOUTH CAROLINA FARMERS, RANCHERS, MANUFACTURES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. NOTHING LIKE IT. WHAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH NAFTA. EVERYBODY WAS LEAVING. IT WAS A DISGRACE THAT WAS EVER SIGNED. YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. YOU HAD THOSE EMPTY HULKS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ALL OVER THE STATES. ALL OVER THE WORLD WE ARE DEMANDING TRADE THAT IS FAIR AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WORD RECIPROCAL. RECIPROCAL. GOT TO BE FAIR. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP OTHER COUNTRIES WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS SOLD OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SUPPORTS FREE FEDERAL WELFARE FERTILE , FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS, FUNDED BY YOU. THEY WANT TO TREAT ILLEGAL ALIENS, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, BETTER THAN THEY WANT TO TREAT OUR MILITARY AND OUR VETERANS. NOT ONLY DOES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DRAIN OUR TREASURY, BUT IT IS A THREAT. I WAS INVITED , I INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A 92-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO WAS RAPED, BEATEN, BRUTALIZED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SET FREE IN NEW YORK CITY. HERE IN CHARLESTON COUNTY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS RECENTLY CHARGED WITH SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A YOUNG GIRL IN THE FOURTH GRADE. IN ANOTHER COUNTY, POLICE CAPTURED A PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED MS-13 GANG MEMBER WHO SHOT A MAN TO DEATH BEFORE DOWSING THE BODY AND GASOLINE AND SETTING HIM ON FIRE AND HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR COUNTRY. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. [CROWD CHANTING BUILD THAT WALL] IT IS BEING BUILT. IT IS BEING BUILT. BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU HAVE NOT HEARD, IT IS BEING BUILT. THAT YOU KNOW. THEY ARE GOING TO GO NUTS, THEY THOUGHT THEY GOT ME. THEY SAID, HAVE YOU HEARD THEM RECENTLY? HE IS BUILDING THE WALL. YOU THINK IT IS EASY GETTING THAT KIND OF MONEY TO BUILD A WALL WHEN I HAVE A PARTY AND A DEEP STATE AND NEVER TRUMPERS , THEY ARE A DYING BREED THOUGH, ON RESPIRATORS. MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION. YOU CAN DO IT, I AM NOT DOING IT. YOU THINK IT IS EASY, IT IS NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY NOW, HE IS BUILDING A WALL BUT MEXICO IS NOT PAYING FOR IT. THEY ARE, THEY ARE. SOME OF THE FAKE NEWS KNOWS THAT . IT IS OK, YOU WILL SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDER. THEY ONLY DO THAT FOR TRUMP. THEY DO NOT DO THAT FOR SLEEPY JOE OR KRAZY BERNIE AND THEY DO NOT DO THAT FOR MINI MIKE. THEY ARE ONLY DOING THAT FOR TRUMP. THIS REASONING OF THE COUNTRY ALONE I SAW THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED SO BADLY. TOUGH GUYS IN HERE, BUT THOSE OFFICERS GO INTO THE NESTS, THESE GUYS THAT THEY GATHER I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL, I DO NOT WANT TO GET THEM IN TROUBLE. THE PRESS WANTS US TO BE VERY POLITICALLY CORRECT. LET ME CHANGE IT AROUND. THEY GO INTO A NEST OF MS-13 AND SAY, HELLO GENTLEMEN, HOW ARE YOU? AND ON OCCASION THEY HAVE A FIGHT. THEY NEVER LOSE THOSE FIGHTS. WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE THAT. [APPLAUSE] HELLO, GENTLEMEN. HOW ARE YOU? HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU KILL LAST YEAR, WITH A KNIFE? THEY LIKE KNIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE PAINFUL. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE WERE LEADING INTO OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. LAST YEAR I.C.E. OFFICERS ARRESTED THOUSANDS CHARGED WITH DANGEROUS OFFENSES INCLUDING ROBBERY, RAPE, AND A THING CALLED MURDER. ON WEDNESDAY WE WON THE BIG CASE IN FEDERAL COURT, DID YOU SEE THAT? WE WON THE CASE UNANIMOUSLY IN FEDERAL APPEALS COURT. WE DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE MONEY TO SANCTUARY CITIES AND STATES IF THEY DO NOT WORK WITH US. FINALLY. YET THE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATES OPPOSE ALL DETENTION OF ILLEGAL ALIENS. THEY WANT UNFETTERED CATCH AND RELEASE. WE HAD THAT PROGRAM, IT WAS NOT EASY. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH COURTS. EVERYTHING IS A SUIT. WE TURN TO THE RIGHT, THEY SUE US. WE TURN TO THE LEFT, THEY SUE US. WE HAVE 218 JUDGES NOW. LET ME PREFACE THAT BY SAYING, I KNOW THEY GIVE THEIR OPINIONS. IT BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP. I NEVER WIN WITH AN OBAMA APPOINTED JUDGE, EVER. I DO NOT WIN. WE HAVE GREAT JUDGES GOING ONTO THE COURT. THEY ARE FAIR, JUDGES THAT LOVE OUR CONSTITUTION. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE JUDGES THAT IF WE FEEL IT IS RIGHT, THEY DO NOT WANT TO INVITE THE WORLD TO TRESPASS ACROSS OUR BORDERS. THE DEMOCRAT FIELD SUPPORTS DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS. YOU KNOW THAT, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICK UP A PAPER EVERY DAY. THEY RELEASE THESE HORRIBLE CRIMINALS TO TERRORIZE OUR COMMUNITIES. WE DO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE, WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. WE DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE SANCTUARY CITIES AND STATES THE MONEY THEY WANT. IT IS A GAME CHANGER. THEY DO NOT EVEN WANT TO REPORT IT. THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE VIRUS. IS TRUMP DOING A GOOD JOB? OH, I DON'T THINK SO. CHUCKY SCHUMER, HE IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. THIS GUY DOES NOT KNOW HE IS ALIVE. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL ORDER CROSSINGS BY A STAGGERING 75% SINCE LAST SPRING AND WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE PERMANENTLY. YOU KNOW I CATCH AND RELEASE IS? WE CATCH THEM, GRAB THEM, SAY, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE YOUR ADDRESS? THEY DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS. COULD WE HAVE A NUMBER, DO YOU HAVE A PHONE? COULD WE CALL YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER AND SAY IN OFUR , FOUR YEARS YOU HAVE TO COME TO COURT? THEY GET SOME INFORMATION, AND THEN WE RELEASE THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE DO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE. WE CATCH THEM AND WE TAKE THE INFORMATION AND WE RELEASE THEM AND SAY, PLEASE REPORT BACK. FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, FOR YOUR TRIAL. ABOUT 2% COME BACK AND THEY ARE THE DUMBEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER SEEN. 2%. NOBODY COMES BACK. IT IS CRAZY, BUT WE ARE GETTING IT CHANGED. IT WOULD BE SO EASY, THEY ARE CALLED LOOPHOLES. IT WOULD BE SO WHEEZY IF WE HAD DEMOCRATS ABOARD. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY DEMOCRATS' SUPPORT. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT CRIME. BORDER PATROL HAS SEIZED THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF NARCOTICS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY THIS YEAR. WE HAVE REPORTED RECORD NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL FASTER THAN EVER AND WILL SOON BE BUILDING MORE THAN ONE MILE A DAY. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. 132 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER. THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER HEALTH CARE WHILE THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY HEALTH CARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROTECTING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND FIGHTING TO GIVE YOU GREAT HEALTH CARE. AND WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN OF CHOICE. REMEMBER WHAT OBAMA WOULD SAY? YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN. HE SAID YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR IN YOUR PLAN. WELL, HE LIED. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM FOR THAT, HE LIED 28 TIMES. DOING A GREAT JOB. WE KILLED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHICH IS THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE, HORRIBLE , AND IT IS NOT OBAMA CARE ANYMORE, BUT WE ARE RUNNING THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT AND TRYING TO KILL IT ENTIRELY. WE WILL PUT IT BACK AND YOU WILL HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE AND PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED. PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE TOTALLY PROTECTED. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND CHEAPER, WHILE PREMIUMS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE FIVE YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE, WE ARE OFFERING PLANS ALREADY UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE OLD OBAMACARE AND BETTER. WE ARE STOPPING SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING. I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IMPOSING PRICE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE TO DO, BUT NOW THEY DO, THOSE SAME PRICES FALL VERY FAST. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE NEW GENERIC DRUGS WHICH ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE NAMEBRAND DRUGS, BUT AT A TINY FRACTION OF THE COST. THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD. I ALWAYS LIKE A NAMEBRAND. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE PROBABLY. WE HAVE TOTALLY TRANSFORMED VETERANS HEALTH CARE, GETTING ALONG , LONG SOUGHT V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY AFTER 50 YEARS. HOPEFULLY NOBODY IN THIS GREAT ARENA NEEDS IT, BUT WE HAVE PASSED SOMETHING THEY SAID COULD NOT HAPPEN, THE SPECTACULAR RIGHT TO TRY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IF YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL YOU COULD GO OVER THE WORLD, BUT IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOU GO HOME AND DIE. TERMINALLY ILL, THEY GO ALL OVER THE WORLD IF THEY HAVE MONEY, TO ASIA, EUROPE. FINDING THE GREATEST DOCTORS, LABS IN THE WORLD. PIPELINES OF DRUGS COMING FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. NOW YOU SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HOLD ANYONE LIABLE, YOU GET TO USE THAT DRUG AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE. HOPEFULLY YOU DO NOT NEED IT, BUT NOW WE HAVE RIGHT TO TRY. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING 51 YEARS TO GET THAT APPROVED. WE GOT IT APPROVED. I GUESS I AM GOOD AT ADDING THINGS APPROVED, AREN'T I? THOSE PEOPLE I BROUGHT APPEAR WHERE THE REASON, EVERY ONE OF THEM. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 32 YEARS. WE HAVE LAUNCHED NEW INITIATIVES COMBATING KIDNEY DISEASE, WHICH IS A BIG DEAL. KIDNEY DISEASE IS SO TOUGH. PEOPLE DIE FROM SO MUCH WORK, OVERWORK. IT IS CRAZY. IN THEORY THEY COULD GO FOR A LONG TIME, BUT DIALYSIS AND ALL THE STUFF THEY HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE MADE IT EASIER AND IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE INVOLVED. ALSO, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, WE ARE MAKING STRIDES. IT IS A GREAT THING. WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN NEONATAL RESEARCH TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENTS AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN SO DOING. VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE-TERM ABORTION OF BABIES BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT OF GOD. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS A PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION AND TOTAL OBLITERATION OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND OF COURSE, THE LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. [APPLAUSE] REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING CITIZENS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND, EVERY COMMUNITY AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. WE ARE THE PARTY OF BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM, EXCITEMENT, ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM. WE ARE A BIG PARTY. WE ARE THE PARTY OF BIG IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. THIS IS WHERE IT IS. THIS IS WHERE IT IS. THIS IS NOT THE OLD REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS A VERY INCLUSIVE PARTY. THIS IS A GREAT PARTY. REPUBLICANS ARE PROUDLY FIGHTING FOR NATIONWIDE SCHOOL CHOICE, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WE WANT TO GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT FROM KINDERGARTEN TO 12TH GRADE BECAUSE NO PARENT SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. I PASSED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM TO GIVE FORMER VISITORS A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BY ANYONE BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY CAME TO ME, A GROUP OF PEOPLE, AND THEY WANTED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT THE ISSUE, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF GREAT REPUBLICANS IN FAVOR OF IT, INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TODAY. I STARTED STUDYING THE ISSUE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, YOU SAW ALICE JOHNSON COME OUT OF PRISON . 22 YEARS. SHE HAD ANOTHER 20 YEARS LEFT FOR A PHONE CALL. A GREAT WOMAN, BUT WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE COMING OUT THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE ANYWHERE NEAR THOSE TERMS, NOT FOR THOSE TERMS. THEY CAME TO SEE ME, A GROUP OF PEOPLE. THEY NEEDED FOUR SENATORS. THEY NEEDED HELP. I CALLED EVERYBODY. THEY NEEDED FOUR SENATORS, MAYBE FIVE, AND HELP WITH SOME OF THE ONES NOT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I GAVE IT TO THEM AND GOT IT AND IT WAS NOT EASY. WE HAVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THEN A PROGRAM THAT GETS NO READINGS AT ALL AND THEY SAY, VAN JONES WANTS TO TAKE EVERYONE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I CALLED OUR GREAT FIRST LADY AND SAID DARLING, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK. IT WILL BE NICE. THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE CLOSE WITHOUT ME. I GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE TOGETHER, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COULD NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING IT AND THEY TRIED. SO HE GETS UP AND STARTS BY SAYING, I WANT TO THANK THE REVEREND AL SHARPTON. [CROWD BOOING] I KNEW AL WHEN HE WAS VERY HEAVY. HE LOOKS BETTER WHEN HE WAS HEAVY, ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE. LOOKED MUCH BETTER WHEN HE WAS HEAVY. I HAVE TO TELL HIM. BECAUSE I KNOW HIM WELL. HE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE CANNOT ADMITTED ON TELEVISION. HE SAYS I WANT TO THANK THE REVEREND AL SHARPTON. NAME AFTER NAME OF PEOPLE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. MY WIFE SAID, ARE THEY GOING TO THINK ABOUT YOU? I SAID, DARLING, OF COURSE. HE IS SAVING ME UNTIL THE END. THIS IS TRUE. I SAID, HE IS SAVING ME UNTIL THE END. IT WILL BE AN HONOR TO BE RECOGNIZED BECAUSE I DO NOT GET ENOUGH PUBLICITY. I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE. HE GOT TO THE END AND HE DID NOT SAY IT. SHE STARTED TO SMILE. I THINK SHE LOVED IT, IN A CERTAIN WAY. SHE SAID, IT IS TOO BAD. THEN HE SET I HAVE ONE MORE THING TO SAY. WE MUST GET OUT THIS YEAR AND FIGHT AND VOTE AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? [CROWD BOOING] TRUE STORY. SO I WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED IN FRONT OF OUR GREAT FIRST LADY, BUT I WILL LIVE THROUGH IT SOMEHOW. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, 52 YEARS. 52 YEARS IN GOLD LINE HEIGHTS THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING FOR IT , GOLAN HE IGHTS, THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING FOR IT. HOW MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE PROMISED THEY WOULD DO THAT? THEY NEVER DID IT. I DID IT. WE INVESTED MORE THAN 2 TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE U.S. MILITARY INCLUDING MORE THAN $150 MILLION THIS YEAR IN CHARLESTON, FORT JACKSON AND PARRIS ISLAND. AND WE CREATED THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE. WE HAVE ANOTHER BRANCH, 72 YEARS. NOT FOR 72 YEARS, THE AIR FORCE. WHEN I FIRST SAID IT, EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS JOKING LIKE FROM THE COMIC STRIPS OR THE FUTURE MOVIES. I SAID IT IS ALL ABOUT SPACE. IN A NUMBER OF YEARS PEOPLE WILL SAY, I CANNOT BELIEVE WE DID NOT DO THIS SOONER. WE NEED VISION AND FORESIGHT. WHEN I MENTIONED SPACE FORCE, AT ARENAS LIKE THIS IT GETS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HANDS. THAT IS WHERE IT IS AT, AND WHERE IT IS GOING, FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY. WE NEEDED FOR DEFENSE AND OFFENSE. 72 YEARS. FOR YEARS WE WATCHED POLITICIANS APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AT STAKE IN OUR BATTLE IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. YOU SEE THESE MANIACS WE ARE DEALING WITH. THEY WANT TO GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING. WE WILL END UP BEING VENEZUELA, LARGE-SCALE VERSION. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR TO SECURE, WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING WE HAVE FOR VICTORY IN NOVEMBER OF 2020. NOVEMBER 3, TO BE EXACT. ONLY THIS WAY CAN WE SAVE THE AMERICA WE LOVE AND DRAIN THE SWAMP. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS THIS DEEP. MAN. I TALKED ABOUT A SWAMP, YOU NEVER TOLD ME IT WAS THIS BAD, FELLAS. THAT SWAMP IS BAD, YOU HAVE DIRTY COPS AT THE TOP OF THE FBI, A LOT OF DIRTY PEOPLE. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE PHENOMENAL PEOPLE IN THE FBI AND OTHER PLACES. BUT WE ARE DRAINING THAT SWAMP. I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD BE THAT DIRTY. WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF HELP FROM A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. LOOK AT SOME OF THE STORIES YOU HAVE, SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE STORIES. LOOK AT TIM SCOTT, THAT INCREDIBLE STORY. I GIVE 99% OF THE CREDIT TO TIM SCOTT'S MOTHER. I DO. I GUARANTEE YOU, TIM, THERE WERE NO GAMES AND YOUR HOUSEHOLDS. IT WAS, LET'S GO TO WORK. GREAT MOTHER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENACT THROUGH TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE "MADE IN THE USA." WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC. NOBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS POSSIBLE. IN LESS NOW THAN NINE YEARS. WE WILL END THE AIDS EPIDEMIC. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THAT? WE WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND BE THE FIRST NATION IN THE WORLD TO PLANT OUR FLAG ON MARS. HAVE TO LAND ON THE MOON BEFORE YOU GO TO MARS. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. ABOVE ALL WE WILL NUMBERS , NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECTS OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, "IN GOD WE TRUST." FROM GREENVILLE TO COLUMBIA, FROM MYRTLE BEACH TO HILTON HEAD, TO WRITE HERE IN CHARLESTON, THIS STATE IS HOME TO SOME OF THE TOUGHEST MEN AND STRONGEST WOMEN TO WALK ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO HAVE CROSSED THE OCEANS, BLAZED TRAILS, SETTLED THE CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, DUG OUT THE PANAMA CANAL, LAY DOWN THE RAILROADS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, LIBERATED MILLIONS FROM POVERTY, HUNGER AND DISEASE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND MADE AMERICA THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING USA] PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION AND DRIVE. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. YOU HAVE THE BEST YEAR EVER ON RECORD, BEST YEAR YOU HAVE EVER HAD. GREAT CONGRESS, GREATEST YEAR YOU HAVE EVER HAD, BUT SOME IN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE GETTING TIRED , I AM SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS, OF WINNING. AND SOME CALLED TWO GREAT SENATORS INTO A TOWN HALL AND SAID, SENATOR SCOTT, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, WE ARE TIRED OF WINNING IN SOUTH CAROLINA. CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. IT IS TOO MUCH. WE HAVE HAD YEARS WHEN WE WERE NOT WINNING AND IT WAS OK. WE COULD NOT GET JOBS, WE TOOK IT EASY. WE JUST WANT YOU TO GO AND SIT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT AND REPRESENT US AND SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, SOUTH CAROLINA IS TIRED OF WINNING. WE DO NOT WANT TO WIN ANYMORE. WE ARE TIRED, SICK OF WINNING. THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN AND SAY, THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA DO NOT WANT TO WIN ANYMORE. I WILL SAY, MR. SENATORS, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. SOUTH CAROLINA DOES WANT TO WIN MORE THAN ANYBODY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE A THING BECAUSE WE ARE WINNING LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND WE WILL KEEP IT THAT WAY. SORRY, SENATORS. GO BACK TO SOUTH CAROLINA, BECAUSE WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. BECAUSE TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA CROWD AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN, AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, SOUTH CAROLINA.

DO YOU THINK OUR OPPONENTS WERE THRILLED WHEN THEY SAW THE STOCK MARKET? I DON'T THINK SO. BY THE WAY LOOK AT THIS. LOOK BACK THERE. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT PRESS. I DON'T KNOW SLEEPY JOE OR BERNIE HAD THAT MUCH PRESS. BERNIE WAS GOING WILD. WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WHY WOULD I BE HERE? HE SAID WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIMARY. WE'VE ALREADY WON THE THING YOU KNOW. I WAS GOING TO SAY THERE YOU KNOW WHAT THING BUT I HELD IT BACK BECAUSE THEY'LL SAY HORRIBLE LANGUAGE THEY WILL USE HORRIBLE LANGUAGE. BUT WE ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE SO UNIFIED AS IT IS NOW. (APPLAUSE) NEVER EVER. YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT ENTHUSIASM FOR CRAZY BERNIE AND THAT IS TRUE HE DOES HAVE SOME ENTHUSIASM BUT MUCH LESS THAN WE HAVE AND A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR BIDEN. I THOUGHT HE GAVE UP THE PRESIDENCY BECAUSE HE SAID HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. I LOOKED AT THE FIRST LADY AND SAID HEY HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. AND TODAY HE JUST SAID, SUPER THURSDAY, HE IS LOOKING FOR TO SUPER THURSDAY. JOBS ARE BOOMING IN OUR COUNTRY. IN COMES THE SOARING. POVERTY IS PLUMMETED. CONFIDENCE IS SURGING AND WE HAVE COMPLETELY REBUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF A THING CALLED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. (APPLAUSE) AND EVERY DAY FOR ME AND FOR YOU IT'S PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. EVERY DAY. (APPLAUSE) ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISES I'VE MADE, IS RIGHT TO THIS ERA, WE LOOK AT IT, IT'S THE NEVER ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE TAKING OUR SOLDIERS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. WE ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. AMERICAN TROOPS CANNOT BE THE POLICEMAN FOR THE WORLD, OR TO CREATE DEMOCRACY AND OTHER NATIONS AND FRANKLY PROBABLY DON'T WANT IT. THE TOP OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS TO SECURE AND DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. (APPLAUSE) ... ... TWO DATES AGO THE UNITED STATES SIGNED A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN AFTER 19 YEARS OF CONFLICT AND VERY CLOSE TO 20. WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO BRING OUR AMAZING TROOPS BACK HOME. (APPLAUSE) AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING OUR NATION AND TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN AMERICAN CITIZENS. AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE, WE'VE WIPED OUT TERRORISM, WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE 8000 MILES AWAY. YOU GOT A LOT OF BIG COUNTRIES SURROUNDING AFGHANISTAN. YOU HAVE AFGHANISTAN ITSELF. THE PROGRESS THERE WAS MADE, WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE EXTRAORDINARY BALLOR OF OUR MEN AND OUR WOMEN IN UNIFORM. YOU KNOW THAT. AND WE PAY A SPECIAL TRIBUTE AND I KNOW YOU PAY IT. A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO OUR GREAT WOUNDED WARRIORS AND THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. (APPLAUSE) AS WE BRING BACK OUR TROOPS WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN TERRORISTS ARE DENIED ADMISSION TO AMERICA AND THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE, AND IF THEY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM. WE MUST KEEP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. BY THE WAY I HAVE TO SAY THIS. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, AND SOMEBODY WAS SAYING THAT IF POCAHONTAS OR ANYONE OF THEM, SLEEPY JOE, HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT, BUT IF SLEEPY JOE OR IF ANY OF THEM HAD A CROWD ONE TENTH OF THE SIZE, THEY GO AROUND TALKING ABOUT HOW BIG THE CROWD IS. TAKE YOUR CAMERAS AND SPIN THAT SPIN THEM AROUND THIS BIG ARENA. (APPLAUSE) (NOISE) (APPLAUSE) THEY DON'T TURN HIM THEY DON'T TURN THEM. YOU NOTICE THEY DON'T TURN. THEM BUT IF THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THE CORNER, ANYTHING TO MAKE US LOOK BAD, THAT CAMERA WOULD TURN LIKE A PRETZEL. I USED TO THINK MODERN EQUIPMENT CAN'T TURN, BUT WE WOULD HAVE A PROTESTER AND I MUST SAY I'LL SAY IT OUT LOUD, WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY PROTESTERS ANYMORE DO WE? WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY. (APPLAUSE) NO FUN TO BE A PROTESTER AT A TRUMP RALLY. BUT DO WE HAVE A GREAT TIME AT A TRUMP RALLY? (APPLAUSE) MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TAKEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN MODERN HISTORY. TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM THE CORONA VIRUS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING. IT'S HORRIBLE. INCLUDING SWEEPING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. TODAY WE MET WITH THE BIG GREAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND THEY ARE REALLY WORKING HARD AND WORKING SMART, AND WE HAD A GREAT MEETING TODAY WITH A LOT OF THE GREAT COMPANIES THEY HAVE THEY WILL HAVE VACCINES RELATIVELY SOON. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU BETTER AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE EVEN SOONER, SO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. BUT WE HAVE STRONG BORDERS AND REALLY OUR TOUGH AND EARLY ACTIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN PROVEN TO BE 100% RIGHT. WE WENT OUT. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO KEEP IN OUR POWER TO KEEP THE SICK AND INFECTED PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD. WE CLOSED OUR BORDERS VERY EARLY. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT. REMEMBER WHEN I CLOSED THE BORDERS TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WORLD? I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT, BUT THERE ARE GLOBALISTS WHO WOULD RATHER KEEP OUR BORDERS OPEN AND KEEP OUR INFECTIONS, THINK OF IT, THINK OF ALL THE INFECTIONS THAT WOULD COME IN. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND ALTERNATE FAIRNESS. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. REMEMBER THIS. OVER THE LAST LONG PERIOD OF TIME, THE FLU, FROM 27,000 TO 70,000 PEOPLE GET INFECTED, AND MANY PEOPLE DIE. THINK OF IT. 27,000. YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE TO THE COMMON FLU. IT CAN BE MUCH MORE. WHEN YEAR WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE 70,000 NUMBER. THOSE PEOPLE DIE. SO WHEN YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE A YEAR, NOBODY KNEW THAT. I DID NOT KNOW. THAT THREE FOUR WEEKS AGO I WAS SITTING DOWN I SAID WHEN WE LOSE WITH THE REGULAR FLU? THEY SAID 20,000 MINIMUM AND GOES UP TO 70 SOMETIMES EVEN 80. WHEN YEAR IT WENT UP TO 100,000 PEOPLE. I SAID NOBODY TOLD ME THAT NOBODY KNOWS THAT. SO I TOLD THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH THAT VACCINE. REALLY. YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THAT VACCINE. (APPLAUSE) LAST YEAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 36,000 PEOPLE DIED. WE ARE WORKING HARD ON IT AND WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME REALLY GREAT SOLUTIONS. IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE STOPPING. (APPLAUSE) ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA BY THE WAY? (APPLAUSE) ... WILL WE HAVE BOTH PLACES BUT THAT WAS FROM NORTH CAROLINA. (APPLAUSE) BUT JUST TO FINISH UP. WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, WE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB WITH IT. WE ARE KEEPING OUR BORDER STRONG. MY JOB IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN PATIENTS AND AMERICANS FIRST. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO POLITICIZE THE CORONAVIRUS. DENIGRATING THE NOBLE WORK OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, BUT HONESTLY NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. EVERYONE APPRECIATES THEM. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORLD AT WHAT THEY DO. WE ARE ACTUALLY HELPING A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE SOME VERY VERY BIG PROBLEMS. WE HAVE OUR PROFESSIONALS IN CONSTANT TOUCH. I AM IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE LEADERS AND HELPING THEM OUT, BUT THE POLITICAL ATTACKS OF SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS REALLY MUST START. WE HAVE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ONE TO SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. WE WILL SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. THE UNITED STATES. (APPLAUSE) THE UNITED STATES IS, RIGHT NOW, RANKED BY FAR, NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD FOR PREPAREDNESS. EARLIER TODAY WHEN I MET WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, THINGS WERE DISCUSSED AND LEARNED. HONESTLY, THE MEDIA DID NOT KNOW, NOBODY KNEW, THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE, AND WE LEARNED A LOT, AND MAYBE THAT HAD THE IMPACT OF THE STOCK MARKET. WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED? BUT WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, THE DURATION OF THE VIRUS. WE DISCUSSED ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE WILL BRING THESE THERAPIES TO MARK IT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, WITH A THRIVING ECONOMY, THE WAY IT IS, AND THE MOST ADVANCED HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH, AMERICA IS SO RESULTANT. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH. WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. THE RENEWAL OF AMERICAN STRENGTH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MEANS OUR TIMES OF CHALLENGE. WE ARE THE BEST PREPARED TO RISE TO ANY OCCASION. NO COUNTRY IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN AMERICA TO HANDLE NEW THREATS, AND KNOW PEOPLE ARE MORE SKILLED, TALENTED, TOUGH, OR DRIVEN, THEN AMERICANS. (APPLAUSE) AND TOGETHER, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. LAST MONTH, WE ADDED 225,000 NEW JOBS IN JANUARY ALONE. THAT MAKES 7 MILLION JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE DESTROYED THE ISIS TERRITORY AND WE KILL THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS AL-BAGHDADI HE IS DEAD. (APPLAUSE) AND WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD QASSEM SOLEIMANI, ENDING HIS EVIL REIGN OF TERROR FOREVER. SOLEIMANI. WHILE THE EXTREME LEFT HAS BEEN WASTING AMERICA'S TIME WITH FILE HOAXES AND DELUSIONAL WITCH HUNTS, WE HAVE BEEN KILLING TERRORISTS, CREATING JOBS, RAISING WAGES, AND LIFTING UP AMERICAN CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, AND CREEK. (APPLAUSE) TOMORROW, VOTERS IN STATES ACROSS THE NATION WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR SUPER TUESDAY, NOT SUPER THURSDAY. OH HE SAID SUPER THURSDAY. YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID SUPER THURSDAY? IT WOULD BE OVER. I WOULD BE OVER. NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T AS AN EXAMPLE NAME LIKE, SLEEPY JOE.

(APPLAUSE) BUT DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE? DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE WHERE HE SAID, LAST YEAR 150 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY GUNS AND OUR COUNTRY. 150 MILLION. THAT MEANS 50% OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S A BIG STORY MAN. COULD YOU IMAGINE TRUMP SAYING THAT? THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER LET ME LIVE. WE CAN'T MAKE A LITTLE MISTAKE RIGHT? WE CAN'T EVEN MAKE A LITTLE TINY TINY MISTAKE. IF WE MAKE A TINY MISTAKE IT'S HEADLINE NEWS. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE 150 MILLION PEOPLE KILLED, GUNS. THEY SAY SUPER THURSDAY. THEY SAY GEORGIA. HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WINNING GEORGIA TOMORROW. GEORGIA IS NOT IN SUPER TUESDAY. SO MANY MISTAKES. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THESE COUNTRIES, YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

SOMEBODY ELSE TOOK THE CONVENTION CENTER AND SPENT A FORTUNE. I JUST TOOK A HOTEL BALLROOM AND SAID WITH THE HECK, IF I WIN NOBODY CARES, AND IF I DON'T, LOOK IF YOU WIN NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ARE IN. IF YOU LOSE, NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ERIN WRAY?

WE LIKE TO TROLL, WE LIKE TO GO THE NIGHT BEFORE ONE OF THEIR PRIMARIES, AND WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. IT'S CALLED WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. BERNIE SANDERS WAS VERY UPSET. WHY WOULD HE BE THERE? WHY? BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN. THAT'S A GOOD REASON. BUT HONESTLY, WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOUR TWO MONTHS OR THREE MONTHS OUT, WE ARE GETTING NUMBERS THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE. COLORADO, WE WENT TO IOWA, EVERY PLACE WE'VE GONE, YOU HAMPSHIRE, EVERY PLACE WE'VE GONE JUST CAME OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA, SO THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ONE.

LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN, WE CANNOT FORGET WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING YOU ON THE OTHER. SITE BERNIE SANDERS IS SO LIBERAL HE DOES NOT EVEN CALL HIMSELF A DEMOCRAT. HE CALLS HIMSELF A SOCIALIST. THIS PRESIDENT WENT TO THE STATE OF THE UNION AND HE SAID AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. THAT IS ANOTHER PROMISE HE HAS GOT TO KEEP. NOW FINALLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING BACK AND I CAN'T WAIT TO LOOK AT HIM IN AUGUST FOR THE RNC CONVENTION. MISTER PRESIDENT, IT WAS ONE THING THAT YOU SAID BACK IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 2016. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S HAPPENED. HAVE YOU GOTTEN TIRED OF WINNING? . DO YOU WANT TO WIN SOME MORE? THEN YOU HAVE THIS TO GET THIS MAN RE-ELECTED SO THAT WE CAN GET WITH THIS COUNTRY DESERVES. FREE BARGAINS, BREACH RAINS FREE, TRAITS FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM FOR YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. THAT IS THE FREEDOM THAT THIS MAN REPRESENTS. THAT IS THE FREEDOM I REPRESENT GET HIM ELECTED FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. WOW. WOW. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD TIME. A LOT OF TIMES WE GET PEOPLE UP AND THEY JUST CANNOT DO IT. . THEY START BREATHING THAT, THEY CANNOT BREATHE, HELP ME. LIKE BLOOMBERG. HE GOES ALL. DID YOU SEE THE DEBATE? OH. SHE CAME AFTER HIM SHE'S BEEN SHE'S VERY MEAN. SHE CAME AFTER HIM AND HE STARTED CHOKING. OH OH GET ME OFF THE STAGE YOU GUYS DID NOT TELL ME THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. NO THAT WAS GREAT TOM. WE'RE ALSO HONOR TO BE JOINED TOGETHER BY A TRUE AMERICAN HERO, A VETERAN OF WORLD WAR II, AND THE KOREAN WAR WHO JUST TURNED 100 YEARS OLD. (APPLAUSE) HIS NAME IS GEORGE WASHINGTON PARROT. GEORGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GEORGE. 100 YEARS OLD. (APPLAUSE) HE'S 100 AND HE LOOKS GOOD THANK YOU GEORGE. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, AMERICA HAS NOW BECOME THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET EARTH. SINCE MY ELECTION, OVER 219,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA. (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF WELFARE, INCLUDING 7 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER EVER RECORDED. THINK OF THAT. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FROM MY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. PRESIDENT IN RECORDED HISTORY. THAT IS THAT BIG. IT IS THAT BIG. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS HISPANIC AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORDED HISTORY. (APPLAUSE) VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AFRICAN AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. AFRICAN AMERICAN POVERTY IS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BETRAYED AND THEY TRULY DID. THEY BETRAYED AFRICAN AMERICANS. MY ADMINISTRATION IS DELIVERING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, LIKE NEVER BEFORE. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY, AND IT IS AN HONOR TO DO IT. LAST MONTH HERE IN CHARLOTTE, WE LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT IS CALLED OPPORTUNITY NOW. YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT WORKING FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE, REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AN AVERAGE OF 2200 DOLLARS THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. (APPLAUSE) THE REPUBLICANS ARE CLAIMING THAT WE DID THAT. NOBODY ELSE DID THAT. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING HOW DID THEY DO THAT ONE? WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT THE SUN MADE IT MANUFACTURING IN NORTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. IT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I'M RUNNING. THE DEALS WE ARE MAKING, THE TRADE DEALS WHO ARE MAKING ARE UNBELIEVABLE. YOUR STATE LOST 43% OF ALL MANUFACTURING SHOPS, AFTER NAFTA WAS SIGNED. THINK ABOUT THAT. WEEKS AGO, WE FINALLY ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE AND I SIGNED THE BRAND NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT IN THE WORLD. THE USMCA IS A GIANT VICTORY FOR NORTH CAROLINA. AND CREDIBLE FOR FARMERS AND FACTORY WORKERS. BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF FARMERS AND FACTORY WARNER'S FACTORY WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, FOR THE DEATH TAX. YOU KNOW THE INHERITANCE TAX? YOU HAVE A SMALL FARM SOMEPLACE YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS, YOU HAVE A NICE BUSINESS. YOU KNOW LONGER HAVE AN INHERITANCE TAX OR A DEATH TAX SO IF YOU WANT IT TO YOU OR LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN. THERE IS NO TAX TO BE PAID BY YOUR CHILDREN. SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE EVIL BANK AND MORE MONEY FROM THE BANKER, LOSE THE FARM, LOSE THE BUSINESS. IT WON'T HAPPEN. AND I ALWAYS SAY, I KNOW A LOT OF PARENTS, THEY DON'T LOVE THEIR CHILDREN VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT DOES NOT LOVE YOUR CHILDREN? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. NOBODY. NOBODY, THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE NORTH CAROLINA. YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN DON'T LEAVE THEM A THING OK? BUT YOU DON'T YOU DO NOT HAVE THE INHERITANCE TAX ANYMORE WHICH IS GREAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS MORE THOROUGHLY BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR DEMOCRATS SUPPORTS FREE FEDERAL WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS ON YOUR TAXES. NOT ONLY DOES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DURING OUR TREASURY, BUT IT THREATENS INNOCENT LIVES, AS A JUST ONE HEARTBREAKING EXAMPLE, TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN MARYLAND THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER WAS RELEASED UNACCOUNTABLE RELEASED AND WENT ON TO MURDER A TEENAGE GIRL, BEATING HER WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND SLASHING HER WITH A MACHETE. THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC FIELD SUPPORTS DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS TO TERRORIZE YOUR COMMUNITIES, RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SANCTUARY COUNTY OF DURHAM RELEASED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL, WHO THEN PROCEEDED TO VICIOUSLY MURDER A YOUNG 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, KILLING HER AND DUMPING HER BODY INTO THE WOODS. LAST YEAR ALONE, SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN TO NORTH CAROLINA? DELIBERATELY SET FREE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS, AND THESE ARE REALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF BURGLARY, GUN CRIMES, SEXUAL ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING AND EVEN MURDER GOT TO CHANGE THIS. AND WILL BAN SANCTUARY CITIES IN YOUR STATE, WHAT IS HE THINKING? BUT WHILE YOU ARE SUPER LEVEL GOVERNOR IS PUTTING YOUR FAMILIES AT RISK, YOUR REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOM TILLIS HAS INTRODUCED A BILL ALLOWING AMERICAN VICTIMS TO SUE SANCTUARY CITIES FOR THE HORRIBLE PAIN, ANGUISH, AND SUFFERING THAT INFLICT ON OUR PEOPLE WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL! MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL, BY THE WAY. . WE BUILT 127 MILES AS OF TODAY, 127 MILES. AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. THE MEDIA IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WHEN I EXPLAIN. BECAUSE FINALLY THEY SAY I'VE HAD OBSTRUCTION LIKE YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I CAN GET ANYTHING, I CREATED SPACE FORCE, I CAN DO ANYTHING. BUT LINDSAY AND TOM TILLIS KNOW THIS, MARK KNOWS, THIS ALL OF THEM KNOW THIS, IF I WANT TO TEN CENTS FOR THE WALL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT NOW WE HAVE IT AND YOU THINK THAT IS EASY? NOBODY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS, WE ARE BUILDING OUR HEARTS AWAY, WE WILL SOON BE BUILDING MANY MILES A WEEK, BUT WE'RE UP TO OVER 125, 127 MILES OF THE SUPER WALL. I WANT TO BORDER PATROL AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR WISH, WELL IT'S LIKELY TO BE STEEL AND CONCRETE. THEY WANTED EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE, AND THE BARRIERS UP TOP ONE EVERYTHING, IT'S CALLED A NO CLIMB PROVIDER, NO CLIMB PROVIDES, OR I SAID WHAT IS THE WORD PROVIDES OR MAINE AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CLIMB OVER, IT'S VERY TOUGH. AND A PART OF THE WALL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY WERE PLANNING A WALL AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS TO TAKE THEM, DOWN THAT IS WHAT THE NO CLIMB IS. THAT'S A NO CRIME, AND WHAT A VOICE. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, IT'S GOING GREAT, SO THEY SAID HE'S BUILDING THE WALL, BUT MEXICO'S NOT PAYING FOR IT. YOU WILL SEE. YOU WILL SEE. SOME OF YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I TOLD A FEW PEOPLE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS LEAKED TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, IF YOU WANT TO AND SANCTUARY CITIES IN NORTH CAROLINA, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE, YOU MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN. YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO. THINGS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BOARDING CROSSINGS BY A STAGGERING 75%. WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, ONE OF THE WORST LOOPHOLES YOU EVER WILL SEE, CATCH AND RELEASE, YOU CATCH AND YOU SAY WHERE DO YOU LIVE? THEY DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THEY DON'T KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT,. AND MEXICO, MAYBE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, WHO KNOWS, EL SALVADOR WHERE, DO YOU LIVE? THIS GUY IS A MEXICAN, YOU ARE ABOUT AS MEXICAN AS I AM. LOOK AT THIS GUY, HE'S AS MEXICAN AS I AM, LOOK AT THAT HAT. ARE YOU MEXICAN? ARE YOU MEXICAN? NO, YOU ARE NOT. ARE YOU? HE IS. IT'S LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN INDIAN, I SAID RIGHT. I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THEN YOU HAVE AND I HAVE NOT, AND SHE SAID THIS IS TERRIBLE, THAT SHE WENT OUT AND GOT A TEST, AND IT TURNED OUT NOT SO GOOD FOR HER. 1024TH. 1000TH. SO I THOUGHT I HAVE MORE AND ME. WHAT A PHONY SHE IS. WHAT A PHONY. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME, 100 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS TRY TO DESTROY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY WITH ME, I'M GOING TO END THE FIRST TIME, AND ALL OF THAT HAS MADE IT STRONGER, YOU KNOW THAT. MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROTECTING YOU, SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR MEDICARE FAN DECIDING TO GIVE YOU GREAT HEALTH CARE, WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE. WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR AND A PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE. REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA? YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN. 28 TIMES THEY SAID IMPEACH HIM, YOU SHOULD IMPEACH HIM, WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. 20 TIMES HE SAID THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN, WELL IT'S NOT TRUE. THERE WASN'T. IMPEACH HIM. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND MUCH CHEAPER PREMIUMS DOUBLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE ARE NOW UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE AND THEY ARE BETTER PLANS. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WELL. WE ARE TRYING TO TERMINATE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE WORSE HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST HEALTH CARE YOU'VE EVER SEEN AT A LOWER PRICE, AND OF COURSE, PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE'RE FIGHTING TO STOP SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SURPRISE, YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SURPRISES. PEOPLE TAKE A BLOOD TEST AND IN ONE PLACE IS 26 DOLLARS, AND IN THE OTHER PLACE IT'S 2000 DOLLARS. SAME BLOOD TEST, MAYBE THE CHEAP ONE IS BETTER, WHO KNOWS. SAME BLOOD TESTS, IT'S WRONG. SURPRISE, MEDICAL BUILDING. I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IMPOSING PRICE TRANSPARENCY, THAT IS GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, THOSE SAME PRICES FALL VERY FAST, IT'S A BIG THING. THAT'S A BIG THING. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE DRUGS THAT ARE AS GOOD AS NAME BRAND DRUGS BUT A FRACTION OF THE COST. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM, AND THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE NOT TO DO THAT, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. TO CARE FOR OUR AMAZING VETERANS, WE PASSED VA CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNTABILITY, AND NOBODY SAID IT COULD BE DONE. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING ONLINE FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS TO SEE A DOCTOR, YOU GO OUTSIDE, YOU GET A DOCTOR, YOU GET ALL FIXED UP, WHAT A GREAT THING. IT'S CALLED ME A CHOICE. HE'S BEEN TRYING TO PASS IT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. AND THOSE PEOPLE WERE A GREAT HELP, WE HAVE PASSED A SPECTACULAR RIGHT TO TRY, YOU KNOW THAT IS? HOPEFULLY NOBODY NEEDS IT. HOPEFULLY NOBODY IN THE ROOM NEEDS WHITE TO TRY, WE ARE COMBATTING THE OPIOID ACADEMIC, DECLINING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 31 YEARS. BIG PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE LAUNCHED NEW INITIATIVES COMBATTING GETTING DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S. AND WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN NEONATAL RESEARCH TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENCE, AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN SO DOING. FORTUNATELY EVERY DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE HAS DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR LATE TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABY STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH. HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE TERM ABORTIONS UP A PIECE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT OF GOD. THEN YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE BABY IS BORN THE BABY IS BORN YOUTH ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOTHER ABOUT IF YOU EXECUTE THE BABY, THIS IS THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, HE IS A BEAUTY, REMEMBER WHAT HE DID? HE WANTED TO DANCE LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS WIFE STOPPED HIM, HE GOT LUCKY. BUT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WANTED TO DO THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE GOES OVER AND TALKS TO THE MOTHER AND YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE BABY LIVE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT? THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THE PARTY OF LATE TERM ABORTIONS, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION AND THE OBLITERATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. SO MANY PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME TODAY, AND THEY WANT ME TO FIGHT AND WE ARE DOING IT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE SO THAT EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS IT GETS IT WITH NO PARENT EVER FORCING TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT COOL. I PASS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, ALICE JOHNSON, AND THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN CAPITAL IN JERUSALEM. WE RECOGNIZE THE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, INCLUDE 200 MILLION DOLLARS TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAS HEARD OF IN THIS AUDIENCE, I'M SURE. FORT BRAGG. 300 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MARINE CORPSb POINT. MORE THAN 500 MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AIR STATION NEW RIVER, AND LISTEN TO THIS ONE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND MONEY, MORE THAN 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAMP LESSON. AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG MILITARY, WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER HAD. OUR MILITARY AND 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS WENT INTO. WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE OUR POLITICIANS, AND YOU WANT A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND WE'RE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ALWAYS WELL. . AS TAKEN OUR PRESENT BATTLE WITH THE ACTUAL SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION ITSELF. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THAT BLESSINGS OF GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT AND DIED TO SECURE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SECURING US, OUR FREEDOM, WE ARE DEVOTING EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY IN NOVEMBER, NOVEMBER 3RD, TO BE EXACT. I WE HAVE TO DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP WHICH IS MUCH MORE VICIOUS AND DIRTIER AND DEEPER THAN I EVER THOUGHT BUT WE ARE KICKING. WITH YOUR HEALTH, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY, TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. ROUND WE WILL REELECT COME TELL US. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO ANGRY AT YOU, I ONLY COME BACK A FEW TIME OF THE YEAR. TOM IS GOING TO BE GREAT, I THINK THEY'RE A GREAT CHAMP. I THINK YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. ONE MORE HAND FOR TOM TELL US, PLEASE. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S RUNNING. WE WANT TO ENACT NEW TRADE DEALS THAT RESULTED IN NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LESS THAN NINE YEARS, WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?469845-1/president-trump-rally-charlotte-north-carolina	President Trump spoke to a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina.

CSPANDT167202048	Donald Trump	2020-07-16	President Trump Remarks on Rolling Back Regulations	We're here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by a merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive, burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people - slashing take-home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas - millions and millions and millions. It never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker, and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. (Applause.) Thank you. At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise: For every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal - which, at the time, people said was impossible - we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. (Applause.) Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic, regulatory burden Americans have been forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100 every single year. And we're going up from that number. (Applause.) We're going up from that number. Think of that: $3,100 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Wilbur, thank you very much. (Applause.) Labor Secretary, Eugene Scalia. Thank you. Thank you, Gene. (Applause.) Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar. Thank you, Alex. (Applause.) Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao. Thank you, Elaine. (Applause.) We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody has ever seen before. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. (Applause.) OMB Acting Director, Russ Vought. Thank you, Russ. (Applause.) And Small Business Administrator - I love her name - Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) And CMS Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great people. Those are great people. They do an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much, and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent - never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the Federal Register. That's why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations - more than any other President by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or, in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations - a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300 per year. Think of that: The average American, $2,300, regulation - hitting low-income Americans, by far, the hardest. These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African American communities. By contrast, our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my Council of Economic Advisers estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200 per vehicle. And I think we're going to get that up to $3,500 per vehicle. (Applause.) It's very exciting. And, by the way, the vehicles will be better, they'll be stronger, and they'll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband Internet services, and some home energy bills will be really historically cut - it's actually amazing - as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices - you look today - I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies - we're now the largest since we've been here - the largest energy source in the world. Nobody is even close. So it's great. But we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago - and, frankly, for a long time - but we've saved them. But $1.99, they were telling me - and, in some cases, lower than that. We're bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers - you didn't have any water, so you - the people that do the dishes - you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you'll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places - in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don't know what to do with it. It's called "rain." They don't have a problem. And old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs - I brought them back. I brought them back. (Applause.) They have two nice qualities: They're cheaper and they're better. They look better, and they make you look so much better. That's important to all of us. (Laughter.) But they're better and much cheaper. And they were mandated out, legislated out. And we brought them back, and they're selling like hotcakes. We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act, which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation, I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me - people that haven't cried since they were a baby. Some of them never even when they were a baby, and they were crying. Many people were cry- - we gave them back their life. They took away their land. They took away their rights. They took away their life. By reining in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of ensuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it's been in the last four decades. Yesterday, our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America's badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control. Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we're cutting the federal permitting timeline - it's already been done - to a maximum of two years or less; in some cases, even less than one year. And it's possible that it won't qualify. It's possible that it won't be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case, at least in a period of a year or two, we'll raise the hand and you won't make it. But most projects will make it, but you won't go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relay. We're reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers in our battle against the China virus. These actions save countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody has ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievements since World War Two. We're now making ventilators for countries all over the world. And medicine - accelerating the delivery of lifesaving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We're doing fantastically well on that. That'll be for another time, another meeting. But we are doing, on therapeutics and vaccines, incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up; that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic - and we're set up, militarily - we're going to be delivering it in record time. It's all set to move. We put an investment upfront. And we have logistical people - generals, great people - they're going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it. And we've made tremendous progress. You've been reading about it. In total, we've taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great autoworkers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators. So we've done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that. And we didn't have ventilators. We weren't set up for ventilators. We became a country that's making a lot of them, helping so many others - countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They're complex, they're expensive, they're big. Very, very, very tough to do. And we've saved a lot of lives. And there's never been a person in our country - even though we started with almost nothing; I say the cupboard was bare when we took over. We started with nothing. There's never been a person in our country - even though we had just absolutely no - we were - we were going on empty - never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. Think of that. Not one person - as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn't get it. We made telemedicine - (applause). Thank you. Great job. Great - really, a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don't want any credit. They should get the credit, but they get no credit. But we've done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that's really gone up by thousands and thousands of percentage points of percent. Because what happened is people that wouldn't even think of using telemedicine, all of a sudden, started using it, and it's really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems. So that's something. There's been great advancement. Furthermore, I have ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment and to employment, and - including a state that I love very much - I have a little history in that state - the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, Governor, for being here. Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much.  In Idaho, Governor Brad Little, who is here today with us as well, set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. (Applause.) Good. Good governor. Great governor. (Applause.) Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don't need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we're not only returning the money and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they're not happy about it - I can tell you that. I think you know that. (Applause.) The swamp was deep. I just didn't know how deep. (Laughter.) Deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefitting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey - a good state, New Jersey - and it's been really something that he's seen firsthand how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up and say a few words. Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Thanks. Good job. Good job. That was easy, wasn't it? Huh? (Laughs.) Thank you very much. Great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded healthcare and telehealth has been for you and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. So that's been a great help to you, telehealth. It's been an incredible - it's been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Chilton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama-Biden administration's ridiculous Waters of the United States rule - it's been a catastrophic rule, but it's gone now - which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land as though it were a lake. Jim, please come up and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn't a good one, but it's a good one now. Please. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. That was my honor, Jim, and thank you very much. It's terrible. It was - that you had to suffer so long. They took your property away from you. And you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You'll take care of it better, so we don't have to worry about that. Thank you very much. Beautifully said. Thank you. I want to just, as President, say that I will always fight to defend your rights and your freedoms. We'll fight very hard for your rights and your freedoms. The hard left wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and re-impose these disastrous regulations. They want to take what we've taken off, Jim, and they want to - they want to put them back on. And I guess they can do that. You'll fight them for a little while, but eventually you'll lose. And they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul-crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality - and right out of our people - and thoroughly crippled our nation's prized competitive edge. It's what we have: We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy and our very way of life are threatened by Biden's plans to transform our nation and subjugate our communities through the blunt-force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven't even seen yet. You think that was bad? You haven't even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the "unity" platform Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing - and this is all in writing; it's done; they agreed - they are proposing to reenter the job-killing, unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars - trillions and trillions of dollars - and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, and so will Russia, so will many other countries. They propose to mandate net-zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of homeownership out of reach for millions - destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home. I'm somebody that's built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn't look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell. But they've put it out of reach, from a cost standpoint. Totally out of reach. It's not practical, it's not good, and it doesn't work. They want to eliminate carbon from the U.S. energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal, and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shutdown would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities, and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go. Thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you've never seen. Companies would be disappearing left and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which was another beauty that we've done - not for now, but another great beauty. But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future, energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans, and the American Dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in D.C. have been and want to, at a much higher level, abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far-left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They are absolutely determined to eliminate single-family zoning, destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise. Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left want to significantly multiply what they're doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they wanted to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement while at the same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule - AFFH rule, a disaster - and our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed, that don't care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I'm here. The Biden-Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail - think of that. Think of that: bail. "No problem. They killed somebody? Let them out." Take a look at what's happening: Crime in New York City up 368 percent from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police, and they're in the process of doing it a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish. It's not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn't think it was real. You didn't think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal. How crazy is that? But they're actually trying to put it into play. It'll mean the end of this country. So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures - they want to get rid of prisons; they don't think anybody should go to prison - setting loose violent criminals; appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go, in many cases immediately, and making our wonderful cops - our great, great police, cops - subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime. Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don't know what they're doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital not only to the success of our economy, but the strength of our democracy and the survival of liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country: the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country, and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great, and together, we will make it greater, by far, than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. We must've said something right. I guess we said it absolutely right. It's about our country. It's about our country. We want to be strong, we want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement. And that's taking place in the areas that we're responsible for. We want others to call us for help. There's nothing wrong. Let Chicago call. Let Seattle call. We were going into Seattle, all set to go, and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in, and the hands went up; they gave up. It's so terrible when you see what's happening. Minneapolis - we said, "Get the guard in there." Three nights: "Get the guard in. Get the Guard." We got the Guard in. The National Guard. They've done a fantastic job. As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. (Applause.) You saw that, right? After four days of horror. It wasn't the police's fault in - in any of these places. They were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave. But you saw what happened. Minneapolis - "Grab - grab your gun and run." That's not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in, and we did a great job. No problem after that, do you notice? We just passed a statues and monument executive order. And they were going wild. They - see that beautiful - look at it right there. It's so beautiful - the Washington Monument. If they had the choice, they'd take it down. And I guarantee you they'd rename it. They want to rename it. They want George Washington out. They want Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don't know what they want. They just want to destroy our country. We're not going to let it happen. We're not letting it happen. So I'd now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike.  So we have many exciting things that we'll be announcing over the next eight weeks, I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible, and things that we're going to get done and we have gotten done - and we've started in most cases. But it's going to be a very exciting eight weeks, a eight weeks, like I prob- - I think, Mike, we can honestly say nobody has ever going to see eight weeks like we're going to have. Because we really have - we have - we're taking on immigration, taking on education, we're taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They can't - they've been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years. It wasn't happening. But you'll see levels of detail, and you'll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn't have in this country. We're going to get things done. We're going to get things done that they've wanted to see done for a long, long time. So I think we'll start sometime on Tuesday. We'll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that's one of many, many different plans. Then we're going into the immigration - the world of immigration, the world of education. We're going into the world of healthcare - very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss. But cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do, and we could do fairly easily. Nothing is easy in this country. We had statutory requirements where we'd do phase one, and then we'd have to wait 90 days. We'd do phase two, and we'd have to wait 60 days. You'd do phase three, and we're set - "Let's do phase four, sir." "I'm sorry you have to wait one year." But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do, or even close, on deregulation. And these trucks - this really is a great - a great little example. I don't know who thought of this idea, but it's actually quite, quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don't love having that big sucker hanging over my head. (Laughter.) I want to get out of here as fast as possible. But I do want to thank you all. Incredible people. You've done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. 	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473927-1/president-trump-remarks-rolling-back-regulations	President Trump delivered remarks from the White House South Lawn on deregulation.

CSPANDT178202049	Donald Trump	2020-08-17	President Trump Remarks in Oshkosh, Wisconsin	thank you very much wow. I don't know what happened something happened this was supposed to be just a quick little small gathering at this is what's happening and we call it a peaceful protest that way you could moderate how we're supposed to 50 people right so we have a little more and they turned away a lot of people outside so we'll call it a peaceful protest that we could do whatever we want. You know that's what they call it in New York in these different places Portland when they're rioting all over the streets they say it was a peaceful protest you could have thousands of people doing it we'll do the same thing I'm truly Brill to be here with you the hard work patriots of Wisconsin thank you. It's a big group of people. This is like a rally and so that's supposed to be a rally Woodard's the 1st Her lawyer. I hereby grade your pardon Right here thank you very much. Rob I want to thank you thank you in the months ahead we will need. Every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism we're in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself we are really in a fight. This is the most important election we've ever had in my opinion and I used to say it and I'd say it with great conviction 2016 but you know what that was a crazy people we were dealing there with or you know when the on the edge could get Hillary was on the edge she was on the verge she became crazy later on when she lost us which he began. But these are people that are seriously radical left Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet he has no clue what's happening. Or are or i'm them making speeches that are taped who want to listen to Michelle Obama do what they basically. Are you got to have her get up there. But we're doing a real speech on Thursday next Thursday she'll be listening. Doing a live live from the White House live from the White House so we have a we have plenty to say. So Joe Biden the Democrats have pledged to oppose 4 trillion dollars of new taxes so this is a a group of people that think it's good to raise everybody's taxes you know in the old days a politician would lower taxes right the Great Scott Walker is here your governor rather are on. And Scott would lower taxes but now the whole thing I guess it's changed it's got inside out now it really is going to raise your taxes but Republicans are lowering your taxes we gave you the biggest tax decrease of the history of our country and we're going lower had the are but they're going to massively increase your regulations in addition to your taxes they're going to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans are going to take away your 2nd Amendment. We're going to make America a sanctuary for criminal aliens are going to keep those sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities they're going to protect the criminals abolish American energy and make us reliant on foreign nations and force taxpayers to fund to extreme late term abortion that's what they're doing. They also want to abolish the suburbs by allowing far left Washington bureaucrats to force the construction of low income housing projects in every neighborhood in America that's what they want to do this is their goal and we're going to let you preserve your American dream in the suburbs Ok we ended the progress bar we ended the program the voters of Wisconsin are very very spectacular people we are going to take care of you at every level we're going to fight for you we're going to fight for every single aspect that you have going we are never going to forget you you didn't forget me in the last election so I want to thank our auto. Thank you everybody thank you I want to thank you very much it's great. So we a shoot a regulation and you know we ended that regulation because when we talk about suburbs and we talk about other things we have taken care of about 84 percent of Obama  regulations executive orders. You know it's amazing we knocked out a big portion of what he did including the wonderful mandate right the individual mandate in Obamacare which totally by the way by far the worst of all of Obamacare we didn't get out the centrally that ended Obamacare and then you say so we knocked out 84 percent of what he did they say he was. Wonderful president why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out and the very popular way not doubt 84 percent the voters of Wisconsin face a simple joys. If you want to be ruled by the radical left or do you want as then tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way. Was you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden And his boss Harris come on. And is not the boss then see Pelosi she's a beauty And is ruler Bernie Sanders crazy. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world which we did we're going to have to do it again we're going to have to do it again and we're in the process of doing. We've built the greatest economy on Earth and that we're doing it again you look at all the numbers we're going to go over and you wanted to fund and defame and dismantle the police I don't think so. You want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement Yes right the laws . You want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing it's called Ted so cold your. Right hand still culture or do you want to defend our history our heroes our faith our values and our treasured American way of life which is what we have laws right thank God I don't believe the lies you're going to hear on tape most is going to be that I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is I think I'll take mine. How do you why. It's a taped they talk about a convention how do you watch a tape speech I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can today but I saw them asking him questions today it was a news conference and you read him of a teleprompter I don't get it I don't get it something going on up there. We can afford it you know I can tell you this look from doing this now we've got the greatest economy in the world we rebuilt our military we gave you the greatest tax cuts for the greatest regulations. We became energy independent we've done things that nobody thought possible right nobody thought possible we've done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state list the greatest here last and when you look at the numbers you're going to have an even greater year next year unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes in which case it's called the depression folks it's called a depression it's not going to happen because we're going to win . The war . Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism he is he's a Trojan horse he has no clue but the people around him a tough and they're smart but we disagree with them very very strongly there mean and they're angry like her by the way nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kemal right she was worse than Pocahontas she was worse than anybody and say nobody treated him worse or with I mean less respect she had no respect all of a sudden she's now saying is the wonderful she didn't feel that way a little while ago let's talk about her for a 2nd she left in shame she started her 14 she left to do she went in the wrong direction so if that's if a poll is any any indication that's what we want speak it a Polls fake do c.n.n. they probably have their camera going thank you very. Much No no no we have to frankly their poster is much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right Vox postered I don't know who he is but he hasn't had a clue for about 7 years let me just let me just tell you that c.n.n. gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we won up and now they call it margin of error don't believe it we're way beyond the margin of error I don't lawyer. I just got back from Texas. And Florida. And Ohio we were all over the place we were we went to great states and every road way highway we had thousands tens of thousands I would say at least on each 100000 people from the plane because you know that's why this isn't a rally this is again friendly protest we were not allowed to do rallies right because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to but from the plane to an oil well from the plane to getting law enforcement all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement right laws. And in Ohio we went to a plant whirlpool there were at a business there were going out of business and now they're thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it and I said you want to do that we're putting a massive tariff and all of a sudden whirlpool and thousands of people there work at Ohio and other places it became  a really terrific company again and we went there but if you look if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016. And I hate to say it and I don't want to be rude because I would never be rude but let me just tell you. Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don't win without enthusiasm like people aren't saying we got to get him and the only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda that's the only reason that's the only thing is going and nobody wins when you're not on the side of enthusiasm so we have more than we ever had in 2016 and in 2016 nobody has ever see the campaign with that kind of enthusiasm and we have much for our Earth at the socialist will not stop until they've ransacked America and laid waste to our cities your eyes don't lie look at Portland it's been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it we save the courthouse you believe it we had to send in homeland security they were great they easily saved it after was pounded Portland was supposed to be watching it but they weren't so we said to men and we will send in the National Guard just like we did in Minnesota you saw what happened there Minneapolis the National Guard went in within 15 minutes all thing was over they should have called them in a week earlier . Oh thank my beautiful beautiful 5th Avenue in New York has been looted and pillaged it was allowed to happen by an incompetent mare that doesn't have a clue look at what's happened to our dime in New York was a diamond for the country look how far it's gone down in Chicago the mayor literally raised up the drawbridge is to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city can you believe it can you believe 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week a little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died that's worse than Afghanistan which we're getting out of that's worse than Iraq which were almost out of that's worse than Syria which were out of step we kept the oil but that's Ok we have to talk about. God thank God this is the future the Joe Biden plans to bring to every city town and suburb in the nation and you know for those suburbs I keep hearing about suburban women made me. Was Well you know in one speech recently I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it but what I got they censor I don't know if that's politically correct I said don't worry about it they'll get over it right but we say. We save the suburbs the suburbs and you know what I'm talking about and they said about the rule it's a rule very strong it's like a law they said sir we can amend it I said I don't want it amended No we can really amended bring it down no I don't want to I wanted terminated and we terminated it it's gone way and it will be reinstituted if Joe Biden comes and not by him because he has no idea what the law says or what it means but by the people that will be running our country it will not be him it will not be him running our country they will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn't mind no one will be safe it is a Biden run America but was president the United States will use every tool and we've done it by the way our country is doing great we have the pandemic sure the never been allowed to the never been allowed to happen by Johnny not to the never been allowed to happen. They released it they didn't release it in China but it came to the United States and Europe $188.00 all over the world $188.00 countries all over the world we're not going to forget it we're not going to forget it but we're doing great coming back we're coming back in our numbers are better than almost all countries I will tell us the spite what you hear look at all of them up there thanks got to look at all of that fake news and some believe that. Unfortunately Fox has become vagueness to I don't know what happens to these people right you agree. At least the other side you know where they're coming from but I'll use every tool of my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars and that's where the our work you know when they were ripping down the statues are great statues they were ripping him down I passed and signed something that's beautiful it says 10 years in prison if you're knocked out is that you know what how far what I have been Scott I don't see it anymore now they go up they look at a statue and they say. 10 years and a long time they say let's get out of here but did you notice that 3 months ago I signed it they were going to have thousands of people March on Washington to rip down statues and these people are sick they're anarchists they were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson George Washington Abraham Lincoln he was fair game Abraham Lincoln so I said these people are sick they are troubled individuals they're an ark is an agitator is there not just protest as they call him peaceful protest is your peaceful protest is on the record you're peaceful broke the law and by the way you're a lot like the sky over here look at the size of that guy you're a lot tougher than they are just so you understand that oh right. There are signs that act Thank you.

Obama and Biden didn't want to give it they didn't want to give it they thought it looked too militaristic meaning it was a lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe and I distributed it all of the hundreds of millions of dollars it was sitting there drawing dust in warehouses that we would probably pay a fortune for all over the country and you got it we all got it everybody got it and everybody's happy God bless as president and as your president I will always stand with law enforcement and that's something that I can't even imagine anybody saying anything differently but this other side does they say it differently I mean nobody can even understand that this November the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob and that's what would happen by a law and in $78.00 days we're going to stop the radical left we're going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win 4 more years was.

Enders does a great job thank you I think we are looking great here you know we wanted last time and you remember what a big shock wave because a Republican had wanted for a long time and they were waiting for Pennsylvania and we won Pennsylvania it we had lost every vote would've won but they didn't want to call it it got later and later or later than Wisconsin came in and then Michigan came in and then Pennsylvania came in by that time we already had North Carolina. You know it's hard for Republicans you have to run. The whole board because they start off that we're going to play for New York with all of the crime in New York I'm going to play for New York because we did well in New York. Thank you did well in New York but we're going to play for New York and we're going to play I don't know yes we'll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California they like b.. And we'll do a tiny little shot in Illinois the other one we're going to do we're going to go after New Jersey we're going to go after Virginia we have a crazy governor of Virginia he doesn't want you to have guns and he doesn't mind not only abortion he doesn't mind execution because after birth we'll decide what to do with the baby right now no f. did you hear this guy 1st time I heard of it Scott after birth we will decide and we will discuss with the mother and that's the 1st time I've heard of it this is the guy that likes to pretend these Michael Jackson right with the dead say his wife saved him great embarrassment we have another great friend of mine a great great politician but really he's much more than a politician he's an exceptional human being he is tough I had to go against him in those presidential primaries and I want to tell you this nobody tougher but he basically loves this state mean he loves this state and he should be your governor right now was should. Was cut the thank you he's an exceptional man Scott Walker Governor Scott Rod was Thal tell you one thing he's one of the most respected men he goes into Washington everybody stands up and they really do respect him a lot and it's really something the next time you run please don't put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you're running you brought out like a 1000000 people that nobody ever knew coming out. Because there was no way but you can do whatever you want you know that you going to be successful what whatever you want to do thank you very much God forbid was so before the virus came in from China thank you unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded. Now as part of Scott's they do I have to give him a little credit there right I have to do that but we created $15000.00 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs everybody said that would be impossible 121000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good job Thad we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it and China was having the worst year they had in 67 years not that I want that but we took in billions of dollars we had nobody ever charged China for doing anything what the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen and that includes sleepy Joe was part of that thank God But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up by took the greatest economy and I'd close that up and we saved millions of lives as many lives should have been won but what you see today you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20 it would have been a horrible it would not have been sustainable and now where bringing it back it will bring it back so strongly. Thank you I took unprecedented action to save the us economy and support Wisconsin families under our paycheck protection program we helped save 0. For $1000000.00 Wisconsin jobs earlier this month I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100000.00 per year Thad this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers that is something that people really out today the great economists that's what they want the payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies number when they open their business is great for them but really great for you and it's a big savings it's a lot of money in your pocket if Republicans win in November we will forgive these payments in full thank God the word Thanks to my administration's policies we're now witnessing the fastest you cut and you've seen this right the fastest economic recovery in the history of our country over the past 3 months we have already gained much more than 9000000 jobs nationwide that's a record that's not even close by the way. And you know you heard about the v. the v the famous 3 and there's a well maybe not a me it's got to be a damn it's got to be it has it's got to be they have no doubt it's turned out to be a super of the because the numbers are much better when you see the numbers coming retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high and auto production has surged 28 percent of the worth and it leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions we have televisions and closets I was saying to another group we have televisions on floors and ceilings we have tele you can't escape but if you want to get away from Trump you can't be on that plane because. The fake news and drop you know they're going to go out of business when I do leave it let's say 60. 20 years something like when we live. When we leave they're all out of business. I wouldn't say that sleepy Joe would be very excited to come right don't think a lot of let's turn on the Biden say today darling. But you know I just noticed on television that Nat stag that's a big deal now as dad hit an all time record today the highest was the highest price ever thank the others are right behind it I mean who would think we have a pandemic I think we're way on the other side of the pandemic we're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else but regardless we're doing great with it but who would think that we had a record with that stack and the others are right there if you would have said we're at $28000.00 on the Dow We're just about and if you would have said Nasdaq hit a new record high that's great for your for a one k's look you get the wrong person and here you go for a one K.'s wave goodbye to a They'll be worthless they'll be worth right for a one k's that's one of the things a lot of people are bragging you know about 4 months ago they were very depressed I said don't sell don't sell Don't worry about the sell forget about this and most people held and they're very very good but husbands come up to me and wives come up to me and one wife was saying sir I always thought my husband was a financial loser a total loser he was his big good looking policeman actually. And she said you know you've never been good with money but over the years over the last few years I think it was up 89 percent I said that's not as good as most people he said No no my husband is a financial genius and there's good looking policemen said Thank you sir because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested but. Thank. You for a one K.'s a grade and your stocks a great. You know when you see these big companies going up that's everybody that's everybody the stock market that's everybody that's just an indication and they're smart people they know where it's going you know they have it it's think that's better than most people and they see what's happening now with all of that we have a headwind and the headwind is a for any reason we didn't win that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water I hate to tell you folks so good look at it we didn't have if we didn't have that headwind your stocks would be even higher right now even higher so on election night expect your 401 K.'s and your stocks to go very very high and I do believe we're going to have a tremendous and. I do believe Thanks again the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one the most enthusiasm so we've got to get out and vote got to be careful with your balance be careful be careful here absentee ballots great you're others you've got to be very careful or go to vote just go to vote you know. Go to her. We have a little problem here you have a Democrat governor who is will do anything that they think could turn things around. How is Tom Tiffani doing by the way another when we just had a nice win right is Tom Tom is around here someplace Tom Tiffany just got a great win well winning a lot we've won a lot of House seats we're going to definitely we're going to take back the house the door and say thank you our thanks as part of our great rebuilding the u.s. military we also signed a 5500000000 dollar contract to build combat ships in Marin that Wisconsin supporting thousands of jobs for us thank God thank God. Ah thank. Her or her. Dad or. We've totally rebuilt our military we've spent $2.00 trillion dollars all made in the USA all made in the us. We have new fighter jets we have new rockets we've upgraded our nuclear I hope to God we never have to use it but nobody's even close it was getting very tired getting very tired what we've done with our military is incredible with tanks speaking of tanks we left our great tank I was supposed to close down we have a tank factory in the Lima Lima Ohio and it was scheduled to close and I went to see it I said No way would closing it because there's no way we could ever reproduce. That incredible and and you know it happened we didn't close it and we are building tanks like you wouldn't believe but what we've done with our military has been incredible and Biden has promised to slash our defense budget destroying critical jobs but more importantly if we don't have defense everything we talk about is meaningless we have to have the feds defense of our country especially when you look at what's happening outside of our borders so we have the greatest right now when I took it over was totally depleted it was God right now we have the greatest military we've ever had the greatest equipment by far we've ever had. The data was Thank You have come out and Biden are ever elected this recovery will come to a total shut down to use that word permanently for no scientific reason Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy locking everyone in their homes you. Look at what's happening with some of you got a dose of it right here I hate to say with some of these Democrat governors they just don't want to open it up by the way on November 4th they'll announce what we have decided to open November for. Got to get out to those polls I'm serious this is the most dangerous election we've ever had the most dangerous because I don't think we can ever bring it back if they get in I don't think there's anything called a comeback it will be another event as well I used to say that lightly I now say it very strongly because it's a similar ideology this will be a large scale very large scale Venezuela if they win. We're going to weigh my administration by contrast is following the science applying common sense mitigation sheltering bird you know this we've got a shelter we've got to take care but what do we really have to do we have to take care of our elderly people our elderly people with heart problems with diabetes and we'll launch an operation warp speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine therapeutics more than 270 therapies are in clinical trials can you believe it 270 and you're going to be here is a very good news very very soon now you know we're dealing with a deep say right so I'm watching it very closely I don't need to have them announce on November 4th ladies and gentlemen we've found a vaccine that's perfect I don't need that I don't need that and hopefully everyone's looking to do the right thing we want to get it out quickly but we're very close both on therapy and on therapeutics add on vaccines. Advances in treatment. Have reduced the fate Tallinn the rate in adults by 85 percent since April think of that they get heard. 3 vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we're mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we're going to have it out very quickly we will defeat the China virus we will have the greatest economy that we've ever had next year unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they're talking about we will have next year the single greatest economy we've ever had laws are also Biden has been there for 47 year and he's personally supported every blow bill a sellout of the last half century he voted for NAFTA one of the worst trade deals in history for the China entry into the World Trade Organization a total catastrophe for Korea the Korean deal was horrible we renegotiated it now it's a really great deal for us one in 4 u.s. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business it would have been a disaster for our country I ended it but I approved the Dakota access pipeline immediately the Keystone pipeline 48000 thank you one of the great rip offs that was done in my opinion to hurt our country because we have so much energy we're now energy independent was I got out of this horrible power a slime an accord which was a ripoff for NACA Law Thank God it would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity and they don't even enter the agreement until 2030 so we it would have been a disaster so many things are stacked against us even in the World Trade Organization China. Is considered a developing nation therefore they get tremendous guess what we don't except that we've had 4 of them we don't accept it and we're not it and we're not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends. Are thanks so time and again thanks sleepy Joe Biden put China 1st in American last even to a point where a son who had absolutely wears hunta Has anyone seen one he's had absolutely no experience walked away with one and a half $1000000000.00 to manage as millions of dollars a year and if you go to the pros of Wall Street they'll tell you it's an impossibility it was a 10 minute meeting he walked away with one and a half 1000000000 from China how do you think he's going to do negotiating by against China Ok nobody's done what I've done the Jaina to Russia a by the way remember we're going to be a war in a war with North Korea what happened to the war we're going to go along Kim Jong un we get along let's see what happens and meantime it's almost 4 years right remember we were going to be in a war Thank you look at a look at all those people back that's a lot of people Thad's a lot of wealth and look at all the fake dues is that incredible round. There a lot of it's a lot of fake news back there's got. At the end of Joe Biden's 8 years as vice president nearly 2000000 Americans a prime worky day job dropped out of the workforce our factories were stolen our country was doing wow z. he lost nearly 200000 manufacturing jobs he was by the way a disaster on swine flu he got a horrible rating in Gallup look at the Gallup Poll look at the Gallup poll so they call it. H one n one right here remember h one swine flu h one n one he calls it and one h one but I don't hold them in that. And that's one of the the bigger mistakes is when he says these are the different say when you speak in great to be in a great state of Ohio but don't know no we're not in Ohio. You know what you do it's you know it's you know it you do when that happens you just walk off because there's nothing you can do it or a guy happened to him like $16.00 times almost every time that's why he doesn't talk. He shot he shot we got to say look one thing I've learned. Putin's president she of China right Kim Jong Il heir to one of Turkey they are world class chess players we can have a guy who shot and it is best years wasn't very good he was a very good week and how are these guys a world class Test player thank God they're all dreaming thank their all dreaming of Joe Biden out is dreaming about it is Iran if we win and when we when we are going to have a deal with the Rana mediately they're just waiting hoping that Biden gets in hoping John Kerry is saying oh you should he by the way if anybody violated the Logan Act It was John Kerry right John Kerry not General Flynn and John Kerry. Of course of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4800.00 and nearly $11000000.00 more Americans were influenced him so Biden's abysmal record but you do have to check the swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster this monster is the worst thing that's happened in this world since 1917 right where it could have been a 100000000 people died swine flu though look at his ratings in Gallup check them out they gave them really bad ratings Joe Biden not that that matters but that does matter right you know when a guy is critical and we've done an incredible job including among the best numbers in the world Joe Biden's abysmal record of failure betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office we got up people back working we made real deals with foreign countries Oh thank you I told Japan I told Japan Thank you Prime Minister Abi great guy but I said Prime Minister you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other countries and other other areas of our country it's not fair we have a big deficit go to Wisconsin go to Ohio go to these places he said he's going to do it many many Japanese plants now are being built all over a country somebody had asked him to do it somebody had to tell them to do it it's not fair and it was all happening then it came and now it's going out watch what's going to happen watch how good the 3rd quarter is the 3rd quarter is coming up right before the election watch how good Scott Walker what even you will be impressed by those numbers. Even sky Oh Ok but we passed massive tax cuts we passed massive regulation cuts and you know want to you might not feel this may be the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn't just the tax cuts it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn't get approved for 15 years and 20 years right or a big deal thanks we'll replace probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new US MCA which puts us right at the top and now Canada and Mexico are doing what's right for our country. Yes but a great deal thank you and when they were his constant temperature and does 3 was being threatened by administration took immediate action we impose tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products saving countless timber jobs all across your state and you know exactly what I'm talking about you were taken advantage of by stupid US policy Canada was taking. Digit of this country not anymore thank God thank you if Biden and the crew get in the Radical Left will bring timber production to a total halt I stood up to China's decades of trading abuses and when China targeted our farmers we provided $28000000000.00 in relief we gave our farmers I said to Secretary producer of Agriculture Sunny how much they've targeted our farmers How much have they been targeted for server 2 years ago is 12000000000 last year was $1628000000000.00 Dodo I said guess what we're charging tariffs of $28000000000.00 to John and. We charge so much more and we gave 12000000000 in 1628 we gave 28 the farmers in here and the farmers did I do a good job for you please. I don't hear any farmers complain back and I have every right we did a good job with a more typical president I want to be nice more typical every farmer would be out of business right now but we gave 28000000000 to the farmers think of that and the farmers are doing well and then we signed a deal with China and I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi we signed a great deal and the Under the deal they would buy $240000000000.50 of farm product and then manufacturing once the China flew came in once a china stuff came in I was not really I was and I couldn't it was different but I have to tell you. 4 days ago the court order right was the largest corner order in the history. Of ordering. It was the biggest China ordered 2 days the biggest order in the history of corn then they did if you look at soybeans it was the largest soybean order in history in history and also beef cattle etc So it just shows you how smart China is we signed a deal and the plague comes in it might have been a mistake it might have been on purpose who knows what happened we'll figure it out but whatever it was it was no good they could have stopped it but they know my attitude I don't like it I don't like it so a normal country that's not so smart in that position Scott what is said oh we don't like the way he's talking about us let's immediately shut down he didn't do that they said let's order more from the farmers that we've ordered biggest corn biggest soybean biggest cattle and now I'm getting my farmers and server. We saw in the like China I said you know what we've got to be very careful you understand that so what they've done is they've gone out they've made massive orders so I think how smart that is 99 percent of people in that position would say well we're not going to order any more they say let's order so much that they become almost reliant on us very smart very very smart America's spent nearly 4 years planing up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden's 47 year worth of disaster you know it's incredible he's in there for 47 years he does nothing now all of a sudden he's going to do all these things he's going to get tough on China sure China will own the United States if we don't make this deal and we were going up if we don't get elected China will own that mark my word well I hope you're not going to be able to test it out Ok China well China will own the United States Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama they got 150000000000 dollars 1800000000 in cash green cash for nothing we got nothing out of that deal and I terminated that deal I terminated  and we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That's been the evangelical Thank you know it's amazing with. The evangelicals some are excited about that then Jewish people it's early right it's incredible but we did we did that and Golan Heights don't forget Golan Heights we did go a lot of time so we've done a lot in February Biden said if you elect me your taxes are going to be raised they're not going to be cut that's a quote How the hell do you do this. That well it's. Only in the state can we get away with. But you have to be right Ok you happened to be right. So I just want to say this this has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you I've been here a lot we won this state we weren't expected to win the state or the author was the Word of God Ah we've been great for each other we've been great for each other it's really you know it's a partnership in a sense but we've been great for each other we brought a lot of business to the state we're bringing a lot more business to the state whether it's the ships or to the crops or any one of the so many different things especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico because because of Wisconsin and us specialize milk a small subject but the right farmers got me at the right time of this sort Wow you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287 percent tariff I bet I think you mostly know about that but unless you're up here a lot like I was you'd never find that out and I work with Scott and I work with others or we solved all of these problems we solved all of them Scott right. This is the most important election we ever had we've got to stop these radical left maniacs we've got to win this election law with. God. God or God or God or. We have many things to do we want to finish it up it's no different you plant a tree it takes a little time to grab on in addition we have other things we're going to do more regulation cutting even more tax cutting we're going to be doing very substantial. Tax cuts because that's an incentive toward growth and we're going to do it and we proved to be right we proved to be 100 percent right we're not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we've done so I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin God lawyer was who really are your only or your estate that despite everything everything that they were saying Well Wisconsin can't be won was going to guess what and I think we're much way far ahead I do believe we're way far ahead where we were if you look back 4 years I think we have much more spirit you see this is easier in a sense now the virus made it a little bit more difficult maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden something happened that nobody ever even thought about but we handled it we handled it and we handled it well and we're now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things but the easier part is I used to come up as a businessman I was very successful and I'd say we're going to do this we're going to do tax cuts we're going to even Space Force I never even talked about space but we did more. Somebody said we actually did more than we promise that's never happened with a politician before right we did actually more but I never talked about Space Force and then I got to doff as I said we need that because you look at what China is doing what Russia is doing what others are looking at so we have space for us 1st time in 78 years since the Air Force that that's happened full scale so it's great but and you're a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election we can't play games get out and vote do those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted make sure because the only way we're going to lose a select. Is if the election is rigged to remember that the only way we're going to lose this election so we have to be very careful look we have this is more than this election that's a big statement the only way they're going to win is that way and we can't let that happen and you know our postoffice we're going to make our Post Office great it's been a disaster for many years we're going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we're going to make it great right now it's a laughing stock Amazon and these companies come in they dop they drop all of their packages into the post office and the post office loses. Trillion me just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages let them deliver to let them pay the right prize you know so that said But we're going to make our post office strong we're going to make our postoffice really strong and really great we're going to be proud of it again it lost $78000000000.00 in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years 78000000000 dollars We want to make our postoffice strong we want to be proud of it I want to thank you very much you've been my friends my true friends we will win and we will make America great again thank you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474841-1/president-trump-remarks-oshkosh-wisconsin	President Trump delivered remarks to a crowd in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he spoke about jobs and the economy, his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, recent protests across the nation and the 2020 presidential election campaign.

FOUR MORE YEARS. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] I CHOSE TO COME UP HERE AND SPEAK IN SPANISH BECAUSE I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE THROWING AROUND THE RACE CARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] I'M SICK AND TIRED OF LATINOS NOT HEARING THE TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT THAT HIS FIRST PRIORITIES ARE HIS COUNTRY? THE ANSWER SHOULD ALWAYS BE YES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT A BOUT RACE. DANCE OR IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DULY ONE OF RESIDENT THAT WANTS TO SECURE OUR NATION'S BORDERS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE OR DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT THAT WANTS TO ALLOW DESTRUCTION OF OUR LIVES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? AGAIN I WILL REPEAT IT IS NOT ABOUT RACE. STOP USING THE RACE CARD AND START USING THE TRUMP CARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS AMERICA, GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP, GOD BLESS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU GUYS HERE TODAY AND GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE OUT THERE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERYDAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] C HE STOLE MY THUNDER EARLIER BUT I WAS GOING TO TRANSLATE THAT FOR YOU BROKE WITH IT WHAT HE SAID WAS FOUR MORE YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED TO KNOW. THERE HAS BEEN A PLACE THAT I'D RATHER BE THAN LOOKING FORWARD. I CAN'T WAIT TO BE AT THE VICTORY CELEBRATION BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO DEFEAT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] HE IS GOING TO DEFEAT THE DEMOCRAT ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE SECOND TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF MY LIFETIME. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE A GREAT MANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN COULD I TAKE , LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA CONTROL OF U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW WILL BE CEDED TO MULTINATIONAL CRIMINAL CARTEL. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA WOMEN AND CHILDREN WILL PUT THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS WHO ABUSE AND AT TIMES MURDER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA ORGANIZED CRIME WILL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY WHILE AN INNOCENT LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS SUFFER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA U.S. BORDERS WILL BE NOTHING BUT A MASK. CHAOS WILL REIGN ON OUR BORDERS. INTEL JOE BIDEN LEFT OFFICE AS VICE PRESIDENT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTED A POLICY IN WHICH BORDER PATROL AGENTS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY INTO CUSTODY AND LESS THEY WERE HERE FOR A YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY PROOF. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS TELL ORDER PATROL AGENTS THAT THEY WERE HERE FOR ONE YEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP , I'M SORRY. LAWLESSNESS ON THE BORDER CRIMINAL CARTELS WEREN'T RIDGED. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT PORTLAND OREGON, SEATTLE WASHINGTON, CHICAGO ILLINOIS AND NEW YORK CITY TO SEE THE LAWLESSNESS THAT WILL HAPPEN IF JOE BIDEN'S POLICIES ARE ALLOWED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE POLAR OPPOSITE HAS DONE EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER AND CONTINUES TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY SAFE BECAUSE HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND HE LOVES THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONCE BUT TWICE CUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE TARGETED THE CARTEL AT THEIR SOURCE AND WENT AFTER THE DRUGS THAT DIRECTLY COME INTO THE UNITED STATES AND KILL OUR YOUTH AND ADULTS ALIKE. HE HAS DONE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE US SAFE. IN THE EARLY PART OF 2016 AND ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNSEL I ENDORSE PRESIDENT TRUMP A POTENTIAL ALONE. TODAY I AM HERE ENDORSING PRESIDENT TRUMP ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL, THE TRUE BORDER SECURITY EXPERTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL ANYMORE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I CAN'T LIST ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD BUT I WILL LIST TWO THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THESE MEN AND WOMEN RIGHT HERE. HE HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. HE HAS ALSO BUILT THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN MY LIFETIME, AND ECONOMY, AN ECONOMY THAT SERVES US ALL AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SERVES OUR CHILDREN. I HAVE COME TO NOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY AND FROM EXPERIENCE I KNOW HOW MUCH HE CARES ABOUT ALL OF YOU. I KNOW HE DOES WHAT HE DOES FOR THE LOVE OF COUNTRY. IN 47 YEARS AS A GROOMED POLITICIAN JOE BIDEN HAS NOTHING BUT RHETORIC. IN THREE AND A HALF SHORT YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED THEM. [APPLAUSE] I AM CONFIDENT IN MY FELLOW CITIZENS ON NOVEMBER 3 WHEN WE ARE ALL SITTING IN THAT AL AT TALKS WITH ALL OF THE NOISE IS BEHIND US, WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL ELECT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO PUT AMERICA FIRST. THAT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I'D LIKE TO KNOW OF HIM TO THE STAGE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.

IN THE BIDEN MANIFESTO, JOE BIDEN PROMISES TO RESTORE AND DISBAND THE CATCH AND RELEASE ACROSS THE U.S. BORDER. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. WE JUST GOT RID OF IT . FREE ALL OF THE ILLEGAL ALIENS AND THROW DETENTION FACILITIES. THIS WOULD MAKE REMOVING ILLEGAL ALIENS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE . AND YOU WOULD HAVE MURDERERS, KILLERS, RAPISTS, IN YOUR MIDST . I DON'T THINK SO. IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND ALL REMOVAL TRIGGERING A TIDAL WAVE OF A FLOOD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. ALL ACROSS OUR BORDER. AND PROSECUTION OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING ENSURING THAT ILLEGAL ALIENS WILL REPEATEDLY REENTER THE COUNTRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND TERMINATE PROTECTIONS WE HAVE ENACTED AGAINST ASYLUM FRAUD.

THEY FIRE PEOPLE, REPLACE THEM WITH MEXICANS, ILLEGALS, AND THEN THEY TURN RIGHT AROUND AND TELL US HOW WE LIKE IT. KAMALA HARRIS, I'M DISAPPOINTED IN HER. SHE SAID JOE BIDEN WAS A RACIST.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE, BUT THAT'S AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE ALL THE WAY BACK , HOW DID YOU GET IN? THAT'S MY QUESTION. I KNOW YOU ARE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF A GROUP THAT HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD JOB AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. PENNSYLVANIA HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I WENT TO SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA, COLLEGE, AND I LOVE IT. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. BY THE TIME I FINISHED, I'M GOING TO HAVE A NICE SUNBURNT RIGHT HERE. WHERE'S MY SUNBLOCK? I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. AND 75 DAYS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS STATE, WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS. THEY'VE HAD US UNDER SIEGE AND WE BEAT THEM AND WE BEAT THEM AND WE KEEP EATING THEM, BUT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING , NO PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH. NO PRESIDENT. IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN. I WATCHED PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT AND I WATCHED HIM TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING AND I HAD TO PUT IT OUT I SAID BUT HE SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN AND HE GOT CAUGHT. THAT'S ABOUT THAT , ABOUT AS BAD A THING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. IF THAT HAPPENS TO ANOTHER CAMPAIGN ON THE OTHERS, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD 25 PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR MANY YEARS, ALREADY. IT'S A DISGRACE. BUT, IN THREE YEARS AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN JUST A SHORT TIME, THERE'S BEEN NO ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND THAT'S DESPITE PANDEMICS, DESPITE ALL THE OPPOSITION AND THE WITCHHUNTS, THE PHONY WITCHHUNTS, NO ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE SECURED OUR BORDERS, BROUGHT BACK OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS, REBUILT OUR MILITARY, WHITE OUT THE ISIS CALIPHATE 100%, KILLED OUR TERRORIST ENEMIES, ACHIEVED AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND GUESS WHAT? WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. THAT'S A SMALL PART OF IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION , AND YOU KNOW THIS , YOU KNOW IT, AND I MEAN IT AND I'VE NEVER MEANT IT MORE, AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH CRAZY PEOPLE ON THE OTHERS. THEY'VE GONE TOTALLY STONE COLD CRAZY. YOU LOOK AT HILLARY, SHE WAS A LOT SMARTER THAN JOE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS A CERTAIN SENSE OF SANITY FOUR YEARS AGO. THESE PEOPLE HAVE GONE INSANE AND THEY ARE RADICAL LEFT AND YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS HAPPENING AT THESE DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES THAT WE CAN SOLVE IN TWO MINUTES. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL US, OUR GREAT EX CONGRESSMAN, AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL US. WE WILL BE IN THERE IN TWO MINUTES AND WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. JOE BIDEN IS A PUPPET OF THE RADICAL LEFT MOVEMENT THAT SEEKS TO DESTROY THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND PROBABLY WHEN IT HAPPENED, THEY SAY WHAT WE EVER DO? JOE BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO HIKE YOUR TAXES BY $4 TRILLION IN THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN HISTORY AND THEY ARE GOING TO WASTE THE MONEY ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THAT? NOTHING. NOTHING EXCEPT DEBT AND DEATH. THEY WANT TO EVISCERATE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. YOU REMEMBER THAT. JUST THAT ONE POINT ALONE, THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. WHO'S GOING TO VOTE FOR THAT? I HAVE HELD THAT STRONG AND YOU THINK IT WAS EASY? I HAVE HELD IT TOTALLY STRONG. GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. YOU DON'T GET FREE HEALTH CARE. EXPAND DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, FORCE TAX PAYERS TO SUBSIDIZE LATE TERM ABORTIONS, SHUT DOWN THE ENERGY FIELDS OF PENNSYLVANIA. THEY WANT TO SHUT THEM DOWN. NO FOSSIL FUELS. TEXAS ISN'T TOO HAPPY EITHER. GO TO TEXAS. I JUST LEFT TEXAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO. I SAID THEY DON'T WANT ENERGY, THEY DON'T WANT GUNS AND THEY DON'T WANT RELIGION. NOT GOING TO WIN TEXAS. BUT YOU HAVE THE SAME THING BECAUSE YOU ARE A BIG FRACKING STATE. YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR TAXES GO UP, STOP FRACKING. IT DOESN'T HURT YOU AT ALL, FRACKING. THEY WANT TO THROW UP WINDMILLS THAT ARE GOING TO RUIN YOUR HOUSES. PUT UP A BIG MILL. YOU SEE THIS BIG MONSTER TURNING, BUT EVEN THAT, I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING. I THINK THEY WANT TO CLOSURE BUSINESS. JUST HER MEMBER, SECOND AMENDMENT, SURE AS YOU ARE SITTING OR STANDING, THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. CLOSE DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS, LIMIT SCHOOL CHOICE, SO IMPORTANT, ABOLISH THE SUBURBS, THEY WANT TO PUT LOW INCOME HOUSING IN THE SUBURBS, SO THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE A LOT OF MINORITY GROUPS THAT LIVE IN THE SUBURBS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, ALL DID PHENOMENALLY LAST YEAR WITH JOBS, BEST JOBS WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BEST ECONOMY WE'VE EVER HAD. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE A BIG PART OF THE SUBURBS AND THEY WANT TO PUT LOW INCOME HOUSING IN THE SUBURBS AT A LEVEL THEY HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 20 YEARS. I TERMINATED THE REGULATION THAT DID THAT AND THEY SAID WE CAN CHANGE THAT AND I SAID LET'S TERMINATE IT. PEOPLE HAVE TO ASPIRE TO GO THERE. THEY WANT TO ASPIRE TO LIVE IN THE SUBURBS. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH CASH BAIL, RELEASING 400,000 CRIMINALS ONTO OUR STREETS. THINK OF IT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. CUOMO ENDED CLASS , ENDED CASH BAIL. IT WASN'T EVEN DE BLASIO, IT WAS CUOMO. HE ENDED IT IN NEW YORK AND NOW THE CRIME RATE HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. THE SPEAKER AT BIDENS CONVENTION PROBABLY A CLAIRE , DECLARED WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ABOLISHING THE POLICE COME ABOLISHING ICE, THEY ARE ABOUT ABOLISHING PRISONS, AND THE ONLY THING THEY ARE NOT ABOLISHING OUR TAXES BECAUSE YOUR TAXES ARE GOING TO GO UP AT A LEVEL YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE. IF YOU WANT A VISION OF YOUR LIFE UNDER BIDEN'S PRESIDENCY, THINK OF THE SMOLDERING RUINS IN MINNEAPOLIS, THOUGH VIOLENT ANARCHY OF PORTLAND, THE BLOODSTAINED SIDEWALKS OF CHICAGO AND IMAGINE THE MAYHEM COMING TO YOUR TOWN AND EVERY SINGLE TOWN IN AMERICA. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT BECAUSE HE WILL PUT IT IN HIS SPEECH, WHICH , IF HE CAN READ IT, WHICH I DOUBT. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO SPEAK LATER. HE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD AUDIENCE. I HEAR HE HASN'T ANSWERED A QUESTION , I JUST HEARD ON THE NEWSCAST SINCE JULY 17. HASN'T TAKEN A QUESTION FROM THE FAKE NEWS BACK THERE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I TAKE ABOUT A HUNDRED QUESTIONS A DAY. THESE PEOPLE. IT'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNED, THE PEOPLE HEADING THESE ON COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT IS PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, PRUDENT OF RUSSIA, ERDOGAN OF TURKEY, ANY OF THEM, KIM JONG-UN, NUMBER WE WERE GOING TO BE AT WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, REMEMBER THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAR, THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAR. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAR IF YOU HAD HILLARY CLINTON. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WAR IF OBAMA WERE ALLOWED TO STAY ANY LONGER. WHERE'S THE WAR? I DON'T SEE THE WAR. MAYBE THINGS HAPPEN, YOU DON'T KNOW, BUT THERE'S BEEN NO WAR, NOBODY KILLED. YOU WOULD HAVE LOST WHEN HE 5, 30 MILLION PEOPLE. THEY DON'T SAY THAT. THEY SAY 100,000 PEOPLE. SOUL HAS 32 MILLION PEOPLE AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE CANNON FIRE. WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. WHEN I SAY THAT, ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE, THEY SAY. IT'S NOT TERRIBLE, IT'S GREAT. I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WHEN I SAT DOWN THAT FIRST MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE, NORTH KOREA. HE WOULD HAVE HAD A BIG PROBLEM. WOULD HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A WAR. YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE IN THAT WAR RIGHT NOW. WHAT I SAY THAT WE GET ALONG AND WE HAVE MET AND THEY SAY THAT'S TERRIBLE, IT'S A GOOD AND, NOT A BAD THING, IT'S A GOOD INK. DOES IT , DOESN'T MEAN BAD THINGS DON'T HAPPEN, BUT IT'S A GOOD INK. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STANDING BETWEEN YOUR FAMILY AND THE RADICAL LEFT-WING MOB AND THAT IS YOUR VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. THIS IS , I FEEL LIKE I'M A WALL YOU KNOW WE BUILT THE WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 300 MILES TWO WEEKS FROM NOW, EVEN LESS, 300 MILES. BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE ALMOST 500 MILES AND SOME AREAS ARE A LITTLE BIT LOOSE, THEY PUT ABOUT 536 MILES GOING UP AT A RECORD CLIP, IT'S DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL. IF YOU WANT MOBS AND CRIMINALS, YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT, LOOK, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT LAW & ORDER. I'M BRINGING IT UP NOW, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY GET UP , I GOT JUST THE OTHER DAY ENDORSED BY ALL THE SHERIFFS OF FLORIDA, ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] I GOT ENDORSED BY PENNSYLVANIA, I GOT ENDORSED BY TEXAS, BY OHIO. I THINK EVERYBODY, I DON'T KNOW. HOW CAN LAW ENFORCEMENT INDOOR SOMEBODY ELSE , ENDORSE SOME AVAIL. ALL OF OUR EX ARMY EQUIPMENT, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS SURPLUS EQUIPMENT, AND IT WAS SITTING IN WAREHOUSES ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I DISTRIBUTED IT TO THE POLICE WHEREAS BIDEN AND OBAMA, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY SAID NO, NO, NO, IT MAKES THE POLICE LOOKED TOO STRONG. I WANT THE POLICE TO LOOK STRONG. YOU LOT , YOU HAVE TO LOOK STRONG. A LOT OF IT WAS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. IF YOU WANT JOBS AND A LOT OF POLICE AND A LACK OF CRIME, IF YOU TAKE AWAY NEW YORK AND CHICAGO AND SOME OF THESE TERRIBLE CITIES, THE CRIME , I LEFT NEW YORK FOUR YEARS AGO AND I CAN SEE BECAUSE HE'S A TERRIBLE MAYOR, THERE WERE THINGS , HE'S NO RUDY GIULIANI, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THE LAST SIX MONTHS, SEVEN MONTHS, IT HAS JUST EXPLODED, IT'S INCREDIBLE. CRIME UP 368%. 368%. IT'S CRAZY. IT'S CRAZY. IF YOU WANT LAW & ORDER, SOMETIMES THEY WILL SAY SIR, SAY IT GENTLY. PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT GENTLY. DON'T SAY LAW AND ORDER. SAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE LAW & ORDER AND SAFETY. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T DO THAT. IF YOU WANT LAW & ORDER, YOU CAN'T HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PORTLAND. DID YOU SEE THE KID GET WHACKED LIKE HE WAS A PIECE OF GARBAGE? WHO CAN TAKE IT? PRETTY SOON WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND IN OUR PEOPLE BECAUSE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL REQUESTS , I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE EMBARRASSED OR WHAT BUT THESE DEMOCRAT CITIES, THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL. THEY HAVE NONE. LOOK AT SEATTLE WHERE SHE SAID WE WANT A SUMMER OF LOVE , I MEAN, THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY. AND THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER TAKEN BACK SEATTLE EXCEPT THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING IN THE NEXT DAY. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY EVEN DID IT. SO, TONIGHT, WE HAVE SLOW JOE WILL SPEAK AT THE DEMOCRAT CONVENTION. AND I'M SURE HE WILL JUST KNOCK THEM DEAD. AND HE WILL REMIND US THAT HE WAS BORN IN SCRANTON. BUT YOU KNOW, HE LEFT LIKE 70 YEARS AGO, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] HE LEFT A LONG TIME AGO. I VIEW IT FIRMLY. HE WOULD SAY HE WAS BORN HERE AND HE LEFT WHEN HE WAS 8, 9, OR 10. SO HE LEFT 68 YEARS AGO, HE LEFT. A LONG TIME AGO. SO I VIEW IT DIFFERENT. HE WASN'T BORN HERE. HE ABANDONED SCRANTON. HIS FAMILY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT, HIS PARENTS, BUT HE LEFT SCRANTON. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT I WAS BORN IN SCRANTON, I LIVED IN SCRANTON, YEAH, FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT HE LEFT FOR ANOTHER STATE. YOU KNOW THE STATE. BUT THE SCRANTON STUFF, THAT'S WHY I FIGURED I WOULD COME HERE AND EXPLAIN TO YOU ONE THING, BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN I DO. HE ABANDONED PENNSYLVANIA, HE ABANDONED SCRANTON. HE WAS HERE FOR A SHORT TIME AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT AND TODAY, IT'S AMAZING , HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW IT? [APPLAUSE] HE SPENT THE LAST HALF-CENTURY IN WASHINGTON SELLING OUT OUR COUNTRY AND RIPPING OFF OUR JOBS AND LETTING OTHER COUNTRIES STEALING OUR JOBS, MEXICO, COUNTRY, ALL OF THEM, STEALING OUR JOBS, HE'S BEEN THERE FOR 47 YEARS AND NOW HE'S GOING TO COME AND MAKE A CHANGE, I DON'T THINK SO. HIS SON WALKED OUT WITH 1.5 MILLIONS , 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS TO MANAGE THAT SHE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A JOB BEFORE THAT AND I ASKED THE WALL STREET PEOPLE, TELL ME IS THAT POSSIBLE, SMARTEST PEOPLE, TAUGHT PEOPLE ON WALL STREET, THEY SAY CAN'T HAPPEN. THE SMARTEST PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE THAT DO GET MONEY FROM EVERY COUNTRY, FROM EVERYBODY, THEY SAY CAN'T HAPPEN. HE WALKED OUT OF THERE IN 10 MINUTES WITH 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS. EXPLAIN THAT ONE. THEN NOBODY LOOKS AT HIM, NOBODY LOOKS AT UKRAINE AND GETS 83,000 MONTH AND A $3 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT EXPERTISE IN ENERGY, BUT HE HAD NONE AND HE EVEN ADMITTED I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ENERGY, BUT HE GOES INTO AN ENERGY COMPANY, GETS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ESPECIALLY DOUBLE THAT BECAUSE HIM AND SOME GUY THAT KNEW LESS THAN HE DID, AND IS THAT OK, IS THAT OK WHEN JOE BIDEN GOES AND SAYS A BILLION DOLLARS, YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT UNLESS YOU GET RID OF THOSE PROSECUTORS? TALK ABOUT QUID PRO QUO, THAT IS YOUR QUID PRO QUO, AND THEY DID. QUID PRO QUO, RIGHT? AND THEY DID. THEY GOT RID OF THE PROSECUTORS AND THEN HE'S CALLED AND THEY SAY NOW YOU ARE GETTING YOUR MONEY, OK? THINK OF THIS , IF THAT'S A REPUBLICAN DOING THAT, WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT REPUBLICAN? IT'S OVER, IT'S A DISGRACE, BUT IT'S CHANGING SLOWLY, TO SLOWLY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. JOE BIDEN IS NO FRIEND OF PENNSYLVANIA. HE'S ACTUALLY, FOR THE REASONS HE JUST SAID, HE IS YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. BIDEN SUPPORTED EVERY SINGLE GLOBALIST ATTACK ON PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS. NAFTA, CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH BUILT CHINA INTO A POWER, PPP, KOREA, THE HORRIBLE, RIDICULOUS PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH STRIPPED OUR NATION OF ITS ENERGY AND THE SO-CALLED CLEAN POWER PLAN. THE ONLY THING ABOUT IT WAS THE NAME. IT WAS A HORRIBLE, UNFAIR DEAL. HORRIBLE FOR YOU, AND HORRIBLE FOR PENNSYLVANIA. THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR POWER AWAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR POWER IS? THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU MAKE GOING DEEP INTO THE EARTH AND TAKING OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE OUT, EVERYTHING YOU WANT FROM FRACKING. DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW BIG FRACKING IS? YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO FRACK ANYMORE. NO OIL. NO NOTHING. NO OIL, NO GAS, NO NOTHING. JUST INC. OF THAT. FIRST OF ALL, MANY OF YOU, I GUESS 600,000 LOSE THEIR JOBS. NO MONEY, NO OIL, HIGHER TAXES. YOUR STOCK MARKET WOULD CRASH. IF THEY GOT IN BEYOND FRACKING, YOU WILL HAVE YOUR 401(K)S, WHICH ARE SETTING RECORDS, BY THE WAY, THE STOCK MARKET JUST HIT A NEW HIGH. [APPLAUSE] AND DON'T FORGET, WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE PLAGUE FROM CHINA, JUST TODAY NEW HIGH, THINK OF THAT, IT'S INCREDIBLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 401(K)S HERE? THAT'S A LOT. HOW ABOUT IF THEY WENT DOWN TO 10% OF WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE THAT CAN HAPPEN. THAT CAN HAPPEN AND IT WILL HAPPEN IF WE ARE STUPID AND DON'T GO OUT AND VOTE AND SECURE YOUR BALLOT. ABSENTEE BALLOTS ARE GOOD, BUT THE STUFF WHERE THEY TAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BALLOTS AND SEND THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE , WE WILL GRAB IT AND PUT THEM IN A BIG PILE THERE, EVERYONE GRAB IT, IT'S A DISGRACE. EVEN COMMON SENSE KNOWS THAT. LOOK AT NEW YORK. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA , I WON'T GO THROUGH THE DETAILS, YOU KNOW THE STORY. THEY HAVE NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER. IN NEW JERSEY, 20% OF THE BALLOTS WERE DEFECTIVE, FRAUDULENT, 20%. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DID A GOOD JOB. OK? THIS IS JUST A WAY THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO WIN IS BY A RIGGED ELECTION. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. I SAW THE CROWD OUTSIDE. FOR EVERY SIGN WE HAD FOR TRUMP /PENS, EVERY SINGLE SIGN , [APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S NOT THAT ATYPICAL. IN TEXAS, WE WOULD DRIVE INTO SOME OIL WELL OR WE GAVE A SPEECH, BUT BETWEEN A 20 MINUTE DRIVE BETWEEN THE PLANE AND THAT OIL WELL, THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THEY HAD THE SIGNS, FLAGS, AMERICAN FLAGS. WHEN THE OTHER SIDE DOESN'T SHOW UP, WHICH IS RARELY, THEY NEVER HAVE AN AMERICAN FLAG. I CAN ALWAYS TELL, YOU NEVER SEE AN AMERICAN FLAG. THE FAKE NEWS WOULD TELL YOU THAT. BUT THEY DON'T PUT IT DOWN. THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT PERSONALLY, BUT THEY DON'T WRITE IT. YOU NEVER SEE AN AMERICAN FLAG. IT'S AN AMAZING THING. IF YOU LOOK OUTSIDE TODAY, IS IT 100 TO 1, 200 TO ONE, YOU WILL READ TOMORROW THAT BIDEN WAS WELL REPRESENTED. THERE WAS HARDLY ANYBODY THERE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I WOULD SEE A BIDEN AND I WOULD SAY I WOULD WAVE TO HER ANYWAY, WHO CARES? WAS IT 100 TO ONE? YOU WILL READ HE HAD A MASSIVE CROWD. PENNSYLVANIA LOST MORE THAN ONE IN THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER NAFTA AND CHINA IT , CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WTO AND THAT WAS A WERT , A VOTE COURTESY OF SLEEPY JOE. BIDEN LOOKED AMERICAN LABOR IN THE EYES, TOOK THEIR DUES, THEIR UNION ENDORSEMENTS AND THEIR VOTES AND THE UNIONS HAVE TO BE MORE REASONABLE, THEY HAVE TO BE MORE REASONABLE AND WE LOVE THE UNIONS, WE LOVE NON-UNIONS , I'VE HAD IT ALL. YOU KNOW? I'VE BUILT EVERY BUILDING I BUILT IN NEW YORK WITH UNIONS AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT ME TO SAY THAT, BUT UNIONS ARE FINE. TELL THEM TO KEEP THEIR DUES DOWN, PLEASE, BUT THEY ARE FINE. HAVE UNIONS, NONUNION'S, BUT WHAT I TALK ABOUT IS THE WORKER. THEY TREATED OUR WORKERS HORRIBLY. WE LOST OUR JOBS TO FOREIGN LANDS. OUR WORKERS GOT FIRED WHETHER THEY WERE IN THE UNIONS OR NOT. THEY SOLD OUT AND PASSED THE CADILLAC TAX ON UNION HEALTH CARE PLANS, TACT THEIR ENERGY JOBS AND SENT THEIR FACTORIES TO CHINA AND NOW HE'S BACK BEGGING FOR THEIR VOTES AND YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A CUSTOM, DEMOCRATS, EXCEPT WITH ME, I CAME IN, I GOT SO MANY UNION VOTES, YOU SEEN IT , A COUPLE OF PEOPLE EITHER LOST THEIR JOB OR CAME VERY CLOSE. THEY LED A CHARGE FOR THE DEMOCRATS FOR CROOKED HILLARY. THEY LET A CHARGE AND THE PEOPLE IN THE UNION DIDN'T WANT THAT. THEY DIDN'T WANT HILLARY, THEY WANTED TRUMP AND WE HAD UNION REVOLTS. THEY REVOLTED. BUT THESE GUYS RIGHT HERE, ARE YOU ALL UNION PEOPLE? IT'S GOOD RIGHT? IT'S FINE. [APPLAUSE] CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THEY WOULDN'T BE AS HAPPY, BUT IT'S OK. IT'S GREAT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY WERE NOT HAPPY , THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WHEN THE BOSSES GOT ENDORSED BY DEMOCRATS. AMERICAN LABOR WILL BOAT FOR TRUMP/PENS, THEY ARE ALL SAYING THAT AND THIS AREA IS GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE AREA. THIS USED TO BE ALL DEMOCRAT UNTIL I CAME ALONG. [APPLAUSE] UNTIL I CAME ALONG, THIS IS DEMOCRAT, IT WAS HEAVILY UNION, BUT THEY LIKE TRUMP AND I'M NEVER GOING TO LET YOU DOWN AND THEY WILL LET YOU DOWN. FIRST OF ALL, THE COUNTRY WILL BE LET DOWN BECAUSE THE COUNTRY, YOU WILL SEE A CRASH LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND AS GOOD AS THE STOCK MARKET NUMBERS ARE, THERE IS A HEADWIND. THE HEADWIND IS A FEW, , IF HE WON, THE MARKETS GOING TO CRASH. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT, IT'S SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. NO DOCTOR, NO PLAN, OBAMA LIED ABOUT IT 28 TIME, RENT HE SAID YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DR., 28 DIFFERENT TIMES THEY HAD THEM. THE LAST FOUR YEARS, WE'VE BEEN REVERSING BIDEN'S BETRAYALS AND DELIVERING HISTORIC WINS FOR THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. YOUR STATE LOST OVER 50,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS WHEN BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT AND MY FIRST YEAR, PENNSYLVANIA GAINED FORT TEEN THOUSAND JOBS , GAINED 14,000 JOBS, AND GOING UP AT A LEVEL NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. WE WILL CATCH ALL OF THOSE JOBS THAT ARE LOST. THEY SAID MANUFACTURING JOBS WILL NEVER COME BACK. REMEMBER THEY SAID YOU WILL NEED A MAGIC WAND. WE HAVE THE MAGIC WAND. MY FIRST WEEK IN AUCTION , IN OFFICE, I WITHDREW FROM THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HORROR SHOW. I WITHDREW FROM THE ONE-SIDED PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH WOULD HAVE COST US SO MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ALL IT WOULD HAVE DONE IS MADE THE COMPETITION EVEN TOUGHER ALL OVER THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT WAS DESIGNED TO HURT THE UNITED STATES AND GET JOBS AWAY FROM US AND COMPANIES. I STOOD UP TO CHINA'S RAMPANT CHEATING, PLUNDER, AND THEFT. I REPEALED THAT HORRIBLE TAX. SO MANY TAXES. HOW MANY TAXES DID I REPEAL? I'M GETTING A LIST OF THEM NOW. I WILL HAVE IT FOR YOU FOR THE NEXT MEETING BECAUSE I WILL BE BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA, THAT I PROMISE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M STANDING UP TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND TO BIG PHARMA, I SIGNED FOR HISTORIC DIRECTIVES TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THINK OF IT. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I SIGNED, AS YOU KNOW, AND AS YOU HAVE SEEN, I GUESS, OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SOMETIMES 10% OF WHAT WE PAY FOR THE SAME EXACT PILLS, SAME DRUGS, SAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I SIGNED A DEAL AND THEY SAID THEY ARE TAKING ADVERTISING AND WHATEVER YOU SEE ADS FROM DRUG COMPANIES, THAT MEANS YOUR PRICES ARE COMING DOWN, BUT IT'S CALLED FAVORED NATIONS. FAVORED NATIONS. WE WERE THE LEAST FAVORED NATION AND THE WHOLE WORLD. WE PAID THE HIGHEST PRICE. IF GERMANY AS AN EXAMPLE PAYS $.10 FOR A PILL AND WE PAY THREE DOLLARS FOR THE EXACT SAME PILL, WE PAY $.10 ALSO. WHAT IT MEANS ARE THEY ARE GOING TO GO UP AND COME WAY DOWN. WE CAN DROP DRUG PRICES BY 50, 60, OR 70%, AT A LEVEL THAT HAS MADE THEM VERY ANGRY AND REBATES, I AND REBATES, THEY GO TO YOU. NOBODY WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. THEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT A LONG TIME AGO. BIDEN COULD HAVE DONE THAT, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, THEY WON'T DO IT BECAUSE BIG PHARMA IS THE MOST POWERFUL GROUP AND I GUESS, THEY SAY NUMBER ONE, IS IT NUMBER ONE? YOU DID NOT TAKE ANY MONEY FROM BIG PHARMA. I BET YOU DIDN'T. I ENDED THE NAFTA DISASTER AND SIGNED USMCA INTO LAW. USMCA IS PHENOMENAL AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR COMPANIES FROM MOVING TO MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING UP OUR NATION.

ALSO A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, GREAT FRIEND OF HIS FATHER , MAYBE EVEN HIS GRANDFATHER , I DON'T KNOW , I HATE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SOUND A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN I FEEL. I FEEL YOUNG. THE STATE GOP CHAIRMAN, LAWRENCE TAVIS. I MISS DAN TO AVIS. WHAT A GREAT MAN HE WAS. HE ENDED UP BEING A RICH MAN, AND HE EMPLOYED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HE WAS A REAL FRIEND OF MINE. IT WAS LONG BEFORE IRAN FOR POLITICS. HE DID NOT LIKE MANY PEOPLE, BUT HE LIKE TRUMP. HE WAS A ROUGH GUIDE. HE BECAME A VERY SUCCESSFUL GUY. HE WOULD LOOK OUT OF THEM, I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY. BEFORE THE CHINA VIRUS, WE HAD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY. BY THE WAY, IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS, WE , RIGHT? 9 MILLION JOBS, AN ALL-TIME RECORD. THIS IS NOW, DURING THE HOPEFULLY CLOSING MOMENTS OF THE PANDEMIC. NOTICE HOW ANY TIME THERE'S A GOOD COUNTRY, THEY LIKE TO COMPARE , BECAUSE WE'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. LOOK AT OUR MORTALITY RATES. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT NEW ZEALAND. NEW ZEALAND, IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER FOR NEW ZEALAND. EVERYTHING IS GONE. THEY HAD A MASSIVE BREAK OUT YESTERDAY. SOUTH KOREA, IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER. BIG BREAKOUT YESTERDAY. WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB. WE ARE A BIG, BIG COUNTRY, AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS POPULAR TO SAY, MAYBE IT'S NOT , I DON'T CARE BECAUSE BASED ON THE CROWD OUTSIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS THING , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK BY A LOT. YOUR GOVERNOR HAS YOU ON A SHUTDOWN. HOW DID THEY GET OUT THERE? AND THEY WERE NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCE, I CAN TELL YOU. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? STILL, SHUTDOWN WOLF. HE CANNOT DO THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PROBLEMS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS, DRUGS, HEART ATTACKS, OBESITY. I MEAN, WHAT IS HE DOING. IT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE VIRUS. HE'S GOT TO OPEN THIS STATE UP. YOU KNOW WHEN HE'S GOING TO OPEN IT UP? I KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING IT. DOING IT IN THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, RIGHT? THEY ARE DOING IT IN NORTH CAROLINA, BUT THEY ARE DOING IT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO OPEN THIS STATE UP, AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT, RIGHT? AND WHAT IS HE DOING? WHAT IS HE DOING? THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE GOING TO GET IT OPEN. I KNOW WHEN HE'S GOING TO DO IT. NOVEMBER 4. HE'S GOING TO SAY WELL, WE ARE GOING TO OPEN IT UP. THEN YOUR RESULTS ARE NO BETTER THAN OTHER STATES. MICHIGAN HAS A CLOSE DOWN. NORTH CAROLINA HAS A CLOSE DOWN. THIS COMMONWEALTH HAS A CLOSE DOWN. IT'S A VERY SAD THING TO SEE, AND THE RESULTS ARE NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS WONDERFUL. IT'S WORSE THAN THOSE THAT ARE OPEN, AND YOU HAVE SOME OTHER STATES , IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRY, IT'S REALLY , WE HAVE STATES WHO ARE THRIVING AND THERE'S NO SHUTDOWN. WE SHUT IT DOWN BECAUSE WE HAD TO. WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WE SHUT IT DOWN, WE LEARNED A LOT, PROTECT OUR SENIORS, ETC., ETC.. THEY SAID THE V WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. WE HAVE A BIG, BEAUTIFUL V. WE ENACTED THE LARGEST FINANCIAL RELIEF PACKAGE IN HISTORY. THROUGH THE PAYCHECK RELIEF PROGRAM, WE SAVED NEARLY 2 MILLION PENNSYLVANIA JOBS. THAT'S RIGHT. 2 MILLION JOBS. WE DELIVERED NEARLY $11 MILLION IN DIRECT SUPPORT TO PENNSYLVANIA FAMILIES, AND OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, WE'VE GAINED OVER 9 MILLION JOBS. NOBODY CAN EVEN BELIEVE THE NUMBERS. AND WATCH, THE NUMBERS WILL GET AT HER AND BETTER BECAUSE WE ARE OPENING UP. FRANKLY, THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD OPEN. WOLF KNOWS HE SHOULD OPEN. HE KNOWS THAT. AND HOW ABOUT THESE , HOW ABOUT HIS PERSON WITH , WITH , WITH HER MOTHER, RIGHT? WITH HER MOTHER? WHERE THE MOTHER WAS PROTECTED BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE NOT? YOU HAD A MASSIVE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN THE NURSING HOMES, BUT 95-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, AS I READ , I SAID, WELL, THAT PERSON WILL BE GONE VERY QUICKLY, AND THAT PERSON IS STILL THERE. I WOULD SAY THAT'S SOMETHING IF EVER , IF ANYBODY WANTS TO RUN FOR THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. THEY TOOK THE MOTHER OUT OF HARMS WAY AND MOVED HER BACK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS OK AND NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT IT? THERE'S NO FIRING? RETAIL SPENDING IS NOW AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT? BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE THIS UNPRECEDENTED RECOVERY. HE WANTS TO IMPOSE A PERMANENT LOCKDOWN COMBINED WITH A SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF THE U.S. ECONOMY. DID YOU HEAR HIM THE OTHER DAY? "MARKET DOWN PURE , "MARKET DOWN." EVERYTHING WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE LAST FEW MONTHS. ON A GREAT JOB IN ARIZONA. TEXAS GOING DOWN, CALIFORNIA GOING DOWN. EVERYBODY WANTS TO PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE, ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES. DO THE MASKS. I MEAN, IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT. DO THEM. DO THEM. BUT THESE THINGS, THESE PLACES HAVE TO BE OPENED UP, BUT NOVEMBER 4, HE WILL OPEN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S A LONG TIME FROM NOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IN BIDEN'S POLICY MANIFESTO WRITTEN WITH SOCIALIST , WRITTEN WITH SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS, BIDEN PLEDGES TO OUTLAW AMERICAN OIL. HE'S GOING TO OUTLAW AMERICAN OIL. AMERICAN COAL. NATURAL GAS, WHICH IS REALLY AN AMAZING FORM OF ENERGY. IT'S CLEAN. BY MANDATING NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS WITHIN NINE YEARS AND FROM ALL POWER PLANTS BY 2035, SO HE WANTS TO BASICALLY GET RID OF ALL FOSSIL FUELS. I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ENERGY. I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ENERGY. OUR NEW FORMS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ARE JUST NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO POWER THESE MASSIVE PLANTS AND ALL THESE THINGS CREATING ALL THESE JOBS AND ALL OF THIS WEALTH FOR YOUR STATE AND FOR THE COUNTRY. THIS WEEK IN CALIFORNIA, THERE WERE ROLLING BLACKOUTS BECAUSE THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS HAVE MANDATED IMPOSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON ENERGY PRODUCTION, AND I SEE AGAIN THE FOREST FIRES ARE STARTING. THEY ARE STARTING AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA. YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FORESTS. YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FOREST. THERE ARE MANY, MANY YEARS OF LEAVES AND BROKEN TREES. AND THEY ARE, LIKE, SO FLAMMABLE. YOU TOUCH THEM AND IT GOES UP. I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM THIS NOW FOR THREE YEARS, BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO LISTEN. THE ENVIRONMENT. THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT THERE ARE MASSIVE FIRES AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA. MAYBE WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LISTEN TO IT. WE SAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE LEAVES, YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE DEBRIS. YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE FALLEN TREES. WHEN A TREE FALLS AFTER 13 OR 14 MONTHS, IT BECOMES EXTREMELY DRY. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE FIRES, THEY DON'T REALLY CATCH WHERE THE TREES ARE GOING BECAUSE THEY ARE WET. THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO LISTEN. THEY MOCK US WHEN I SAID YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FLOORS , JUST AN EXPRESSION. CLEAN YOUR FLOORS. AND I HAVE MANY, MANY YEARS, DECADES OF LEAVES , DRY LEAVES AND EVERY , THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE THEM. THERE ARE OTHER PLACES , FOREST CITIES. THEY WERE DEVELOPED IN FORESTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH MORE FLAMMABLE TREES THEN YOU HAVE IN CALIFORNIA, BUT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT. SENIOR CITIZENS WERE FORCED TO SIT IN THEIR HOMES WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER. YOU GET USED TO NO AIR CONDITIONING. THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT THAT, EITHER. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY, AND I PUT THE MINORS BACK TO WORK. WE PUT THEM BACK TO WORK. THE MINERS ARE BACK TO WORK NOW. I APPROVED THE KEYSTONE XL AND DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE'S ALMOST RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. I JUST APPROVED THEM. RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, AND, A LOT OF JOBS. BY THE WAY, IT'S A MUCH CLEANER FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. AMERICA IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE WORLD. THINK OF THAT ONE. TO PROTECT OUR GREAT STEELWORKERS , DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF CITY STEELWORKERS HERE, BY THE WAY? TO PROTECT OUR GREAT STEELWORKERS, I PLACED TARIFFS ON NATIONS THAT WERE DUMPING CHEAP, FOREIGN STEEL ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND WE HAVE CREATED INCREDIBLE INDUSTRY OUT OF NOTHING. IT WAS READY TO GO OUT. WITHIN MONTHS, STEEL IMPORTS DROPPED BY 26%, AND AMERICAN STEEL PRODUCTION SURGED BY 18 MILLION TONS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. BIDEN ABANDONED THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN SAYING , AND SAVED OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT WERE WORTHLESS, BUT HE DID NOT SAVE THE STEEL INDUSTRY. WE SAVED THE STEEL INDUSTRY. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT, THE BOARDED , THE BORDER WAS AN OPEN PIPELINE FOR GANG MEMBERS IN CARTELS, FLOODING OUR SCHOOLS WITH DRUGS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE ENDED THE HORRIBLE CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH THE CRIMINALS, YOU TAKE THEIR NAME, YOU SAY, IS THIS RIGHT? WE DON'T HAVE IDENTIFICATION, OH, THAT'S OK. IT'S LIKE VOTING. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE VOTER ID. WHY? THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT VOTER ID. YOU HAVE ID FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING. MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO IS TO VOTE, AND VOTER ID, BUT THEY DON'T WANT IT. THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THEY DON'T WANT VOTER ID, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT? YOU GUYS ALL IN FAVOR, RIGHT, OF VOTER ID? EVERYBODY? IF THEY WERE NOT, THEY WOULD NOT BE CONGRESSMAN IN GOOD STANDING FOR VERY LONG, I TELL YOU THAT. WE STOPPED ASYLUM FRAUD AND DEPORTED 20,000 GANG MEMBERS AND 420 3000 CRIMINAL ALIENS. WE GOT THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. , 423,000 CRIMINAL ALIENS. IF BIDEN WINS, THE BORDER WILL BE CEDED TO CARTELS AND THE LEFT WING CRAZIES WHO EMPOWER THEM. USED TO SEE THESE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF ILLEGALS COMING UP FROM HONDURAS, RIGHT? FROM GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR. THEY WOULD COME UP, AND THERE WOULD BE JUST THOUSANDS OF THEM. YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE. MEXICO IS , THEY HAVE, RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE FOR MONTHS. 27,000 OF THEIR SOLDIERS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. GOT TO DO IT. GOT TO DO IT. MEXICO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US VERY WELL. NEW PRESIDENT OF MEXICO , NOW HE IS NOT SO NEW. HE HAS BEEN THERE A WHILE, BUT THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO HAS BEEN DOING WELL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. IN HIS JOINT MANIFESTO WITH BERNIE SANDERS, BIDEN HAS CALLED FOR A COMPLETE SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATIONS, CLOSING DOWN DETENTION FACILITIES, ENDING BORDER PROSECUTIONS , THINK OF THIS , RESTORING AND EXPANDING CATCH AND RELEASE. HANDING OUT FREE WELFARE TO NEW ARRIVALS, WORK PERMITS FOR ILLEGAL CROSSERS AND MASS AMNESTY FOR ALL ILLEGAL ALIENS , CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THIS IS BERNIE PLUS , I THOUGHT BIDEN WOULD BE TAKEN RIGHT. THIS SHOWS HOW GOOD NEGOTIATOR HE IS. BERNIE TOOK HIM LEFT. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET A LITTLE BIT LEFT OF CENTER, MAYBE, A LITTLE BIT, FOR THEM, BUT BERNIE ACTUALLY TOOK HIM LEFT. ALONG WITH AOC. ANOTHER BEAUTY. DESIGNER OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. SHE PROBABLY NEVER STUDIED , ASK HER, HOW MANY HOURS HAS SHE TAKEN ON THE ENVIRONMENT? BIDEN WANTS TO OPEN BORDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE THAT 300 MILES OF ALL. YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A PROBLEM LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I WAS SAYING THIS FROM DAY ONE. I IMPOSED A TRAVEL BAN ON JIHADIST REGIONS TO GET THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. LOWER COURT FAILED, APPEALS COURT FAILED, BUT I WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. THEY SAY HE LOST BECAUSE I LOST IN THE FIRST TWO COURTS, BUT WE WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. JOE BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO REMOVE THIS BAN, OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO TERROR AND TERROR HOTSPOTS AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES ALLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY BY 700%. THAT'S THE MANIFESTO OF AOC AND BERNIE. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA , SHE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY , ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO BAD FOR YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE. THIS DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO PUT A DRUG DEALING ILLEGAL ALIEN INTO A JOB AND JOBS PROGRAM INSTEAD OF INTO PRISON. FOUR MONTHS LATER, THE ILLEGAL ALIEN ROBBED A 29-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, MOWED HER DOWN WITH AN SUV, FRACTURING HER SKULL AND RUINING HER LIFE. WE BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER EIGHT LONG YEARS, JOE BIDEN AND OBAMA LEFT AMERICA WEAK, DISRESPECTED, AND ENDANGERED. WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN. WE ARE A RESPECTED COUNTRY AGAIN. THEY SAID THAT , ONE OF THE LEADERS CALLED UP, TOP, TOP LEADER OF ONE OF THE COUNTRIES. HE ASKED ME TO CALL PRESIDENT ERDOGAN OF TURKEY, WHO I GOT ALONG WITH VERY WELL. HE SAID YOU CALLED HIM, AND I SAID WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT, HE SAID YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HE RESPECTS. I LIKE TELLING THE STORY. I LIKE TELLING VERY PERSONAL STORIES, BUT THEY DID SAY THAT. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HE WILL LISTEN TO. I SAID IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES? HE SAID NO, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU. I MIGHT AS WELL TELL YOU THE STORIES BECAUSE THEY WON'T. WE'VE INVESTED MORE THAN $2 TRILLION TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY . OUR MILITARY IS IN THE BEST SHAPE IT HAS EVER BEEN AND EVERYTHING IS MADE IN THE U.S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE REVIVED THE HISTORIC SHIPYARDS IN A PLACE CALLED PHILADELPHIA WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NEW JOBS , YOU KNOW THAT , AND WE JUST LAUNCHED SPACE FORCE. I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. I'M THE ONLY ONE PROBABLY THAT EVER RAN FOR OFFICE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS ACHIEVED MORE THAN I SAID I WOULD. I NEVER TALKED ABOUT SPACE FORCE. I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS, AND WE GOT IT. SIX BRANCH , THINK OF THAT. THAT'S A BIG DEAL. AMERICAN ROCKETS ARE ONCE AGAIN SENDING AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS INTO SPACE. WE RENEWED NASA. IT WAS A FIELD OF WEEDS. PRESIDENT OBAMA CLOSED IT DOWN. WE ARE NOW SENDING ROCKETS UP. A LOT OF THOSE ROCKETS ARE PAID BY RICH PEOPLE. THEY LIKE SENDING UP ROCKETS, FOR WHATEVER REASON. I SAY GO AHEAD. PASS A LITTLE VENT AND YOU CAN USE OUR PROPERTY. WE WITHDREW FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, A HORROR SHOW. THE ISIS CALIPHATE WAS DESTROYED. THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, THE ANIMAL KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST, QASEM SOLEIMANI, IS DEAD. JOE BIDEN VOTED FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ. I KEPT US OUT OF NEW WARS. EVERYONE SAID TRUMP WILL BE IN A WAR HIS FIRST WEEK. INSTEAD OF THAT, I GOT YOU OUT OF WARS. WE ARE DOWN TO A MINIMUM NUMBER IN IRAQ. AFGHANISTAN WILL BE DOWN SHORTLY TO 4000 TROOPS, AND THAT WILL COME BACK SHORTLY, TOO. SYRIA, WE TOOK THEM ALL AROUND , WE KEPT THE OIL, IF THAT'S OK WITH YOU. WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE OIL IN A WRECK, TOO. REMEMBER, I USED TO SAY KEEP THE OIL, DON'T GO , I'D SAY GO INTO A WRECK, BUT I WAS A CIVILIAN, NOBODY CARES. LIKE YOU, NOBODY CARES , I WANT TO GET THAT MOSQUITO OUT OF HERE. THEY'LL SAY IT'S CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. THEY WERE SAYING THE OTHER NIGHT, THE SHARK. THEY WERE SAYING OH, SHARKS, WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEM. I WAS SAYING WHAT A MINUTE, WAIT. THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO REMOVE ALL THE SEALS IN ORDER TO SAVE THE SHARK. I SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, DON'T YOU HAVE IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND? I'M NOT A FAN OF SHARKS, EITHER. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY VOTES I'M GOING TO LOSE. I HAVE PEOPLE CALLING ME UP, WE HAVE A FUND CALLED SAVE THE SHARKS. I SAY NO, THANK YOU, I HAVE OTHER THINGS I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL, OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM AND RECOGNIZED ISRAEL AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. NOBODY ELSE , THEY TALKED ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, MANY, MANY PRESIDENTS TALKED ABOUT THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, JERUSALEM, AND THEY NEVER DID IT. I DID IT. IN GOLAN HEIGHTS, 52 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN READING IN GOLAN HEIGHTS. I DID IT. LAST WEEK, WE REACHED A HISTORIC THROUGH IN THE MIDDLE EAST, FINALIZING A GROUNDBREAKING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. EVEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" GAVE US A GREAT EDITORIAL. THEY CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE IT. WE PASSED VETERANS CHOICE AND BETTERMENTS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR GREAT VETS. NOBODY HAS DONE FOR THE VETS WHAT I HAVE. NOBODY, NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE LOVE THE VETS. FEDERAL WORKERS WHO FAILED AND MISTREATED OUR VETERANS NOW CAN BE TOLD, YOU'RE FIRED. THAT'S ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAD SADISTS, WE HAD THIEVES, WE HAD SOME BAD PEOPLE. THEY LET GO OF 9000 PEOPLE IN THE V.A.. THEY WERE BAD PEOPLE. THEY DID NOT LOVE OUR VETS. IN A SECOND TERM IN OFFICE, WE WILL CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS IN THE NEXT YEAR. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE. WE WILL BAN SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL APPOINT PROSECUTORS, JUDGES AND JUSTICES WHO BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW, NOT THE RULE OF THAT HORRIBLE MOB THAT YOU GET TO WATCH ON TELEVISION. WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLCHILDREN IN EVERY HOME , WE ARE GOING TO LET YOU HAVE SCHOOL CHOICE. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING. THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOL CHOICE. WE WILL LOWER THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AS I SAID. WE WILL BUILD AND EXPAND OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO A LEVEL THAT IS EVEN GREATER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. LIKE I SAID BEFORE, WE ARE NUMBER 1 , WE ARE NUMBER ONE BY A LOT. NOBODY THOUGHT WE WOULD EVER BE BEFORE AND WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT, WHICH IS VERY NICE. AND AS WE'VE BEEN DOING, WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR DRUGS AND OTHER THINGS. WE WILL MAKE OUR CRITICAL DRUGS, MEDICINES, AND SUPPLIES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL GIVE TAX CREDITS TO COMPANIES TO BRING JOBS BACK TO AMERICA, AND IF THEY DON'T DO IT, WE WILL PUT TARIFFS ON THOSE COMPANIES, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY US A LOT OF MONEY, SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? THEY ARE GOING TO BRING THE JOBS BACK. IN EVERY ACTION, EVERY MOMENT, EVERY DECISION, I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU. I'M FIGHTING FOR PENNSYLVANIA. A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT RICH AND GOT POWERFUL AT YOUR EXPENSE. NOW THE SAME LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO OPEN UP BORDERS AND LET VIOLENT MOBS ROAMED THE STREETS WHILE THEY LIVE IN WALDORF COMPOUNDS AND COMMUNITIES. THEY WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE WHILE HIRING PRIVATE SECURITY. THEY WANT TO LET FIRES BURN CHURCHES WHILE JAILING YOU FOR PRAYING IN YOUR CHURCH. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH SCHOOL CHOICE WHILE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO THE BEST PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE LAND. THEY WANT TO CANCEL YOU , TOTALLY CANCEL YOU , TAKE YOUR JOB, TURN YOUR FAMILY AGAINST YOU FOR SPEAKING YOUR MIND WHILE THEY INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN WITH TWISTED, TWISTED WORLDVIEWS , AND NOBODY EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. NOTICE THEY ARE NOT KNOCKING DOWN MONUMENTS AND STATUES ANYMORE. WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I SIGNED A NICE, NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER, AND THEN I EXPLAINED , 10 YEARS IF YOU KNOCK DOWN A FEDERAL STATUTE OR MONUMENT. , FEDERAL STATUE OR MONUMENT. AND THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO MARCH ON WASHINGTON, WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK DOWN SOME NICE STATUES, AND THEN THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S NOT MARCH. AND THEY TURNED AROUND. 10 YEARS, THAT'S A LONG TIME TO KNOCK OVER A STATUE THAT MANY PEOPLE LOVE AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T. JOE BIDEN IS THE CANDIDATE OF THESE PRIVILEGED LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WHO HOLD YOU AND YOUR VALUES IN DISDAIN, BUT YOU CAN SEND THEM ALL A THUNDERING MESSAGE ON ELECTION DAY BY VOTING TRUMP-PENS. DO WE LOVE OUR VICE PRESIDENT? DO WE LOVE OUR VICE PRESIDENT, I'LL TELL YOU. I WATCHED KAMALA LAST NIGHT, AND I SAID I'LL TAKE MIKE. I'LL TAKE MIKE BY A LOT. HE'S BEEN A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT, ACTUALLY. PENNSYLVANIA IS THE STATE THEY GAVE US THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, VALLEY FORGE, GETTYSBURG, AND GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS JUST LIKE YOU. YOU ARE PATRIOTS. YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY YOU ARE HERE. WITH YOU, IT'S ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. WITH ME, I'M GOING TO GO HOME, MY WIFE IS GOING TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED, YOU LOOK LIKE A LOBSTER. LOOK AT THE SUN, THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS A STATE WHERE WORKERS GOT THEIR HANDS DIRTY MINING THE COAL AND FORGING THE STEEL THAT RAISED UP THE MIGHTIEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. REMEMBER WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE, AND THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND YOU KNOW THIS , LOOK, TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. AS I SAID, STRONGER. THEY WANT TO COME IN AND RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEY WANT TO COME IN AND PUT REGULATIONS ON ALL YOUR FACTORIES AND YOUR JOBS AND ALL YOUR PERSONAL THINGS. YOU KNOW, LITTLE THINGS , AND THEY LAUGH AT IT WHEN I SAY IT, THE LIGHT BULBS, THOSE NEW, EXPENSIVE LIGHT BULBS. I SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ONES? THEY SAID THEY ARE BETTER. I BROUGHT THEM BACK. DISHWASHERS, THE NEW DISHWASHERS DON'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH WATER, SO WHAT DO PEOPLE DO? THEY IS THE BUTTON AGAIN AND AGAIN. JUST GOT BACK FROM WHIRLPOOL IN OHIO. THEY ARE THRIVING NOW BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID TO COMPETITION FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. I TARIFF THEM, AND WHIRLPOOL ONE FROM , WENT FROM A COMPANY JUST ABOUT OVER TO ONE THAT IS THRIVING. SINK FAUCETS, SHOWER FAUCETS. I WON'T SAVE A THIRD ELEMENT OF THE BATHROOM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS JUST BRING THAT UP, SO I WON'T SAY THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY DON'T ALLOW WATER. YOU GO INTO IT NEW HOTEL, THERE'S NO WATER. I OPENED IT UP AND SAID THEY CAN HAVE AS MUCH , DOES PENNSYLVANIA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WATER? NO. YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WATER, YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT. WHY ARE WE HAVING RESTRICTORS? I TOOK IT OFF. THESE ARE LITTLE THINGS. I TELL YOU ABOUT THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE THEM. IT'S BETTER, WON'T LAST AS LONG, BUT IT'S BETTER. BETTER LIGHT. VERY IMPORTANT THING. INSTEAD OF HAVING IT LIKE ON FOR MANY TIMES LONGER, ACTUALLY WHEN I TAKE A SHOWER, I CAN HAVE WATER HIT MY HAIR. NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE WATER POURING OUT OF OUR SHOWER HEADS, OK? WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT, NOBODY WRITES ABOUT, BUT IT'S ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE, AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE IT. NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO DO ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, INTERNET PEOPLE. HOW GOOD IS BERNIE , BERNIE , HOW GOOD IS ERNIE? HE'S GREAT. LARRY HOLMES, IS HE STILL IN THE AREA? HOW GOOD WAS LARRY, RIGHT? THAT WAS PROBABLY MUHAMMAD ALI'S MOST DANGEROUS FIGHT. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. MOHAMED WOULD NEVER GO DOWN, BUT LARRY HOLMES IS A GREAT CHAMPION. I HOPE HE'S DOING WELL, BUT HE WAS ONE HELL OF A FIGHTER. FROM SCRANTON TO EAST INTO ALLENTOWN, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY JOB, EVERY FAMILY, EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD, AND EVERY VOTE. WHEN PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD , THAT'S ANOTHER WORD THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY , GOD. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? DID YOU SEE THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING LAST NIGHT THAT WAS EXTREMELY BASIC AND ALWAYS HAS HAD THE WORD GOD IN IT, AND THEY DECIDED TO TAKE THE WORD GOD OUT, BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE COMING FROM. THEY ARE COMING TO GET YOU. THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM, AND ME, WE , WE ARE THE WALL BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND TOTAL INSANITY AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE ARE ALL THAT STANDS , [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALL THAT STANDS, AND A TYPICAL REPUBLICAN PROBABLY WOULD NOT GET THERE, BUT I THINK I'M VERY REPUBLICAN IN MANY WAYS, BUT YOUR TYPICAL REPUBLICAN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WIN. LIKE YOUR AREA, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DEMOCRAT AREA, AND LET , AND YET, THE VOTES FOR TRUMP HERE ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. YOU KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. IT'S A GREAT AREA. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT, HARD-WORKING INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, AND WE LOVE THEM. WITH YOUR DRIVE AND DEVOTION, WE WILL WIN A HISTORIC VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3, AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF SCRANTON, THE LACK OF HOME, OK? REMEMBER, THE NEXT ONE, WE'VE GOT TO STOP HIM FROM SAYING THESE THINGS. HE'S GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE DOES. I HOPE HE DOES WELL. I REALLY HOPE HE DOES WELL, BUT I ALSO WANT HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH. HE'S GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THINGS, AND HE'S GOING TO DO A LOT BETTER IF HE DOES, BUT HOPEFULLY, NOT WELL ENOUGH. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LEADING A WAR THAT IS IN INCREDIBLE, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LEADING IN SO MANY POLLS THAT THEY REFUSE TO PUT OUT. WE ARE DOING SO GOOD IN THIS STATE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, IN FLORIDA, IN TEXAS, IN OHIO, IN MICHIGAN. YOU KNOW HOW MANY CAR PLANTS ARE BEING BUILT OR EXPENDED IN MICHIGAN? WE ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE DOING GREAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THESE ARE REAL POLLS. THESE ARE NOT POLES WHERE THEY DO REGISTERED VOTERS. NO, YOU WANT TO DO VOTERS THAT ARE GOING TO VOTE. REGISTERED VOTERS. YOU WANT TO DO WHAT IS CALLED LIKELY VOTERS. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO VOTE. NOT REGISTERED VOTERS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE DIED, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE. THEN YOU WANT TO DO AN EVEN COUNT. THEY DO A POLL, MANY, MANY DEMOCRATS. THEY HAD ME LOSING EVERY SWING STATE. I THINK THEY HAD ME LOSING, LIGHT, NINE STATES, THEN I WON. BUT HE'S GOING TO LOSE, RIGHT? YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE THAT TOLD ME, LOU. HE'S GOING TO LOSE SEVEN SWING STATES. HE'S GOING TO LOSE THEM ALL. HE'S DONE BY 14. WASHINGTON POST, ABC, THEY HAD ME DOWN WHEN WE FOR THE ELECTION. 12 TO 14 POINTS. THE DAY OF THE ELECTION, BECAUSE WE COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS A FAKE POLL, SO THEY CHANGED IT THE DAY OF THE ELECTION, BUT THEY HAD US JUST ABOUT EVEN. REMEMBER THAT WHOLE BIG DEAL? WE SAID YOU CAN'T , BECAUSE THAT'S CALLED SUPPRESSION. YOU SAID HEY, I LOVE TRUMP, BUT I CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE TIME BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN HER THE PROBLEM WAS LAST TIME FOR THEM, 2016, EVERYBODY WENT OUT AND VOTED. THERE WAS NO SUPPRESSION. THERE WAS INCREDIBLE EXHILARATION EXCEPT ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU EVER SEE THOSE PICTURES OF THE CRAZINESS GOING ON? BUT THE OLD WERE FAKE JUST LIKE THEIR STORIES ARE FAKE, JUST LIKE THE NEWS IS FAKE. THE POLLS ARE EVEN WORSE AND WE ARE NOW ACTUALLY DOING WORSE. ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE POLES WAS RASMUSSEN, AND RASMUSSEN CAME OUT TODAY , DID YOU SEE IT? 51 FOR TRUMP. 51. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK THEY WERE ONE OF THE THREE MOST ACCURATE POLES. ON THE ONES THAT ARE TELLING THE TRUTH , SOMETIMES. I HAD A POKE THAT CAME OUT THAT WAS VERY FAVORABLE. THEY REFUSED TO RELEASE IT. THEY DID NOT WANT THE PEOPLE TO SEE IT. WHAT KIND OF STUFF IS THIS? THAT'S WHY YOU ARE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS, AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT REALLY BIG. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE OUTSIDE, AND I MEAN, YOU COULD TAKE THIS CROWD AND MULTIPLY IT TIMES , IT LOOKS LIKE A HUNDRED, RIGHT? YOU COULD MULTIPLY IT TIMES A HUNDRED, BUT WHEN YOU SEE THIS CROWD AND YOU SEE THE KIND OF ENTHUSIASM, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. WE ARE LEADING, BY THE WAY , EVEN THEY ADMIT, WE ARE LEADING BY ENTHUSIASM BY NUMBERS THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE , RECORD NUMBERS, MEANING WE HAVE RECORD ENTHUSIASM AND HE HAS A RECORD LACK OF ENTHUSIASM, AND THAT IS A BIG, BIG VACUUM. I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE FROM THIS INCREDIBLE PLACE. IT'S JUST A GREAT, GREAT PLACE. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SO LONG AND SO MUCH AND I LOVE IT. I LOVE THE PEOPLE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST VICTORY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VICTORY THAT WILL EQUAL OR SURPASS WHAT WE DID IN 2016. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

NOW THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE HISTORY CONFERENCE WHERE HE ANNOUNCES A NEW ORDER TO PROMOTE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION CALLED THE 17 70 SIX COMMISSION. THIS IS UNDER ONE HALF HOUR. THANK YOU. SECRETARY CARSON, SECRETARY DEVOS, EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, AND ALL THOSE LOOKING ON TO THIS CONFERENCE ON AMERICAN HISTORY, WELCOME TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE. TODAY IS CONSTITUTION DAY, A DAY IN WHICH WE CELEBRATE THE WORK THAT IS PRESERVED IN THESE VERY HALLS, TWO HUNDRED 30 THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, OUR FOUNDERS COMPLETED WHAT FOR THEM WAS THE WORK OF A NATION, FOR HUMANITY, A WORK FOR THE AGES, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A GOVERNMENT WAS FOUNDED BY WE THE PEOPLE TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION TO ESTABLISH JUSTICE AND ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY FOR THEMSELVES AND POSTERITY. JOHN ADAMS, OUR FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, DESCRIBED OUR CONSTITUTION IN HIS WORDS AS THE SINGLE GREATEST EFFORT OF NATIONAL DELIBERATION THE WORLD HAS SEEN, AND SO IT WAS. WE ALL KNOW THE SUMMER OF 1787 DID NOT JUST HAPPEN. IT WAS PRECEDED BY THE SUMMER OF 1776 AND THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THE WORDS CONTINUE TO ECHO, THAT WE AS AMERICANS HOLD CERTAIN TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL AND ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN AND A-LEVEL RIGHTS , IN A LABEL RIGHTS AND AMONG THESE ARE THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. WITH THOSE WORDS, AMERICA LEADS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR AN AMERICA THAT WAS TO ELEVATE THE CONDITION OF MEN, TO LIFT ARTIFICIAL WEIGHT FROM ALL SHOULDERS AND TO CLEAR THE PATHS OF PURSUIT FOR ALL. AS THE WORDS INSCRIBED ON THE WALLS OF THESE ARCHIVES READ, THIS BUILDING HOLDS IN TRUST THE RECORDS OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE, SYMBOLIZES OUR FAITH IN OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE CONSTITUTION ARE THE GREATEST CHARTERS OF FREEDOM THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. [APPLAUSE] THE CHARACTER OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED THERE ARE THE REASON FOR OUR UNPARALLELED SUCCESS AND THEY REMAINED IT , THEY REMAINED THE GREATEST WORK IN HISTORY. THE REASON IS SIMPLE. OUR FOUNDERS HISTORY, AND SADLY WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN TO MANY FORGET HISTORY TODAY. THOMAS JEFFERSON WARNED THAT, QUOTE, IF A NATION EXPECTS TO BE IGNORANT AND FREE IN A STATE OF CIVILIZATION, IT EXPECTS WHAT NEVER WAS AND NEVER WILL BE, BUT SADLY WE LIVE IN A TIME WHERE SOME SEEK TO ERASE THE HISTORY AND DENY THE ROMANUS MARCH TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION. AS THE PRESIDENT HAS OBSERVED, IN TOO MANY SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, MILLIONS ARE EDUCATED BY THOSE WHO SEEK TO WIPE OUT HISTORY, ERASE VALUES AND INDOCTRINATE OUR CHILDREN. WE GATHER HERE TODAY SOON TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMERICANS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO AFFIRMING THE GREATNESS OF THIS NATION AND THE IDEALS OF OUR FOUNDERS. [APPLAUSE] OUR PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND, IF WE DO NOT TEACH THAT NEXT-GENERATION THE PRINCIPLES FROM THESE HALLS, WE CANNOT EXPECT THEM TO PRESERVE THEM. NO ONE CAN PRESERVE WHAT THEY DO NOT LOVE, AND NO ONE CAN LOVE WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW. THAT IS WHY ON THIS CONSTITUTION DAY, OUR PRESIDENT WILL REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO THE PRINCIPLES AND LIBERTIES THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CHAMPIONED FROM DAY ONE AND TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL ROOTS OF OUR NATION, WHAT WE DO HERE TODAY IS A PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE RISING GENERATION WILL BE ABLE TO DO THEIR PART. AS WE KNOW THEY WILL, TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS WE KNOW THEY WILL DO BECAUSE THESE PRINCIPLES ARE NOT JUST ENSHRINED IN THESE ARCHIVES , THEY ARE ENSHRINED IN THE HEARTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I KNOW THESE GREAT PRINCIPLES WILL PREVAIL BECAUSE LIKE OUR PRESIDENT I HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I HAVE FAITH THAT HE WHO GUIDED OUR FINDERS ON THIS DAY TO 33 YEARS AGO GUIDES US STILL FAR AS THE FATHER OF OUR CONSTITUTION JAMES MADISON REFLECTED, AND I QUOTE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO PERCEIVE IN IT A FINGER OF THAT ALMIGHTY HAND WHICH HAS BEEN SO FREQUENTLY EXTENDED TO OUR RELIEF AT CRITICAL STAGES OF THE REVOLUTION. SO IT IS CONSTITUTION DAY, AND WITH GRATITUDE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE US AND GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE, WHO LOVE AND CHERISH OUR HERITAGE OF FREEDOM, WITH GRATITUDE TO GOD WHO HAS GUIDED THE DESTIN SEE , DESTINY OF THIS LADND, AND TO OUR PRESIDENT WHO HAS CHAMPIONED THE POLICIES OF THIS PLACE, IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT TRUMP. (music) [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, MIKE. A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT. I AM TRULY HONORED TO BE HERE AT THE VERY FIRST WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON AMERICAN HISTORY. SO IMPORTANT. OUR MISSION IS TO DEFEND THE LEGACY OF AMERICA'S FOUNDING, THE VIRTUE OF AMERICA'S HEROES, AND THE NOBILITY OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. WE MUST CLEAR AWAY THE TWISTED WEB OF LIES IN OUR SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS, AND TEACH OUR CHILDREN THE MAGNIFICENT TRUTH ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. WE WANT OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE THE CITIZENS OF THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. (APPLAUSE.) TO GROW UP IN AMERICA IS TO LIVE IN A LAND WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, WHERE ANYONE CAN RISE, AND WHERE ANY DREAM CAN COME TRUE ALL BECAUSE OF THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES OUR NATION'S FOUNDERS INSCRIBED NEARLY TWO AND A HALF CENTURIES AGO. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COME TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, THE SACRED HOME OF OUR NATIONAL MEMORY. IN THIS GREAT CHAMBER, WE PRESERVE OUR GLORIOUS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE CONSTITUTION, THE BILL OF RIGHTS. ON THIS VERY DAY IN 1787, OUR FOUNDING FATHERS SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION AT INDEPENDENCE HALL IN PHILADELPHIA. IT WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF A THOUSAND YEARS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. OUR CONSTITUTION WAS THE PRODUCT OF CENTURIES OF TRADITION, WISDOM, AND EXPERIENCE. NO POLITICAL DOCUMENT HAS DONE MORE TO ADVANCE THE HUMAN CONDITION OR PROPEL THE ENGINE OF PROGRESS. YET, AS WE GATHER THIS AFTERNOON, A RADICAL MOVEMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO DEMOLISH THIS TREASURED AND PRECIOUS INHERITANCE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] LEFT-WING MOBS HAVE TORN DOWN STATUES OF OUR FOUNDERS, DESECRATED OUR MEMORIALS, AND CARRIED OUT A CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND ANARCHY. FAR-LEFT DEMONSTRATORS HAVE CHANTED THE WORDS "AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT." THE LEFT HAS LAUNCHED A VICIOUS AND VIOLENT ASSAULT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AMERICA. THESE RADICALS HAVE BEEN AIDED AND ABETTED BY LIBERAL POLITICIANS, ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA, AND EVEN LARGE CORPORATIONS. WHETHER IT IS THE MOB ON THE STREET, OR THE CANCEL CULTURE IN THE BOARDROOM, THE GOAL IS THE TO SILENCE DISSENT, TO SCARE YOU OUT OF SPEAKING THE TRUTH, AND TO BULLY AMERICANS INTO ABANDONING THEIR VALUES, THEIR HERITAGE, AND THEIR VERY WAY OF LIFE. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO DECLARE THAT WE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO TYRANNY. WE WILL RECLAIM OUR HISTORY AND OUR COUNTRY FOR CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, AND CREED. THE RADICALS BURNING AMERICAN FLAGS WANT TO BURN DOWN THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE BEDROCK PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. IN ORDER TO RADICALLY TRANSFORM AMERICA, THEY MUST FIRST CAUSE AMERICANS TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN WHO WE ARE, WHERE WE CAME FROM, AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. AS I SAT AT MOUNT RUSHMORE, WHICH THEY WOULD LOVE TO RIP DOWN AND IT RIP IT DOWN FAST, AND THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN , TWO MONTHS AGO, THE LEFT-WING CULTURAL REVOLUTION IS DESIGNED TO OVERTHROW THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. AS MANY OF YOU TESTIFIED TODAY, THE LEFT-WING RIOTING AND MAYHEM ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF DECADES OF LEFT-WING INDOCTRINATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. IT'S GONE ON FAR TOO LONG. OUR CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED FROM PROPAGANDA TRACKS, LIKE THOSE OF HOWARD ZINN, THAT TRY TO MAKE STUDENTS ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN HISTORY. THE LEFT HAS WARPED, DISTORTED, AND DEFILED THE AMERICAN STORY WITH DECEPTIONS, FALSEHOODS, AND LIES. THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN THE NEW YORK TIMES' TOTALLY DISCREDITED 1619 PROJECT. THIS PROJECT REWRITES AMERICAN HISTORY TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF OPPRESSION, NOT FREEDOM. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. AMERICA'S FOUNDING SET IN MOTION THE UNSTOPPABLE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT ABOLISHED SLAVERY, SECURED CIVIL RIGHTS, DEFEATED COMMUNISM AND FASCISM, AND BUILT THE MOST FAIR, EQUAL, AND PROSPEROUS NATION IN HUMAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] THE NARRATIVES ABOUT AMERICA BEING PUSHED BY THE FAR-LEFT AND BEING CHANTED IN THE STREETS BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA OF OUR ADVERSARIES BECAUSE BOTH GROUPS WANT TO SEE AMERICA WEAKENED, DERIDED, AND TOTALLY DIMINISHED. STUDENTS IN OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE INUNDATED WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY. THIS IS A MARXIST DOCTRINE HOLDING THAT AMERICA IS A WICKED AND RACIST NATION, THAT EVEN YOUNG CHILDREN ARE COMPLICIT IN OPPRESSION, AND THAT OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY MUST BE RADICALLY TRANSFORMED. CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS BEING FORCED INTO OUR CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS, IT'S BEING IMPOSED INTO WORKPLACE TRAININGS, AND IT'S BEING DEPLOYED TO RIP APART FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, AND FAMILIES. A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. THIS DOCUMENT ALLEGED THAT CONCEPTS SUCH AS HARD WORK, RATIONAL THINKING, THE NUCLEAR FAMILY, AND BELIEF IN GOD WERE NOT VALUES THAT UNITE ALL AMERICANS, BUT WERE INSTEAD ASPECTS OF WHITENESS. THIS IS OFFENSIVE AND OUTRAGEOUS TO AMERICANS OF EVERY ETHNICITY, AND IT IS ESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO CHILDREN OF MINORITY BACKGROUNDS WHO SHOULD BE UPLIFTED, NOT DISPARAGED. TEACHING THIS HORRIBLE DOCTRINE TO OUR CHILDREN IS A FORM OF CHILD ABUSE IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THOSE WORDS. FOR MANY YEARS NOW, THE RADICALS HAVE MISTAKEN AMERICANS' SILENCE FOR WEAKNESS. BUT THEY'RE WRONG. THERE IS NO MORE POWERFUL FORCE THAN A PARENT'S LOVE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND PATRIOTIC MOMS AND DADS ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE NO LONGER FED HATEFUL LIES ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. AMERICAN PARENTS ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT INDOCTRINATION IN OUR SCHOOLS, CANCEL CULTURE AT OUR WORK, OR THE REPRESSION OF TRADITIONAL FAITH, CULTURE, AND VALUES IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. NOT ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE EMBRACE THE VISION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, WHERE CHILDREN ARE NOT JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER. THE LEFT IS ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THAT BEAUTIFUL VISION AND DIVIDE AMERICANS BY RACE IN THE SERVICE OF POLITICAL POWER. BY VIEWING EVERY ISSUE THROUGH THE LENS OF RACE, THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW SEGREGATION, AND WE MUST NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. CRITICAL RACE THEORY, THE 1619 PROJECT, AND THE CRUSADE AGAINST AMERICAN HISTORY IS TOXIC PROPAGANDA, IDEOLOGICAL POISON THAT, IF NOT REMOVED, WILL DISSOLVE THE CIVIC BONDS THAT TIE US TOGETHER. IT WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY I RECENTLY BANNED TRAININGS IN THIS PREJUDICED IDEOLOGY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BANNED IT IN THE STRONGEST MANNER POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] THE ONLY PATH TO NATIONAL UNITY IS THROUGH OUR SHARED IDENTITY AS AMERICANS. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO URGENT THAT WE FINALLY RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS. UNDER OUR LEADERSHIP, THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES HAS AWARDED A GRANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRO-AMERICAN CURRICULUM THAT CELEBRATES THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR NATION'S GREAT HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE JOINED BY SOME OF THE RESPECTED SCHOLARS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT, INCLUDING PROFESSOR WILFRED MCCLAY. WILFRED, PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. DR. PETER WOOD OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOLARS. DR. PETER. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. AND TED REBARBER. THANK YOU, TED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TED. [APPLAUSE] TODAY, I AM ALSO PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL SOON SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL COMMISSION TO PROMOTE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION. IT WILL BE CALLED THE 1776 COMMISSION. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. IT WILL ENCOURAGE OUR EDUCATORS TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE MIRACLE OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND MAKE PLANS TO HONOR THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FOUNDING. THINK OF THAT, 250 YEARS. RECENTLY, I ALSO SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL GARDEN OF AMERICAN HEROES, A VAST OUTDOOR PARK THAT WILL FEATURE THE STATUES OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS WHO HAVE EVER LIVED. TODAY, I AM ANNOUNCING A NEW NAME FOR INCLUSION. ONE OF THE 56 SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A PATRIOT FROM DELAWARE. IN JULY OF 1776, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS WAS DEADLOCKED DURING THE DEBATE OVER INDEPENDENCE. THE DELEGATION FROM DELAWARE WAS DIVIDED. CAESAR RODNEY WAS CALLED UPON TO BREAK THE TIE. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SUFFERING FROM VERY ADVANCED CANCER, HE WAS DEATHLY ILL, RODNEY RODE 80 MILES THROUGH THE NIGHT, THROUGH A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM, FROM DOVER TO PHILADELPHIA TO CAST HIS VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE. FOR NEARLY A CENTURY, A STATUE OF ONE OF DELAWARE'S MOST BELOVED CITIZENS STOOD IN RODNEY SQUARE, RIGHT IN THE HEART OF WILMINGTON. BUT THIS PAST JUNE, CAESAR RODNEY'S STATUE WAS ORDERED REMOVED BY THE MAYOR AND LOCAL POLITICIANS AS PART OF A RADICAL PURGE OF AMERICA'S FOUNDING GENERATION. TODAY, BECAUSE OF AN ORDER I SIGNED, IF YOU DEMOLISH A STATUE WITHOUT PERMISSION, YOU IMMEDIATELY GET 10 YEARS IN PRISON. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO STATUES DEMOLISHED FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS, INCREDIBLY, SINCE THE TIME I SIGNED THAT ACT. JOE BIDEN SAID NOTHING AS TO HIS HOME STATE'S HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS DISMANTLED AND DISMEMBERED, AND A FOUNDING FATHER'S STATUE WAS REMOVED. TODAY, AMERICA WILL GIVE THIS FOUNDING FATHER, THIS VERY BRAVE MAN, WHO WAS SO HORRIBLY TREATED, THE PLACE OF HONOR HE DESERVES. I AM ANNOUNCING THAT A STATUE OF CAESAR RODNEY WILL BE ADDED TO THE NATIONAL GARDEN OF AMERICAN HEROES. [APPLAUSE] FROM WASHINGTON TO LINCOLN, FROM JEFFERSON TO KING, AMERICA HAS BEEN HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVER LIVED. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TODAY, THE LEGACY OF 1776 WILL NEVER BE ERASED. OUR HEROES WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. OUR YOUTH WILL BE TAUGHT TO LOVE AMERICA WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART AND ALL OF THEIR SOUL. WE WILL SAVE THIS CHERISHED INHERITANCE FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR THEIR CHILDREN, AND FOR EVERY GENERATION TO COME. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY. THANK YOU ALL ONCE AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. NOW I WILL SIGN THE CONSTITUTION DAY PROCLAMATION. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I-91% APPROVAL RATING, SO NOBODY HAS DONE MORE. WE HAVE WEAPONS, THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. HOPE TO GOD WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THEM, BUT NOBODY HAS THEM, NOT CHINA, NOT RUSSIA, NOBODY HAS THE WEAPONRY THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD, AND HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THEM REMEMBER THAT. WE HAVE THE, I CALLED IT THE SUPER MISSILES. AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN, THEY GO THROUGH HERE AND WILL SAY WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WAS THAT?

IN FACT THIS FAKE NEWS SAYS WILL SAY HE JUST GAVE AWAY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. NO I JUST SAID WE HAD THE GREATEST WEAPONS, I DIDN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE. I COULD BECAUSE AS PRESIDENT I'M ALLOWED TO DO THAT. HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE AWAY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. . YEAH HILLARY THE IDIOT JOHN BOLTON, HE COMES IN ONLY THING I WANT TO DO IS GO TO WAR WITH EVERYBODY. IF I LISTEN TO THAT IDIOT, WE'D BE RIGHT NOW IN WORLD WAR FIVE. SO WE SAW SOME MOVEMENT IN CHINA, I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO WAR WITH THEM. I THINK RUSSIA LET'S DO THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. LET'S ALSO GOING RIGHT NOW TO NORTH KOREA, HEY DO YOU REMEMBER NORTH KOREA? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, WHAT HAPPENED? YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRESS SAID, THEY SAID IT'S AMAZING.

BRAND-NEW PLANES THE BOMBERS, THE TANKERS THE JET FIGHTERS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE WE HAD TO DO IT SOMEBODY HAD TO DO IT. SOMEBODY SAID WELL WE'RE DOING SOME DAMAGE TO OUR BUDGET I SAID, I WANT TO HAVE A STRONG MILITARY. IF I SEE SOME SOLDIERS FROM FOREIGN LANDS, WALKING UP OR RUNNING UP THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. THE BEAUTIFUL SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE, I'M NOT GOING TO BE SAYING, YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T DO TO GO WITH THE MILITARY. BUT WE KEPT IT UNDER CONTROL IN THE BUDGET RIGHT. THE MILITARY SUPERSEDE'S EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD THE SUPREME COURT, TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MILITARY, OUR DEFENSE AND OUR OFFENSE. JOE BIDEN SHOULD NOT BE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT, HE SHOULD BE BEGGING FOR YOUR FIGURATIVE IN THIS. BIDEN SUPPORTED LEAVE THE GIANTS -- SUPPORTED THE DISASTER TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEATH SENTENCE FOR THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. HE SUPPORTED THE HORRENDOUS KOREA DEAL. HOW ABOUT THE SOUTH KOREA DEAL? IT'S A DISASTER, SO THAT WAS A HILLARY CLINTON DEAL I MUST SAY. ALTHOUGH HE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH BIDEN, HE ALWAYS SAYS, WHY DID THE PRESIDENT DO THIS? WHY DIDN'T THE PRESIDENT DO THAT? WHY DIDN'T HE DO THIS OR THAT? THE GUY HAS BEEN THERE FOR 47 YEARS, BUT HE JUST LEFT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. I KEEP SAYING, WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT? WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT? YOU KNOW, HE COULD'VE DONE IT. IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS 25 YEARS AGO, IT WENT ON THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT SLEEPY JOE? BUT THE KOREA DEAL, AND I SAY IT ALL THE TIME, SHE SAID THIS WILL CREATE 250,000 JOBS, 250, 000, AND PEOPLE GOT ALL EXCITED ABOUT THOSE JOBS. THE PROBLEMS WERE THAT THOSE JOBS WERE ALL PRODUCED IN SOUTH KOREA, SO THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. 250,000 JOBS FOR SOUTH KOREA. I RENEGOTIATED THE DEAL IN ITS ENTIRETY, AND NOW IT IS A GOLD DEAL. AND THE PRO-CHINA PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, IT'S PRO EVERYTHING, PRO EVERYBODY BUT US. THAT WOULD HAVE COST US TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF CLOSING DOWN. DAYTON PROBABLY 25% OF YOUR COMPANY'S, IT'S AN ANTI-AMERICA DEAL. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I DID, IT I THOUGHT I WOULD BE SCORNED, PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF. THEY UNDERSTOOD IT. WITH EVERY DECISION JOE BIDEN TWISTED A KNIFE INTO THE HANDS, AND HEARTS, OF THE AMERICAN WORKER. BUT THESE BRUTAL BETRAYALS ENDED THE DAY I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THAT'S TRUE. IT'S JOE BIDEN AND HIS HE, HE'S TOO WEAK, HE'S TOO SCARED TO STAND UP TO THE LOT RADICAL LEFT OF HIS OWN PARTY, AND HE'S TERRIFIED OF STANDING UP TO CHINA. BUT I BELIEVE HE'S MUCH MORE SCARED OF THE RADICAL LEFT, THEN HE IS OF CHINA. THAT'S WHY CHINA IS DESPERATE YOU SEE THE REPORTS. THEY WANT BIDEN TO WIN. THEY WANT BIDEN TO WIN. THEY WANTED TO WIN IT ANY COSTS. IF BIDEN IS ELECTED, CHINA WILL OWN AMERICA AND BIDEN IS ELECTED YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY IS NEVER SEEN BEFORE IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. FOUR MORE YEARS. LARGEST TAX INCREASE EVER PROPOSED, DOES ANYBODY MY PAY MORE TAXES? ALL MY LIFE LIKE I ALWAYS LIKE POLITICS AS LUCKY ELECTED I NEVER DID IT BEFORE. THEY SAID YOU CAN'T, RONNY'S GOT NO EXPERIENCE AND NOW A LOOK AROUND, YESTERDAY I WAS IN THE OFFICE, I SAID OH EXCUSE ME IS THE OVAL OFFICE? A LOT OF IT IS COMMON SENSE, IT'S ALL COMMON SENSE. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A PROTESTS, WE'RE STARTING SOME OF THE THINGS, I'LL TELL YOU ONE QUICK STORY. SO WE'RE BUILDING AIRCRAFT CARRIER, GERALD FORD, AND THEY DECIDE ON THE CATAPULTS THAT'S THE CATAPULTS TO THROW THE PLANE IN THE. AIR FOR YEARS IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS OR LONGER, IT'S BEEN STEAM, SIMPLE BEAUTIFUL STEAM, THROWS IT OFF, WOW, SEE THOSE AIRPLANES, THEY GO OFF THE ACCOUNTABLE. SO I NOTICE THAT THIS SHIP IS NEVER GETTING DONE. I CAME IN AND I SAID GOT A TREMENDOUS COST OVERRUNS, I SAID WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? OH I SAID THE CATAPULT SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. I SAID THAT'S STRANGE HOW THEY'VE BEEN BUILDING THE FOUR YEARS I WONDER WHY? AS IT'S STRANGE, LET ME CHECK, SOME SUPPOSED TO GO OVER, TAKE A TOUR, I WANT TO TAKE A TOUR WHY IT'S SO LATE. I WON'T TELL YOU HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S OVER BUDGET, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT I HEARD THE CATAPULT SYSTEM AND THE ELEVATORS IN A GOOD, OTHER THAN THAT IT'S WONDERFUL. THE ELEVATORS THAT BRING THE PLANES UP THEY DON'T WORK. SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM CAN'T GET THE PLANES, UP THEY'RE STUCK IN THE. GARAGE NOT TOO GOOD. SO I GO OVER AND THEY WANT ME TO MEET THE ADMIRAL. I SAID NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET THE ADMIRAL. TO ME I, HAVE A LOT OF ADMIRAL'S, I LIKE THE ADMIRAL'S. I WANT TO MEET WITH THE CATAPULT OR'S. SIR, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET WITH THE CATERPILLARS FOUR? I WANT TO FIND OUT WHY THE HELL THE CATAPULT IS NOT WORKING. SO THEY HAVE A SYSTEM, IT'S ALL ELECTRIC IT'S ALL ELECTRICS. ON STATE OF SCENE, STEAM WHICH IS GREAT, IT'S POWERFUL, THEY KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS, THEY DECIDE TO GO ALL ELECTRIC. NOW IF YOU TAKE A LITTLE GLASS OF WATER, AND YOU THROW IT THAT'S THE END OF THAT, SOMEONE FROM MIT HOW DO YOU FIX? IT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE OCEAN AND ROCKETS BEING SHOT AT THE SHIP AND ROUGH STUFF RIGHT? BUT IT WASN'T WORKING, SO I SAID I WANT TO MEET WITH THE CATAPULT OR'S, THERE WERE FIVE PEOPLE, THEY CAME IN, ONE'S BEEN DOING IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS HE SAID. I SAID WHO'S THE? BOSS I AM SIR. I SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR NEW SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC CATAPULTS? SIR, IT'S NO GOOD SIR. I SAID, THAT'S NOT GOOD. THAT'S NOT, THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I DID EXPECT TO BE HONEST. I SAID, SO IT'S NO GOOD RIGHT? THE SYSTEM IS NO GOOD? NO SIR. WHEN YOU THINK EPSTEIN, WELL THAT'S THE GREATEST I CAN REFER BREAKS DOWN A CAN FIX IT WITH A BLOWTORCH OR A HAMMER. AND IF THE WAVES HIT IT SIR ALL IT DOES IS COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT SIR, IT'S GOOD FOR THE SURROUNDING STEEL. I SAID SO YOU THINK IT'S BETTER? WHY DID THEY DO THE ELECTRIC. BECAUSE A TOTAL INEXPERIENCE. AND THAT I WANTED TO SEE THE ARCHITEC. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARCHITECT OF THE SHIP. THIS IS A SHIFT THE COST 15 BILLION DOLLARS. I LOOKED AT THE ARCHITECT AND SAID HAVE YOU DESIGNED TO SHIP BEFORE? AND HE SAID YEAH I HAVE. I SAID, THEY HAVE 900 MILLION DOLLAR COST OVER RUN FOR ELECTRIC CATAPULTS AND YOU KNOW GOOD EVEN IF THEY WORK. I SAID WHY IS IT THAT, HE SAID SIR WE CAN DO MUCH FASTER, THE THING GOES BACK AND FORTH. A CIVIL THAT MAKES SENSE, BUT THE CATAPULT, HE SAID SIR DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT TAKES ONE MINUTE AND 52 SECONDS. IF YOU'RE A MARIO AND READY TEAM TO GET A PLANE HOOKED IN SO THE STEAM GENERATES IN THAT MINUTE AND A HALF AND IT'S ALL SAID TO GO. IT DOESN'T HELP THAT HE KEEPS GOING BACK AND FORTH. I SAID THAT MAKES SENSE, THAT MAKES SENSE. SO IT'S 900 MILLION DOLLARS IT COSTS, AND HERE'S THE STORY. THEY SPENT MUCH MORE MONEY AND IT'S NO GOOD. THEN WE HAVE THE ELEVATORS. NOW TRACTORS IS HYDRAULICS RIGHT. THEY CAN DO ANYTHING, THEY LEFT UPRIGHT, MAKE A RAIN, IT CAN SNOW, LIGHTNING HITS THE THING. NOTHING HAPPENS LIGHTNING GETS HURT. SO THEY HAVE THESE BIG ELEVATORS, SIREN GOES OFF, EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL, PROBLEM IS THE ELEVATORS NETWORK. SO THE MAGNETIZE. THEY'RE LIFTED BY MAGNETS. I SAID WHO THE HELL I KNOW ABOUT. THAT IT'S NEW TECHNOLOGY IT'S ABOUT 200 YEARS OLD. SO THE USING POWERFUL HYDRAULIC AND NEVER BREAKS INSTEAD, THEY HAVE MAGNETIZE ELEVATORS. SO STUPID, I MEAN HONESTLY SO STUPID. AND YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THIS. IT IS WHAT WE DO IS SO STUPID. SO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COST OVERRUN FIRST OFF THE SNOW GEAR AND TWO YEARS AGO I TOLD THEM IT'S NO GOOD, YOU MIGHT AS WELL RIP IT OUT BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK. HE PUT HYDRAULIC IN THE ELEVATORS AND YOU GO BACK TO STEAM. IT'S SUCH A SHAME TO SEE THE KIND OF MONEY THAT WAS SQUANDERED BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING. IT'S A SHAME, RIGHT IT'S A SHAME. AND YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND IT. I ONLY TELL THAT STORY TO REALLY A SORT OF A GROUP LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND IT. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. AT A VERY EASY LEVEL, IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WASTED FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOOD. POLITICIANS WHO SPENT TRILLIONS IN TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOREIGN NATIONS, FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS AND DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS BUT NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES, WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA WHERE THEY BELONG. WHEN THE TERRIBLE PLAYED ARRIVED FROM CHINA, WE MOBILIZED AMERICAN INDUSTRY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE RAPIDLY DEVELOPED LIFESAVING THERAPIES REDUCING THE FATALITY RATE BY 85%. WE HAVE DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB EXCEPT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS BECAUSE THE PRESS JUST WILL NOT ACCEPT IT. THEY JUST WANT TO THINK OF THINK OF WHAT WE DOWN WITH THE VENTILATORS. SOON THE VACCINES IN THE THERAPEUTICS RUN RIM ESCOBAR AND OTHER THINGS. EUROPE IS ALMOST 30% GREATER ACCESS MORE TOTALITY THAN THE UNITED STATES AND AS YOU HEARD TODAY, EUROPE HAD A TREMENDOUS OUTBREAK. EUROPE EUROPEAN UP. WE'RE DOING GREAT, WE'RE DOING GOOD. SADLY, VERY SADLY, I HATE IT. BUT THEY HAD A BIG OUTBREAK CAUSED A STIR IN THE MARKET TODAY. WE LAUNCHED THE MOST AMBITIOUS VACCINE PROGRAM EVER CREATED AND WE WILL DELIVER A VACCINE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR BUT IT COULD BE A LOT SOONER THAN THAT, A LOT SOONER. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING, THE DEMOCRATS THEY'RE ALL SAYING WE WANT A VACCINE, THEY THOUGHT WE COULDN'T GET IT, FOR SAYING THAT WOULD, BECAUSE IF WE WERE LAID ON THEM, THIS VACCINE WOULD'VE TAKEN TWO OR THREE YEARS MORE, BECAUSE OF THE FDA AND I MOBILIZE THE FDA AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BUT IT WOULD'VE TAKEN TWO OR THREE YEARS MORE. SO WHEN THEY HEARD THAT WE WERE GETTING THE VACCINE, THEY STARTED KNOCKING IT, SO THEY PUT POLITICS OVER LIFE AND DEATH IT'S INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER IN ANY OF EVENT. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VACCINE VERY SOON, IT'S A GREAT, GREAT VACCINE. LOOKING REALLY, REALLY GOOD. REALLY GOOD. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT SOONER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT AND IT'S PRETTY SAD WHEN THE DEMOCRATS TRY TO MAKE THAT INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE BECAUSE THEY'RE UNHAPPY IT'S COMING TOO SOON, THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED. WE WILL END THIS PANDEMIC IN THE NEXT YEAR WE WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST YEARS OF THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE THIRD QUARTER WILL END JUST BEFORE NOVEMBER 3RD, YOU WILL SEE NUMBERS THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN, THAT'S HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. YOU'LL SEE. I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. AND IF THEY'RE GOOD I HOPE YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT TO. SOMEBODY PREDICTED 25% AND THEN SOMEBODY PREDICTED 35% GDP INCREASE. NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF A NUMBER LIKE THAT. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE'RE DOING UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE BUILT THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND NOW WE WERE DOING IT AGAIN. THEY KNOW. IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS, WE HAVE ADDED A RECORD SMASHING 10.6 MILLION JOBS, NEVER BEEN CLOSE TO THE. 10.6 MILLION JOBS. MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IS UP 61%, AUTO PRODUCTION HAS SURGED 500% AND RETAIL SALES HAVE SOARED 112%. (CLAPPING) (CLAPPING) BUT A SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WINS, THE ECONOMY WILL. CROPS ECOLOGICAL EAGLES CLAPS. AND AS GOOD AS THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING, IT'S A HEADWIND KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE AN ELECTION. BUT THAT'S A HEADWIND. WE WOULD BE DOING ERVIN BETTER IF THIS ELECTION WERE OVER. IF WE WIN AND WHEN WE WIN THE ELECTION, YOU WILL SEE THINGS ROAR, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANTED. THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET WANTS. THAT'S WHAT THE WORKERS WANT. BIDEN KEEPS TALKING ABOUT A NATIONWIDE SHUTDOWN. THERE IS NO SHUTDOWN. MY PLAN IS TO CROSS THE VIRUS. BIDEN'S PLAN REALLY IS NOT THAT HE WANTS TO CRUSH AMERICA BUT HE WILL JUST OUT OF GROSS IN CONFIDENCE. BIDEN WILL SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS, JUST LIKE HE SURRENDERED TO CHINA AND JUST LIKE HE SURRENDERED TO THE RADICAL LEFT, INCLUDING HIS OWN RUNNING MATE WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW. SHE'S NOTHING SPECIAL. SHE HAS NOTHING BETWEEN HER AND ELIZABETH WARREN, A LOT OF GREAT WINDS THEY ARE. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. ELIZABETH WARREN TO DO A GREAT NUMBER AWE AND -- DIDN'T SHE? ONE QUESTION AND I WAS THE END OF HIM. HOW ARE YOU DOING POLITICS MIKE? 1.8 BILLION WIPED OUT IN ONE QUESTION. WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE QUESTION IN HISTORY. TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS DURING THE PANDEMIC, I SUSPENDED THE ENTRY OF NEW FOREIGN WORKERS WHO THREATEN AMERICAN JOBS. YOU REMEMBER YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TO YOU? AS THE ECONOMY REOPENS, WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST AND OUR JOBS ARE PUT FIRST, OUR COUNTRY IS PUT FIRST, OUR MANUFACTURING IS BUT FIRST, EVERYTHING IS PUT NOW PUT FIRST FOUR. THE USA. USA AND BY THE WAY, WERE UP TWO MILE 330 ON THE WALL. 330. WE'RE SETTING RECORDS ON NOT ALLOWING ALL OF THESE, I MEAN IT'S REALLY BAD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TRAFFICKERS. THEY TRAFFICKING WOMEN AND DRUGS AND OTHER THINGS, BUT THE TRAFFIC AND WOMEN, THE DRUG DEALERS ARE ALREADY SETTING RECORDS NOW. WE HAVE 330 MILES. WE'RE AVERAGING TEN MILES A WEEK AND WILL BE FINISHED WITH THE BALL VERY SOON. IT'S HAD A HUGE IMPACT. SO ONE OF THE MOST RADICAL THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN AND THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS BECAUSE HE WAS BANNING FRACKING FOR YEARS. HE'S BANNING FRACKING, I SAID HE'S GONE. HE'S GOT. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WELL I DIDN'T REALLY SAY THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST THING THEY SAY, THE POLITICIANS. HE WANTS TO BAN FRACKING AND OUTLAW OHIO ENERGY PRODUCTION AND EUROPE YOU ARE A BIG ENERGY PRODUCER WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT. HE'S IN A BAD FRACKING THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT. IT AND EVEN IF HE DIDN'T WANT TO, THE WHOLE RADICAL LEFT, THEIR PLAN IS TO BAN FRACKING. THEY WANT TO BAN FRACKING. THEY DON'T WANT ANY FOSSIL FUELS. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, BIDEN REITERATED HIS PLAN TO REQUIRE NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS. SO YOU DO THAT, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL, CLOSE UP ABOUT 70% OF YOUR PLANTS. THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD AND ALL INVESTMENT IN FRACKING AND I WOULD JUST SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING. OUR COUNTRY. YOU SEE THE ROLLING BLACKOUTS THEY HAVE IN CALIFORNIA? I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO MANY OF THEM IN OHIO DOING? WOULD ANYBODY LIKE A FEW ROLLING BLACKOUTS? LIKE WE WALKED LIKE TO WATCH PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT I'M SORRY DARLING WE HAVE NO ENERGY. WE HAVE NO ENERGY. WE'RE GONNA GET IT FROM THE WIND, THE WIND IS BLOWING. THE WIND IS WONDERFUL ENERGY, WONDERFUL ENERGY, WHAT IS JUST BLOWING FOR ABOUT 20% OF THE TIME. BY ENDING FRACKING, BIDEN WOULD DESTROY 700,000 TO 1 MILLION OHIO JOBS AND YOUR ENERGY PRICES WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF. WHEN BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT, THEY DELIBERATELY KILL 40% OF ALL COAL MINING JOBS AND THE REST WERE COMING FAST. I SAVED IT. I PUT OUR MINERS BACK TO WORK. CLEAN COAL, I CALL IT CLEAN COAL. YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH CLEAN COAL. WELL I'M PRESIDENT, AMERICA WILL REMAIN THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL OR NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND OHIO WORKERS WILL CONTINUE LEADING THE WAY IN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. JUST THINK INCLUDING, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL BUILD AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD. WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA AND ALL OTHER FAR AWAY LANDS THAT NOBODY IN THIS BEAUTIFUL FACILITY, WHATEVER THE HELL YOU MAKE HERE I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT LOOKS GOOD TO ME. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF IT. A LANDS THAT WE GO TO TOUT NOBODY EVER HEARD. OF WHERE HE IS SENDING THIS? MONEY WE'RE SENDING IT TO SUCH AND SUCH A COUNTRY. I NEVER HEARD OF. IT WILL MAKE OUR MEDICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WILL CUT YOUR TAXES AND TAXES FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. YOU KNOW WE GIVE YOU THE THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE GAVE YOU THE BIGGEST REGULATION CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THE ADDITIONAL REGULATION CUTS, THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS YOU HAVE THE JOBS HERE NOW, THE REGULATION CUT WAS IMPORTANT PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT. REGULATION CUTTING WAS EVERYBODY'S IMPORTANT. WE'RE GONNA EXPAND OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO MAKE SURE THAT NO COMMUNITIES LEFT BEHIND AND THEY'VE BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. ESPECIALLY FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN, HISPANIC COMMUNITY. WE'RE DOING INCREDIBLE, TIM SCOTT, GREAT SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. WE WORKED HARD ON THAT. OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. BIG SUCCESS. WILL ENFORCE IMMIGRATION RULES THAT THE FAN AMERICAN FAMILIES, RAISE AMERICAN WAGES AND ALWAYS PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST. WE WILL ENACT ENACT FAIR TRADE DEALS THAT ISSUE MORE PRODUCTS THAT PROBABLY STAND WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. AND WE WILL ALWAYS LEWIS BY THE TIME WAS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, AND GOD WE TRUST. (CLAPPING) AND THEY TOOK THE WAY GOD OUT OF THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, YOU SAW THAT. I WAS LISTENING TO THIS PLEDGE IN HIS PLEDGES OF ALLEGIANCE I SAID THAT STRANGE. THEY MUST MADE A MISTAKE. IT MUST BE IN A TYPO. SOMETHING HAPPENED. THEN IT HAPPENED TWICE, AND WAS GETTING READY TO HELP IN THE THIRD TIME AND SOMEBODY HEARD THAT THE PUBLIC WAS ENRAGED INCLUDING ME BY THE WAY. AND BY THE WAY, WE WANT THE NFL TO STAND AND PUT THEIR HAND IN THEIR HEARTS. (CLAPPING) GOTTA DO IT. RIGHT? I FELT WE TAUGHT THEM THAT LESSON ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. THE COMMISSIONER TRIED IT AGAIN, IT'S NOT WORKING TO ALL. NOT WORKING. THE RATINGS ARE NOT GOOD. PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT IT. PEOPLE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, LOVE OUR FLAG, HE LOVER ANTHEM. THIS NOVEMBER IF YOU WANT JOBS, IF YOU WANT AN OPPORTUNITY, IF YOU WANT SAFETY AND IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO DEFENDS THE DREAMS OF WORKERS IN DAYTON AND AKRON AND ALL ACROSS OHIO IN AMERICA, THEN YOU NEED TO GET OUT AND VOTE FOR TRUMP MIKE PENCE. HOW GOOD IS MIKE? PENCE TRUMP PANTS. AND I LOVE MIKE, BUT DOES NOT PENCE TRUMP. IT'S NOT PANTS. MIKE WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHEN HE SAID THAT THE OTHER DAY, HE SAID THE HARRIS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I SAID THAT STRANGE. AND MY CALL ME UP, AND HE SAYS YOU NEVER HAVE TO DO. THAT I SAID DON'T WORRY MIKE I WON'T. MIKE PENCE IS DONE A GREAT JOB, HE'S A GREAT GUY. TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICANS SAFER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONGER AND PROUDER AND GREATER AND THAN EVER BEFORE. WOULD YOU MAKE A GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE AND AGAIN THIS REALLY WAS NOT A RALLY, THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE, WORKERS, THIS WAS TOLD TO ME, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN BUT IT'S VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. NOVEMBER 3RD AND BEFORE DEPENDING ON NOT WHERE THEY HAVE THOSE FAKE BALLOTS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GREAT ONE OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES. THEY WANTED TO BE A MESS, THEY KNOW IT'S NO GOOD. I THINK IT'S 11 DIFFERENT RACES, THEY CAN'T EVEN WITH SMALL RACES, THEY CAN ACCOUNT. PEOPLE STEAL THE BALANCE, PEOPLE DON'T GET THE BALLOTS. THEY DON'T STAND SEND INTO REPUBLICAN AREA, OR MAYBE A DEMOCRAT ERA. IT'S STILL WRONG, BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE REPUBLICAN UNFORTUNATELY. BUT THEY DON'T SEND THEM OUT AND THEY HARVESTED WHICH THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO. THEY HAVE THEM IN NEVADA, THE GOVERNOR SAID HE SIGNED IN ORDER THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SIGN. WE NEED NO SIGNATURE VERIFICATION. OH THAT'S GREAT. BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET PEOPLE TO SIZE SO THEY SAID WILL JUST SEND THEM IN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THIS IS A REAL AFFRONT TO OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING THAT'S GOING ON. AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT AND THEY SAY WELL HE'S NOT FOR OUR GREAT HERITAGE, HE IS FIGHTING OUR VOTE. NO I'M NOT FIGHTING THE VOTE. YOU HAVE BALANCE THE EGO OUT AND YOU CAN GET, YOU CAN REQUEST AS YOU KNOW, YOU CAN REQUEST THEM AND THAT'S FINE. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT REQUESTING THEM, WHEN YOU GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, 80 MILLION THEY SAY, ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY GOING? WHO STANDING? THEM WHO'S GETTING THEM? WHO SENDING THEM BACK? WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE TRANSPORTATION? WHO'S GUARDING THE LOCKED BOXES? THEY KNOW IT'S A FRAUD WAITING TO HAPPEN. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT 1% WHICH IS NO GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN LOSE OR WIN AN ELECTION BY 1%, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20, OR 30%, IN ONE CASE OVER 40%. THIS IS A DISGRACE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET ALLOW WITH IT, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, IS THEY WANT TO HAVE A MESS AT THE END OF THE EVENING ON NOVEMBER 3RD AND THEN FIGHT IT OUT IN THE COURTS. AND THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CAUSING. WE LOVE OHIO, WE LOVE DANE, GOD LAST YEAR, GOD BLESS OHIO, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475976-1/president-trump-campaign-remarks-dayton-ohio	President Trump delivered remarks at a rally held at Dayton International Airport in western Ohio.	475976-1	Speech

I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN A COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA. HARDWORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS, AND BY THE WAY, THE HOME OF THE PITTSBURGH STEALER'S. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD TEAM. GREAT QUARTERBACK, DON'T YOU THINK? BIG BEN, RIGHT? GOODMAN. HE IS A GOOD MAN. 42 DAYS FROM NOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS. AND WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO IT, I WILL TELL YOU THAT. WITH YOUR VOTE, WE ARE GOING TO LIFT OUR NATION TO EXTRAORDINARY NEW HEIGHTS. WE ARE GOING TO TURN THE PAGE FOREVER ON THE FAILED POLITICAL CLASS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND OUR JOBS, FAMILIES, WORKS AND OUR TREASURED WAY OF LIFE. THAT REMEMBER, WE NOW PUT AMERICA FIRST, WE DO IT. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THAT. THIS ELECTION IS A MATTER OF ECONOMIC SURVIVAL FOR PENNSYLVANIA. YOU HAVE THE GREATEST YEAR YOU'VE EVER HAD LAST YEAR AND YOU ARE REALLY ON YOUR WAY. WE WERE VERY VERY SADLY DISTURBED BY WHAT HAPPENED WITH CHINA. THEY LET THE PLAYED OUT, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT. BUT YOU ARE NOW ON YOUR WAY, WE CLOSE IT UP AND WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES AND THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. WE CLOSE IT UP AND SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES. I WILL TELL YOU, YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING, YOU SEE THE NUMBERS AS WELL AS I DO. YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO MAYBE ECONOMICALLY THE BEST YEAR, THIS NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE BEST YEAR THAT WE HAD. AND THE THIRD QUARTER, WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT, WAIT FOR THE NUMBERS, THEY WILL BE OUT BEFORE THE ELECTION. I PREDICT THEY WILL BE VERY GOOD. IF THEY ARE NOT, I DENY I EVER SAID IT. I DENY IT. BUT I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL BE INCREDIBLE, THE BEST EVER, UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE PROBABLY ACHIEVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. (APPLAUSE) AND DON'T FORGET, I AM NOT THE CANDIDATE, TWO CANDIDATES SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE FRACKING, AND THEY SAID THAT FOR A YEAR. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAID, MAYBE WILL HAVE SOME FRACKING AND YOU KNOW THAT WON'T LAST BECAUSE THE RADICAL LEFT WON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. I AM ALL FOR FRACKING. I WAS IN TEXAS, IT IS A BIG PART OF YOUR ECONOMY, IT IS ENERGY, IT IS A TREMENDOUS APART. I WAS IN TEXAS TWO WEEKS AGO AND MY OPPONENT IS AGAINST OIL, GUNS AND GOD. (BOOING) AND I JUST SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREAT GUY. HE SAID I THINK YOU ARE UP 15. AND I SAID THE FAKE NEWS SAYS I AM UP FOR, AND HE SAID, YOU ARE NOT UP FOR. REMEMBER LAST TIME WITH YOU, WITH TEXAS? IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL, AND THEN BOOM, THE POLLS CLOSE. THEY SAID, TRUMP WON, TRUMP WON, TRUMP WON. WE WON A LOT. AND I WON PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE OF YOU. AND YOU HAD YOUR BEST YEAR, SO THAT'S THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN A LOT -- LAST TIME I CAME IN I SAID I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE TAX CUTS, REGULATION CUTS, I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO BIG THINGS WITH ENERGY, BIG THINGS WITH STEEL. YOU ARE STEEL MILLS WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND GONE HAD I NOT WON. I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND NOW I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I'VE SAID AND MORE. I HAVE DONE MORE. I'VE DONE SO MUCH MORE. SO THEY SHOULD BE EASIER, I HEARD WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL, I KNOW WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL, WE CAME IN WITH A LOT OF THESE GREAT CONGRESSMAN AND THEY SAID YOU ARE GOING TO WIN IT BY A LOT. WE BETTER WIN IT. WE GOTTA GO OUT AND VOTE. WE ARE EMPOWERED BY THE INCREDIBLE WORKERS OF THE STATE, YOU ARE NOW REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER, THINK OF IT, AS A NATION AND YOU ARE SAYING -- YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG YOU ARE IN ENERGY, PEOPLE WILL THINK OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT WAY. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? AND AS A NATION, WE ARE THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD BY FAR, NOT EVEN CLOSE. AND WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. THINK OF THAT. BUT NO LONGER IS AMERICA AT THE MERCY OF THESE FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, ALL THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF US FOR SO MANY YEARS, NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO BE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE PERHAPS TO HELP ALLIES, WE ARE THERE TO HELP GOOD PEOPLE, BUT WE ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE WE NEITHER ENERGY OR OIL. INSTEAD WE ARE THE DOMINANT ENERGY PRODUCER, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE IT THAT WAY. BY THE WAY, OUR OPPONENTS, THEY DON'T WANT PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THEY WANT WIND. LET'S OPEN UP WIND. LET'S HAVE SOME WINDS AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE WIND WILL BLOW AND YOU CAN PRODUCE A COUPLE OF THINGS AND THEN YOU CAN CLOSED DOWN YOUR PLAN FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON. YOU CAN WATCH THOSE BIRDS FLY OUT OF THE SKY. I ALWAYS SAY IT IS A BIRD GRAVEYARD UNDER THE WINDMILLS. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER? DOESN'T HAVE THE STAYING POWER? YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA, ROLLING BLACKOUTS. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA? THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA? DARLING, WHAT IS WRONG I CANNOT WATCH TRUMP ON TELEVISION. I CAN'T WATCH OUR PRESIDENT. WE HAVE A ROLLING BLACKOUT, IT WILL ONLY BE A FEW HOURS. I THINK WE WILL BE ON BY TWO CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WE CAN WATCH AROUND. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, WE HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS, SOME CASES YOU JUST HAVE BLACKOUTS. THEY REMAIN CALLED ROLLING. IT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN HERE STATE. LAST YEAR I VISITED THE PETROL CHEMICAL PLANT IN BEAVER, PENNSYLVANIA, THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN YOUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND THAT WAS ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY OR PRO-ENERGY POLICIES. HAD WE DONE IT A LAW IN LOUISIANA. WE ARE BUILDING SOME OF THE LARGEST PLANTS YOU'VE EVER SEEN, BLUR JUST IN THE WORLD. IT IS INCREDIBLE. ALL RELATED TO ENERGY. YOUR SECURITY AND YOUR JOBS ARE VERY GRAVE PERIL BECAUSE THE RADICAL LEFT MANIACS DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH ENERGY. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH -- THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS, RIGHT? THEY HAVE THE GREEN NEW DEAL WHERE THERE WILL BE NO ENERGY OF ANY KIND. IT IS CRAZY. IT IS AOC PLUS THREE. NOT A GOOD STUDENT, NOT GOOD AT ANYTHING, BUT SHE HAS A GOOD LINE OF CRAP. I WILL TELL YOU THAT. SHE HAS A HELL OF A LINE. BUT SHE IS RADICAL LEFT, BUT SHE IS NOT AS BAD AS SOME OF THEM. HOW ABOUT OMAR OF MINNESOTA? WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF HER, THEY SAY. THEY ARE TELLING US HOW TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. DO IT HOW YOU CAME FROM. SHE'S GOING TO TELL US, SHE IS TELLING US HOW TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THEIR STANCE ON ISRAEL'S LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD. IT IS LIKE FROM TEN YEARS AGO, IT IS A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND WE WANT TO KEEP OUR WORLD THE WAY IT WAS AND THE WAY IT WAS GOING TO BE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. WE DON'T NEED SOCIALISTS, WE DON'T NEED COMMUNIST TELLING US HOW TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. NO, THEY ARE ALL GREAT WOMEN. BRILLIANT, GREAT SCHOLARS. BY THE WAY, WHILE I AM HERE, WOULD ANYONE PREFER THAT THEY PICK A MAN? IS THERE ANY MAN THAT HAS THE COURAGE TO RAISE THEIR HAND. YES, THERE IS ONE RIGHT THERE. WE ARE GOING TO AND A CREDIBLE ONE, A WOMAN. WATCH THE ABUSE THAT SHE WILL TAKE, WHOEVER, THE DECISION WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON SATURDAY, 5:00 ON SATURDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS REPUBLICAN SUPPORT. TWO PEOPLE, ALWAYS HAVE TO BE TO. ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THOSE TWO. WE HAVE GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TREMENDOUS SUPPORT, NEVER BEEN THIS UNIFIED BEFORE EVER. EVER. AND THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT WE HAD 196 TO NOTHING, WE CAN PROBABLY SUPPORT AND WE HAD 52 AND A HALF TO ONE HALF IN THE SENATE. WHO WAS THE HALF? I CAN'T IMAGINE. BUT HE WAS VERY GOOD FOR THE HALF. NOW I AM HAPPY. THANK YOU MITT. IT WAS VERY GOOD. VERY POSITIVE. BUT DAYS AGO, BIDEN REITERATED HIS PLANS TO ACQUIRE NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS. THAT IS BASICALLY SAYING, THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL, NO MORE GAS, NO MORE NOTHING, NO MORE INDUSTRY, NO MORE COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT IT IS SAYING, REALLY. AND THAT WOULD INSTANTLY SHUT DOWN ALL FRACKING AND MINING IMMEDIATELY IN PENNSYLVANIA, SENDING YOUR JOBS OVERSEAS, SENDING YOUR MONEY TO SOMEONE ELSE, NOT YOU. AND I WILL KEEP YOUR JOBS IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE THEY BELONG IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE DOING FRACKING FOR A LONG TIME. BUT I CAN SAY THIS, BECAUSE YOU ARE BEGUN ENERGY. I CAN SAY THE SAME THING TO YOU AS I SAY TO TEXAS. THEY DON'T WANT OIL, THEY DON'T WANT FRACKING, THEY DON'T WANT THE ENERGY WE KNOW THAT POWERS THESE MASSIVE PLANTS. BECAUSE THE OTHER STUFF IS WONDERFUL, IT'S NOT GONNA DO IT. SO THEY DON'T LIKE OIL, THEY DON'T LIKE THE GAS, THEY DON'T LIKE GOD, RELIGION, CHURCHES ARE CLOSED. HOW ABOUT THESE STATES? THEY STILL HAVE CHURCHES CLOSED. AND BY THE WAY, YOUR GOVERNOR HAS NOT BEEN SO GREAT, YOU KNOW THAT? ARE YOUR CHURCHES STILL CLOSED? THEY ARE STILL CLOSED. THEY ARE DOING IT FOR A REASON. NOVEMBER 4TH THEY WILL ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO OPEN UP. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE OUR NUMBERS AS BAD AS POSSIBLE SO CALIFORNIA IS CLOSED, PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA ALL CLOSED, MICHIGAN IS CLOSED. THAT IS ANOTHER BEAUTY RIGHT THERE. MICHIGAN IS CLOSED. AND THEN THEY HAVE THESE FAKE BALLOTS, BILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. WHEN YOU SEE SHENANIGANS, PLEASE REPORT IT HERE AUTHORITIES. THE REAL AUTHORITIES. THOSE AUTHORITIES ARE WATCHING. BUT PLEASE REPORT IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, REALLY, IT IS AMAZING. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE HER NUMBERS LOOK BAD BUT EVEN WITH NUMEROUS CLOSED STATES, AND ALSO LAW AND ORDER, THE RED STATES, THE REPUBLICAN STATES, THEY ARE WORKING GREATS. RECORD LOW CRIME. BUT DEMOCRAT RUN STATES, LOOK AT CHICAGO, NEW YORK, NEW YORK HAS GONE THROUGH -- WE HAVE TO DRAFT RUDY GIULIANI. WE WANT RUDY. RUDY IS AMAZING. HE DID A GREAT JOB. NEW YORK WAS IN BIG TROUBLE AND HE CAME IN AND WAS TOUGH AND SMARTS AND IT BECAME THE SAFEST BIG CITY. NOW WE HAVE A MAN WHERE SOME CATEGORIES OF CRIME WERE UP 300%. HE FIRED 1000 -- HE FIRED A LOT OF POLICE. A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF POLICE, FIREMEN AND WOMEN. IT IS A TERRIBLE THING. I LOVE THAT PLAY SO MUCH AND IT IS SO SAD TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO NEW YORK. WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PLAY FOR NEW YORK. IN THEORY, THEY AUTOMATICALLY -- THE DEMOCRATS AUTOMATICALLY THAT -- I DO PHENOMENALLY IN MOST PARTS BUT ONE PART IT IS AUTOMATIC. BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PARTICULAR PART IS GOING TO BE HAPPY. SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE A PLAY FOR NEW YORK. WITH PENNSYLVANIA, I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY. I'VE GOT PENNSYLVANIA. WE DON'T HAVE TO, FOR YEARS THOUGH, PENNSYLVANIA WAS THE PLACE THAT REPUBLICANS DIDN'T WIN. AND FOR MANY YEARS EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO WIN, EVERY REPUBLICAN, THEY SAID WE WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA. AND THEY DIDN'T. AND I CAME ALONG AND WE WON IT AND WE WON IT QUITE EASILY. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO EVEN BETTER NOW BECAUSE REMEMBER, NUMBER ONE, IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR STATE LAST YEAR IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID. WE STOP THE DUMPING. WE SAVED SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. PENNSYLVANIA IS THE HOME OF AMERICAN ENERGY, THINK OF IT THAT WAY, AND THIS IS TAKING PLACE OVER SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. ALSO THE BIRTHPLACE OF A THING CALLED THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION, RIGHT? AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. AND TO UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN, AS OPPOSED TO AS CONCEIVED BY SOME RADICAL LEFT, I WILL SOON BE ANNOUNCING THAT NOMINEE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, MY OPPONENT REFUSES TO RELEASE A LIST OF JUSTICES. I WAS TOLD, I WAS TOLD A BIG THING WHEN I WAS RUNNING LAST TIME. NOBODY REALLY KNEW ME VERY WELL, WE HAD GREAT SUCCESS ON THE APPRENTICE AND IN BUSINESS AND IT WAS GREAT, BUT THEY NEVER KNEW WHAT KIND OF JUDGE I WOULD PICK TO BE A JUSTICE. AND I SAID, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? HOW MIGHT GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. I WAS IN POLITICS NEVER. DON'T FORGET, WHEN I RAN THEY SAID, HE'S INEXPERIENCED. AND I ERADICATE SOME VERY TALENTED PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE, SOME OF WHOM I DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH. YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T LIKE SOMEONE IT LAST FOR A LONG TIME. BUT I SAID, HOW DO WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM? I DON'T KNOW. THEY JUST WON'T -- BELIEVE ME, THE APPOINTMENT OF A UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO THE VOTERS AND I THOUGHT. AND THEY ARE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WILL SET POLICY FOR 50 YEARS AND POLICY WHETHER IT IS LIFE, SECOND AMENDMENT, THE SECOND AMENDMENT -- IF I WEREN'T PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW THE PRESSURE. YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD BE OBLITERATED. IT WOULD BE GONE BUT AT A MINIMUM OBLITERATED. THEY HAVEN'T TOUCHED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. I AM A BLOCKING FORCE. I AM LIKE A LINEMAN FOR THE PITTSBURGH'S DEALERS. I AM A BLOCKING FORCE. THEY HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT. BUT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL. I NEVER KNEW THAT WITH THE SUPREME COURT, YOU KNOW ABOUT OTHER JUDGES -- BY THE WAY, AT THE END OF THE FIRST TERM WE WILL BE CLOSE TO 300 FEDERAL JUDGES INCLUDING -- WHICH I THINK IS A RECORD, THAT IS A LOT. THAT IS A LOT, NOBODY IS DONE THAT. AND THINK OF THAT, THINK OF THAT 300. THAT IS A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THE ENTIRE JUDICIARY. THINK OF THAT, 300. MANY MANY COURT OF APPEALS JUDGES. TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO GET A THIRD. CAN YOU IMAGINE? CAN YOU IMAGINE OUR ENEMIES? THREE-IN-ONE TERM. SO MANY PRESIDENTS JUST DON'T HAVE THE CHANCE AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT. I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME, WHAT I'LL DO IS MAKE UP A LIST OF 25 JUDGES. OR PEOPLE. AND WE WILL TELL THEM, I WILL ONLY PICK FROM THAT LIST, AND THEY SAID THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN INTERESTING IDEA. THIS WAS MY IDEA, WHEN YOU'VE NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IMAGINATION. I GOT OUT MY LIST AND I NAMED THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE THAT I SAID, AND I PROMISE THAT I WILL PICK SOMEONE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS LIST. AND IT DIDN'T WORK. IT WENT NOWHERE. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TRUST IT. THEY SAID, WE WANT YOU TO PICK THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST, NOT SOMEBODY LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST. I WENT BACK AND SAID I WILL PICK SOMEBODY THAT IS ON THIS LIST. AND THEY WERE ALL GREAT, GREAT JUDGES FOR THE MOST PART. ALMOST ENTIRELY. BUT JUDGES, AND REALLY RESPECTED, CONSERVATIVE BELIEVERS IN OUR COUNTRY. SOLID, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND AS SOON AS I DID THAT, THINGS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF. IT'S AMAZING HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. BY THE WAY, WOULD HE STAND UP WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL JACKET, I LOVE THAT JACKET. HOW MANY TIMES -- HOW MANY EVENTS. HE'S BEEN TO A COUPLE. THAT'S REALLY GREAT, THANK YOU LCBO IT'S BEFORE, HE'S BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES. THANK YOU, MAN. THAT REALLY NICE. I'M GOING TO GET ONE OF THOSE JACKETS. BY THE WAY, AND YOU KNOW THE WALL, THE WALL, HE HAS 330 MILES. 330 MILES. 330 MILES. 330 MILES. AND, YES, WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO, AND THEY KEEP SAYING, YES -- FIRST, THEY SAID THE NEVER BE ABLE TO BUILD IT BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WERE JUST BRUTAL. I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. I SAID IT LAST NIGHT, I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUILD -- THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME ANY MONEY IN THE WORLD, THEY SAID THAT AND WE WON. WE WON COURT CASES. WE WANT THE COURT CASE. IN FACT, I WON SO MUCH MONEY THAT WE COULD BUILD FOUR WALLS IF WE WANTED. THEN THEY SAID, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WE ARE UP TO 330. THE EXACT WALLS, I SAID TO THE BORDER PATROL THAT I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. I SAID GIVE ME OR DREAM WALL, AS LONG AS WE ARE BUILDING THAT, WE SHOULD BUILD THE WALL THAT YOU WANT, LET'S BUILD IT RIGHT. SO, WE HAVE THAT VISION. WE NEED STEEL AND CONCRETE, I SAID HOW ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER? THEY SAID NO, WE NEED STEEL AND CONCRETE. STEEL AND INSIDE THOSE POLLS, WE HAVE BARR AND CONCRETE, AND THE 30 FEET TALL. WE DID ALL SORTS OF THINGS. WE NEED THEM TO BE WIRED. I WON'T TELL YOU WHY THEY'RE WIRED, BUT THEY'RE WIRED FOR A REASON. THEY'RE ALL WIRED UP. AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE GOT THE WALL, NOBODY ELSE COULD'VE DONE IT. SO ONCE WE HAD THE BALL AND IT STARTED GOING UP AND THEN WE HIT 100 MILES, 200 MILES, NOW WE'RE AT 330. WE ARE BUILDING TEN MILES A WEEK. AND IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON. AND WE HAVE THE MOST SECURE OUR BORDER IN TERMS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING, TRAFFICKING COMING ALONG, AND WE HAVE DONE PHENOMENALLY WELL. THAT'S A LOT OF THE TERRITORY THAT WE NEED. WE WILL GO UP TO ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OVER 500 MILES. WE'RE AT 3:30. ONCE THIS SAW THAT I HAD IT THEY SAID, YES, BUT MEXICO IS NOT PAYING FOR IT. OKAY. BUT THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT. MEXICO IS PAYING FOR IT, THEY'RE PAYING AT THE BORDER. THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE WALL. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE TRUCKS TO GO BACK AND FORTH? THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE WALL. SO THE DEMOCRATS SAY, YEAH -- THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING, RIGHT? AND YOU REMEMBER WHAT I USED TO SAY? THAT IF THEY FIGHT US -- REMEMBER PETE WOULD SAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO DEFY YOU ON THE WALL, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY FIGHT YOU ON THE WALL? I SAID THE BOMB WE GET TEN FEET TALL OR, DO YOU REMEMBER? LOOK A LITTLE HIT ON THAT, TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A HIT, BUT THAT IS OKAY. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET UP TO THE TOP AND LOOK DOWN, THEY SAY HOW DO WE GET DOWN? IT'S TALL AND IT IS STRONG AND IT IS GREAT. AND WE APPRECIATE IT. MEXICO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US VERY CLOSELY. THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW 27,000 MEXICAN SOLDIERS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT COME INTO OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. VERY HELPFUL. I MADE THIS LIST OF POTENTIAL JUSTICES AND I'LL TELL YOU IT ALL CHANGED. NOW I'M ASKING SLEEPY JOE BIDEN TO GIVE ME A LIST, AND HE DOES NOT WANT TO DO IT. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY PUT SUPER RADICAL LEFT JUDGES ON. PEOPLE THAT WOULD DESTROY YOUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE THAT WOULD DESTROY YOUR COUNTRY. AND HE KNOWS THAT. HE'S NOT ELECTABLE -- HE SHOULDN'T BE ELECTABLE ANYWAY. HE'S THE WORST CANDIDATE. YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS TODAY? THERE'S A THING CALLED THE LID. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR? WE PUT OUT A LID TODAY EARLY IN THE MORNING, LIP MEANS HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYWHERE TODAY. I'M WORKING OFF, I'M IN OHIO, I'M IN TEXAS, I'M IN FLORIDA, I'M IN MICHIGAN. I'M IN WISCONSIN. THAT'S A NICE. WELL, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ONE OF THE FAKE NEWS REPORT ASPECT DAY, THEY SAID THEY NEVER HEARD OF THAT. THERE'S A CHANT THAT'S GOING UP, ELASTICS OR SEVEN RALLIES SAYING WE LOVE YOU. THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE A POLITICIAN BEFORE. I DON'T WANT TO BE A POLITICIAN. I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS A POLITICIAN, BUT IT REALLY IS. I APPRECIATE IT. AND I'VE NEVER HEARD IT, I LIKE RONALD REAGAN BUT THEY NEVER SAID WE LOVE YOU. MAYBE THEY DID, WILL TRY TO FIND OUT AND THEN THEY WILL SAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP LIED LAST NIGHT BECAUSE 40 YEARS AGO I REMEMBER, BUT NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. AND I APPRECIATE IT. IT IS RECIPROCAL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RECIPROCAL. RECIPROCAL LOVE. I HAD SUCH A NICE LIFE BEFORE AND I HAVE TO WITCH HUNT THAT GOES ON FOREVER. AND THEN WE CATCH THEM SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN, HOW ABOUT THAT? LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PICK DEAL? AND THEN THE GUYS THAT WERE DOING THE INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVE 31 DIFFERENT PHONES. THEY WERE ACCIDENTALLY WIPED CLEAN. 31 DIFFERENT PHONES, I THINK IT WAS 19 DIFFERENT PEOPLE? AND THEY ALL DID THE SAME EXACT ACCIDENT, WHICH IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ACCIDENTS, IT'S ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO DO IT ONCE, LET ALONE 31 DIFFERENT TIMES. SO WE CAUGHT THEM AND THAT IS CALLED OBSTRUCTION. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT CALLED OBSTRUCTION. THAT WAS THE MUELLER GROUP. THAT WAS THE MUELLER GROUP. ALL THOSE PHONES, THEY WERE WIPED SUDDENLY CLEAN. AND HILLARY GOT A SUBPOENA ON THE -- I SAID FORGET ABOUT THESE THINGS. YOU'LL FIND THEM, THEY'RE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THEY'RE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. BUT THEY WILL GET THEM. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 33,000. THEY HAVE A REQUEST FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT'S NOT BAD. THE U.S. CONGRESS, THEY WANT TO SEND A SUBPOENA. VERY IMPORTANT. AFTER GETTING THE SUBPOENA, SHE DELETED ALL OF HER EMAILS AND ACID WASHED, AND THEN SHE TOOK TELEPHONES. I'VE GOT RID OF PHONES TO, I THREW THEM AWAY, RIGHT? SHE TOOK CAMERAS AND SHE BEAT THEM WITH A HAMMER. AND THEN THREW THEM AWAY. AND THEY FOUND A COUPLE OF THEM. SHE WAS VERY ANGRY, OBVIOUSLY. IF SHE DID THE HAMMER WORK. BUT IF ANYONE ELSE DID THIS THERE'S A PROTECTION. THERE IS A DUAL LEVEL OF JUSTICE, AND WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. IT'S NOT FAIR TO US, NOT FAIR TO US. SHE DELIGHTED THEM ON THE BASIS -- 33,000 EMAILS. SHE DELETED HIM ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING, CHELSEA. AND ALSO YOGA CLASSES. 33,000 EMAILS ON YOGA AND A WEDDING? I DON'T THINK SO. AND COMEY SAID, OH, THAT'S OKAY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD REASON. THAT'S COMEY, THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY, THAT COMEY. BUT WE CAUGHT HIM. WE CAUGHT HIM. VERY SMART MOVE, GETTING RID OF THAT GUY WAS A SMART MOVE. BUT WE CAUGHT HIM. LISTEN, WE CAUGHT HIM. THEY WERE SPYING ON THE CAMPAIGN, THEY WERE DOING ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THAT, BUT NOBODY HAS EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SO WE CAUGHT HIM COLD, WE GOT SO MUCH. REMEMBER THE INSURANCE POLICY, RIGHT? FROM SHRUNKEN PAGE, TWO LOVERS. REMEMBER, THEY WERE VERY SMART. THEY WOULD USE THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND SEND IT OVER THE PUBLIC WIRES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE CAUGHT HAVING AN AFFAIR, SO THEY WENT OVER THE PUBLIC. THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING FOR US, WASN'T IT? DARLING, DARLING, DARLING. PLEASE. SHE'S GOING TO WIN. SHE'S GOING TO WIN. PETER, ONLY YOU CAN SAVE US. PETER, SHE'S GOING TO WIN. I KNOW 100,000 TO NOTHING. REMEMBER THAT? ACTUALLY, IT WAS 100 MILLION TO ONE. THIS WAS 100 MILLION TO ONE. SO LISTEN, DARLING, PLEASE. TELL ME AGAIN? 100 MILLION TO ONE. SHE IS GOING TO WIN. BUT JUST IN CASE SHE DOES NOT, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. THAT ONLY MEANS ONE THING, AND WE WENT THROUGH THE INSURANCE POLICY, AND WE CAUGHT THEM. SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE TREASONOUS CROOKS, THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE AND THEY PUT OUR NATION THROUGH TURMOIL. I JUST WANT TO THANK -- A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VERY UNFAIRLY TREATED. LOOK AT GENERAL FLYNN. HE'S STILL GONE. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UNFAIRLY TREATED BY A BUNCH OF TREASONOUS, HORRIBLE PEOPLE. AND THEY USED THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OF OUR COUNTRY TO TRY TO STEAL AN ELECTION, AND TO TRY TO DO A COUP, WHEN YOU THINK. WHO WOULD EVER THINK THIS COUNTRY, THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY? SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY. NO, TAKE A LOOK AT THE RECORDS. SO FOR ME IT'S A VERY EXCITING THING, BECAUSE WE FOUND SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WOULD'VE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. NOW, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT WE HAVE BEEN COLD. A SPY ON OUR CAMPAIGN. IT IS OUR CAMPAIGN. AND IF YOU WANT TO SAVE AMERICA, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT, GET OUT AND VOTE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION, AND IN JUST THREE AND A HALF YEARS, WE'VE SECURED AMERICA'S BORDERS, WHICH MAKES THEM VERY UNHAPPY. WE BUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF THE U.S. MILITARY. WE BUILT THE MILITARY. IT WAS TOTALLY DEPLETED WHEN I TOOK OVER. WE BUILT A MILITARY, TWO AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPENT. ALL MADE IN THE USA, THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT, THE GREATEST PLANES AND ROCKETS AND I HATE TO EVEN MENTION THE WORD BUT I HOPE TO GOD THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT, BUT WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND WE DID THAT OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WEAPONS THAT WERE SO POWERFUL, THAT WERE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. I NEVER WANT TO USE THOSE WEAPONS, AND THE WAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE USE THEM IS WHEN YOU HAVE THEM, BUT NO ONE HAS EVER BUILT A FORCE LIKE WE HAVE. AND THE PRESS AND THE FAKE NEWS THAT HE GAVE WAY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. NO, A LUCKY RIGHT IN THE -- FIRST OF ALL, I'M ALLOWED TO DO IT. I'M THE PRESIDENT. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT IS ALLOWED, BUT I DID NOT GIVE A WAY, MOST POWERFUL WEAPONS EVER PRODUCED WE HAVE, AND OTHER COUNTRIES KNOW THAT, AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THEY KNOW IT, AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE WILL EVER BE USING THEM, AND I HOPE THAT WE DON'T. HELP TO GOD. I USED THE WORD GOT BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO USE THE WORD GOD IN THEIR PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, RIGHT? I HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE THAT. BUT I OBLITERATED THE ISIS CALIPHATE, WHICH WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE GOT DOWN TO 99%. EVERYONE IS COMING BACK HOME, LONG, LONG WARS. NEVER ENDING WARS. IN LESS WARS. WE FIXED OUR DISASTROUS TRADE DEALS, THEY WERE A DISASTER, BROUGHT JOBS AND FACTORIES BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA, UNDER 16 YEARS AND THINK OF THIS. THINK OF THIS. FOR 16 YEARS PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT BUSH, HOUSEHOLD INCOME ROSE. 295,000 DOLLARS. THAT'S OVER A 16-YEAR PERIOD. IN THREE YEARS, YOUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ROSE ALMOST 10,000 DOLLARS WHEN YOU INCLUDE ENERGY. YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE ENERGY. ALMOST 7000 DOLLARS. HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR YOUR GASOLINE? THEY GO UP, IT IS LESS. NOW, IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. WHAT IS IT NOWADAYS? TELL ME. I DON'T HAVE A GAS. I HAVEN'T STOPPED RECENTLY AT A GAS STATION. 15? FOR A WHILE IT WAS WAY UNDER TWO, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THERE. WE HAVE SO MUCH. WE HAVE SO MUCH. IN MY FIRST THREE YEARS, WE LIFTED 3.6 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, THE LARGEST POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BY FAR. WE BUILT THE LATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. I SEE ALL THESE HATS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND NOW I WILL SAY THIS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN. WE SAVED 1.4 MILLION JOBS IN PENNSYLVANIA ALONE. AND TO FIGHT THE CHINA VIRUS -- IT'S THE CHINA VIRUS. IT'S NOT THE CORONAVIRUS. CORONA SOUNDS LIKE A PLACE IN ITALY, A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN ITALY. IT'S CORONA. NO, IT'S THE CHINA VIRUS. THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. YOU ALWAYS NOTICE THAT THEY'RE GOING AFTER RUSSIA. LOOK, NO ONE HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN ME. RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA! I SAY, WHAT ABOUT CHINA? THEY NEVER WANT TO MENTION THAT. LITTLE DEALS GOING ON, I THINK. BUT CORONAVIRUS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ITALY, A BEAUTIFUL VILLA. A CORONA? NO, IT'S THE CHINA VIRUS. THEY SHOULD'VE STOPPED IT. TO FIGHT THE CHINA VIRUS WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE DID AN A+ JOB, EXCEPT WE DID A D JOB IN TERMS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AND EXPLAINING IT. WE WERE TOO BUSY DOING IT, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN IT ANYWAY. DIDN'T MATTER TO THEM. THAT'S A LITTLE THING. WE HAVE TO WATCH BIDEN? YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING SO HE GETS UP, THE CORONAVIRUS, THEY SAY WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TODAY. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT THE CORONAVIRUS, AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WE DID A GREAT JOB. I SHOULD HAVE OPENED -- HE SAID I SHOULD'VE SHUT DOWN ONE WEEK EARLIER. BUT HE DOESN'T SAY THAT HE DID THE WORST JOB IN THE HISTORY OF AN EPIDEMIC OR A PANDEMIC WITH THE SWINE FLU. IT WAS A JOKE. AND WHAT HE DID, WHAT HE DID, HIS OWN MAN THAT WAS IN CHARGE SAID RECENTLY, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH. IT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER. THERE WERE AMATEURS AND NOW HE TELLS US HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS FAR MORE LETHAL. BUT HE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE CLOSED ONE WEEK EARLIER, EXCEPT WHEN IT CAME TO CLOSING THE BORDER, WHICH I DID, WHICH TURNED OUT TO SAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES, BIDEN CRITICIZED ME UNTIL TWO MONTHS LATER WHEN HE SAYS I WAS RIGHT. BUT WE SHOULD'VE CLOSED A WEEK EARLIER. THINK OF THAT. WE PIONEERED LIFESAVING THERAPIES, REDUCING THE FATALITY RATE 85% SINCE APRIL. THINK OF THAT. REMDESIVIR, THE PLASMA. WE HAVE AMONG THE LOWEST CASE FATALITY RATE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY, NOBODY KNOWS THAT. AND I'M DEVASTATED TO SEE IT HAPPENING, BUT YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE AGAIN. THEY ALWAYS SAID, OKAY, EUROPE IS DOING BETTER. ACTUALLY, WE DID BETTER. BUT NOW EUROPE HAS A BIG SPIKE, A BIG SPIKE. SO THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZED VIRUS PATIENTS IS DOWN BY 47%. AND A VIRUS PATIENTS COMING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS DOWN, AND VISITS OUR WAY. DOWN VISITS TO HOSPITAL. EUROPE IS ALMOST A 50% GREATER ACCESS MORTALITY RATE THAN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW, THE ELECT TO COMPARED TO EUROPE, 50% GREATER ACCESS MORTALITY RATE. OUR EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE ACTS AND SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES THROUGH OPERATION WARP SPEED, YOU HEARD ABOUT IT? THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT. IT WHAT WE'VE DONE A RECORD PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE VENTILATORS AND NOW WE ARE BUILDING VENTILATORS IN THE WORLD, THEY WILL DISTRIBUTE A VACCINE IN RECORD TIME AND IT WILL BE THREE OR FOUR YEARS IF BIDEN HAD DONE IT, BUT WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE FDA AND CLEARING A PATH. YOU WILL BE SEEING IT VERY SHORTLY. THESE ARE GREAT COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING IT. WE WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS AND OUR OPPONENTS WILL, WITH HIM, THEY WILL CRUSH AMERICA. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. THIS COUNTRY IS TOO GREAT. OUR LOVE EACH OTHER IS TOO GREAT. THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW HE IS ALIVE, I MEAN, HE REALLY DOESN'T. HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS ALIVE. HE DID AN AD ON AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE THAT SAID ME MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT MILITARY SOLDIERS THAT DIED, AND IT WAS TOUGH DISGUSTING THING. I SAID, THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS NOW I CAN TAKE THE GLOVES OFF. THIS GUY DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. AND THEY WILL GIVE HIM A SHOT OF SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW, I JUST WANT TO THINK THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, A MAN THAT HELPED -- WE JUST NEGOTIATED A MAJOR PEACE DEAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST. EVERYONE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. YOU KNOW THAT? THEY SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'VE BEEN KILLING EVERYBODY FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THEY HAD THIS GUY, JOHN KERRY, WHO WAS GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. THEY PAID 150 BILLION DOLLARS TO IRAN. THEY PAID 1.8 BILLION IN CASH, THAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE. IN CASH. AND THAT'S JOHN KERRY. AND WE JUST MADE A DEAL WITH BAHRAIN AND UAE, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, AND ISRAEL. IT'S A GREAT THING. THE MAN RIGHT THERE, JARED? THE ABUSE HE TAKES, WHEN HE DID SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO. AND HE WANTS NONE OF THE GLORY. HE'D RATHER NOT COME UP HERE. THESE GUYS WILL COME UP 100%, BUT, JARED, GREAT DEAL. GREAT JOB, INCREDIBLE. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THERE IS NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. OKAY, THANKS. THANK YOU. GREAT PEOPLE. THANK YOU, SEAN. THANK YOU, SEAN. WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE DAMAGE THAT JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE LAST 40. SO THEY LIKE SHAWN. SEAN, WILL YOU PLEASE WIN? SEAN PAR NOW. I'LL TELL YOU, HE IS POPULAR. THAT'S GREAT, SHAWN. WE LOVE SEAN. BUT BIDEN CHAMPIONED EVERY GLOBALIST TRAIL OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR HALF A CENTURY, HE WAS A CHEERLEADER FOR THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY, NAFTA. AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH BUILT CHINA LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. THEY WERE FLATLINE FOR MANY DECADES, AND THEN RIGHT THROUGH THE ROOF. THAT WAS A BIDEN APPROVAL TO. THESE DISASTERS RIPPED OUT ONE THIRD OF YOUR STATES MANUFACTURING JOBS. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? BIDEN, YOU SHOULD NOT BE ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE, YOU SHOULD BE BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS. HE DID A TERRIBLE JOB. NOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS PLEDGING TO REJOIN THE DISASTROUS PARIS CLIMATE ACCORDS. YOU WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOTHING? IF THIS READING YOUR STATE'S ECONOMY. YOU WILL SPEND A TRILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT IT IS, IT REALLY TAKES AWAY YOUR POWER. IT TAKES AWAY YOUR ENERGY. YOU WILL BE CLOSING YOUR PLANTS AND FACTORIES ALL OVER THE PLACE. I WITHDREW FROM IT -- YOU KNOW WHAT? THE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND, THE SMART PEOPLE, THEY SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT. I THINK WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY KILLED ON THIS ONE, AND I'M SO PROUD I DID IT. AND PEOPLE GET IT. IT WAS A RIP OFF OF THE UNITED STATES. I WITHDREW FROM THE CATASTROPHE BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR PITTSBURGH, NOT FOR PARIS. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA AND CHINA. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS. WHEN WE WIN, PENNSYLVANIA WINS AND AMERICA WINS. FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS SPEND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS THAT NEVER ENDED AND DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS. NOW, WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES. AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME IN THE USA WHERE THEY BELONG. THEY ARE ALL COMING HOME. DURING THE PANDEMIC, I HAVE SUSPENDED THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN WORKERS WHO THREATEN AMERICAN JOBS AS OUR ECONOMY REOPENS, I WANT TO ENSURE THAT AMERICANS ARE FIRST IN LINE TO GET TO HIGH JOBS AND HIGH WAGES. AMERICA FIRST. BIDEN WANTS TO FLOOD THE ECONOMY WITH CHEAP LABOR TO REPLACE U.S. WORKERS. YOU KNOW THAT. AND THAT IS WHY NEVER, NEVER -- HE SAYS HIGHER AMERICAN. ALL THE WORDS HE GOT, THEY ARE MY WORDS. DID YOU EVER SEE THAT? THEY SAY, HE COPIED MY CAMPAIGN. I KEEP SAYING WHAT HAPPENED FOR 47 YEARS, AND NOW HE'S COPYING MY CAMPAIGN? AS PRESIDENT AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH HIM -- AS PRESIDENT, MY FIRST DUTY IS ALWAYS TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, THE AMERICAN WORKER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN U.S. HISTORY AND WE ARE FINISHING THAT WALL. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE SO FAST. IT'S GOING TO BE DONE SO FAST. SINCE 2017, ISIS SUCCESSFULLY ARRESTED A LEGAL ALIENS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS, INCLUDING OVER 145,000 ASSAULTS. 40,000 SEX OFFENDERS AND 5000 MURDERS. IF YOU DON'T MIND DEMOCRATS, WILL BRING THEM OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE'LL GET THEM OUT. SOME OF THEM ARE SO VIOLENT WE, DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM FOR 2 MILLION YEARS, BUT THEY COME BACK IN AS MUCH AS WE WATCH. THEY COME BACK, AND YOU DON'T WANT IT. THEY KEEP THEM THERE. THE LEFT GAINS POWER, THEY WILL ABOLISH -- THEY CAN ABOLISH. THE REPUBLICANS WILL STAND WITH THESE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF ICE AND BORDER PATROL. WE HAVE TO SEE THESE ISIS PEOPLE. THEY GO INTO A DIN OF MS 13, THEY GO INTO A DEN WHERE YOU HAVE THESE GUYS THAT ARE VICIOUS GANG MEMBERS. AND THEY GO IN THERE AND START SWINGING, THEY LOVE IT. WHO WANTS THAT JOB? DO YOU WANT THAT JOB? HE'S A TOUGH GUY SITTING HERE. YOU TOO. YOU TOUGH GUYS, YOU DON'T PART OF IT. THEY'RE INCREDIBLE, AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE TOO ROUGH, WELL YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD SOME OF THESE GANGS ARE. WHAT THEY DO. THE EUTHANIZED BECAUSE IT'S MORE PAINFUL. THEY CUT PEOPLE UP, THEY CUT TWO YOUNG BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. 16 YEARS OLD, GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL. THEY CUT THEM TO PIECES. KILLED THEM. THEY ARE ANIMALS. WE INVESTED 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE U.S. MILITARY AND LAUNCHED THE FIRST NEW BRAND TO THE U.S. ARMED FORCES IN 75 YEARS, SPACE FORCE. NOT SINCE THE AIR FORCE. THINK OF IT, THE AIR FORCE WAS LAST. IF I DID JUST THAT, THE SPACE FORCE, BIG DEAL. IT COULD END UP BEING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU'VE NEVER IMAGINED, BUT IF I JUST DID THAT, THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE U.S. MILITARY, THAT'S A BIG DEAL. THAT'S ONE OF MANY THINGS. WE PASSED THE A CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNTABILITY. WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI. THEY WERE AFTER HIM FOR YEARS. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND THE MASS MURDER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND MANY OTHERS, QASSEM SOLEIMANI. HE'S GONE. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TO DISASTERS, IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. ONE OF THE GREAT DISASTERS. IT PRACTICALLY EXPIRED. AND HIS CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, HE NEVER LEFT. I WANT THIS, NO, WE'RE NOT GIVING IT. OKAY, LET'S GO TO THE NEXT THING. GIVE ME THE, SNOW. GIVE ME THE, SNOW. GIVE ME THIS, NO. HE NEVER WON A POINT AND THE ONLY TIME HE LEFT THE TABLE WAS TO GO ON A BICYCLE RIDE, AND HE CRASHED AND BROKE HIS LEG AND ARM. I PROMISED EVERYONE I WOULD NEVER GO RIDING ON A BICYCLE. I SWEAR TO YOU. I KEPT MY PROMISE, I RECOGNIZED THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPEN TO THE AMERICAN IS EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. I ALSO RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. THAT WAS A 52 YEAR DEVELOPMENT THAT I GOT DOWN AND ABOUT ONE DAY. THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING THAT SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, I GOT IT DONE IMMEDIATELY. 52 YEARS THEY WORKED ON THAT. INSTEAD OF ENDLESS WAR, WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S SO GREAT. PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BIDEN HAS PUT FORWARD A PLATFORM THAT WOULD END AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT. AND THIS IS TRUE. I DON'T THINK OF HIM AS A RADICAL LEFTY, BUT HE IS CONTROLLED BY THEM. AND WHAT ABOUT THIS KAMALA? HOW ABOUT THAT? SHE'S A 15%, NO 13%. NO, SHE'S AT 12. NO, SHE'S AT TEN. NO, SHE'S AT NINE. NO, SHE'S AT SEVEN. THESE ARE HER POLL NUMBERS. SHE GOT WORSE AND WORSE. SHE QUIT BEFORE SHE EVER GOT TO IOWA. PLUS, NOBODY, INCLUDING POCAHONTAS TREATED BIDEN SO BADLY. CALLED HIM A RACIST, RIGHT? BROUGHT HIM INTO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, RIGHT? MADE HIM A MEMBER OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. THE THINGS SHE SAID -- AND I BRILLIANTLY SAID, WELL, THE ONE PERSON HE CAN'T CHOOSE IS KAMALA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE TO PICK KAMALA. AND SHE HAS RAIDED MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE. YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S NUMBER TWO. BELIEVE IT OR NOT. IT'S A TRUE STORY. SHE IS RATED THE MOST LIBERAL PERSON IN CONGRESS, AND I THINK SHE IS GROSSLY INCOMPETENT, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS. AND WE HAVE A GRACE VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. HE'S GREAT. IF ELECTED, BIDEN WOULD DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY AND DESTROY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. DRAIN YOUR MEDICARE BY GIVING AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THERE ARE GOING TO COME IN. IF YOU HAVE THAT, THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOUR HEALTH CARE -- THERE ARE GOING TO POUR INTO THE UNITED STATES, AND OUR COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD IT. WE WANT TO BE NICE. WE ALL HAVE HEARTS. THE COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD IT. THEY COULD GET PEOPLE THAT NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING, IF THEY SAW THAT. THEY WOULD END OUR TRAVEL BANS ON JIHADIST A REGIONS. REMEMBER, I HAD TRAVEL BANS. EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON. HE'S SUCH A TERRIBLE PERSON. I'M SUCH A BAD GUY. I INCREASED REFUGEE ADMISSIONS BY MORE THAN 700%, OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. BANNED A SCHOOL CHOICE AND ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS, THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

Thank you very much. This mi lestone u nderscores or historic partnerships acr oss Latin America. On April 17th , 1961 the 1400 Cuban exi les off Brig ade 25 06 land ed at the Bay o f Picks. They we re met by f ierce airstrike s by heavy fi re, very, very heavy and 20,000 soldiers from t he Cast ro regime. Thes brave warrio rs fought t hree gruel ing days . The brut al Castro regime impr isoned them for 20 month s until the Uni ted St ates negoti ated their release. Today we're prof oundly honor ed by the ir pre sence. We're joined by thes e 20 inc redible Veterans Bri gade 25 06 and their famil ies. Could I ask yo u to stand please? B ecause that's a fter That's rea lly good. You're loo king good, too. Looking g ood. Oh, that's grea t. Good looking pe ople in Cuba. That's a goo d looking group. I apprecia te you being here. This is treme ndous. It's an hon or. You've bee n honoring me for four years, and now I'm honoring you, and that's a nice way to do it. Wel l, thank you very much. Now we re ally appreciate it. We wi ll honor your courage with my administration' s dete rmination to defea t communism and so cialism. And we will do that in our own cou ntry t o. We're in the process of doin g it right now. And i t has stepp ed, in my opinio n, beyond the word soci alism, and we are mee ting it with gre at force. M y administration stands with ev ery c itizen of Cub a, Nic aragua and Venezu ela in their fight f or libert y. And we work for the day when this will be come a fully free h emisphere and i t w ill be for the first time in human his tory, a f ully free hemisphere. And we will have it . We will hav e it. And it's g onn a happ en. Gonna hap pen soo ner rather than later. A lot of things were go ing on . A lot of thi ngs are going on right now that I can't tell you about , but I wi ll be soon. The Obam a Biden admini stration made a weak, pat hetic, one sided de al with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban peopl e and en rich the Communist regime . I canceled the Obam a Bide n sell out to th e Castro regime. I'm g onna hold it. W e will not lift sanc tions un til all politica l pr isoners are freed. Fr eedoms o f assemb ly and expression or respected. Al l political parties a re legalized an d free elections are schedu led. They wil l have to g o through a lot, but thing s were h appening and it's ver y int eres ting to see the lev el at which th ey're ha ppening. Ea rlier this yea r, we also de manded the relea se of human r ights activ ists Jose Daniel Ferrer and t hank goodne ss today is part of our continuing fig ht agai nst Commun ist dep ression. I am an nounci ng that the T reasury Depa rtm ent will p ro hibit US travelers from staying at pr opertie s owned by the C uban government. We're also further r estricting the importati on of C uban alcohol and Cuban tob acco. These a ctions will ensure th at U. S. Dollars do n ot fund the Cuba n regime and go dire ctly to the Cuban people. Big difference. Big differenc e, really. We're also imposing s trict sancti ons on th e Dictato rships of Nicaragua and Venezuela. We brought criminal charges against Maduro fo r his na rco terroris m. The cour ageous v eterans h ere tod ay b ear witness to how socialism radical mobs and violent Communis ts ruin a nation. Now the Democrat Party i s unleashing sociali sm right within our o wn beautiful country. To day we proclai med that America will n ever be a social ist or com munist country, and I'm gonna add that way the first time I've ev er sai d that I 've never added the other word, but I think it' s appropriate, Mike, wh en you look at what the k ind of ideology were also facing. When you s ee the rid ers, looters, an archists and then yo u see the press, th e media play right into their hands. It's so sad to s ee the media the w ay they'r e being us ed. The med ia is b eing used like fools. They 're b eing used, and it' s very sad to wa tch, but we will preva il. It's first time I've sai d that socialism and communism we did not fight ty ranny abroad. O nley toe. Let Marxist destroy o ur beloved country. Together we will defend our freedo m in our American way o f li fe, and we will defend it s trongly and successfully as we've been doing. And as we celeb rate Hispanic Heri tage Month, we give than ks to the cou ntless wa ys that Hi spanic Americans uplift and ins pire our nation. They've been so g ood to me, and I must tell you tha t the big story i s the poll numbers. Trump has gone through the roof with the poll numb ers from Hispanics. They're all talking about it. I just watch so mething and re ad a couple of articles and they don't know what's hap pening. I guess they did n't know I love you, but I do . They're incredibl e people, incredi ble people. They knew it, but they 're all shocked has i t been a tim e when something like this h as happened? Nea rly 60 0 Hispan ic A mericans s ervas police offic ers More than 300,000 His panic Americans serve in the m ilitary. Over half of the Border Pa trol agents are Hispa nic, and they'r e incredible . I've gotten to know so many of them. They're in credib le. More than th re e million Hispanic owned small busin esses provide job s for millions o f Amer icans. They're fabulous business people. Hi span ic Americans t each their Child ren to love our cou ntry, honor our history and res pect our great A merican flag. Hispan ic Americans embody the American drea m, and my administ ration is delivering f or you that American dream like nobody has ever delivered for the Hi spanic Americans and hopefully for everybody else. We implemented t he historic tax cuts, regulation cuts, and I rece ntly created t he Hispanic Pr osperity Initiat ive to expand economic op portuni ty. Before the Chi na virus, we achiev ed the low est Hispanic American u nemployment rate ever recorded in our in our country. I m ean, like, it's not ev en close . Last year, Hi spanic American pove rty reached an all time low. We built the greatest economy i n history and now we're d oing it again. We closed it up. We saved millions a nd millions of lives. And now we opened it up and you've been hearing about the V. We have a V. We may have a super V and it's c oming back fast. We 're gonna have a ver y good third quarter that will be a nnounced just prior t o the election. So I 'm putti ng myself at ris k when I sa y that, because if it's not good, you can imagine they'll be playing what I just said. The y won't say that I' m here representing the Hi spanic Americans or Cuban s or an ything el se is just sa y, Look what he said. But I'm w illing to take th at chance. We're gonna have a great third qu arter and next year is going to be one o f the greatest economic yea rs we've eve r had. We feel very confident ba sed on everything we In the last four months, 3.3 million Hispan ic Americans we re hir ed to fill new job s, a record. I've ta ken bold action to de fend the ri ght t o religious liberty and the right to life. We're protecting school choice for over one million Hispanic American students. Such a big deal in the second term. I will provide school choice to every family in America. We want every American to have a limitless future here with us today is Bay of Pigs veteran Umberto Cortina Prison set up. Come on.

THEY ARE A DISASTER. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. LOOK AT PORTLAND COMMIT HOW BAD IS THAT? I WILL SAY LAST NIGHT IN KENTUCKY, I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR. HE PULLED OUT HIS NATIONAL GUARD AND I GIVE HIM CREDIT. MOSTLY THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I SAID, LET US SEND THE NATIONAL GUARD. I DID IT REMEMBER , MINNESOTA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND A SODA. I DID IT IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. THEY WERE HAVING A HARD TIME. TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN WE WANTED, BUT WE GOT WHAT WE WANTED. THEY FORMED A LINE, THAT WAS THE HARD PART. THEY WERE NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCED , THEY WERE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. THEY HAD 250 THOUSAND DOLLAR UNIFORMS. MORE STUFF IN THEIR HEAD. COMPUTERS, INFRARED GOGGLES. THEY HAD EVERYTHING. THEY WALKED FORWARD WITH THEIR CANISTERS OF TEAR GAS AND PEPPER SPRAY. REMEMBER THE CNN REPORTER? HE GOT HIT IN THE KNEE WITH A CAN OF WHAT? THAT IS RIGHT. HE SAID, I AM DOWN. HE WAS DOWN. I FEEL BADLY FOR HIM, HE WENT DOWN. HE WAS STANDING. HE WAS SAYING, THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST. IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE LOVELY PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE. HE IS DUCKING. BEHIND HIM, THE ENTIRE CITY WAS BURNING DOWN. WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IT? I DON'T GET IT. HE GOT HIT WITH A CANISTER OF TEARGAS. THEY SAY IT HURTS. THAT IS ONLY GOING 52 MILES PER HOUR. A BULLET WAS ABOUT 2000 MILES PER HOUR. THEY SAY IT HURTS. THEY CLEANED OUT THAT CITY. IN HALF AN HOUR, THEY HAD NO PROBLEMS. MINNEAPOLIS, IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM GOING TO WIN. ANOTHER IS ELON OMAR , ILYAN OMAR. SHE IS GREAT. SHE LOVES OUR COUNTRY VERY MUCH. SHE HAS TOTAL DISRESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY. I THINK SHE HAS HATRED FOR OUR COUNTRY. I WOULD SAY SHE IS A BIG REASON SHE IS , WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THEY ARE NOT TOO FOND OF HER IN MINNESOTA. I WILL FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT OF ALL CITIZENS TO LIVE IN SECURITY AND PEACE. JOE BIDEN IS WEAK AS HELL. HE SURRENDERED HIS PARTY TO FLAG BURNERS AND ANTI-POLICE RADICALS. THE DEMOCRAT PARTIES WERE IN PEACE. MY FATHER, SIT DOWN, WE WILL BE HERE. WHAT THE HELL? WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO. I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO EXCEPT RUN A COUNTRY. THE HARDEST PART ABOUT RUNNING THE COUNTRY IS DEALING WITH CRAZY DEMOCRATS. WE ARE WORKING ON STIMULUS FOR PEOPLE. IT WAS CHINA'S FAULT. WE CAN'T GET NANCY PELOSI TO APPROVE IT. SHE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. PEOPLE WANT THEIR MONEY NOW. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY'S WAR ON COPS, IT IS PUTTING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT POLICE OFFICERS IN DANGER. MY FATHER HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, FOR THE POLICE. HE SAID, LOOK AT THE COPS OUT THERE. I SAID, NEVER USE THE WORD COPS. IT IS POLICE. I HAVE A COUPLE OF ROUGH LOOKING GUYS. I ALWAYS FIND IT A LITTLE HARD. POLICE, HE THOUGHT IT WAS SLANG. I DON'T THINK THEY MIND. WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM HERE. DOES ANYBODY MIND THE TERM COPS? WHO IS THE POLICEMAN OR WOMAN? DO THEY MIND? A LOT OF THEM. A LOT OF THEM. DO THEY MIND THAT TERM COPS? NO. THEY WANT RESPECT AND THEY WANT TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOBS PROPERLY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? THAT IS WHAT I SAY. THEY SAID, WE DON'T MIND. JUST RESPECT US AND LET US DO OUR JOBS. TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WERE AMBUSHED AT CLOSE RANGE. I CALLED THEM BOTH AND THEY WERE OK BUT THEY WERE HIT. LAST NIGHT, TWO POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY. EVERY YEAR, DOZENS OF COURAGEOUS POLICE OFFICERS LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR PEOPLE THEY HAVE NEVER MET, PEOPLE THEY DO NOT KNOW. PEOPLE THEY NEVER SAW IN MOST CASES, RIGHT? THEY LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR PEOPLE THEY HAVE NEVER MET. LAW ENFORCEMENT , LET'S GIVE THEM A HAND, PLEASE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I TELL THEM ALL THE TIME, WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FROM ALL OF THEM. I TELL THEM, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOVED. YOU DO NOT GET THE TRUE STORY. THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK THERE. THAT IS A LOT OF FAKERS BACK THERE. THE PROBLEM WITH BEING ON LIVE, YOU MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A MISTAKE AND THEY SAY THIS WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. THAT IS ENOUGH OF THAT. IT IS VERY DISHONEST. IT IS A SHAME. IT DOES HURT OUR COUNTRY. THEY DO NOT SHOW THE PROTESTERS. CITIES ARE BURNING DOWN, STOREFRONTS ARE BEING EXPLODED. THEY WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING. IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PHILOSOPHY IS, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO , WOULDN'T WANT TO SHOW THE FACTS? AND THEN WE FIX IT. REPUBLICAN CITIES DON'T HAVE TROUBLE. REPUBLICAN STATES DO NOT HAVE TROUBLE. YOU GO TO DIFFERENT STATES, SOME OF THESE GOVERNORS, FRIENDS OF MINE. I HAVE FRIENDS ON BOTH SIDES. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, RED STATES, THEY LOOK LIKE, HOW IS A THING LIKE THIS POSSIBLE? BECAUSE THEY HAVE LAW AND ORDER. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER, JOE BIDEN WAS SILENT AS HIS FAR LEFT SUPPORTERS ASSAULTED POLICE OFFICERS. HARASSED CITIZEN AMERICANS AND SET FIRE TO BUILDINGS. THERE WERE RIOTERS, LOOTERS. THEY WERE ANARCHISTS. HE CALLED THEM PEACEFUL PROTESTS. HE SAID, THERE PEACEFUL PROTESTS. HE MAY BELIEVE IT. HONESTLY, HE MAY SAY THEY ARE PEACEFUL. I THINK HE BELIEVES IT. I ACTUALLY DO. IT IS THE OTHER ONES YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE THEY CALL THE SHOTS, NOT HIM. HE HAS CALLED FOR THE RIDICULOUS CUTTING OF POLICE FUNDING. ABOLISHING CASH BAIL, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT AND THE CLOSING OF OUR PRISONS. THAT IS A GOOD IDEA. HE EVEN DESCRIBES LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE ENEMY. HE HAS TAKEN IT BACK, I ASSUME. HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING BACK. HE HAS TAKEN ANTI-FRACKING BACK. BUT IT IS THE FIRST THING THEY SAY, THEY STICK WITH. BIDEN'S ANTI-POLICE CRUSADE MUST STOP. I WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF 48 SHERIFFS RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA. THREE WEEKS AGO. AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM TEXAS, ARIZONA, OHIO. MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN. PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK'S FINEST. THEY HAD NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE NATIONAL TROOPERS COALITION. CHICAGO, HOW ABOUT THAT? CHICAGO POLICE, THEY ENDORSED ME. ALL THE MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. THEY GO BACK HOME TO MOMMY, THEY SAY MOMMY, I AM SORRY. I AM SORRY. YOU KNOW THE INCREDIBLE THING ABOUT THAT? I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING EXCEPT OUR CROWD. THEY HAVE NO VOICE. THEY ARE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS, BUT THEIR LUNGS ARE VERY SMALL. I DIDN'T HEAR , ALL YOU HEAR , LIKE THIS HERE. IF YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THEM, WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST. THE HEADLINE , WE HAD ONE YOUNG PROTESTER. THE HEADLINE WILL BE, TRUMPS RALLY BROKEN UP BY PROTESTS. ONE VERY YOUNG GIRL, SHE IS A GIRL. AM I ALLOWED TO SAY A GIRL? SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT 16 YEARS OLD. HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN. 250 GENERALS AND MILITARY LEADERS. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILITARY SPOUSES HAVE GIVEN THEIR COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT TO OUR CAMPAIGN. TO UPHOLD THE LAW OF OUR LAND. AND TO UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. ON SATURDAY, I WILL BE ANNOUNCING MY NOMINEE TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE DOING IT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE ROSE GARDEN OF THE WHITE HOUSE. UNLESS IT IS RAINING IN WHICH CASE WE WILL STILL DO IT THERE. IT IS BEAUTIFUL, THE WHITE HOUSE. WE LOVE THE WHITE HOUSE, RIGHT OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE. THEY DO NOT WANT US TO DO IT. DEMOCRATS SAY, YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT READ WHY? WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME. LET ME ASK YOU ONE SIMPLE QUESTION. IF IT WAS THEM INSTEAD OF US, DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD DO IT? THIS WILL BE A VERY TALENTED PERSON. IT WILL BE A WOMAN. I AM SORRY, MAN. IT WILL BE A WOMAN. ALL RIGHT, READY? WHO WOULD RATHER SEE A MAN? THAT IS TROUBLE. TRY IT AGAIN. WHO WOULD RATHER SEE A MAN? THAT IS NOT GOOD. WHO WOULD RATHER SEE A WOMAN. [APPLAUSE] I THINK IT WOULD BE , I THINK IT WOULD TAKE TREMENDOUS COURAGE. I DON'T CARE HOW GREAT THE MAN IS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT JIM FITZGERALD , YOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF VERY UNHAPPY FACES, RIGHT? MY OPPONENT REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS LIST OF POTENTIAL JUSTICES BECAUSE THEY WILL BE HANDPICKED BY EXTREMISTS LIKE REPRESENTATIVE ALEXANDRIA OH BECAUSE YOU CORTEZ , OCASIO CORTEZ. SOMETIMES KNOWN AS AOC. ONE OF THE THREE IS OMAR. THEY WILL PICK THE FIRST. IF BIDEN DOES THAT, IF HE PUTS AN EXTREMIST INTO THAT POSITION, HE LOSES EVERYTHING THAT IS LIKE NORMAL. IF HE DOES THE OTHER WAY, HE LOSES THE LEFT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HIM PUT UP A LIST. I COULD SEE WITH THAT LIST WOULD BE. I CAN ALREADY TELL YOU THE PEOPLE ON THAT LIST. YOU WOULD NOT BE HAPPY. THAT WOULD BE THE END. IF GIVEN POWER, BIDEN AND HIS SUPPORTERS WOULD PACK THE COURT. WE HAVE WON RACES. THIS WILL BE MY THIRD. WE ARE IN GREAT SHAPE. YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? HOW UNIFIED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS? RIGHT? WE ARE UNIFIED. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SAY. THANK YOU, MET. , MITT. EVEN MITT IS ON BOARD. HAVING A UNIFIED PARTY. WHEN THEY DID THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX, WE HAD 197-ZERO. THAT IS OK. I AM NO LONGER ANGRY AT MITT BECAUSE HE IS BEING VERY NICE IN THE RIGHT THING. THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURT. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HORRIBLE. I GUESS WE COULD DO THAT, TOO, RIGHT? REMEMBER, IT WAS HARRY REID THAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE. CHUCK, EVERY TIME YOU COMPLAIN, REMEMBER, IT WAS HARRY REID. YOUR PERSON IN CHARGE. IT WAS HARRY REID WHO MADE THIS ALL POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HARRY. I HOPE YOU ARE ENJOYING YOUR EVENING. THEY BLAME ON US. HARRY REID GAVE US THE POWER, THE NEW THEIR OPTION , NUCLEAR OPTION. HE WANTS TO PACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH RADICALS WHO WILL TERMINATE THE SECOND AMENDMENT, CONFISCATE YOUR FIREARMS. STRIKE UNDER GOD FROM THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. SCARED DOWN CROSSES , TEAR DOWN CROSSES FROM PUBLIC SPACES AND FORCE TAXPAYERS TO FUND EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTIONS. THESE FAR-LEFT JUSTICES WOULD RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS, SHIELD FOREIGN TERRORISTS, IMPOSE SANCTUARY CITIES AND DECLARE THE DEATH PENALTY TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT WILL BE TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THEY WANT TO DECLARE IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR EVEN THE MOST DEPRAVED MASS MURDERERS. IT IS A TOUGH THING. THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE TODAY FOR CLEMENCY. I SAID, WHAT WAS THE CRIME? THE CRIME WAS SO HORRIBLE. I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS, BUT IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 21 YEARS OR SO. THE CRIME WAS SO HORRIBLE, THIS PERSON COMMITTED TO. I SAID, I CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT. IT WAS SO HORRIBLE. THAT IS USUALLY THE CASE. USUALLY THE CASE. LIKE THE BOSTON BOMBER. BY THE WAY, THEY WANT TO GIVE VOTES TO PRISONERS, PEOPLE IN PRISON, THEY WANT TO GIVE VOTES. WE SAID, REMEMBER, BERNIE? ONE THING ABOUT HIM. HE IS THE GREATEST LOSER I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT IS TRUE. I MEAN THAT IN A RESPECTFUL WAY. WHAT THEY DID TO HIM WITH HILLARY WAS BAD. THIS TIME WAS EVEN WORSE. ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS WARREN WOULD HAVE LEFT THE CAMPAIGN ONE DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY. WITH HER IDEOLOGY, BASICALLY. SHE IS THE RADICAL LEFT. SHE WAS REALLY FRESH. HOW BAD WAS ELIZABETH WARREN TO JOE BIDEN? THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO WAS WORSE. KAMALA. IT SHOWS YOU MY GREAT INSTINCT. HE WILL NEVER PICK KAMALA BECAUSE NO HUMAN BEING WHO HAS BEEN TREATED WORSE THAN KAMALA. SHE CALLED HIM A RACIST? SHE CALLED HIM XENOPHOBIC. SHE CALLED HIM ALL SORTS OF THINGS. THINGS THAT WERE SO BAD, I CANNOT SAY THEM. I SAID, SHE IS OUT. HE PICKS HER. WE ALWAYS PICK PEOPLE GOING UP, NOT GOING DOWN. HOW GOOD IS MIKE PENCE? IS HE GREAT? HE IS A SOLID GUY AND HE IS A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT. HE IS IN MICHIGAN, HE IS EVERYWHERE. WHERE DID YOU GO TODAY, MIKE? I WENT TO MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. I WENT TO WISCONSIN. HE IS AN INCREDIBLE GUY. HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT DO BETTER THAN MIKE PENCE. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE AMERICA, YOU MUST GET OUT AND VOTE. IN JUST 3.5 YEARS, WE HAVE SECURED OUR BORDERS. WE BUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF THE U.S. MILITARY. A BLOODED ISIS CALIPHATE , OBLITERATED ISIS CALIPHATE. FIXED AND DISASTROUS TRADE DEALS AND THEY WERE A DISASTER. I SAID, WHO AGREED TO THIS? STUPID PEOPLE. WE BROUGHT JOBS BACK TO AMERICA. YOU HAD THE GREATEST YEAR HERE HAVE EVER HAD LAST YEAR. THE GREATEST YEAR YOU HAVE EVER HAD. UNDER 16 YEARS OF PRESIDENTS, OBAMA AND BUSH, HOUSEHOLD INCOME ROSE ONLY 2000 $900 , $2900. IN THREE YEARS, AND INCLUDING ENERGY, BECAUSE LOOK AT THE SAVINGS, HOW ARE YOU DOING AT THE GAS PUMP? DID YOU EVER THINK THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. IN THREE YEARS , LESS THAN 3000 , YOU WENT UP $10,000 INCLUDING ENERGY. WE LIFTED 6.6 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. THE LARGEST POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NOT ONLY HERE. EVERYWHERE. FOR YEARS, I HEARD THAT CHINA, AND 2019, WAS GOING TO OVERTAKE US. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. AND THEN THEY RELEASED THE PLAGUE BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN. I GOT HIT HARD THEMSELVES. I WONDER IF THEY UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE GOING TO GET HIT, TOO. THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED IT. THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED IT GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD, 188 COUNTRIES INCLUDING EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE ADDED A RECORD 10.6 MILLION JOBS. INCLUDING 3.3 MILLION FIRST PANIC AMERICANS. BOTH NUMBERS ARE A RECORD. WHEN THE PLAGUE ARRIVED FROM CHINA, WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE PIONEERED LIFESAVING THERAPIES. EUROPE HAS ALMOST A 50% GREATER MORTALITY RATE THAN THE U.S.. YOU SEE THEY ARE BEING HIT VERY HARD. THE FAKE NEWS SAYING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE DOING AS WELL AS EUROPE. NOW EUROPE IS EXPLODING AGAIN. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEIR NARRATIVE. OUR EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION SAVED MANY MILLIONS OF LIVES. THROUGH OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE DEVELOPED AND DISTURBED DID A VACCINE. WE WILL HAVE A VEXING SO SOON, YOU WILL NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF THE POLITICAL HIT. LET'S DELAY THE VACCINE JUST A LITTLE BIT. WE HAVE THREE GREAT COMPANIES AND OTHERS ALSO. JOHNSON AND JOHNSON. PFIZER. MODERNA. GREAT COMPANIES, ALL OF THEM GREAT COMPANIES. I TOOK HISTORIC ACTION TO GET CRITICAL RELEASE IS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. WE SAVED 3.2 MILLION FLORIDA JOBS. WE ARE LAUNCHING A HISTORIC EFFORT TO BRING OUR MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN BACK HOME WHERE THEY BELONG. IN 1996, JOE BIDEN VOTED TO ELIMINATE PUERTO RICO'S THRIVING PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. I AM REVERSING THAT. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE IT BACK SOON. THAT WAS JOE BIDEN THAT DID THAT. THEY VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE? HE IS THE ONE THAT DID IT. LOOK HOW DEVASTATED , WHAT HE DID TO OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. WHAT HE DID WAS DEVASTATING. HE IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE, LET'S FACE IT. LAST WEEK, I ANNOUNCED $13 BILLION THAT GOES TO DISASTER RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO. THEY GOT HIT HARD. I HOPE THEY REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS GIVEN BY TRUMP, NOT BY THE DEMOCRATS. OUR HEARTS ARE ALSO WITH THE COMMUNITIES IN THE PANHANDLE. I LOVE THE PANHANDLE. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE GREAT , YOUR GOVERNOR IS DOING A GREAT JOB. HE SAID THEY LOVE YOU IN THE PANHANDLE. I THINK I AM OUT LIKE 99.9%. WE TOOK CARE OF , WE TOOK CARE OF THE PANHANDLE. HE REMEMBERS , DO YOU REMEMBER HURRICANE SALLY? WE TOOK CARE OF IT. RON SAID, WE NEED MORE MONEY. I SAID, HOW MUCH? I SAID, YOU GOT IT. DON'T COME BACK. SIR, WE NEED MORE MONEY. THAT IS I GUESS A GOOD GOVERNOR, THAT IS WHAT A GOOD GOVERNOR DOES, RIGHT? THAT IS WHAT A GOOD GOVERNOR DOES. I APPROVED A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION. WE WILL BE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WE ARE THERE SO FAST. OTHER PRESIDENTS TOOK A LONG TIME TO APPROVE THEM. WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE TOOK CARE OF FLORIDA. NOVEMBER 3, FLORIDA WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE RETURN TO RECORD PROSPERITY OR WHETHER WE ALLOW JOE BIDEN TO KILL THE RECOVERY. IMPOSE A FOUR BETWEEN DOLLAR TAX HIKE. THEN , BAN AMERICAN ENERGY, DESTROY THE SUBURBS. GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS WHICH MEANS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. AND DR. RATE CHILDREN WITH ANTI-AMERICAN LIES. TO COMBAT THE TOXIC LEFT-WING PROPAGANDA, I ANNOUNCED SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY POPULAR. WE ARE LAUNCHING A NEW PRO-AMERICAN LESSON PLAN CALLED 1776. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN THE TRUTH ABOUT AMERICA, THAT WE ARE THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL NATION IN THE EARTH AND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING YET. I HAVE ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROHIBIT THE TEACHING OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY. THAT DOCTRINE PROMOTES AMERICA AS A WICKED NATION. REWRITES HISTORY AND TEACHES PEOPLE TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES AND BE ASHAMED OF THEIR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. WE FIRED SO MANY OF THESE WISEGUYS. WE HAVE ONE GUY GETTING $350,000 A YEAR TEACHING OUR MILITARY THIS STUFF. HE SAID, WHAT HAPPENED? HE SAID, YOU ARE FIRED, GET OUT. MANY PEOPLE. IT HAS BECOME A CANCER. IT IS LIKE A CANCER. IF THEY ARE NOT GONE, LET US KNOW. WE HAVE TO UNITE AS ONE PROUD AMERICAN FAMILY. WE ARE JOINED BY SOME INCREDIBLE WARRIORS, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. ONE IS A MAN THAT CAME TO THIS STATE AND WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE . RHONDA SANTOS. , RON DESANTOS. HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. HOW ARE WE DOING IN THE ELECTION? NOVEMBER 3? HE SAYS GOOD. WE BETTER DO GOOD. HE WON A GREAT PRIMARY. AND THEN HE BEAT A MAN WHO HAD A GREAT FUTURE. I DO NOT THINK IT IS TOO GOOD. HE DID NOT CHOKE UNDER PRESSURE. MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IS THE FIRST LADY OF FLORIDA, CASEY TO SANTOS , DESANTOS. THE MAYOR OF JACKSONVILLE. A REALLY GOOD GUY, I GOT HIM , HE WANTED TO DO IT SO BAD. WE WANTED TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION RIGHT HERE IN JACKSONVILLE. BUT THE TIMING WAS A LITTLE BIT BAD. WE GOT HIT WITH COVID AS THEY SAY. WE GOT HIT WITH THE CHINA VIRUS. BUT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. YOUR MAYOR, LENNY CIURRY. , CURRY. ARE YOU READY? SOME OF THE GREATEST, TOUGHEST WARRIORS YOU EVER WILL MEET DURING THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX, THEY SAID THIS IS THE BIGGEST PILE OF CROP YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. I AM THE ONLY GUY IN HISTORY WHO EVER GOT IMPEACHED FOR A PERFECT CONVERSATION. EVERYBODY SAID, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS? WE SENT IT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WE SAID, PLEASE CHECK THIS. THANKFULLY, THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING IT DOWN, EXACT NOTES, AND IT WAS PERFECT. WE SENT IT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. PLEASE EXAMINE THIS CONVERSATION. THEY CALLED BACK AND SAID, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR HERE? THESE GUYS ARE USED TO LOOKING AT KILLERS AND DRUG DEALERS. WE SAID, EXPLAINED TO US, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR? THIS WAS THE GREATEST HOAX. TODAY, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED? THEY CAUGHT HIM? THEY GOT HIM COLD. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT. THEY NOW FIND OUT TRUMP WAS 100% TRUTHFUL. IT WAS A HOAX. THEY GOT THEM COLD.

THAT WAS A BIG TRUMP DISTRICT. THAT WAS A GREAT WHEN YOU HAD , WIN YOU HAD. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE ALSO HAVE SOME OTHERS THAT ARE RUNNING FOR DIFFERENT OFFICES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE LOVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. WE ALSO HAVE SOME OF OUR UNBELIEVABLE UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WILL NOT INTRODUCE THEM. I WANT TO SO BADLY. I WANT TO BRING THEM UP HERE. I WANT TO HUG THEM AND KISS THEM CHIME NOT ALLOWED TO DO. THEY MAY LOSE SOME EFFECTIVENESS IF I INTRODUCE THEM. THEY ARE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND ALSO, HERE IS A WOMAN , I MEAN, SHE WAS TOUGH. SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF A GREAT STATE, MICHIGAN, AND SHE SAID, REPUBLICANS HADN'T WON MICHIGAN IN MANY DECADES. I WAS DOING SO MUCH FOR THE BUSINESS AND JOBS AND BRINGING PEOPLE BACK, RECOMMENDING AND TELLING THEM, YOU'RE LOSING YOUR BUSINESS TO MEXICO, CANADA, AND TOLD MUSICAL, THEY GAVE THE MAN OF THE YEAR IN MICHIGAN , AND 12 YEARS AGO, THEY GAVE ME THE MAN OF THE YEAR IN MICHIGAN. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I AM RUNNING FOR OFFICE. A WOMAN, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, SHE SAID, COME GIVE A SPEECH. SHE SAID, I AM IN CHARGE OF MICHIGAN. I SAID, I HEAR WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE, WE SHOULD WIN MICHIGAN. SHE SAID, YOU WILL WIN HERE IF YOU COME HERE. SHE CALLED AGAIN, AND AGAIN, I COULDN'T TAKE IT. SHE WANTED ME TO DO ONE MORE. I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO WIN, DO ONE MORE. JUST TWO WEEKS LEFT. AND I SAID THIS IS IT, I DEVOTED A LOT OF TIME TO MICHIGAN AND EVERYONE SAYS YOU CAN'T WIN. BY THE WAY, JUST GOT A POLL, WE ARE THREE POINTS UP IN MICHIGAN. SHE USED TO CALL ME MR. TRUMP, I WASN'T PRESIDENT YET, SHE SAID, SIR, PLEASE, THIS ONE TIME, THREE WEEKS OUT. I SAID, THIS IS IT. THAT'S IT. SO I DID IT. THE NET BEFORE THE ELECTION, SHE SAID, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN, BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE ONE MORE STOP. [LAUGHTER] AND I MADE IT ON ELECTION DAY. I ARRIVED AT 12:15 IN THE NOW MORNING, THAT WAS NO ELECTION DAY , NOW ELECTION DAY. I STARTED SPEAKING AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING ON ELECTION DAY. MY WIFE SAID, ARE YOU CRAZY? WE HAVE 32,000 PEOPLE. THE REASON I WENT, SHE WANTED US THERE, BUT WE FOUND OUT THAT CROGHAN HILLARY CLINTON, BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA, AND MRS. OBAMA AND BILL CLINTON WERE TRAVELING TO MICHIGAN UNEXPECTEDLY, BECAUSE AS BILL CLINTON TOLD THEM MONTHS AGO, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH TRUMP IN MICHIGAN. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO HIM. HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE IN WISCONSIN, TOO, AND BE CAREFUL OF MINNESOTA. THIS WAS CLINTON. THEY WERE LAUGHING. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY. BUT THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN TROUBLE. I WENT THERE, I STARTED SPEAKING AT ONE OF CLOCK , AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING WITH 2000 PEOPLE THAT GRAND RAPIDS. THEY HAD 500 PEOPLE. IN GRAND RAPIDS. I SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE THIS DAY, AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. I SAID, WE ARE NOT LOSING FLORIDA, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. YOU CAN FEEL IT. YOU HAVE AN INSTINCT. WE ARE JOINED, AS WELL, BY A GROUP OF INCREDIBLE SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE RECENTLY WALKED AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS. THEY JUST REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR US. I THANK YOU. YOU ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THEY ARE SMART. THEY HAVE COMMON SENSE. WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE TERRIBLE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE LAST 47 YEARS. TOGETHER, WE HAVE TAKEN ON A CORRUPT AND BROKEN SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN THROWING EVERYTHING AT US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. REMEMBER THIS, I HAVE DONE MORE IN 47 MONTHS THAN JOE BIDEN HAS DONE IN 47 YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING] BUT TODAY, TEXT MESSAGES WERE RELIEVED FROM THE FBI AGENTS INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA WITCHHUNT. DID YOU SEE? THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THE HEADLINE FROM THE FEDERAL INDUSTRIES, "TRUMP WAS RIGHT, EXPLOSIVE NEW FBI TEXT, DETAIL OVER HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION." WE CAUGHT THEM. REMEMBER THE INSURANCE POLICY? SHE IS GOING TO WIN, ISN'T SHE? YES, 100 MILLION TO ONE. THAT IS NOT GOOD AS FOR ME. 100 MILLION TO ONE, LISA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. BUT IT WAS FOR SOME REASON , BUT IF FOR SOME REASON, SHE DOES NOT WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. YOU CAN'T BE ANY MORE OBVIOUS THAN THAT. THESE PEOPLE ARE SCUM. THEY WERE TRYING TO DO A COUP, WHO WOULD THINK? [APPLAUSE] AND WE CUT THEM BEFORE THAT , CAUGHT THEM BEFORE THAT, WE CAUGHT THEM SPYING ON OUR NATION. THIS WAS A BIG DAY. THEY ARE COMING AFTER ME, BECAUSE I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS, AND DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS. BUT NOW, WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES, AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN CHAMPIONS OF A GLOBAL IS BETRAYAL OF AMERICA FOR 47 YEARS. HE WAS A CHEERLEADER FOR NAFTA, THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. HE WAS A CHEERLEADER FOR CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. I TOOK THE TOUGHEST EVER ACTION TO STAND UP TO CHINA'S RAMPANT THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS, AND I PROUDLY SIGNED A HISTORIC EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING IT OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT POLICY TO BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS GUY, HE IS USING MY SLOGAN. I SAW IT THE OTHER DAY, "BUY AMERICAN." I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR FIVE YEARS. I'M TELLING YOU. YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SLOGANS, JOE. WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION IN THE U.S. MILITARY TO LAUNCH THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES IN NEARLY 75 YEARS AFTER THE AIR FORCE, THE SPACE FORCE. WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE A 91% OF , 91% APPROVAL RATING IN THE V.A. THE HIGHEST AND HISTORY. , THE HIGHEST IN HISTORY. 91% APPROVAL. WE USED TO SEE THINGS IN THE NEWS ABOUT HOW BADLY VETS WERE TREATED. NOW WE HAVE A 91% APPROVAL RATING. TODAY, I CAN ANNOUNCE THE V.A. IS APPROVING A NEW LEASE FOR A BRAND-NEW VETERANS'HEALTH, VETERANS' HEALTH CARE CLINIC. WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST ALL OVER THE WORLD. NUMBER ONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE MASS MURDER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND MANY OTHERS, QASEM SOLEIMANI, IS DEAD. HE DESERVED TO BE TAKEN OUT. I KEPT MY PROMISE, RECOGNIZED THE TRUTH CAPITAL , PRO CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. , THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I ALSO RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, AND INSTEAD OF ENDLESS WAR, WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] , YOU SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I WAS NOMINATED FOR TWO NOBEL PEACE PRIZES LAST WEEK. YOU KNOW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND I TOLD OUR GREAT FIRST LADY, I WAS NOMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. I'M HERE TO COME HOME EARLY. I HAVE TO WATCH IT ON NBC NEWS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCAM JOBS I'VE EVER SEEN. MBC. PROBABLY WORSE THAN CNN, NBC. WE WILL WATCH SECOND BLAZE NBC. , PLACE NBC. THEY ARE BED. , THEY ARE BAD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THEY START OFF WITH SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING ELSE. NOW THE SHOW WAS ALMOST OVER, THEY ARE NOW MENTIONING THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING, BUT THEN IT WAS OK, BECAUSE TWO DAYS LATER, I GOT NOMINATED AGAIN. THAT WAS FOR ISRAEL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I GOT NOMINATED. AND I REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA GOT , THEY SAID, BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA WAS DISSEMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. , WAS JUST NOMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. WHAT HAPPENED? IN SERBIA, THEY ARE NOT KILLING EACH OTHER ANYMORE. TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THE FIRST WAS ISRAEL. BAHRAIN, UAE, THIS ONE WAS KOSOVO. I SAID, FIRST LADY, LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT. WHEN BARACK OBAMA GOT HIS NOBEL PRIZE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, THEY ASKED HIM WHY DID HE GET IT, HE HAD NO CLUE. NOBODY KNEW. IT WAS A BIG STORY. BREAKING NEWS , THEY DIDN'T HAVE BREAKING NEWS WHEN I GOT IT. WE UNDERSTAND THE PRESS. WE UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL. THE LESSON MINISTRATION MADE A PATHETIC ONE-SIDED DEAL WITH THE CASTRO DICTATORSHIP THAT BETRAYED THE CUBAN PEOPLE AND ENRICHED THE COMMONEST REGIME. MY OPPONENTS STAND WITH SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM, I STAND WITH THE PROUD PEOPLE OF CUBA, VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA. YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THAT VERY SINGULAR. THE LESSON MINISTRATION, ALSO NEGOTIATING THE TERRIBLE , THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ALSO NEGOTIATED THE TERRIBLE DEAL WITH COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS. THEY SURRENDERED THE NARCO TERRORISTS , TO THE NARCO TERRORISTS AND CAUSED ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCTION TO SOAR. WE WORKED WITH OUR COLOMBIAN PARTNERS TO LAUNCH A HISTORIC REBEL OPERATION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. SINCE APRIL, WE HAVE SEEN THE HAVE DISRUPTED 227 METRIC TONS OF NARCOTICS. NOBODY HAS DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. NAIL-BITER AND HAS PUT FORWARD THE MOST INJURIES AND EXTREME PLATFORM OF ANY MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE IN HISTORY. THE BAD NEWS IS, YOU DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THE BIDEN PLAN WOULD DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY AND DESTROY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT WILL DRAIN YOUR MEDICARE BY GIVING FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. ALL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WILL ENFORCE TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS. HE WOULD TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BANS ON JIHADIST REGIONS. REMEMBER I GOT THAT APPROVED? THEY KEPT SAYING HE LOST. HAVE A TRAVEL BAN , WE HAVE A TRAVEL BAN. AND INCREASE THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. HE WANTS TO BAN SCHOOL CHOICE AND CHARTER SCHOOLS, WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE FOR OUR CHILDREN. IN THE SECOND TERM, I WILL PROVIDE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY PARENT IN AMERICA. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN IS A VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES, GREAT JOBS, AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS.

WATCH SUNDAY EVENING BEGINNING 6:30 P.M. EASTERN ON C-SPAN. ONLINE AT C-SPAN.ORG OR LISTEN ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD AN AUDIENCE IN ATLANTA BLACK AMERICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY. HE TALKS ABOUT HIS PLAN FOR MORE OF THEM TO HAVE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO START BUSINESSES. YOU HAVE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. YOU HAVE PRISON REFORM. I BELIEVE IN POLICE BEING REFORMED AND NOT ELIMINATED. I AM SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THIS IS OUR TIME AND WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOMENT. SO WHY AM I VOTING FOR HIM? WHY AM I ENDORSING HIM? BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE IS GOING TO KEEP HIS WORD. [APPLAUSE] I AMBITION WELLINGTON BOONE AND I SUPPORT AND EXPECT DONALD J. TRUMP TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND AND THEY CAME HIS FOREFATHERS FROM THE HEBRIDES ISLANDS AND ONE OF THE GREATEST REVIVALS WE KNOW IN HISTORY CAME FROM THE HEBRIDES ISLANDS AND SO WHAT THEY ARE NOTED FOR HIS CALVINISM AND CALVINISM SAID THAT THERE IS A MANIFEST DESTINY OF YOUR LIFE. THIS MAN HAS SAID HE IS THE PRODUCT OF MANIFEST DESTINY. THAT HE WOULD BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] CLEARLY SATAN I CAN SAY THIS TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT BY THE FACT THAT HE HAS, BY HIS TRUTH WITH SHOE HAVE EVIDENCE BY THE THINGS YOU ARE SAYING, YOU WILL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUIT. HE HAS MADE HERE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. REMEMBER IT SAYS THE PROMOTION COMES NOT FROM THAT EAST ARE THE WEST BUT THE SOUTH. GOD LIFTS WENT UP AND TAKES ANOTHER DOWN. [APPLAUSE] THAT HE HAS TARGETED THE INNER-CITY. AND ALL OF YOUR EVIDENCE. HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB IN THE INNER CITIES. IT SHOWS THE FAVOR OF GOD IS ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THE BIBLE SAYS NOT MANY WINES ARE CALLED AND NOMINEE NOBLE ARE CALLED. THE BASE THINGS OF THE WORLD CONFOUND THE WISE. YOUR ASSIGNED THAT REVIVAL IS COMING TO BLACK AMERICA. SO WE ARE JOINING WITH HIM. LET EVERY MAN BE A LIAR. REELECT THIS MAN PRESIDENT, IT IS A VISIBLE MANIFESTATION REVIVAL IS HERE. CONTINUE TO DO A GREAT JOB. IT IS YOUR DAY. [APPLAUSE] (music) HEY. HO. GOD IS GOOD. THIS MATCHEST HE SUIT. I WAS BORN TWO AND A HALF HOURS FROM HERE, KNOWING THAT I WAS COLORED. I WENT TO COLLEGE AND HOUR AND A HALF FROM HERE KNOWING THAT I WAS BLACK. I HAVE A HOME HERE IN ATLANTA KNOWING THAT I'M AFRICAN-AMERICAN. TIME HAS CHANGED. NOW I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. [CHEERING] I PLAYED FOOTBALL IN THE 1980'S IN NEW YORK CITY. I MET A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT WAS VERY BRASS. I LEARNED THAT HE LOVED HIS FAMILY. HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY AND HE LOVED PEOPLE, SO I REMEMBER TELLING A REPORTER FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT THIS GUY COULD BE PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1985. BECAUSE HE LOVED AMERICA, BUT I GUARANTEE YOU CAN'T FIND THAT IN THE ARCHIVES TODAY. BUT I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN HE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE HE BECAME THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I ALSO GET UPSET BECAUSE HE DON'T GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR ALL THE THINGS HE'S DONE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES LIKE HISTORICAL BLACK COLLEGES, THAT HELP TO BUILD GREAT BLACK LEADERS IN THE WORLD TODAY AND ALSO, THE PRISON REFORM THAT BENEFIT MOST OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, SO I GET UPSET ABOUT THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW HIS ADMINISTRATION , AND HIMSELF, THEY WORK EXTREMELY HARD TO DO MANY THINGS FOR AMERICA, NOT JUST AFRICAN-AMERICANS. AND YOU KNOW, I SAID ONCE WHEN , YOU GIVE A MAN A JOB, YOU GIVE HIM SELF-WORTH. DO YOU KNOW, THIS PRESIDENT AND THREE AND HALF YEARS, PUT 1 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO WORK. [APPLAUSE] IN EIGHT YEARS, THE OBAMA BIDEN PUT 140,000 PEOPLE TO WORK. YOU KNOW, I HAVE BOYS, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THIS MAN BECAUSE HE KEEPS GONE IN THE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF US AMERICANS HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY TOUCHDOWN PASSES FROM THIS MAN, I WANT TO SAY IT IS TIME FOR US TO RECOGNIZE OUR QUARTERBACK. SO IT IS MY HONOR AND PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 45TH PRESIDENT, DONALD J TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] (music) [CHEERING] THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO HERSCHEL. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HERSCHEL. [CHANTING] THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HERSCHEL. I'D WATCH HIM IN COLLEGE, I WOULD WATCH HIM CARRY THAT BALL BUT I THINK HE'D DO JUST AS WELL AS A SENATOR OR GOVERNOR. [CHEERING] WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THAT. HE'S A FANTASTIC PERSON, GREAT MAN. I'M HONORED TO BE BACK IN THE HEART OF GEORGIA WITH THE TRULY INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION BLACK , VOICES FOR TRUMP. [CHEERING] IN 39 DAYS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN 4 MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING] WE WILL DO IT WITH A RECORD ANDWE WILL DO IT WITH A RECORD NUMBER OF VOTES FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY. [CHEERING] THAT'S ALL HAPPENING, WE ARE YOU SEE THE PEOPLE BACK THERE THEY ARE SAYING WHAT'S GOING ON , OVER HERE? THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THAT IS OK. OUR MOVEMENT IS WELCOMING, LIENS OF BLACK AMERICANS BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, FREDERICK DOUGLASS. AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN. [CHEERING] WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT FOUR YEARS AGO, I LOOKED AT THE DISMAL RECORD OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND AS BLACK AMERICANS, THEY SAID YOU SHOULDN'T USE THE WORD , BUT I SAID, IT'S MORE DESCRIPTIVE. IT DOES NOT WORK AS WELL WITHOUT IT. TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO GAIN NOVEMBER 3. FOR VOTING ON IT WILL BE THE BIGGEST ELECTION OF OUR LIVES. FOR DECADES, POLITICIANS HAVE TAKEN BLACK VOTERS FOR GRANTED. THEY MAKE YOU PROMISES BEFORE EVERY ELECTION AND THEN THE MOMENT THEY GOT TO WASHINGTON, THEY ABANDONED YOU AND SOLD YOU OUT. THEY LIED TO YOU EVERY SINGLE TIME. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE KNOWS. THE DEMOCRATS WILL ALWAYS TAKE BACK THE VOTE, WHAT THEY WANT TO IS TAKE THE VOTE BACK. TAKE THE BLACK VOTER FOR GRANTED AND THEY HAVE AND IT IS NOT FAIR, IT IS NOT RIGHT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU , BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A VICTORY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER HAD , BEFORE. [CHEERING] IN 2016 , THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IN 2016, I MADE YOU A SOLEMN PLEDGE THAT WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, I WOULD BE YOUR GREATEST CHAMPION. SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE DELIVERED MORE THAN I PROMISED. ONE OF THE FEW POLITICIANS TO DO THAT BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE. BEFORE THE CHINA VIRUS HE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS, WE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN HISTORY. THE BLACK YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. WE ACHIEVED THE LARGEST JOB GAINS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON RECORD. BLACK AMERICANS SAW THE LARGEST INCREASE IN HOMEOWNERSHIP. [CHEERING] THANK YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA THE POVERTY RATE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED. LAST YEAR, 811,000 AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY, THE MOST IN OVER 51 YEARS. [CHEERING] IN MY FIRST THREE YEARS, WE LIFTED 6.6 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, THE LARGEST REDUCTION OF ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING] I DID MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN 47 MONTHS, I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT, IT WAS IN THE VIDEO BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. THEN JOE BIDEN DID IN 47 YEARS. [CHEERING] I HERE TODAY TO ANNOUNCE A NEW AM PLAN TO DELIVER MORE OPPORTUNITIES, MORE SECURITY, MORE FAIRNESS AND MORE PROSPERITY TO BLOCK COMMUNITIES. WE CALL IT THE PLATINUM PLAN. [CHEERING] THAT'S A CONTRACT WITH BLACK AMERICANS AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. WE WILL CREATE 3 MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. [CHEERING] OPEN 500,000 NEW BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES, INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND BLACK COMMUNITIES BY $500 BILLION. [CHEERING] THIS INCLUDES INVESTING IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. BUILT UP PEACEFUL AND SAFER URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF, AND YOU KNOW THIS OF POLICING. ,WE WANT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. WE WANT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF POLICING. BRING EVEN GREATER FAIRNESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE DID CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, WE REMEMBER THAT. EVEN GREATER. WE WILL CREATE A NATIONAL CLEMENCY PROJECT TO RIGHT WRONGFUL PROSECUTIONS AND PARDON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE REFORMED THEIR LIVES. YOU SAW ALICE, RIGHT? WE LOVE ALICE. SHE HAD ANOTHER 24 YEARS AGO, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? TWENTY-TWO YEARS, YET ANOTHER 24 YEARS TO GO. IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND SHE IS A GREAT WOMAN.

[APPLAUSE] GIVE BLACK CHURCHES THE ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR FEDERAL RESOURCES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES, BRING BETTER AND TAILORED HEALTHCARE TO ADDRESS HISTORIC DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE HAD FOR SO MANY YEARS. YOU KNOW THAT. THIS INCLUDES INVESTING IN TREATMENTS FOR KIDNEY DISEASE, DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND MATERNAL MORTALITY. [CHEERING] ADVANCE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WEALTH BUILDING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITIES, BRING MORE MANUFACTURING BACK TO THE USA, WHICH WE'RE DOING ANYWAY.

AND DEMOCRAT POLICIES THAT LOW-WAGE, FOREIGN WORKERS FROM OVERSEAS TO REPLACE BLACK WORKERS IN OUR INNER CITIES. JOE BIDEN CARES MORE ABOUT THE CITIZENS, AMERICANS LIVING IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. I WILL PUT AMERICANS FIRST INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY BLACK AMERICANS.

OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS, BLACK AMERICANS HAVE MOSTLY VOTED DEMOCRAT BUT EVERY DAY, MORE BLACK AMERICANS ARE DECIDING THAT THE OLD WAY IS NOT WORKING. FIVE DECADES OF EVIDENCE PROVED DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY, THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT POWER FOR THEMSELVES, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

[CHEERING] BRIAN, DO NOT LET THEM GET OUT, NOT LET EVERYBODY GET OUT. EVERYONE IS GOING FOR BOTH OF THEM. DO NOT HAVE , WE DO NOT HAVE LONG TO GO. NOVEMBER 3. I SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE HORRIBLE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY OVER 47 YEARS. I SAID YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 47 YEARS. IT IS ALWAYS GREAT WHEN THEY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING AND THEY HAVE NOT DONE IT THEMSELVES. IT IS NOT LIKE IT WAS FUNNY FIVE YEARS AGO HE LEFT, HE WAS THERE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO, RIGHT? IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. NO ONE IN WASHINGTON POLITICS TODAY HAS DONE MORE TO HURT BLACK AMERICANS THEN JOE BIDEN. , THAN JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] JOE PERSONALLY ADVOCATED OR ENACTED VIRTUALLY EVERY POLICY THAT'S CAUSED PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW THAT. HE SHIPS MILLIONS OF YOUR BEST JOBS OVERSEAS, HOW ABOUT THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS AND WITH OPEN BORDERS, STRAPPED CHILDREN IN FAILING SCHOOLS, SENT YOUNG MEN TO FIGHT IN ENDLESS WARS, THEY ARE COMING BACK ON, YOU SEE THAT. THEN HE ARE ALREADY BACK. , MANY ARE ALREADY BACK. CITIES CRUMBLED AT HOME AND MADE CITIES LESS SAFE AND LESS SECURE. JOE BIDEN SHOULD BE BEGGING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. [CHEERING] MY OPPONENT DRAFTED THE 1994 DISASTER, THE 1994 CRIME BILL WHICH CAUSED UNFAIR SENTENCING DISPARITIES THAT DEVASTATED BLACK FAMILIES. I MEAN, JUST DEVASTATED. I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT THE 1994 AND WHEN WE DID CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. IT WAS LARGELY ABOUT ERASING THAT TERRIBLE ACT. THAT WAS HIS DEAL. I ROLLED BACK THE UNFAIR PROVISIONS OF THE 1994 BIDEN CRIME BILL. I SIGNED IN GROUNDBREAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WHICH PEOPLE ARE SO HAPPY ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] EVEN MY ENEMIES ARE SAYING THANK YOU FOR THAT. TODAY WE ARE GLAD TO BE JOINED BY THE FIRST PERSON TO BE RELEASED UNDER THE FIRST STEP ACT WHO I WAS HONORED TO HAVE AS MY GUEST AT THE STATE OF THE UNION, A WONDERFUL MAN, MATTHEW CHARLES. [APPLAUSE] WHERE IS HE? [APPLAUSE] WHAT A GOOD MAN. WHAT A SMILE. I LOOKED AT THAT SMILE FROM THE PODIUM, I WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL THOSE KILLER POLITICIANS. I LOOKED AT MATTHEWS, THE NICEST LOOKING GUY IN THE HOUSE. THANK YOU, YOU ARE DOING WELL, RIGHT? YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GOT. YOU DESERVE IT. [APPLAUSE] BIDEN SUPPORTED THE TWIN DISASTERS OF CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION THAT ELIMINATED ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS HELD BY BLACK AMERICANS. JOE BIDEN'S GLOBALIST AGENDA CLOSED DOWN FACTORIES IN BALTIMORE AND SENT THEM, JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENED. ALL THESE FACTORS, ALWAYS JOBS, , ALL THESE JOBS, SENT THEM TO BEIJING, HE SHUDDERED , SHUTTERED THE PLANS IN MICHIGAN AND SENT THEM TO MEXICO. ONE OF THE STUPIDEST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE WITH THE NEW U.S. , MEXICO AND A LIMIT CREATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. WE GOT IT DONE AND PRETTY QUICKTIME TO REVITALIZE NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES. CREATED NEARLY 9000 OPPORTUNITIES ZONES. TIM SCOTT, SOUTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW TIM SCOTT. [APPLAUSE] SENATOR TIM SCOTT FROM SOUTH CAROLINA CAME TO MY OFFICE, CAME TO THE OVAL OFFICE AND HE HAD THIS IDEA AND I SAID IT SOUNDS GOOD AND WE GOT IT DONE AND PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED WE COULD GET IT DONE AND IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE INCREDIBLE. INVESTMENT PUT INTO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH WILL CREATE AN ESTIMATED 500,000 JOBS AND LIFT 1 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF POVERTY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN THE CHINA VIRUS STRUCK, WE RACED TO ENSURE BLACK AMERICANS HAVE THE MEDICAL CARE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEY NEEDED. TO DO THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, WE HELPED SAVE OVER 200,000 BLACK OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES, IT IS INCREDIBLE. THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS TREMENDOUS TALENT IN TERMS OF THOSE BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. WE SAVED AT LEAST 200,000 OF THEM. AS WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE THE VIRUS, MY ADMINISTRATION IS SHELTERING THOSE AT HIGHEST RISK WHILE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING TREATMENTS AND THE VACCINE IS COMING VERY QUICKLY. A COUPLE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE VACCINE BECAUSE THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE WE THINK TRUMP IS PUSHING IT TOO FAST, BUT THAT'S THE REASON WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT. THIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN YEARS TO GET. WE ARE YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO, THREE YEARS BY DEMOCRATS BUT THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID IT IS HAPPENING TOO FAST AND THAT MEANS WE WILL GET CREDIT, I DO NOT WANT CREDIT, I WANT TO SAVE LIVES. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS, , THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME, TOO LONG. THEY WILL DELIVER , IF HE GETS ELECTED, THIS GUY, HE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST DEPRESSION THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN AND THAT INCLUDES A BIG ONE 1929 , IN 1929. HELLO. LOOK AT YOU. I LOVE HER DRESS. THAT IS GREAT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE HERE. NEARLY 1.3 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE GONE JOBS IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS ALONE NEXT YEAR, WE WILL BE, I THINK IT WILL BE THE GREATEST YEAR, ECONOMICALLY THE GREATEST YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY FOR THESE YOUNG POLITICAL GENIUSES BUT I THINK WE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY AND THE THIRD QUARTER WILL BE ANNOUNCED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE NUMBERS COME OUT. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER AND I WILL SAY IT NOW, THESE PEOPLE UP THERE WILL HOLD ME TO IT. THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME CREDIT IF I WAS RIGHT, BUT IF I WAS WRONG, IT WOULD BE HEADLINED. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS THIRD QUARTER. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE PATH TO THE AMERICAN DREAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN EDUCATION, REPUBLICANS BELIEVE SCHOOL CHOICE IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] AND JOE BIDEN IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO THERE BECAUSE OF THE RADICAL LEFT. HE IS CONTROLLED BY THE RADICAL LEFT TOTALLY. HE IS EXHAUSTED. [LAUGHTER] BIDEN PROMISED TO BAN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND OPPOSE SCHOOL CHOICE. HE IS WILLING TO SPEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS UPON SELLING REFUGEES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT WILL NOT SPEND ONE PENNY PROVIDING SCHOOL CHOICE TO BLACK CHILDREN OF AMERICA, WHICH IS INTERESTING. IN HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE OF A PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VP BIDEN CUT FUNDING FOR HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES. I HAVE INCREASED HBCU FUNDING AND I MADE IT PERMANENT. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT THE FIRST YEAR I SAW THESE PROBABLY 42 PEOPLE CAME OUT AND THEY WERE THE HEADS OF INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES, HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, AND I SAID HOW ARE YOU DOING? THEY WERE NICE PEOPLE. WE TOOK A PICTURE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WITH ME, I SAY COME ON IN. WE TOOK A PICTURE. THE NEXT YEAR THEY WERE THERE AGAIN, AND I SAID WE KNOW THE STORY, THEY WERE THERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE? THEY SAID WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE NEED MONEY AGAIN. I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN AGAIN? AND I FORGOT ABOUT , I SAID, ALL RIGHT, AND THEY GOT IT. THE THIRD YEAR, CAME IN AGAIN AND I SAID WHAT IS THIS? YOUR GREAT PEOPLE, BUT WHAT? THEY DO NOT HAVE PERMANENT FUNDING SO THEY CAN BE SHUT OUT IF THEY HAVE THE WRONG PRESIDENT. HONESTLY, YOU WOULDN'T GET $.10, THE WRONG PRESIDENT WOULD GIVE YOU ANYTHING. THE ONE GENTLEMAN LOOKED AT ME AND SAID WE FEEL LIKE BEGGARS. THAT WAS A HELL OF A STATEMENT. I SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I SAID WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN, SO WE WORKED ON IT. KELLY WORKED ON IT. WE ALL WORKED ON IT. FRANKLY , [APPLAUSE] AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT HAD TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE. YOU REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS A HARD THING. THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. WE GOT IT PASSED. WE GOT MORE MONEY THAN WE ASKED FOR. WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU NEED, YOU NEED MORE. BUT WE GOT MORE MONEY THAN THEY ASKED FOR. WE GOT IT FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS. WE SIGNED IT TOGETHER, ABOUT 42 PEOPLE, WE SIGNED IT TOGETHER. THE ONLY BAD THING IS I WILL NOT SEE YOU ANYMORE. I WILL NOT SEE YOU FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS. WILL I BE PRESIDENT IN 10 YEARS? THAT IS YOUR BREAKING NEWS. I TOLD YOU, HE IS A DICTATOR, HE WILL NOT GIVE UP POWER, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL HE GIVE UP OUR , POWER. HE INTENDS TO SERVE AT LEAST TWO MORE TERMS. YOU CANNOT JOKE. IF YOU JOKE, THEY TAKE IT AWAY. A LITTLE SARCASM IN YOUR JOKE, BUT THEN THEY THINK YOU ARE SERIOUS, AND THEN YOU LAUGH ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS. THEY CUT IT. THEY SAY, HE IS SERIOUS, HE WANTS 12 MORE YEARS. THEY START SHOUTING THAT. 12 MORE YEARS. THIS WAS OFFENSIVE. HE WAS VERY DERISIVE OF THE BLACK AMERICANS WHEN HE NEGATIVELY COMPARED THEM TO ANOTHER GROUP OF AMERICANS. IT WAS TERRIBLE AND HE DID IT. NOBODY BELIEVES THAT ALL BLACK AMERICANS HAVE TO THINK THE SAME WAY. TODAY'S , HE DOES NOT KNOW BLACK AMERICANS LIKE I DO. TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RUN BY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WHO STEREOTYPE YOU, DISRESPECT YOU, AND SELL YOU OUT. THEY ARE ONLY GOOD FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD BEFORE THE ELECTION AND THEY ARE VERY NICE AND THEY WANT YOUR VOTE. THEY FORGET ALL ABOUT YOU. THEY ARE GONE. BIDEN WANTS TO LECTURE THE COUNTRY ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE WHEN HE SPENT HIS CAREER HURTING BLACK AMERICANS, HURTING HISPANIC AMERICANS AND FORGING ALLIANCES WITH SENATORS. IT RACIAL JUSTICE BEGINS WITH JOE BIDEN'S RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC LIFE. [CHEERING] TODAY, I AM URGING BLACK AMERICANS TO WALK AWAY FROM THE CORRUPT AND VERY EXTREME DEMOCRAT PARTY. ON NO ISSUE HAS , DEMOCRATS HAVE RUN AMERICA'S INNER CITIES FOR 100 YEARS. LAST YEAR, 19 OF THE TOP 20 MOST DANGEROUS CITIES IN AMERICA WERE RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THE MURDER RATE IS HIGHER IN BALTIMORE THAN IN AFGHANISTAN, EL SALVADOR, OR HUNTER S. , HONDURAS. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE ATTACKING OUR POLICE AND EMPOWERING FAR-LEFT RIOTERS, L OOTERS, AND ANARCHISTS. THE DEMOCRATS' WAR ON COPS HAS CAUSED BLACK OWNED HOMES AND CHURCHES TO BE DESTROYED, MOST TRAGICALLY OF ALL, SO MANY INNOCENT BLACK LIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM US. PEOPLE ARE DYING BY THE THOUSANDS IN LACK ON BLACK CRIME , BLACK ON BLACK CRIME AND I WANTED TO STOP. PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. IN CHICAGO, THERE ARE WEEKENDS WHEN 60 OR 70 OR MORE PEOPLE ARE SHOT AND MANY DIE. HOW CAN WE ALLOW THIS TO GO ON? HOW CAN WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN? THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRAT RUN CITIES. EVERY YEAR, THOUSANDS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE MURDERED AT THE RESULT OF VIOLENT CRIME IN THESE DEMOCRAT RUN MONSTROSITIES. IT IS WORSE THAN AFGHANISTAN. WE ARE AT WAR. DEMOCRATS IGNORE THESE AMERICAN VICTIMS AND I WILL NOT. WE HAVE TO BE ASKED TO COME IN. THEY HAVE TO SAY, PLEASE COME IN. MINNEAPOLIS, WE WENT IN AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A CITY LEFT. SEATTLE, THEY KNEW WE WERE COMING IN. THE NIGHT WE CAME IN, THEY LEFT. IT WAS THE END OF THAT. LOOK AT PORTLAND. HOW BAD IS PORTLAND? WE CAN SOLVE THAT IN HALF AN HOUR. A BUNCH OF YOUNG ANARCHISTS THAT LIVE WITH THEIR PARENTS IN A BASEMENT. I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE TO. INCLUDING INCREDIBLE BLACK POLICE OFFICERS WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO KEEP US ALL SAFE. THEY PROTECT PEOPLE WHO THEY HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. THEY ARE AMAZING. THOSE PUSHING TO DEFUND THE POLICE ARE HURTING BLACK COMMUNITIES THE MOST. WHEN THERE IS POLICE MISCONDUCT, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS TOLD WRONGDOERS FULLY RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, AND THEY WILL DO THAT. POLITICIANS SUPPORTING MOB VIOLENCE ARE NOT ALLIES OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY, THEY ARE CAUSING EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGE, HARDSHIP. OUR NATION HAS GRIEVED OVER THE TRAGIC DEATHS OF BREONNA TAYLOR, GEORGE FLOYD, AND AHMAUD ARBERY. OUR HEARTS BREAK FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND ALL FAMILIES WHO LOST A LOVED ONE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK, IT IS SO SENSELESS. BUT WE CAN NEVER ALLOW MOB RULE. TO HAVE SAFETY, PROSPERITY, TO HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HAVE, WE MUST ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO. MANY OF THOSE WERE SPREADING VIOLENCE IN OUR CITIES SUPPORTERS , OUR SUPPORTERS , ARE SUPPORTERS OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER, BLM. IT IS REALLY HURTING THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THIS IS AN UNUSUAL NAME FOR AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE IDEOLOGY AND TACTICS ARE RIGHT NOW DESTROYING MANY BLACK LIVES. IT'S FIRST PHRASE WAS PIGS IN A BLANKET, FRY THEM LIKE BLANKET, REFERRING TO OUR POLICE. THE GOAL OF BLM PEOPLE IS TO ACHIEVE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY, ABOLISH THE POLICE, ABOLISH PRISONS, ABOLISH BORDER SECURITY, ABOLISH CAPITALISM AND ABOLISH SCHOOL CHOICE. THIS IS NOT THE AGENDA OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THIS IS THE AGENDA OF FREEDOM EXTREME SOCIALIST , YOU KNOW THE OTHER WORD. MARXIST. COMMUNIST. THIS IS THE EXTREME SOCIALIST LEFT, BUT BEYOND THAT IN MY OPINION. THE FOUNDERS OF THE ORGANIZATION CALL THEMSELVES TRAINED MARXISTS, BUT WE HAVE CORPORATIONS OUT OF WEAKNESS, FEAR, OR WHATEVER REASON DONATING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THEM. THESE ARE FOOLS. [APPLAUSE] THE BIG PROGRESSIVE CORPORATIONS DONATING TO BLM SHOULD INSTEAD BE SPENDING THEIR MONEY HELPING BLACK FAMILIES REBUILD FROM THE LEFT-WING RIOTS. WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE IN OUR INNER CITIES WHILE LIVING BEHIND WALLED COMPOUNDS. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE WAY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE LIVE. THEY LIVE VERY WELL. IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN, THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO GO. LET'S GO GET THESE PEOPLE. THEY ARE FOOLS. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF SCHOOL CHOICE FOR BLACK CHILDREN WHILE SENDING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO THE BEST PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE LAND. THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS FOR YOU, BUT SECURITY FOR THEMSELVES. THEY WANT TOP SECURITY, BUT LET'S OPEN THE BORDERS AND LET EVERYONE POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY SO YOU WILL NOT HAVE JOBS LEFT OR ANYTHING LEFT. THAT IS A TREMENDOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WE HAVE BUILT OVER 330 MILES OF WALL. [APPLAUSE] IT WILL BE FINISHED SOON AND OUR NUMBERS AT THE BORDER OF THE BEST THEY HAVE BEEN IN DECADES. IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE WALL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. 330 MILES. THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAD A PARTY THAT DID NOT WANT US TO BUILD IT. HE WANTED , THEY WANTED IT 10 YEARS AGO, BUT AS SOON AS I WANTED IT, THEY DID NOT WANT IT. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS RALLY LAST NIGHT WITH ABOUT 25,000 PEOPLE. I SAID I MADE A MISTAKE. I SHOULD HAVE SAID, WE WILL NOT BUILD A WALL. [LAUGHTER] AND WE WOULD'VE HAD FUNDING IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES. I HAD TO WIN SIX DIFFERENT LAWSUITS. CRAZY NANCY. SHE IS CRAZY. IT WILL BE BUILT VERY SOON. WE ARE DOING 10 MILES A DAY ON AVERAGE. THINK OF THIS. [APPLAUSE] I DO NOT HEAR ANYMORE ABOUT THE WALL. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS UPHOLD EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. WE WILL DEFEND THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN AND WE WILL DEFEND OUR GOD-GIVEN FREEDOMS INCLUDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. [APPLAUSE] AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT, BY THE WAY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE HAVE TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. I AM THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND AND ME , AND ME AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE WILL NOT BE LOSING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY WILL GET RID OF IT. YOU KNOW WHO THEY PUT IN CHARGE? DATA , NATO. THAT IS A SPANISH NAME. HE NEEDED A SPANISH BOAT. , HE NEEDED A SPANISH VOTE. HE KNOWS LESS ABOUT IT THEN I DO , THAN I DO. THEY SAID HE SAID THAT I WAS BORN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. EVEN THOUGH HE JUST LOST THE RACE. HE WAS HOT. HE SAID, I WAS BORN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT IS A SURE LOSER. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID THAT? I WAS BORN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE WOULD SAY, THIS GUY IS WHACKED OUT. IT IS NOT EASY DEAL GOING ON OVER HERE. I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE BEFORE. YOU KNEW A LOT ABOUT MY LIFE. I HAD A GREAT LIFE. WHAT THE HELL DID I DO THIS FOR, DAVID? WHAT THE HELL DID I DO THIS FOR? I ENJOY IT. I LOVE IT. DID YOU SEE THE TEXT MESSAGES? IT IS BRUTAL. ONE GUY SAID THIS IS REALLY ILLEGAL , I WANT INSURANCE. THEY BOUGHT INSURANCE WITH THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE LOCKED UP. WE GOT IT. NOW THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. THIS IS THE HOTTEST THING RIGHT NOW ON THE INTERNET, ALL OVER THE PLACE. OH BOY, OH BOY. IT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. DID YOU SEE BIDEN'S SON? WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? I SAY, WHERE IS HUNTER? WE MADE A TEACHER , T-SHIRT. I WAS KIDDING. THE NEXT DAY, IT WAS THE BIGGEST SELLING T-SHIRT IN HISTORY. HUNTER GOT A CHECK FROM THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW. FOR $3.5 MILLION. WOULD ANYONE EXCEPT WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO FOR $3.5 MILLION? FOUR , BEFORE BIDEN BECAME VICE PRESIDENT, HE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY. NOW HE IS GETTING CHECKS FOR $3.5 MILLION FROM THE MAYOR , EX-MAYOR OF MOSCOW. SO, WE GOT IT WRONG. IT WAS NOT TRUMP. I DID NOT HAVE A PHONE CALL. LET'S CALL BOB MUELLER AND PUT THEM ON THE CASE. VENUE. , THANK YOU. I STOLE FROM HIM. I PLAGIARIZED FROM HIM, LIKE BID EN. THAT WAS VERY GOOD. BOB'S A SHARP GUY. HE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. HOW ABOUT ME? THREE YEARS OF INVESTIGATION. A FRIEND OF MINE, VERY SMART NEW YORK, HE SAID YOU MUST BE THE MOST HONEST PERSON AND THE WORLD WHEN 19 GENIUSES, BAD PEOPLE, BUT GENIUSES, PLUS UNLIMITED LAW ENFORCEMENT, 2.5 YEARS, CAN'T FIND ANYTHING, YOU HAVE TO BE THE CLEANEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE OPPOSITE STORY. IT WAS THEM WHO WAS DEALING WITH RUSSIA. DAVID, CAN YOU GUYS START WORKING ON THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK? DOUG, IF YOU DO NOT MIND? THINK OF IT, IT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. PLEASE DEFEND THE PRESIDENT. IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE OPPOSITE. THEY WERE THE ONES DEALING WITH RUSSIA. IT WAS A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN. I THINK MONDAY MORNING WOULD BE OK. WE ARE APPOINTING A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD DO IT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT. BUT THEY DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE IT IS , WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT. PUT THEM IN OUR SHOES. DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SAYING, WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT DO THIS. WHAT CHANCE DO WE HAVE OF THAT, DAVID? ZERO? THEY WOULD HAVE GONE EVEN CRAZIER. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, LET'S GET IT DONE IMMEDIATELY, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE WEEKEND. THEY HAVE BEEN NOT GOOD TO DEAL WITH. WHEN WE BUILD THIS GREAT SUCCESS, THEN WE GET INTERRUPTED BY CHINA. THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT. WE CAN NEVER FORGET IT. IT WAS STARTING TO COME TOGETHER, AND IT WILL COME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE EVEN GREATER SUCCESS IN MY OPINION NEXT YEAR. WHEN DEMOCRATS TRY TO SILENCE PASTORS, AND WE HAVE HAD GREAT PASTORS APPEAR , UP HERE. I WATCHED THOSE GUYS AND I SAID, I DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW THEM. I DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW THEM. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO SPEAK FIRST, BUT THEY WERE GREAT. WEREN'T THEY REALLY GREAT? THEY LOVE YOU, THEY LOVE THE COUNTRY. THEY AT LEAST LIKED ME BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THEY DID NOT, THEY COULD NOT DO WHAT THEY JUST DID. THEY DID IT FROM THE HEART. I WATCHED THAT. WILL NEVER FORGET IT , I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. I DO NOT FORGET THINGS. I DO NOT FORGET THINGS. WHERE ARE THOSE GUYS? MAN, OH MAN. [APPLAUSE] I WILL NEVER FOLLOW YOU AGAIN. AT LEAST WE HAD HERSCHEL IN BETWEEN, RIGHT? AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT, EITHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND FROM THE HEART. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE WILL NOT FORGET. I WILL FIERCELY DEFEND THE ROLE OF BLACK TRUCES , BLACK CHURCHES IN AMERICA. JOE BIDEN ON THE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER, BUT THEY DO NOT PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE BLACK LIVES OF ALL. UNBORN CHILDREN. THEY SUPPORT THEM RIGHT UP UNTIL THE NINE MONTH OF PREGNANCY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THEY SAID BABY IS BORN. AND THEN THEY START TO TALK. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, THAT IS NOT ABORTION. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? I CALL IT EXECUTION. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT, RIGHT? HAVE NOT HEARD THAT. HERE LATE-TERM ABORTION. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE ONE THAT THINKS HE IS MICHAEL JACKSON. THE ONE WHOSE WIFE STOPPED HIM FROM TRYING TO IMITATE MICHAEL JACKSON MOONWALKING. HE IS NOT GOING TO BE MICHAEL. THERE IS NOBODY THAT CAN MOONWALK LIKE MICHAEL. HE GOT VERY LUCKY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END IF HE WOULD'VE DONE THAT. THE DEMOCRATS CHAMPION PLANNED PARENTHOOD, JUST FOUNDED ON RACISM AND THEY TARGET THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE BELIEVE IN PROTECTING ALL BLACK LIVES, INCLUDING THE UNBORN. WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD OF EVERY RACE BORN AND UNBORN IS MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF GOD. [APPLAUSE] REPUBLICANS LEAVE THAT ALL HUMAN LIFE IS SACRED. AT NO TIME BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN A CLEAR CHOICE BETWEEN TWO PARTIES, TWO VISIONS, TWO PHILOSOPHIES. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DIFFERENCE LIKE THIS. OUR OPPONENTS WANT CHILDREN TO GROW UP IN A SOCIALIST NATION THAT WILL MEAN LESS OPPORTUNITY, LESS PROSPERITY, LESS SAFETY, AND LESS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY'S MESSAGE TO THE CHILDREN IS THAT THE COUNTRY'S PEOPLE. MY MESSAGE IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE IN HUMAN HISTORY. NO MATTER WHERE YOUR FAMILY COMES FROM, MATTER YOUR BACKGROUND IN AMERICA, ANYONE CAN RISE. DEMOCRATS DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY BY RACE. REPUBLICANS UNITE AMERICANS OUR SHARED VISION OF CITIZENSHIP. THIS COUNTRY IS THE , GLORIFIED HERITAGE AMERICANS. BLACK PATRIOTS POURED OUT THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, HEART, AND SOUL TO DEFEND AMERICAN LIBERTY AND TO FOUND OUR PROMISE THAT WE ARE ALL MADE EQUAL BY THE HAND OF OUR ALMIGHTY GOD. AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS, LISTEN UP. TO END SLAVERY AND SEGREGATION, TO SECURE CIVIL RIGHTS, BLACK HEROES LIKE HARRIET TUBMAN, SOJOURNER TRUTH, BOOKER T. WASHINGTON, MARTIN LUTHER KING, ROSA PARKS, AND THURGOOD MARSHALL HELPED BUILD THE MOST DOES , JUST, NOBLE, FREE COUNTRY. WITH THE HELP OF NEW BLACK PATRIOTS, AND THERE ARE SOME OF THEM RIGHT NOW, WE WILL REACH NEW HEIGHTS OF GLORY AND GREATNESS. WE ARE GOING TO REVITALIZE OUR CITIES. IT IS IN THE PROCESS. WE WILL BRING MORE JOBS AND FACTORIES BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WILL GIVE EVERY SINGLE CHILD A CHANCE TO REACH THEIR FULL GOD-GIVEN DENTAL. , POTENTIAL. WE WILL INCLUDE THE MOST INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY AND THE MOST INSPIRING FUTURE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN AND WE WILL DO THAT FOR EVERY CITIZEN OF EVERY BACKGROUND, RACE, RELIGION, AND CREED. TOGETHER, WE MAKE UNBELIEVABLE PROGRESS AND ACHIEVED ONCE UNIMAGINABLE SUCCESS. NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR VOTE, AND YOUR VOICE, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. [APPLAUSE] THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT HONOR FOR ME. I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. DOG BLESS THE WORLD. , GOD BLESS THE WORLD. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) YOUNG MAN THERE'S NO NEED TO FEEL DOWN THERE'S NO NEED TO BE UNHAPPY I SAID YOUNG MAN WHEN YOU'RE SHORT ON YOUR DOUGH IT'S FUN TO STAY AT THE YMCA IT'S FUN TO ,	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476175-1/president-trump-remarks-black-economic-empowerment-atlanta	President Trump made remarks in Atlanta on his plan to boost economic opportunities for Black Americans.

CSPANDT269202074	Donald Trump	2020-09-26	President Trump Rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania	WELL, WE WON PENNSYLVANIA LAST TIME AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT BY A LOT MORE THIS TIME. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE HAD A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM BUT WE HAVE MORE NOW, EVEN THE FAKE NEWS WILL ADMIT THAT. MORE THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD. HELLO, PENNSYLVANIA. AS WE STAND TOGETHER -- WE WILL TAKE IT. I JUST CAME FROM THE ROSE GARDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [CHEERING] WE ARE DOING WELL. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE VERY SOON. IT IS ALL HAPPENING BEAUTIFULLY. WE HAD TO CLOSE IT DOWN, WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES, WE ARE DOING RECORD NUMBERS, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT THIRD QUARTER, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST CAME FROM THE ROSE GARDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE I PROUDLY NOMINATED JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT FOR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. JUDGE BARRETT IS A BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND AND EXTRAORDINARY SCHOLAR, YOU KNOW THAT. NUMBER ONE IN HER CLASS. ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE, HE SAYS THE GREATEST STUDENT HE HAS EVER HAD. THAT IS A LITTLE BETTER THAN JOE BIDEN, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? SHE SHOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ACADEMICALLY, SLIGHTLY BETTER. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHE WILL DEFEND YOUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, SHE WELL. JUDGE BARRETT WOULD BECOME THE THIRD SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALONG WITH OVER 300 -- THINK OF THIS, THIS IS OUR THIRD NOMINATION. JUSTICE GORSUCH, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, AND NOW WE HAVE AMY ALONG WITH 300 FEDERAL JUDGES. CONFIRMED TO UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND CONSTITUTION AND THAT IS A RECORD. JOE BIDEN HAS REFUTED TO PROVIDE HIS LIST BECAUSE THE NAMES WILL BE HANDPICKED BY SOCIALISTS LIKE REPRESENTATIVE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ. AN ILL HAD OMAR -- ILHAN OMAR. SHE IS ALWAYS COMPLAINING. THINGS WORKED OUT FOR HER. HOW DID SHE COME HERE? DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW SHE CAME HERE? THAT IS A BEAUTY. THAT IS A GROUP OF REAL -- THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY SO MUCH, RIGHT? THE FAR-LEFT WILL PACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH ABOUT ECHOLS WHO WILL TERMINATE THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, STRIKE THE WORD UNDER GOD -- TEAR DOWN CROSSES FROM PUBLIC SPACES AND FORCE TAXPAYERS TO FUND EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO DO. THOSE JUSTICES WILL CRIPPLE POLICE DEPARTMENTS, PROTECT SANCTUARY CITIES, AND DECLARE THE DEATH PENALTY UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR EVEN THE MOST DEPRAVED MASS MURDERERS, IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WE WILL SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND TOGETHER, WE WILL SAVE OUR COUNTRY, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IF SLEEPY JOE CAME HERE, I REALLY MEAN THIS, YOU KNOW THE LITTLE CIRCLE? HE CAN'T GET THEM FULL. THOSE BIG, BEAUTIFUL -- WHEREVER DOES IT DOES A NICE JOB, THEY ARE VERY ROUND. YOU GET LIKE FIVE OF THEM AND THEN HE STANDS FAR BACK AND WALKS -- I DON'T GET THE WHOLE DEAL. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS, SOMEBODY SAID 18,000. LAST NIGHT, WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA. WE ARE MAKING A PLAY FOR VIRGINIA BECAUSE WE HAVE A GOVERNOR IN VIRGINIA, ALL HE DOES IS TALK ABOUT TERMINATING THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THAT IS ALL HE TALKS ABOUT. IN 38 DAYS, WE WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA, WE WILL WIN FOUR BOY YEARS -- MORE YEARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU GREAT HONOR. WE HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT TOGETHER. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE NUMBERS ON NOVEMBER 3, GET OUT AND VOTE, EARLY VOTE, DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO, MAKE SURE THEY DON'T TEACH YOU WITH THOSE BALLOTS. DID YOU SEE TODAY? THERE WAS A BIG MISHAP WITH THE BALLOTS, ANOTHER ONE. EVERY DAY. BIG MISHAP WITH THE BALLOTS. NEW YORK IS SAYING, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IT IS A LITTLE LATE FOR DOING THAT, ISN'T IT? NEW YORK IS GOING TO WORK ON SOMETHING, GOVERNOR CUOMO IS GOING TO WORK ON SOMETHING NOW. THE BALLOTS ARE FLOWING, IT IS A LITTLE LATE. THEN IN A CERTAIN LOCATION, YOU KNOW THE LOCATION, THEY MAILED THE BALLOTS OUT. THEY DOUBLED IT UP AND EVERYBODY IN THIS DEMOCRAT AREA GOT TWO BALLOTS INSTEAD OF ONE. THEN TWO DAYS AGO, THEY FOUND EIGHT BALLOTS IN A WASTEPAPER BASKET. THEY ALL HAD THE NAME TRUMP WRITTEN ON THEM, THEY WERE MILITARY BALLOTS. THEN THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD STATE, THEY FOUND LOTS OF PALLETS DUMPED IN THE STREAM. THIS IS NOT RIGHT, WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS NOT IT IS ALL GONE -- THESE ONES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS PENNSYLVANIA, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA, BUT YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO IS IN CHARGE OF PALLETS -- NORTH CAROLINA, MICHIGAN, NEVADA, ALL OF THESE PLACES ARE BUN BY DEMOCRATS, THESE ARE THE ONES THAT COUNT THE BALLOTS. IT IS LIKE COMMON SENSE. WE ARE GOING TO BE CAREFUL, AND WE ARE WAITING FOR RULINGS FROM A GREAT FEDERAL JUDGE IN YOUR STATE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE WHOLE THING. THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO STEAL THE ELECTION. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN WIN PENNSYLVANIA IS TO CHEAT ON THE BALLOTS. THEY SAID, THERE WAS A MISTAKE ON A LETTER THE BALLOTS, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO REDO THE SYSTEM. THINK OF IOWA DURING THE PRIMARY, THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING, IT WAS A MESS. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. MAN. THAT GUY, HE IS GOING -- WAIT, WAIT. HE JUST OPENED HIS MOUTH AND WE HAD THAT GENTLEMAN IN THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE -- WILL YOU STAND UP? YOU ARE ON HIM? THIS GUY HADN'T GOTTEN THE FIRST WORD OUT. THAT IS THE KIND OF GUY I WANT WORKING FOR ME. THAT WAS JUST INSTINCT, IT IS CALLED NATURAL INSTINCT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST PEOPLE DON'T, THAT IS THE PROBLEM. WE PROUDLY ACHIEVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, WE ARE NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL IN THE WORLD. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN -- THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR PENNSYLVANIA. HE DECIDED TO PULL BACK. HE WENT TO A PLACE CALLED TEXAS. NO OIL, NO GOD, AND NO GUNS IN TEXAS, THAT DOESN'T WORK. IT DOESN'T WORK HERE EITHER. IT IS A BIG BUSINESS YEAR, 900,000 JOBS. HE WANTS TO ERADICATE ALL OF THE THINGS YOU ARE DOING, ALL OF THE THINGS BRINGING IN SO MUCH MONEY FOR YOUR STATE, IT IS A DISGRACE. HE IS TRYING TO SAY, I DID NOT MEAN THAT. THAT WAS LIKE HILLARY, REMEMBER? SHE MADE A HORRIBLE STATEMENT ABOUT CLEAN COAL, CROOKED HILLARY, THEN THREE WEEKS LATER -- I'VE USED TO SAY, NOW, NOW, WE ONE -- WON, BUT NOW -- SHE IS CRAZY. IT WAS A STONE COLD OF HER. REMEMBER THE EMAILS? YOU THINK WE FORGOT? DID NOT FORGET THE EMAILS. REMEMBER THE EMAILS? WHEN CONGRESS SAID WE WANT 33,000 EMAILS AND THEY DELETED EMAILS, THEY DELETED EVERYTHING, THE TEXT MESSAGES EVERYTHING THEY DELETED, IF MIKE KELLY DID THAT HE WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB SO FAST. HE WOULD BE GONE. WE WOULD NOT LAST LONG. I MEAN, THE CORRUPTION -- DID YOU SEE OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS, THE FBI TEXT MESSAGES, TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THE ONE GUY SAYS, TRUMP WAS RIGHT, YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS. BUT THEY BROUGHT HIM ALONG -- WE NEED INSURANCE, WE HAVE TO GET INSURANCE FOR THIS, THIS IS WRONG. TRUMP WAS RIGHT. IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A WHOLE BIG DISINFORMATION DEAL AND YOU KNOW WHO THE GUILTY PARTY IS? THE DEMOCRATS AND HILLARY, THEY WERE THE ONES THAT DEALT WITH RUSSIA, IT WASN'T US, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME. THESE TEXT MESSAGES CAME OUT, DID YOU SEE THAT? THEY JUST CAME OUT. WE WENT THROUGH 2.5 YEARS OF A LOT OF WORK AND THEY RUINED A LOT OF PEOPLE. LOOK AT GENERAL FLYNN. THOSE MESSAGES ABOUT GENERAL FLYNN CAME OUT. THEY KNEW HE WAS INNOCENT AND THEY SAID, WE WANT FLYNN TO GET TRUMP. IT CAME OUT LOUD AND CLEAR, THEY WERE AFTER TRUMP. WE GOT TO GET BACK TO CONGRESS AND GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE, THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. IT WAS A WHOLE BIG CALL AND JOB WITH SHIFTY S CHIFF, HE SAYS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING THAN WHAT I SAID AND THEY SAID, YOU CAN'T GO AFTER HIM BECAUSE HE IS SHIELDED BECAUSE HE MADE THE SPEECH -- HE TOTALLY LIED. IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE. WHEN YOU ARE IN CONGRESS, YOU SHOULD BE MORE HONEST. THERE WE HAVE ANY SENIORS -- DO WE HAVE ANY SENIORS? WE ARE PROUD OF IT. FOR YEARS, BIDEN TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE -- YOU KNOW THAT. THEY ARE GOING WITH SOCIALIZED MEDICINE IF THEY EVER GET IN. REMEMBER OBAMA? OBAMA KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SCAM. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS COUP. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN. HE KNEW EVERYTHING. THEY HAVE HIM COLD. THEY HAVE HIM COLD. I SAID HE WAS SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN. THE INTERNET BLEW UP, HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT? IT WAS TRUE. IT WAS TRUE. AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE IT AWAY. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THIS IS USA. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WE CAUGHT HIM. ALL THESE TEXT MESSAGES, AND FROM WHAT I HEAR, THEY HAVE REAL BEAUTIES COMING OUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT SOMEBODY SAID, YOU CAN DO THAT, HE WAS PRESIDENT, WELL I'M PRESIDENT, AND IT WOULD NOT STOP. I PROMISE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. REMEMBER WHEN BIDEN SAID, WHEN I ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD FREEZE FEDERAL SPENDING, I MEANT SOCIAL SECURITY, HE MEANT THIS, HE SAID WHEN I ARGUED THAT HE WANTED TO FREEZE ALL THIS FEDERAL SPENDING, HE IS NOT GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR MEDICARE, HE IS NOT WHAT YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND IF HE GETS IN, HE IS GOING TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY BECAUSE THE RADICAL LEFT WILL CONTROL HIM, AND HE IS GOING TO DO SOCIALIZED MEDICINE AS SURE AS YOU ARE SITTING OR STANDING THERE. I CAN'T EVEN TELL THE DIFFERENCE. YOU ARE SITTING. AS IT DID NICE, WE'VE GOT SEATS FOR PEOPLE? AND THE POLICE BACK THERE, ARE THEY THE GREATEST? [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING WAS BRACKET -- [CROWD CHANTING] THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT SO MANY DOOR SUMMONS, I DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THEM ANYMORE. WE HAVE SO MANY POLICE ENDORSEMENTS. NEW YORK CITY'S FINEST. NEVER DID IT BEFORE. THEY ENDORSED ME. THEY ENDORSED US FOR PRESIDENT. THEY CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN NEW YORK. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS LET THEM DO THEIR JOB AND NOT TAKE $1 BILLION AWAY ON FIRE SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE ON THE FORCE. WE'VE GOT CHICAGO. THINK OF THAT, CHICAGO POLICE ENDORSED ME. THAT IS NOT EASY. THEY ARE DEALING WITH RADICAL LEFT PEOPLE. WE GOT ENDORSED BY ALL THE SHERIFF'S IN FLORIDA, ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FLORIDA. WE GOT ENDORSED BY TEXAS, OKLAHOMA. WE GOT ENDORSED BY, DOES ANYBODY KNOW OF ANY POLICE AREA OR GROUP WHO HAS NOT ENDORSED US? WE ARE LOOKING FOR THEM. WE ARE LOOKING. NOW, BIDEN IS PLEDGING TO GIVE FEDERAL HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, WHICH IS DECIMATING MEDICARE. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, WE ALL HAVE HEART. WE WANT TO HELP YOUR. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN YOU SAY THAT, PEOPLE WHO NEVER THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE UNITED STATES SAY LET'S GO. WE GET FREE EDUCATION, PREMEDICATION, FREE HEALTH CARE. AND I SAID JOKING ONE TIME, EVERYBODY GETS A NEW ROLLS-ROYCE AND CNN SAID, HE LIED. HE SAID THAT'S ALL THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THERE ARE 750,000 OF THEM. [CROWD CHANTING] THEY SAID HE LIED, I DIDN'T. I WAS ONLY KIDDING. THEY SAID I LIED. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID, RUSSIA IF YOU ARE LISTENING, FIND YOUR EMAILS, OR WHATEVER I SAID, FIND HER EMAILS. THEN WE ALL LAUGHED TOGETHER, 25,000 PEOPLE ON THE STADIUM COME ON TELEVISION, LOOK AT ALL THE CAMERAS ON TELEVISION, LOOK AT ALL THOSE GREAT LIGHTS, THEY ARE STANDING IN THE RAIN, JUST LIKE I AM, AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT, BUT DO YOU REMEMBER? THE PROBLEM IS, THEY CUT IT OFF EXACTLY BEFORE WE ALL STARTED TO LAUGH TOGETHER. AND FOR TWO YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, HE ASKED RUSSIA TO PLEASE GET HER EMAILS OR WHATEVER THE HELL WE WERE ASKING . RUSSIA, IF YOU ARE LISTENING. THE HOPELESS CRACKS UP ALONG WITH ME. IN FACT, THEY CUT OFF MY LAST WORD. YOU KNOW, THE GOT TO CUT IT SHORT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY SIGN, THIS IS DISHONEST OF THESE, THEY ARE REALLY, THEY ARE SO BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT RIGHT NOW, IT IS LIVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE WILL LET IT GO. LET'S SAY IT AT THE END INSTEAD. THEY ARE CNN, TOTALLY CORRUPT, THEY ARE FAKE, AND YOU SEE THE LIGHT GO OFF, THE RED LIGHT. AND I SAID, I'VE GOT TO STOP SAYING THAT. THE THINK IT IS WET ENOUGH OUT HERE? [APPLAUSE] AND THEY ALL SAID, DO YOU NEED A HAT? WHAT HAT IS GOING TO MESS THIS BEAUTIFUL SUIT? I HAVE A RED ONE AND WHATEVER THE HELL COLOR THIS IS. RED IS NOT GOING TO GO WELL WITH THIS COLOR. NO, IT IS FINE, I LIKE TO PLAY IN THE RAIN WITH MY FRIENDS FROM PENNSYLVANIA. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE IN THE RAIN TOGETHER. WE ARE IN THE RAIN TOGETHER. [CROWD CHANTING] [UNINTELLIGIBLE CHANTING] THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. NOW WE ARE IN THE RAIN TOGETHER. WE WILL STAY OUT HERE ALL NIGHT IF WE HAVE TO. BUT, I WILL TELL YOU, SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS ARE GOING ON. WHEN I LOOK AT THEIR PLANS, DID YOU SEE THEIR PLANS, THE MANIFESTO? THAT IS THE BERNIE SANDERS AND AOC MANIFESTO. NORMALLY, WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE WITH COMMUNISTS, HAVEN'T THEY GONE OVER, I DON'T THINK IT IS, THIS IS NO LONGER SOCIALISM, WE ARE DEALING WITH WORSE THAN SOCIALISM. THESE ARE COMMUNISM -- THIS IS COMMUNISM. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH SOCIALISM, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BRINGING THEM TO THE RIGHT, AND THEY STARTED WITH A PLAN AND ARE BRINGING IT FURTHER LEFT. THIS PLAN IS HORRIBLE. CALL IT THE BERNIE MANIFESTO, CRAZY BERNIE. THE ONE THING THEY AGREE ON WITH US HIS TRADE, BECAUSE WE WERE BEING RIPPED OFF BY SO MANY COUNTRIES. I STOPPED A LOT OF IT. I HAD TO DEVOTE A LOT OF TIME TO THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT. NOW YOU SEE HOW FAKE THE IMPEACHMENT WAS. WHAT ABOUT BIDEN'S SON GETTING 3.5 MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW, AND THEN THEY SAY DONALD IS DEALING WITH RUSSIA. DONALD TRUMP, I NEVER EVEN MADE A CALL, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP IS DEALING, THIS GUY GOT $3.5 MILLION FROM THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR? PROBABLY FOR HIS GREAT EXPERIENCE IN ENERGY. BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT. AND THEN IT IS REVEALED YESTERDAY THAT HE GOT A LOT MORE MONEY FROM CHINA AT HE THOUGHT, AND HE GOT A LOT MORE MONEY, THIS IS ALL PERFECT STUFF, IT IS LIKE UNBELIEVABLE, BUT HE GOT A LOT MORE MONEY FROM CHINA, AND THE 100 OR 83 OR $63,000 A MONTH, NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS 180 THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. AND HE GOT AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $3 MILLION FROM UKRAINE. AND THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF ENERGY, BUT HE HAD NONE. THEY SAID, DO YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY? NO, I DON'T UP AT THE KNOW ANYTHING. AND THEN THE FATHER CALLS FOR THE PROSECUTOR, GET HIM OUT OR YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE UNITED STATES. WHOA, THEY GOT HIM OUT, AND HERE IS YOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS NOT A WIT PROBE WHOA, BUT A PERFECT PHONE CALL IS A QUID PRO QUO, WHERE NOTHING WAS UP. IT'S A DISGRACE. HOPEFULLY, WE ARE GETTING ALL THAT STUFF COME, BECAUSE WE HAVE PLENTY. BIDEN'S PLAN FOR MASS AMNESTY WOULD BANKRUPT YOU ARE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. THEY SAY THAT IS GOING TO HURT. BECAUSE THEY GIVE DISINFORMATION. THEY SAY A LIVE, LIKE THE SOLDIERS IN THE GRACE, AND THEY PUT IT IN. CAN YOU IMAGINE. NO ANIMAL I KNOW WOULD SAY THAT. NOBODY. THEY MAKE UP A LIE AND THEY GO WITH IT. SOCIAL SECURITY, THEY SAID FOUR YEARS AGO THEY SAID AGAIN NOW, YOUR SOURCE OR SECURITY, BY THE WAY, WE NEVER TOUCHED IT. THEY SAID, HE WILL DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. NO, THEY WILL DESTROY IT, BECAUSE THEY WILL DESTROY YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE WORTHLESS. THAT IS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, IN JUST THREE POINT FIVE YEARS, WE SECURED AMERICA'S BORDERS, REBUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF THE U.S. MILITARY, OBLITERATED 100 PERCENT OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE, FIXED OUR DISASTROUS TRADE DEALS AND BROUGHT JOBS BACK HOME, AND BACK ONTO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA. UNDER 16 YEARS OF PRESIDENTS OBAMA AND BUSH, HOUSEHOLD INCOME ROLLED ONLY $2945. THESE ARE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOOK. SO 16 YEARS, LESS THAN $3000. IN THREE YEARS, WITH US, IT ROSE $6,483. SO MUCH LESS FOR THEM. AND IF YOU INCLUDE ENERGY SAVINGS, HOW DO YOU LIKE MANGOES TWO DOLLARS FOR GASOLINE? AND YOUR ELECTRIC BILLS, WAY DOWN. WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. IF YOU INCLUDE THAT, IT IS $10,000. THAT IS OVER THREE YEARS, THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WE LEFT AT SIX POINT 6 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, WHICH IS A RECORD. WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND NOW WE ARE VERY RAPIDLY, AND YOU SEE THE NUMBERS, IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER, WE HAVE ADDED A HISTORIC 10.6 MILLION JOBS IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A RECORD LIKE THAT. WE HAVE ADDED MORE JOBS AT ANY TIME IN FOUR MONTHS. NOT EVEN CLOSE. AND TO FIGHT THE CHINA VIRUS, WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. THEY SAID, HOW DID YOU DO IT? I SAID TO GET NA+, BUT I GET A D IN PUBLIC RELATIONS, BECAUSE WERE SO BUSY WORKING, AND WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO THE FAKE NEWS, THEY REPORTED INCORRECTLY, SO I FIGURE, WHAT IS THE USE OF EVEN DEALING WITH THEM? WE DID A JOB, WE GOT THE VENTILATORS THAT NOBODY HAD COME OF THE CUPBOARDS WERE BARE WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE ION AIDED -- WE PIONEERED LIFESAVING THERAPIES, REDUCING THE FIDELITY RIGHT 85% -- THE FATALITY RATE 85% SINCE APRIL. AND EUROPE IS HAVING A BIG SURGE, LOOK AT EUROPE, WE ARE DOING WELL AND WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE A SEARCH. EUROPE HAS HAD ALMOST A 50% GREATER EXCESS MORTALITY RATE THAN THE UNITED STATES. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. OUR EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES THROUGH OPERATION WARP SPEED. WE WILL DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE A VACCINE IN RECORD TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT VERY, VERY SOON. THEY ARE VERY UPSET WITH THE VACCINE. THEY ARE VERY UPSET WITH THE VACCINE BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING TOO SOON. THEY DON'T WANT IT NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT IS SAVING LIVES. IT IS GOING TO SAVE TREMENDOUS LIVES. THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE THERAPIES. THEY JUST WANT TO GET TO THE ELECTION. ONE STATE, DID YOU HEAR THIS, WE ARE GOING TO OPEN HIGH SCHOOLS ON NOVEMBER 6. I TOLD YOU THAT, RIGHT? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, PENNSYLVANIA. YOUR STATE IS GOING TO BE OPEN ON NOVEMBER 4 THIS WAS SOME IDIOT. AND NOW THEY ARE EXCORIATING THIS PERSON WHO SAID IT. THEY ARE EXCORIATING THE PERSON WHO SET IT. WE WILL OPEN OUR SCHOOLS NOVEMBER 6, NOVEMBER 9 THE LATEST. THAT'S NICE. YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR SCHOOLS, OPEN UP YOUR STATE. OPEN IT UP. [APPLAUSE] THE ONES THAT ARE DOING WELL OTHER ONES THAT OPENED AT UP. WE WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS AND OUR OPPONENTS WILL CRUSH AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THEY WILL. THEY WILL DELIVER CRIPPLING SHUTDOWN AND A STEEP -- YOU WILL HAVE, IF SLEEPY JOE BIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT, FIRST OF ALL, A MASSIVE TAX INCREASE. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE INTEREST RATES THROUGH THE CEILING. YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, AND I AM INCLUDING 1929. THAT WAS A PRETTY BAD WHEN. THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I HOPE I DON'T GET A CHANCE TO BE TESTED, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE TESTED. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HIM SAY, I WAS RIGHT, BECAUSE WITH US, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE INCREDIBLE PROSPERITY. WE ARE CUTTING TAXES AND WE ARE GROWING FAST. [APPLAUSE] I AM DELIVERING A SAFE VACCINE IN RECORD TIME. THAT IS THE OTHER THING WITH THE VACCINE, BECAUSE OF ME AND THE FAA, THEY ARE APPROVING THINGS IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A VACCINE IF YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT OBSOLETE PROCESS. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A VACCINE FOR TWO AND A HALF TO FOUR YEARS. ON NOVEMBER 3, PENNSYLVANIA WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE END THE PANDEMIC, DEFEAT THE VIRUS, AND RETURNED TO RECORD PROSPERITY, OR WHETHER WE ALLOW SLEEPY JOE BIDEN TO KILL THE RECOVERY, DELAY A VACCINE, IMPOSE A $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE, DESTROY YOUR SUBURBS. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT ME AND SUBURBS. I KNOCKED DOWN IN THE REGULATION THAT ALLOWS A LOW-INCOME HOUSING IN THE SUBURBS. AND THEN, PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBS DON'T LIKE ME, YOU BETTER LIKE ME, BECAUSE YOUR SUBURBS ARE GOING TO BE SO GREAT. THEY SAY THAT WOMEN IN THE SUBURBS, I MADE THE MISTAKE, I SAID HOUSEWIVES LIVING IN THE SUBURBS. THEY SAID, THAT WAS POLITICALLY INCORRECT. I GOT KILLED FOR THAT. I USED THE TERM HOUSEWIVES. IT IS NOT AN UNACCEPTABLE TERM? THEY ARE ALL ARE SAYING NO. I SAID HOUSEWIVES IN THE SUBURBS AND THEY SAID, WHAT A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY. BUT WOMEN, IT MUST BE POLITICALLY CORRECT, WOMEN AND MEN IN THE SUBURBS, THEY ARE CHANGING THE ZONING SO THEY CAN BUILD. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THEY ARE CHANGING YOUR ZONING. IT WAS A RULE, REGULATION, IT WAS A DISASTER, AND I CALLED MY PEOPLE, I SAID, I WANT TO TERMINATE IT. THEY SAID, WE CAN'T DO THAT, LET'S JUST AMENDED. I SAID NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ENDED IT, I WANT TO TERMINATE IT. YES, SIR. AND WE TERMINATED IT. [APPLAUSE] BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THE FAKE SUBURB POLLS, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBS KNOW THAT I DID THAT. I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW THAT I DID IT. THEY SAY, WE WANT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. WHY? FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE NOT GETTING HIM UP. YOU'RE GETTING THIS MANIAC WHO IS FALLING LIKE A ROCK IN THE POLLS. HE PICKED SOMEBODY THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE PICKED. SHE WAS SO BAD TO HIM, SHE SAID SUCH BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM. AND ON TOP OF IT, 15, 14, 13, 10, 8, 7, THEN SHE WENT BACK UP TO EIGHT, HAD A BIG WEEK, THEN SHE WENT BACK DOWN. AS SHE GOT OUT AT ONE OR TWO. SHE QUIT BEFORE IOWA. AND THEN THEY HAD THE IOWA PRIMARIES, AND BECAUSE THEY USE THESE CRAZY BALLOTS, NOBODY EVER FOUND OUT WHO ONE RATE AND OTHER WANT TO USE THEM ON A SCALE THAT IS 1000 TIMES BIGGER FOR OUR COUNTRY, 80 MILLION BALLOTS. 80 MILLION BALLOTS. THEY COULDN'T COUNT A SMALL NUMBER BUT NOW THEY COUNT. AND THEN THEY HAD THE RACE IN NEW YORK, CAROLYN MALONEY, TERRIBLE CONGRESSWOMAN, AND THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE GUY THAT WAS BEATING HER, OR WOULD HAVE BEAT HER. BUT THEY ARE MISSING MASSIVE. SOME SAY THEY ARE MISSING 1%. WHICH WOULD BE TERRIBLE. YOU CAN WIN BY 1%. YOU CAN WIN BY 1/10 OF 1%. THERE WAS ONE AREA WHERE 41% OF THE BALLOTS WERE MISSING. 41. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER. ALL I AM ASKING IS PEOPLE GO UP TO VOTE, GO OUT TO VOTE, AND STOP WITH THIS NONSENSE, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE COUNTING BALLOTS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I DON'T WANT TO END UP IN THE SUPREME COURT AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO CONGRESS EITHER. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IF WE GO BACK TO CONGRESS. DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THAT? I THINK IT IS 26-22 ARE SOMETHING, BECAUSE IT IS COUNTED ONE VOTE PER STATE. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. THEY ARE GOING TO BE THRILLED TO HEAR THAT. I AM SURE THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, HOW CAN WE BREAK THAT ONE? BIDEN WANTS TO CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS AND INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN. WITH POISONOUS ANTI-AMERICAN LIES IN SCHOOLS. TO COMBAT THE TOXIC, LEFT-WING PROPAGANDA IN SCHOOLS, I ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING A PRO AMERICA LESSON LAND FOR STUDENTS CALLED THE 1776 COMMISSION. WE WILL TEACH HER CHILDREN ABOUT THE TRUTH OF AMERICA, THAT WE ARE THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL NATION ON THE FACE OF THE OATH, AND WE ARE GETTING BETTER. WE ARE GETTING BETTER. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE HAVE EVER HAD. I USED TO SAY COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, 20, 2016, THAT WAS PRETTY EXCITING, RIGHT? WAS THAT THE COOLEST NIGHT? TRUMP IS WINNING FLORIDA. HE IS WINNING NORTH CAROLINA. HE IS WINNING PENNSYLVANIA. HE IS WINNING MICHIGAN. HE IS WINNING WISCONSIN. HE IS WINNING EVERYTHING. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, AND PEOPLE CRYING, CRYING, THE ANCHORS, NONBIASED ANCHORS, THEY ARE CRYING. I WATCHED AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSON ON MSNBC, SLEEPY JOE WAS ON, AND SHE IS, DID YOU SEE THAT ON TV? AS HE IS VERY TOUGH, VERY TOUGH, VERY NASTY, AND SHE IS FEEDING HIM CANNED ANSWERS, AND ISN'T IT TRUE, ISN'T IT TRUE TRUMP IS A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING? YES, AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE, IT IS TRUE. THIS WAS THE WORST, MOST OBVIOUS, AND THIS WAS A KILLER, THIS PERSON IS VERY TOUGH. IT IS SO BIG. THE WHOLE THING IS RIGGED. WITH GOT TO BEAT THE SYSTEM, AND WE ARE BEATING THE SYSTEM. SOMETIMES I WILL LOOK AND I WILL HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE OFFICE, A CORRUPT MEDIA PERSON, AND I WILL BE COMPLAINING HOW UNFAIR IT IS AND I WILL BE SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAYING HOW UNFAIR IT IS AND I WOULD LOOK AROUND THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAY WAIT A MINUTE, WE ARE IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND YOU ARE NOT. [APPLAUSE] AND I STOPPED COMPLAINING, MIKE. AND I SAID, THIS IS THE OVAL OFFICE, ISN'T IT? JOE BIDEN HAS SURRENDERED HIS PARTY TO THE FLAG BURNERS, RIOTERS, ANTI-POLICE RADICALS, AND ARCUS -- ANARCHISTS, HIS RUNNING MATE DONATED TO A FUND THAT BAILED OUT RIOTERS FROM JAIL, INCLUDING A COP KILLER, LET'S GET THEM OUT OF JAIL. 13 MEMBERS OF BIDEN'S STAFF DONATED TO THE SAME FUND. THEY DONATED A LOT OF MONEY. WE WANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE OUT. YOU SAW WHAT WE DID IN MINNEAPOLIS. THEY CALL THIS A WEEK TOO LATE. WE WENT IN. ABOUT A HALF-HOUR, IT WAS OVER. WE BROUGHT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. WE TOLD SEATTLE, WE ARE COMING, AND THEY LEFT THAT NIGHT. WE WERE ALSO AGO IN. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. WE WERE GOING TO MAKE A BIG STATEMENT, BUT WE COULDN'T, BECAUSE THEY SAID OK, THEY LEFT. SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD THEM. NEXT TIME, DON'T TELL THEM. AND IF YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND, WHAT A MESS, RIGHT? WHAT A MESS. CHICAGO IS A MESS. NEW YORK, WHAT THEY LET HAPPEN TO NEW YORK. THAT WE HAVE THESE GREAT POLICE IN CHICAGO AND NEW YORK. THEY CAN DO THE JOB. JUST LET THEM DO THE JOB. IT'S TERRIBLE. [APPLAUSE] BUT PORTLAND IS ANDA RCHISTS. AND LASTLY, THEY SHOT A MAN IN THE STREET, I WON'T EVEN SAY LIKE WHAT BECAUSE HIS PARENTS ARE SO DEVASTATED. AND THEY SHOT HIM. THIS ONE GUY. THIS ANIMAL. AND THEY RAN OVER HIS HAT. NOT OUR HAPPY WAS ANOTHER NOT. IT WAS A CHRISTIAN HAT. HE WAS A CHRISTIAN. IT WAS A CHRISTIAN. AND THEY SHOT HIM, KILLED HIM INSTANTLY. AT THE SKY SHOT HIM, EVERYBODY KNEW WHO HE WAS. I SAID AFTER TWO DAYS, WHERE IS HE? DID YOU ARREST HIM? IF YOU ARREST THEM? AND THEN THEY PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHY DIDN'T YOU ARREST HIM? IN THE U.S. MARSHALLS SOUGHT, THEY WENT IN, HE PULLED A GUN ON THEM, AND 15 MINUTES, IT WAS ALL OVER. NONE OF OUR GUYS WERE HURT. THIS GUY WAS A STONE COLD KILLER, AND YET THEY SAY HE WAS A PROTESTER. NOT A PROTESTER. AND ANARCHISTS -- AN ANARCHIST AND A KILLER. ON THE U.S. MARSHALS, THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE JOB THEY DID, BRAVE. AND THE US MARSHALS COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO EASILY, COULD PUT THEM IN THERE SO EASY, BUT THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT THEM. AND FOR YEARS, THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN PORTLAND. I SAID, WHAT DID THE STREETS LOOK LIKE? THEY SAID, YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE. PEOPLE PUT UP TWO BY FOUR STOREFRONTS, THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY NEW BECAUSE THEY KNOW SOMEBODY'S GOING TO KNOCK THEM DOWN INTO WEEKS. IT IS A TERRIBLE THING. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WARREN COPS IS PUTTING POLICE OFFICERS AT RISK. -- THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WAR ON COPS IS PUTTING POLICE OFFICERS AT RISK. I WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING] YOU SEE HOW MUCH THE PEOPLE LOVE YOU? THEY REALLY DO. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. BUT THE PEOPLE LOVE AND RESPECT THE YOU DO. BUT YOU DON'T HEAR IT BECAUSE THE MANIACS BACK HERE, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WRITING. BUT THEY LOVE AND RESPECT YOU SO MUCH, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT THAT IS WHY LAW-ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, ALL ORGANIZATIONS, THAT IS WHY THEY ARE ENDORSING MAY AND STRONGLY OPPOSING MY OPPONENT ON THE RADICAL LEFT. ON MY OPPONENT IS CONTROLLED LIKE A PUPPET BY THESE PEOPLE, BY THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. I'M PROUD TO HAVE RECEIVED THE FIRST-EVER UNANIMOUS ENDORSEMENT FROM THE LARGEST POLICE UNION IN THE WORLD, THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE. [APPLAUSE] LARGEST IN THE WORLD. AND WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY THEIR PRESIDENT, A FANTASTIC GUY, FRIEND OF MINE. PAT YOST AND SEVERAL HUNDRED OF THEIR BRAVE OFFICERS. PAT, COME ON UP. COME ON UP. WOW. WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

A SET I KNOW, I CAN TELL, I SEE PEOPLE WITH TRUMP STUFF ON THAT NEVER CARED ABOUT A POLITICIAN IN THEIR LIFE. AND THEY GET THE HAPPENED THE SASH AND THE BELT AND THE SHOES. HE SET OF NEVER SEEN. HE CALLED IT A LONG TIME AGO. FORMER CONGRESSMAN, WE ARE GOING TO GET HIM BACK IN I GUESS, HE LEFT BECAUSE HE HAD A LOT OF THINGS TO DO, BUT HE IS FANTASTIC. WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM BACK. LOU BARLETTA.

THAT'S A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE, THANK YOU, ALL. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT VICTORY. LAWRENCE, YOU AGREE WITH ME, RIGHT? GREAT VICTORY. BIGGER EVEN THAN FOUR YEARS AGO. THAT WAS GOOD. REMEMBER, WE WOULDN'T -- THEY WOULDN'T EVEN ANNOUNCEMENT? SOME PEOPLE THAT -- REMEMBER, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN ANNOUNCE IT. NOW I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN I EVER SAID I WOULD. BUT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF NUMBERS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY SURPRISED BY. WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER HIS 47 YEARS IN POLITICS, ALONG WITH HIS OTHER FRIENDS. HE CHAMPIONED EVERY GLOBALIST BETRAYAL OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR A MOST HALF A CENTURY. HE SUPPORTED NAFTA. GOT RID OF THAT ONE. SOUTH KOREA. RENEGOTIATED THAT ONE. TPP. GOT OUT OF THAT ONE. IN CHINA' ENTRY INTO THE WORLD -- AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HE SAID WAS A WONDERFUL THING. NO IT WASN'T E-READER WAS A TERRIBLE THING. THAT IS WHEN CHINA TOOK OFF LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. CHINA WAS GOING TO OVERTAKE US, THEY SAID 2019. GUESS WHAT? WE WAY OUT DID THEM IN 2018 AND 2019, AND WE PICKED UP. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SMART, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY SMART, BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SMART IN THIS POSITION, YOUR PRESIDENT, THEY WILL NEVER OVERTAKE YOU. THERE WILL NEVER, EVER OVERTAKE, THEY HAVE MORE PEOPLE, BUT THEY WILL NEVER OVERTAKE YOU IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SMART. BIDEN'S CHINA DEAL WIPED OUT ONE THIRD OF YOUR STATE'S MANUFACTURING JOBS. BIDEN SHOULDN'T BE ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE, HE SHOULD BE BEGGING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. IN A TRUE SENSE, THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA AND CHINA, OR WHATEVER STATE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND CHINA. BUT WE ARE DOING WELL. IT'S INTERESTING. WE SIGNED A GREAT DEAL. FARMERS HAVE DONE MORE BUSINESS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS. THE BIGGEST ORDERS EVER COME A BIGGEST SOYBEANS, BIGGEST CAPITAL, BIGGEST BEEF ORDERS, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH TO ME. THE INK WASN'T EVEN DRY WHEN THE PLANE CAME OVER, IT WASN'T EVEN DRY. IT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT IT MEANT. WE MADE A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED IT FROM COMING HERE. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS, AND HUNTER WINS. WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? HE WALKS INTO CHINA HAD WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE. AT THE MOST SOPHISTICATED GUYS ON WALL STREET, I KNOW THEM, THEY ARE SMART, AND THEY CAN'T DO THAT. IT TOOK THEM 10 MINUTES TO WALK OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE AND MAKE LIENS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON THAT WHEN WE WIN BIG, PENNSYLVANIA WINS IN AMERICA WINS AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING EERIE FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS AND COUNTRIES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF, AND OFFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS. BUT NOW, WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES AND BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA WHERE THEY BELONG. NOW, OUR OPPONENTS ARE PLEDGING TO REJOIN THE JOB-KILLING PARIS CLIMATE CORD, DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT WAS MEANT TO HURT US. IT WAS MEANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. WE WOULD HAVE SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. YOU WOULD HAVE ENDED UP CLOSING A LOT OF YOUR PLANTS AND FACTORIES. AND I SAID, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS CRAZY DEAL, AND I DID THEY SAID, I'M GOING TO KILL ME. YOU KNOW WHAT, THE PEOPLE GOT IT. THEY UNDERSTOOD IT. IT WAS RIPPING OFF OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE HAVE THINGS THEY DON'T HAVE, LIKE UNBELIEVABLE WEALTH UNDER OUR GROUND. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WITHDREW FROM THAT CATASTROPHE BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR PENNSYLVANIA, NOT FOR PARIS. AND WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. FROM DAY ONE, I PUT AMERICA FIRST. TO DEFEND OUR WORKERS, I IMPOSED TARIFFS ON FOREIGN ALUMINUM AND FOREIGN STEEL. I SAVED OUR AUTO INDUSTRY BY WITHDRAWING FROM THE HORRIBLE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT WOULD HAVE KILLED. WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR MICHIGAN, IN PARTICULAR, ALSO PENNSYLVANIA, BUT WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR THEM WITH AUTOS, THEY GET IT. THEY ARE BUILDING 17 OR EXPANDING 17 PLANTS. THEY HADN'T BUILT ONE IN 42 YEARS, AND WE ARE BUILDING A LOT OF THEM. WE HAVE COUNTRIES, WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH US, GOING TO BUILD AUTO PLANTS. I ENDED THE NAFTA NIGHTMARE AND SIGNED A BRAND-NEW U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW, WHICH IS GREAT. AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE LOSING COMPANIES TO MEXICO AND CANADA, VERY DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM TO DO THAT. I TOOK THE TOUGHEST TYPE AND NUMBER ACTION TO STAND UP TO CHINA'S RAMPANT THEFT OF PENNSYLVANIA JOBS. I PROBABLY SIGNED A HISTORIC EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING IT OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT POLICY TO BUY AMERICAN AND HIGHER AMERICAN -- BY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN. I WATCHED BIDEN TWO WEEKS AGO, THIS LID, YOU KNOW WHAT A LID IS? HE KEEPS PUTTING THIS LID, IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING, LID MEANS YOU ARE OUT FOR THE DAY, THAT MEANS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA CAN GO HOME. HE'S GOT THE EASIEST JOB I EVER SEEN. THEY NEVER HAVE TO WORK. MEDIA, PLEASE GO HOME, THERE WON'T BE ANY ACTIVITY FROM SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. HE IS A LOW-ENERGY INDIVIDUAL. YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WITH A LOT OF ENERGY. YOU ARE DEALING WITH PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA, KIM JONG-UN, REMEMBER, WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAR? WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THAT NUCLEAR WAR. PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN NUCLEAR. BUT LOOK AT IT. GETTING ALONG WITH THESE FOREIGN NATIONS IS NOT A BAD THING. THEY SAID, HE GETS ALONG, YEAH. OBAMA TOLD ME THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAD WAS NORTH KOREA. HE TOLD ME LOTS OF FOUR-STORY SPIRIT AND I SAID, HAVE YOU TRIED CALLING HIM? AND I GOT NOMINATED FOR TWO NOBEL PEACE PRIZE'S. [APPLAUSE] CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ONE IS FOR ISRAEL AND BAHRAIN AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, AND BY THE WAY, MANY COUNTRIES ARE COMING IN. THEY ARE ONGOING, WANT TO COME IN. THEY ARE ALL COMING IN. NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. WE REVERSED IT. IT'S OUT OF COMMON SENSE, WHAT WE DID. WE'VE REVERSED IT. AND MANY COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO COME IN. AND I TOLD THE STORY, I GOT ONE FOR KOSOVO AND SERBIA. THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING EACH OTHER FOR MANY YEARS. JUST KILLING EACH OTHER. THEY DON'T GET ALONG. THEY ARE LIKE THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAEL. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH BOTH OF THEM. I SAID TO THEM, WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING AND KILLING EACH OTHER? THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCE I GUESS. I SAID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AND WE TRADE WITH BOTH, SO WE HAVE CERTAIN POWER. I SAID LET'S GET THE DEAL, LET'S MAKE ECONOMIC PEACE AND ULTIMATELY PEACE. THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE, THE OVAL OFFICE, TO SIGN. THEY WERE HUGGING, THEY WERE SO, IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE. WE SAVED A LOT OF LIVES. AND I TOLD THIS LAST NIGHT, I SAID TO MY GREAT FIRST LADY, OUR RATE FIRST LADY A -- OUR GREAT FIRST LADY, MILANI F. I SAID, FIRST LADY, I'M GOING TO WATCH TELEVISION TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO COME HOME EARLY. 6:30 IS VERY EARLY. I STAY IN BED LATE. BUT I'M GOING TO COME HOME EARLY, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT A GREAT JOB I JUST GOT, NOMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. AND WE ARE GOING TO SIT THERE AND I AM JUST GOING TO SOAK IT IN, DARLING. LET'S TURN ON NBC FAKE NEWS. LESTER HOLT. NUMBER-TWO RATED SHOW. HE IS NUMBER TWO. HE'S HEADED SOUTH. I FIND NBC TO BE WORSE THAN THE OTHER FAILURE. THEY SPEND ALL THAT MONEY ON THEIR PR. BECAUSE WHEN OBAMA GOT IT, NOBODY KNEW WHAT HE GOT IT FOR, INCLUDING HIM. THIS, WHAT DID YOU GET IT FOR? I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE TO WORK HARDER. HE GOT A NOBEL PRIZE AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY HE GOT IT. THEN HE STARTED DROPPING BOMBS ON SOMEPLACE TWO WEEKS LATER THE DIDN'T WORK OUT. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT BECAUSE HE HAD JOHN KERRY NEGOTIATING. HE WAS THE WORST. INCOMPETENT. SO SAD, IRAN, THAT HORRIBLE DEAL. THAT WAS A FAST PLANE. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE NEW ONES WE JUST BOUGHT. WE HAVE ALL NEW EQUIPMENT. THAT WAS SCARY. IF I'M THE ENEMY, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT SOUND. BUT I SAID TO OUR FIRST LADY, FIRST LADY, TURN ON THE TELEVISION, TURN IT ON, DARLING, IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG EVENING. I WOULD TOAST YOU, BUT I DON'T DRINK, DARLING. I JUST DON'T RANK. SO WE TURN IT ON, AND THEN DATE -- AND THEY DID A STORY ON THE WEATHER, RAINING HEAVILY IN A CERTAIN AREA, THEN THEY DID A STORY AND SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING ELSE, ANOTHER STORY ON SOMETHING IN A COMMERCIAL THAT LASTED NINE MINUTES. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE MONEY. THEY ARE USING OUR FREE AIRWAVES TO MAKE FAKE NEWS. THINK ABOUT THAT. THEY ARE USING OUR FREE AIRWAVES. THINK ABOUT THAT. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT. WHY ARE THEY USING FREE AIRWAVES TO GIVE FAKE NEWS? IT CAME TO THE END AND I SAID, DARLING, I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. BUT THE FOLLOWING DAY, I GOT NOMINATED FOR ANOTHER ONE. I TOLD HER. I SAID, LET'S GO HOME AND TURN ON THE TELEVISION. THEY HAD ANOTHER STORY, THIS TIME THEY ARE CLEANING UP, ANOTHER ONE, ANOTHER ONE, ANOTHER ONE, THE COMMERCIAL, IT NEVER ENDED, GOT BACK, A TINY PIECE COMMAND THEY DIDN'T COVER TWO NOBEL PRIZES. I GOT TWO IN ONE WEEK. AND MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS, I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SEVEN OR EIGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS, SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER. I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SEVEN. BUT THE FAKE NEWS NEVER EVEN PUT IT ON. AND SOMEBODY ELSE HAD A SHOW AND SAID, THE AMOUNT OF TIME DEVOTED TO DONALD TRUMP'S NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, TWO OF THEM, ON THE NETWORKS, ZERO. 0. AND THE IMAGE OF TIME DEVOTED TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS NEGATIVE FOR SOMEBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LIKE INFINITE. IT IS SO DISGRACEFUL. THEY ARE SO BAD. BUT WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP ON WINNING. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WAITING. KEEP ON WINNING. KEEP ON WINNING. [APPLAUSE] SEE, THEY WILL TELL THAT STORY DIFFERENTLY. THEY WANT TELL IT AS WE DO IT IN FUN, IF YOU CAN'T LAUGH, YOU WOULD BE OUT OF HERE FAST. LIKE BETO WHEN HE SAID, I WAS BORN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE WAS ON A MAGAZINE, FAKE MAGAZINE, VANITY FAIR, IT IS DYING. THOSE MAGAZINES ARE GOING DOWN FAST. BUT HE WAS ON A FAKE MAGAZINE, VANITY FAIR I THINK, AND HE STARTED SAYING HE HAD A GOOD WEEK, GOOD WEEK, AND HE STARTED SAYING, I WAS BORN, I WAS BORN TO DO THIS, WAS BORN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I SAID, HE'S NOT GOING TO LAST LONG, AND TWO WEEKS LATER IT WAS OVER. HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF TAKING YOUR GUNS AWAY BY BIDEN, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? THEY KNOW. BETO. WHERE DOES THE BETO COME FROM? ANOTHER PHONY DEAL THERE. TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS DURING THE PANDEMIC, I SUSPENDED THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN WORKERS WHO THREATENED U.S. JOBS. AND WE WILL ALWAYS CARE FOR OUR CITIZENS FIRST. [APPLAUSE] BIDEN'S PLEDGE TO TERMINATE THESE PROTECTIONS AND TO GIVE AWAY YOUR JOBS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE ACHIEVED OF THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN HISTORY, AND WE'RE JUST FINISHING THAT BEAUTIFUL WALL. THAT WALL, 340 MILES. WE HUNDRED 40. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE WALL. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE WALL. I GOT SUED BY NANCY PELOSI, CRAZY NANCY, I GOT SUED. I MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE ON THE WALL. I SAID WE HAVE TO BUILD THE WALL, BUILD THE WALL, BUILT THE WALL. I SHOULD HAVE SAID VERY SIMPLY, WE WILL NOT BUILD THE WALL. THE MONEY WOULD HAVE COME POURING IN. [APPLAUSE] THEY WOULD HAVE INSISTED THAT WE BUILD IT. AND WALLS WORK. REMEMBER THE SIDEWALLS DON'T WORK? WALLS DON'T WORK. THEY WANT TO GIVE US DRONES SO WE CAN WATCH THE PEOPLE POOR ACROSS THE BORDER. DRONES. PUT A DRONE A HALF-MILE UP IN THE AIR AND YOU CAN WATCH EVERYBODY COME INTO THE UNITED STATES. REMEMBER THAT? I SAY IT ALL THE TIME, WHEN YOU ARE A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST, YOU DEVELOP A NEW CHIP, A NEW LAPTOP OR COMPUTER, IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS, IT IS OBSOLETE READ IT IS WORTHLESS. THE WALL WILL NEVER BE OBSOLETE. WHAT ELSE WON'T BE OBSOLETE? A WHEEL. TWO THINGS WILL NEVER BE OBSOLETE, AWOL WALL AND A WHEEL. EVERYTHING ELSE GOES. NO, WE ARE UP TO 330 MILES. WE ARE AVERAGING 10 MILES A WEEK. IT IS EVERYTHING THE BORDER PATROL NEEDS. I SAID, CAN YOU GIVE ME A LESS-EXPENSIVE VERSION, PLEASE? BUT WE HAVE A GREAT BALL GOING AND IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON, BUT THE PRESS DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE WALL ANYMORE. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK. IT'S NOT A GOOD SUBJECT FOR THEM. SINCE 2017, ICE ARRESTED HALF A MILLION CRIMINAL ALIENS WITH ILLEGAL RECORDS, OVER 40,000 SEX OFFENSES AND 5000 KILLERS. I WANT TO THANK ICE. BOY, THEY GET BEAT UP BY THE MEDIA. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. YOU WOULD HAVE, THINK OF IT, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THEY TAKE OUT OF YOUR. REAL BAD ONES, MURDERERS, KILLERS, DRUG DEALERS. BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS, ZERO DEPORTATIONS, THAT IS IN THE MANIFESTO, AND SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE. THEY PROTECT THE CRIMINAL, NOT OUR PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT TO END SANCTUARY CITIES, YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE AND THAT IS VOTE REPUBLICAN. YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT IS. ALL THESE PLACES THAT YOU ARE READING ABOUT, ALL OF THEM, THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES AND STATES. ALL OF THEM. THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRAT-RUN, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO LAW & ORDER. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL US AND WE WILL BE INCOME OF BUT THEY HAVE NO LAW & ORDER. THEY HAVE NOTHING. THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRAT RUN. THEY ARE A DISASTER. WE INVESTED 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE U.S. MILITARY AND LAUNCHED THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF THE ARMED FORCES IN NEARLY 75 YEARS, THE SPACE FORCE. [APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. I DID MORE IN 47 MONTHS THAN SLEEPY JOE BIDEN DID IN 47 YEARS. IT'S TRUE. WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, AL BAGHDADI. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S NUMBER-ONE TERRORIST AND MASS MURDER OF TROOPS AND OTHERS, SOLEIMANI. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. THEY PAID $150 BILLION FOR NOTHING. THEY GOT NOTHING. I WOULDN'T MIND THE 150. THEY GAVE $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. THAT WOULD FILL UP THIS WHOLE AREA. 1.8. LANE LOADS OF CASH. THAT IS WHEN I REALIZED A PRESIDENT IS VERY POWERFUL. WHEN YOU CAN SEND THAT MONEY TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND NO FRIEND, IT'S CRAZY. I KEPT MY PROMISE, RECOGNIZED THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHO LIKES THAT THE MOST? THE EVANGELICALS LIKE IT THE MOST. THE EVANGELICALS LOVE IT. WE WERE JUST WITH FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND A LOT OF BIG PEOPLE, THEY HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL EVENT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT. IT WAS GREAT. FRANKLIN GRAHAM. ALL THE TOP EVANGELICAL AND OTHER LEADERS. THEY WERE GREAT. THEY WERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE CEREMONY TODAY WITH THE JUSTICE. I ALSO RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND INSTEAD OF ENDLESS WARS, WE ARE FORGING PEACE ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. AND IT IS COSTING NOTHING, COSTING NOTHING. WE ARE NOT KILLING PEOPLE. NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. THEY ARE TIRED OF FIGHTING, BY THE WAY, JUST IN CASE. EVEN PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO FIGHT, THEY ARE TIRED. 19 YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN, THEY ARE TIRED. THEY'LL WANT TO RELAX, AS TOUGH -- THEY ALL WANT TO RELAX, AS TOUGH AS THEY MAY BE. JOE BIDEN OPPOSED TO THE MISSION TO TAKE OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN, HE OPPOSED SOLEIMANI, HE BACKED THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, A HORROR SHOW, AND HATRED THE RISE OF CHINA AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES. NOT SO POSITIVE. NOW, BIDEN IS PUSHING THE MOST FAR-LEFT PLATFORM IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE BIDEN PLAN WOULD DESTROY SOCIAL AND PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY WANT TO GO SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. GO TO A HOSPITAL AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. GET RID OF 180 MILLION PRIVATE PLANS THAT PEOPLE LOVE. HE WOULD TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BAN ON JIHADIST REGIONS AND INCREASE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS 700 PERCENT, OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST. HE WANTS TO BAN SCHOOL CHOICE AND THEN CHARTER SCHOOLS, TERRIBLE. IN A SECOND TERM, I WILL PROVIDE SCHOOL CHOICE TO PARENT IN AMERICA. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES, GREAT JOBS, AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS READ IN CONCLUSION, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD, AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL MAKE OUR MEDICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. SECOND AMENDMENT SECOND AMENDMENT. WE WILL STRIKE DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS, AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA OUT OF THESE ENDLESS, RIDICULOUS, STUPID FOREIGN WARS AND COUNTRIES YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND AND SHORT PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, $2.5 TRILLION, WE HAVE WEAPONS, JUST TO TALK ABOUT THEM, THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE, THE POWER, THE STRENGTH, THE INCREDIBLE TALENT AND ENGINEERING. WE HAVE WEAPONS THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE SO FAR ADVANCED OVER EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, AND HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE THEM. AND WHEN I GOT HERE, WE WERE A DEPLETED, TIRED MILITARY WITH GREAT PEOPLE, BUT WE WERE EXHAUSTED. WE HAD OLD JET FIGHTERS, NOW WE HAVE BRAND-NEW F-35'S THAT ARE STEALTH. I ASKED THE PILOT, HOW GOOD OF THESE PLANES COMPARED TO THE ENEMY? AND HE SAID, WHEN DIFFERENCE, YOU CAN'T SEE OUR PLANES. AND I SAID, THAT HELPS, AND HE SAID, IT REALLY HELPS. THE GUY LOOKED LIKE TOM CRUISE, BUT BETTER. TOM CRUISE, BUT STRONGER. WE WILL END SURPRISED MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND FURTHER REDUCE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE THE FIRST NATION TO LEND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS, VERY SOON. AND NASA HAS BECOME THE PREEMINENT SPACE CENTER AGAIN, IN THE WORLD. IT WAS TIRED. IT WAS OVER. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, ON A ROBBER HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. FOUR YEARS, YOU HAD A PRESIDENT TO APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA.

I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA. AND TOOK OUT MONEY FROM CHINA. THEN HE GOT THE 183 , $183,000 A MONTH. IT ANYBODY LIKE THAT JOB? YOU DO NOT HAVE A JOB. YOU'D NOT APPLIED , YOU ARE NOT EMPLOYED.

WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE PROSECUTOR, WE WILL SEND YOU THE MONEY. THEY GOT RID OF THE PROSECUTOR AND HE SAID NOW, THE MONEY COMES. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I DID THAT? AND PRESS DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND CHRIS WALLACE, HE SAYS, WE DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS THAT. REALLY, CHRIS? IT IS SO SAD. IT IS SO HYPOCRITICAL, SO SAD. THIS IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY, ECONOMIC SECURITY, JOE BIDEN GOT RICH WHILE THE AMERICAN WORKERS GOT ROBBED. HOW CAN YOU DEAL WITH CHINA A FEW TAKE OUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND MAKE SOME , MAKE ALL SORTS OF MONEY. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF A YEAR THEY PAID US AND I GIVE A LOT THATTO THE FARMERS. A CRITICAL ISSUE SELECTION OF THE MINNESOTA IRON RANGE. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GET TOGETHER BUT THEY SAID SIR, THOUSANDS OF WANT TO SHOW. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN IRON RANGE GET TOGETHER. BIDEN HAS 30 PEOPLE AT THOSE CIRCLES. THEY WERE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER. I SENT HIM A NOTE. TOO CLOSE, VERY POOR PEOPLE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. AND YET, HE COMPLAINS ABOUT OUR RALLIES THIS WAS GOING TO BE A QUICKIE TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS, BECAUSE OBAMA CLOSED THE ION RANGE, AND I OPENED IT. , IRON RANGE, AND I OPENED IT. A TOUGH MAN CAME UP TO ME, A CONSTRUCTION WORKER, A REAL WORKER, AND HE LOOKED AT ME , THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO. HE SAID, SIR, YOU HAVE GIVEN US BACK OUR LIFE. HE WAS CRYING. I SAID YOU NEVER CRIED WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BABY THIS IS NOT A CRIER. THE SKY WAS TOUGH AS HELL , THIS GUY WAS TOUGH AS HELL. JOE WILL REINSTITUTE THAT BAN IN TWO MINUTES.

THEY SAY WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW? A LOT OF IRON OVER THE YEARS, THEY SAY IT'S THE GREATEST IRON ORE IN THE WORLD. THE IRON RANGE CAME ROARING BACK, JUST THING I DID WAS KNOCK OUT HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SO MANY OF THE THINGS HE DID. HE CAN'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. DUTY SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FBI TODAY? COMEY EITHER HAS THE WORST MEMORY AND HISTORY, HE SAID I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. CAN YOU GO FOR A COUP? DID YOU GO FOR A COUP? UH, I DON'T REMEMBER. WE CAUGHT HIM COLD. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS. IT'S ENOUGH. WE HAVE PLENTY OF INFORMATION ON THESE CROOKS. A BUNCH OF CROOKS. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS. WE RESCINDED THE FEDERAL WITHDRAWAL. YOU ALL ABOUT IT , JOE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT. WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR MINNESOTA. IF I LOSE MINNESOTA, I AM NUMBER , I AM NEVER COMING BACK. PROTECTED IRON RANGE WORKERS FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION TO GET IRON ORE TO MARKET QUICKLY, WE FIXED THE LOCKS. AS THINGS WERE SO OLD AND BROKEN, NOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE SHORTLY FIXATE. I OPENED UP FOR COPPER, NICKEL MINING, OH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT SOUNDED A LITTLE FAR OUT. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE DECAYING LINE THREE PIPELINE. IT'S ALL DONE. ALL OF THIS IS WHY NINE DEMOCRAT MAYORS I'VE ENDORSED ME OVERSLEEP JOE BIDEN , OVER SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. WHERE ARE THEY? WOW. [APPLAUSE] WE HAD A CEREMONY A MONTH AGO WHERE I INTRODUCED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. I AM NOT INTRODUCING YOU AGAIN, IT IS FREEZING OUT YOUR GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT MAYORS, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT VERY MUCH. THESE ARE DEMOCRAT MAYORS THAT SUPPORT TRUMP. EVERYTHING IN GOOD SHAPE, RIGHT? IT IS A GREAT HONOR. IF JOE BGETS IN, THE RADICAL LEFT WILL SHUT DOWN THE IRON RANGE FOREVER. NOT EASY TO OPEN A THING LIKE THAT. EARLIER TODAY, I TOOK ANOTHER HISTORIC STEP PROVIDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO JUMPSTART PRODUCTION OF MINERALS THAT WILL CREATE COUNTLESS JOBS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTRY. MINERALS. [APPLAUSE] I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. I WILL DO THAT. IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME. WE ALMOST WON IT. ONE MORE SPEECH. I HAD A CHOICE. DO I DO MICHIGAN? I SHOULD HAVE DONE THEM BOTH. ONE MORE SPEECH. THINK ABOUT. IT HAS NOT BEEN WON BY A REPUBLICAN. I DO NOT GET BY BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE SUCH A PATHETIC JOB. HAS NOT BEEN WON SINCE 1972. REAGAN LOST IT, THE ONLY STATE HE LOST. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT. ANOTHER MASSIVE ISSUE FOR MINNESOTA IS THE ELECTION OF JOE BIDEN'S PLAN TO INUNDATE YOUR STATE WITHIN HISTORIC FLOOD , WITHIN HISTORIC FLOO AN HISTORIC FLOOD OF REFUGEES. INGRID ON THE MEDIFAST OUTCOME OF THE FACT CHECKED AND FIND OUT HE MADE A SLIGHT MISTAKE. THE WORST THING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. HE PLEDGED A 700% INCREASE IN REFUGEES. 700%. CONGRATULATIONS, MINNESOTA. CONGRATULATIONS. NO. WHAT ABOUT OMAR WHEN SHE GETS HOT HARVESTING? , COP HARVESTING? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH OMAR? I'VE BEEN READING FOR YEARS ABOUT HOW CORRUPT SHE IS. HARVESTING IS TERRIBLE, BUT THAT IS THE LEAST OF THINGS SHE HAS DONE. AND THEN SHE TELLS US HOW TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. HOW THE HELL DID MINNESOTA ELECT HER? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? THESE GUYS, STAND UP. ARE YOU A BIG FAN OF OMAR? WE SKY. NOBODY IS GOING TO FIGHT HIM. , LOOK AT THIS GUY. NOBODY'S GOING TO FIGHT HIM. AOC ALSO, IT'S TIME.

INUNDATING YOUR HOSPITALS. YOU KNOW THAT. IT IS A DISGRACE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO YOUR STATE. IT IS A DISGRACE. BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BAN ON JIHADIST REGIONS OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST. REMEMBER WE USED TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME? REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD GET A BAN? THEY SAID HE LOST, HE LOST. I WANT TO THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY DID BEEN REPORTED. AND THEY SAY STILL THAT HE LOST. BUT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST TWO. THEY FORGET TO SAY THAT SUPREME COURT , IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE. IT IS A LOT. THEY LOVE IT. EVERY TIME I AM GETTING READY, THE LIGHTS , EVERY TIME I AM GETTING READY TO HIT THEM, THE LIGHTS JUST GO OFF. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS KEEPING CRIMINALS , WE ARE KEEPING CRIMINALS OUT OF MINNESOTA. WE ENDED THE REFUGEE INFLUX INTO YOUR STATE. ONE OF THE MOST HARD-HIT STATES FOR WHATEVER REASON. DID YOU KNOW THAT? IS ANYBODY KNOW , DID ANYBODY KNOW? I DON'T THINK THEY TELL YOU ABOUT IT. THEY TALK ABOUT WOMEN IN SUBURBS. I ENDED A REGULATION THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE DONE. JUST SO WE CAN GET THIS RACE, 30% OF PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBS ARE LOW INCOME PEOPLE. HE HAS GOT A PLAN. THE WORST THING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. HAVING TO DO WITH ZONING. THESE ARE NEW OUT. IT IS CRAZY. AND THEN I HEAR I AM NOT DOING WELL IN THE SUBURBS. ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY? I JUST EXPLAIN THIS. , I JUST EXPLAINED THIS. BEN CARSON. A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. THEY SAID, WHAT IF WE JUST AMENDED IT? NO, I WANTED OVER. I WANTED OVER , I WANT IT OVER. THEY SAY WOMEN IN THE SUBURBS DO NOT LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. NOT THINK SO. THAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. REMEMBER? LAST TIME, THEY SAID HE WILL NOT DO WELL WITH WOMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE WILL NOT DO WELL WITH WOMEN. THESE WERE THE IDIOTS ON ELECTION NIGHT FOUR YEARS AGO. THIS WILL BE A VERY SHORT NIGHT. THIS WILL BE , THEN AT THE END, THEY SAID HE DID VERY WELL WITH WOMEN. ANYWAY, WE DID WELL WITH EVERYBODY. WE HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM , LOOK AT THIS CROWD. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO JUST BE A LITTLE CELEBRATION. I FIGURED A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE LIKES TO BE JOE GETS ON HIS BEST DAY. WITH JUST THREE OF THE HALF-YEAR US, WE HAVE SECURED AMERICA'S BORDER. THEY WERE A DISASTER. BROUGHT JOBS BACK HOME TO AMERICA, AND BACK HOME TO MINNESOTA. HE BROUGHT A LOT OF JOBS BACK.

BY THE WAY, WITH THE BIDEN, IT WOULD HAVE IN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAME UP WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF. HE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE, CALLING ME XENOPHOBIC BECAUSE I CLOSED THE BORDER. HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT ONE? THIS GUY, JUST ANOTHER POLITICIAN. 47 YEARS, HE HAS NOT DONE A DAM THING , DANB TMN THING. EUROPE IS ALMOST 8% , HAS ALMOST A 58% GREATER MORTALITY RATE AND THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE WILL ADMINISTER A VACCINE IN RECORD TIME AND BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, THE SOONER THE NIGHT. ON NOVEMBER 3, MINNESOTA WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE END THIS PANDEMIC, DEFEAT THE VIRUS, AND RETURNED TO RECORD PROSPERITY. EITHER WAY, WE ARE RETURNING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN.

I WAS IN THAT HOSPITAL. I WAS WATCHING DOWN OVER SO MANY PEOPLE. I WENT OUT ANDTO SAY HELLO TO THOSE PEOPLE. I TOOK A LITTLE HEAT FOR IT BUT I WILL DO IT AGAIN. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE FIRST LADY, THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE OUTPOURING. WE ARE STARTING VERY BIG WITH OUR RALLIES AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR COUNTRY TO BECOME A SOCIALIST NATION. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. OR WORSE. BY THE WAY, OR WORSE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW OUR NATION IS GOING TO DEFEAT THIS TERRIBLE CHINA VIRUS, AS WE CALL IT. WE'RE PRODUCING POWERFUL THERAPIES AND DRUGS. WE ARE HEALING THE SICK AND WE ARE GOING TO RECOVER. THE VACCINE IS COMING UP VERY QUICKLY, IN RECORD TIME. IT IS COMING UP VERY SOON. WE HAVE GREAT COMPANIES DOING IT AND THEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTING IT. WE WILL THROUGH OUR MILITARY VERY RAPIDLY. THROUGH THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT, I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. SCIENCE, MEDICINE WILL ERADICATE THE CHINA VIRUS ONCE AND FOR ALL. YOU SEE BIG FLAREUPS IN EUROPE. BIG FLAREUPS IN CANADA. VERY BIG FLAREUP IN CANADA. A LOT OF FLAREUPS, BUT IT'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR. IT'S DISAPPEARING. VACCINES ARE GOING TO HELP. THE THERAPEUTICS ARE GOING TO HELP A LOT. JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THIS AFTERNOON. WHAT BEAUTIFUL COLOR. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COLOR, CANDACE? WHAT A BEAUTIFUL COLOR. I WANT TO PUT ONE OF THEM ON A WHITE SHIRT. I WANT TO THANK YOU, THOUGH, SERIOUSLY. EVERY DAY, MORE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE LEAVING BEHIND LEFT-WING POLITICIANS AND THEIR FAILED IDEOLOGIES. FAILED FOR MANY YEARS AND MANY DECADES. DEMOCRATS HAVE RUN NEARLY EVERY INNER-CITY IN AMERICA, AND I MEAN FOR 100 YEARS. THEYIR POLICIES HAVE DELIVERED NOTHING BUT CALAMITY, POVERTY AND TROUBLE. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN BETRAYED BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. IF YOU THINK HE CAN RUN THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE WRONG. FOR HALF A CENTURY, SHIPPING YOUR JOBS TO CHINA. WE ARE BRINGING THE JOBS BACK. WE'VE BEEN CHARGING CHINA A LOT OF MONEY WITH THE TARIFFS. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OPENING YOUR BORDERS TO MASS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THE WALL IS NOW 380 MILES LONG. IT WILL SOON BE FINISHED. TRAPPING US IN ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS, THESE RIDICULOUS FOREIGN WARS THAT LAST FOR 19 YEARS. OUR PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK HOME. AND SELLING YOU OUT TO THE RICH GLOBALIST WALL STREET DONORS. THEY HAVE THE WALL STREET DONORS. SOMEDAY, SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO WRITE A LITTLE STORY ABOUT THAT. BLACK AND LATINO AMERICANS ARE REJECTING THE RADICAL SOCIALIST LEFT AND EMBRACING OUR PRO-JOBS, PRO-WORKER, PRO-POLICE. WE HAVE TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER. AND PRO-AMERICAN AGENDA. I WANT TO THANK THE FOUNDATION FOR ORGANIZING THIS EVENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ESPECIALLY YOUR TWO FOUNDERS, GREAT PEOPLE, CANDACE OMENS AND FORMER TUCSON POLICE OFFICER BRANDON TATUM. THANK YOU BOTH. GREAT JOB. WHAT A GREAT JOB. TWO BRILLIANT, SMART, YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YOU'VE JUST MARCHED TO THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF BLACK AMERICANS AND ALL AMERICANS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR POLICE SUPPORT YOU. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT. IF THE LEFT GAINS POWER, THEY WILL LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE CRUSADE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT. THEY ARE DOING THAT AT A LEVEL NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. THE OTHER DAY IN THE DEBATE, BIDEN COULD NOT EVEN USE THE WORDS LAW ENFORCEMENT. I SAID USE LAW ENFORCEMENT. HE WAS BAILED OUT BY THE ANCHOR. I SAID, VERY SIMPLY, NAME ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP THAT HAS SUPPORTED YOU. HE COULDN'T DO IT. HE WAS BAILED OUT BY THE ANCHOR. HE GOT BAILED OUT BY THAT ANCHOR A LOT. TAKING THEIR FUNDS AWAY, THEIR FIREARMS. TAKING EVERYTHING AWAY, INCLUDING YOUR FREEDOM. JOE BIDEN EVEN SAID WHEN YOU CALL 911, A THERAPIST SHOULD ANSWER THE CALL. THAT DOES NOT WORK. BUT, THIS IS THE PEOPLE TELLING HIM WHAT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T SAY. HE IS TOLD WHAT TO SAY. YOU SAW WHAT THEY INTRODUCED TODAY. THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH A PERIOD OF YEARS, NO FRACKING, NO FRACKING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE GETS THE NOMINATION AND SAYS THERE WILL BE FRANKCKING. PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH DAKOTA, ALL OF YOU , IF IT HAPPENS, ALL OF YOUR JOBS ARE GONE, THOSE ENERGY JOBS ARE GONE IF THEY GET IN. REMEMBER I SAID IT. I DON'T THINK SO EITHER. I HAVE TO SAY, THERE HAS BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASM. WE'VE HAD MORE ENTHUSIASM RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE FOUR YEARS AGO BY A FACTOR OF THREE TIMES. AND WE HAD A LOT. AND THEY HAD NONE. THEY HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM. [CROWD CHANTING "FOUR MORE YEARS"] THEY HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM. IN FACT, THE GAP IS SO INCREDIBLE, A POLL JUST CAME OUT. I THINK IT'S A 56 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE PREFER THEIR POSITION NOW IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAN THEY DID FOUR YEARS AGO. THINK OF WHAT THAT MEANS. AND IT'S A GALLUP POLL AND IF THEY HIGHEST POLL EVER RECORDED, 56%. TELL ME ABOUT THAT. WE REALLY HAD IT GOING AND THEN THE PLAGUE CAME IN FROM CHINA BUT WE ARE GETTING RID OF THAT AND WE ARE REBUILDING IT AND IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE. THE HOMES AND CHURCHES IS AN BUSINESSES OF BLACK AND HISPANIC AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LOOTED. THEY HAVE BEEN VANDALIZED AND BURNED BY LEFT-WING FANATICS. TOTAL BAD PEOPLE. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. YET, BIDEN LIKES TO CALL THEM PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. YOU SEE ANCHORS FROM A COUPLE OF THE VERY BAD, VERY CORRUPT NETWORKS. BEHIND THEM, THE CITIES ARE BURNING AND THEY ARE SAYING THESE ARE PEACEFUL PROTESTS. YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE. I WANT TO THANK OUR A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I THINK WE PROBABLY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY PRACTICALLY. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY , THERE MUST BE SOME. THEY WILL FIND ONE TONIGHT. NO, HE MISREPRESENTED. BUT, WE HAVE A LEVEL OF SUPPORT THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. I DON'T THINK SO. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THAT. YOU SEE HOW MANY CRICKET BALLOTS ARE BEING FOUND AND TURNED BACK IN AND FRAUDULENT? THEY WILL SAY HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN FREEDOM. I TOTALLY BELIEVE IN FREEDOM. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS FREEDOM. TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE BALLOTS. 50,000 IN OHIO. 25,000 , YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. EVERYDAY, THERE'S A STORY ABOUT BALLOTS. SOME THROWN OUT. MILITARY BALLOTS WERE THROWN OUT WITH THE NAME TRUMP ON THEM, OK? I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SLUMP THEM BY SO MUCH, HOPEFULLY IT WON'T MATTER. WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WATCHING. WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WATCHING ALL THOSE BALLOTS. THEY ARE BEING FOUND FOR A REASON. LEFT-WING POLITICIANS LIKE KAMAL A HARRIS, WHO REALLY DID NOT DO WELL THE OTHER NIGHT. BY THE WAY, DID OUR VICE PRESIDENT DO A GOOD JOB, CANDACE? THAT WAS EASY FOR HIM. NO, HE DID A GREAT JOB BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF RIGHT. WE REALLY ARE. BY THE WAY, WE ARE, AND IT IS TRUE , I SEE IT ALL THE TIME NOW , WE ARE DRAINING THE SLUMP LIKE NOBODY IN HISTORY HAS EVER DRAINED THE SWAMP. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DELIVER A UNITED MESSAGE TO POLICE OFFICERS ALL ACROSS OUR GREAT LAND , EVERY AMERICAN, EVERY RACE AND COLOR, WE LOVE YOU. EVERY RACE, COLOR, CREED, WE SUPPORT YOU. WE HONOR YOU. IT IS A DANGEROUS PROFESSION. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. I WANT TO THANK THEM ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY HERE TODAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE ARE SAFE. IN CONTRAST, THE DEMOCRATS SOCIALIST PROGRAM AND PLATFORM , AND IT REALLY IS MORE THAN SOCIALIST, IT IS BEYOND SOCIALISM. COMMUNIST, YEAH. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. BUT, I RECENTLY ANNOUNCED MY PLAN TO DELIVER MORE OPPORTUNITIES, SECURITY, FAIRNESS AND PROSPERITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY, TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, I DON'T HAVE TO GO OVER IT BUT IT IS THE PLATINUM PLAN. IT'S GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS AT A LEVEL YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND WE'VE DONE A LOT. BUT, INCREASE CAPITAL. IT IS GOING TO INCREASE MONEY COMING INTO THE BLACK COMMUNITY, TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY WHERE IT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH SHUT OUT AND ADVANCED HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WEALTH BUILDING. IT IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE. IT IS TAKING PLACE AT A LEVEL , HAD WE NOT BEEN HIT BY THE PANDEMIC, YOU WILL SEE NUMBERS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. BUT, THOSE NUMBERS ARE ALREADY REBUILDING AGAIN. WE WILL BUILD UP A PEACEFUL AND SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD PROGRAM LIKE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN, WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF POLICING. WE WILL CREATE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT DELIVERS BETTER CARE AT A LOWER COST. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. WE WANT TO TERMINATE IT. WE WANT TO GET GREAT HEALTH CARE. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. AND WE WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS. I THINK WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE GETTING IT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN HEALTH CARE, WE HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. LESS EXPENSIVE HEALTH CARE AT A MUCH BETTER HEALTH CARE AT A MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE PRICE. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. IT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S HAPPENING FAST. ANOTHER THING IS SCHOOL CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SCHOOL CHOICE. CHARTER SCHOOL, CHOICE. I MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT PEOPLE THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT ON THE BOLD SIDE BUT WE'VE ACHIEVED A HISTORIC REDUCTION OF VIOLENT CRIME. WE SIGNED A LANDMARK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BILL THAT NO ONE THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE TO EVEN THINK ABOUTT. I DID THAT. I DID THAT. I GOT THAT DONE. AND I WORKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WE GOT IT DONE. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION COULDN'T GET IT DONE. BIDEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS. WE HAVE PRISON REFORM. WE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST BLACK AND HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE BLACK YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REACHED THE LOWEST EVER AGAIN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. LAST YEAR, BLACK AND HISPANIC AMERICAN POVERTY REACHED THE LOWEST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS ALL BUILDING BACK UP SO QUICKLY. IF YOU LOOK AT WOULD WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHERE WE FUNDED THEM , THEY COULDN'T GET FUNDED. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, NOBODY WAS FUNDING THEM. YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH SENATOR TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA, OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND THE JOBS CREATED. I SAID IT STRONGLY. PERHAPS, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, PEOPLE SAY MAYBE THAT IS THE BEST OF ALL, BUT THE FACT IS THEY ARE ALL GREAT. I SAY THE FACT IS I HAVE DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN ANY PRESIDENT SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN. NOBODY CAN DISPUTE IT. NOBODY CAN DISPUTE IT. NOBODY CAN DISPUTE IT. SO, WE ARE NOW BEGINNING THE FASTEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN HISTORY. WE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION JOBS JUST IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. THAT'S THE FASTEST EVER. THE U.S. HAS SEEN THE SMALLEST ECONOMIC CONTRACTION OF ANY MAJOR NATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE SEEN THE SMALLEST GOING DOWN. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE STATEMENT. OUR OPPONENTS WILL CRUSH THE COMEBACK WITH UNSCIENTIFIC LOCKDOWNS. THEY WANT TO LOCK EVERYTHING DOWN. HERE WE GO AGAIN. THEY WANT TO LOCK EVERYTHING DOWN. NO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. SO IMPORTANT YOU GET OUT AND VOTE. SO, WE'VE GOT A GREAT POLE IN FLORIDA. A GREAT POLL IN NORTH CAROLINA. A GREAT POLL IN ARIZONA. A GREAT POLL IN NEVADA. JUST GOT A GREAT POLL IN NEVADA. I THINK WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO STATES WE ARE GOING TO WIN. GEORGE IS LOOKING FANTASTIC. THINK ABOUT TEXAS. THEY HAVE NO OIL. THEY DON'T WANT OIL, THEN DON'T WANT GUNS, THAT ONE RELIGION. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL WIN , THEY DON'T WANT RELIGION. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL WIN TEXAS VERY WELL. WE ARE GETTING GREAT POLES ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY UNDERSTAND IT. YOU KNOW WHY? IT IS BECAUSE OF THE SPIRIT, THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, THIS BEAUTIFUL, GREAT LAWN. AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD.

WE HAVE BEEN BEATING CHINA, WE'VE BEEN BEATING EVERYBODY PRAY BEFORE WE WERE THE PLAGUE CAME IN WE WERE TEACHING CHINA LIKE THEY'D NEVER BEEN TAUGHT BEFORE. THEY KNOW IT, THEY TOLD ME THAT A AND NEVER THOUGHT IT COULD HAPPEN. THEY THOUGHT THEY'D BE DOUG IT AGAIN WE ACHIEVED ALL OF THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE CAUGHT THEM COLD FOR THE RESPONDING ON OUR CAMPAIGN, OUR CAMPAIGN NOT MY CAMPAIGN. THEY WERE SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN AND ILLEGALLY TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A VERY, VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND LEGALLY SWORN IN ADMINISTRATION. WE WERE SWORN IN AND THEY TRIED BEFORE THE FACT THEY TRIED AFTER THE FACT, WE WERE AT ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN THEY SAY WE WANT TO KNOW IF YOU WILL AGREE THAT THEY FRIENDLY TRANSFER OF POWER. FOR FOUR YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET US OUT OF OFFICE. FOR YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET US OUT. BUT WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT ALL AFTER THE ELECTION. WE CAUGHT THEM COLD SPREAD BECAUSE THEM COLD, BAD PEOPLE, KIRK AND HILLARY. AND BY THE WAY, OBAMA AND BIDEN KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING, OKAY JUST IN CASE YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT AFTER THE ELECTION. JOE BIDEN AND THEY DEMOCRAT SOCIALIST FOR THAT GIVES YOU ANOTHER REASON TO GO OUT AND VOTE, WE HAVE GOT TO GET IN.

RELEASE ALIENS, CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS NUMBER SECOND AMENDMENT GET USED TO IT. [BOOING] THEY WILL DRIVE GOD FOR THE PUBLIC SQUARE THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. [BOOING] YOU SOUGHT IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE DURING THE DEMOCRAT NATIONAL CONVENTION. THEY TOOK THE WORD GOD OUT TWICE. [BOOING] THEY SAID ALL WE MADE A MISTAKE, AND EXCUSE MADE HAPPEN THE SECOND TIME I GUESS THAT WASN'T A MISTAKE, RIGHT? BIDEN EVEN REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTION ON THE PACKING OF THE SUPREME COURT. NOBODY EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT FOR MANY, MANY, MANY DECADES. AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO DO. WE CAN'T GET THERE LEGITIMATELY SO THEY ARE GONNA PACK COURT. THERE UP A LOT OF SUPER LEFTIES ON THE COURT WILL HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRY. NOPE, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAY. GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. YOU KNOW, A A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID I WAS ELECTED BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT PART BECAUSE I SAID I'M GOING TO PUT GREAT CONSERVATIVE CONSTITUTIONALIST, GREAT JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE. BUT IF IT IS THROUGH TORTURE NOW THAT IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. BUT WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE ARE A NUMBER THREE OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE NEVER HAD ANY, THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANY PRIDE WE ARE AT THREE ALREADY IN THREE AND HALF YEARS. I WILL SAY THIS, I WILL SAY THIS. IT IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY. [CHEERING] IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY. THEM GREAT INTELLECT GREAT SCHOLAR IS GOING TO BE A FANTASTIC SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. [CHEERING] AS AMERICA SAW EARLIER TODAY IN AMY'S OPENING STATEMENT IN THE SENATE, JUDGE BARRETT A BRILLIANT SCHOLAR I WILL DEFEND OUR LAWS, OUR RIGHTS, OUR FREEDOM, AND OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF DOUG. THE RADICAL LEFT IS HELL BENT ON DESTROYING EVERYTHING WE LOVE AND CHERISH. THEY ARE ENRAGED AND UNHINGED. NOBODY CAN BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE DOUG AND WHERE THEY ARE GOING. BUT WE UNDERSTAND IT. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR CANCELED CULTURE. WE ARE NOT LETTING THEM CANCELED CULTURE US AT ALL. WERE PROUD OF HER COUNTRY WE ARE PROUD OF OUR HERITAGE. THEY WANT TO PUNISH THE MIDDLE CLASS, EXPUNGE EVERY LAST TRACE OF TRADITIONAL VALUES AND REPLACE THE AMERICAN DREAM WITH A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE. THAT IS WHAT IT IS FOR THEY WANT TO TURN AMERICA INTO COMMUNIST CUBA OR SOCIALIST VENEZUELA UNDER THE LIVES OF HISPANIC AMERICANS AND ALL AMERICANS. I WANT TO THINK THE HISPANIC AMERICANS DOWN IN FLORIDA. YOU HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLE. BIDEN'S AGENDA WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE OR FLORIDA SENIORS. AND BY THE WAY, BIDEN WAS A BIG LOVER OF TESTER. YOU KNOW THE DEAL THAT I BROKE, YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT AS I CAME INTO OFFICE OBAMA GIVE THE WHOLE PLANET AWAY TO CASTRO. I SAID NO THANK YOU, WE ARE NOT DOUG THAT. THAT IS WHY WE JUST GOT THE BAY OF PIGS AWARD FROM THE CUBAN-AMERICANS PARADE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LOT OF THEM ARE HERE, THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, BAY OF PIGS. BIDEN TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. NOW BIDEN IS PLEDGING MASS AMNESTY, FEDERAL HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS. WE ALL HAVE A HEART AND WE ALL WANT TO TAKE CARE PEOPLE. WHAT YOU ARE DOUG IS TELLING MILLION PEOPLES WHO COME TO OUR COUNTRY WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU EDUCATION, WERE GOING TO GIVE YOU HEALTHCARE, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING. WE CAN'T DO IT, WE CANNOT AFFORD IT, WE CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HER OWN PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE FIRST. [CHEERING] AND IF THEY LET THAT HAPPEN YOU WOULD BE DECIMATING MEDICARE IN DESTROYING SOCIAL SECURITY. WHILE I AM PRESIDENT NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR MEDICARE NO ONE WILL TOUCH, HURT, HERE SOCIAL SECURITY. WITH YOUR VOTE I WILL FINISH BUILDING THE STRONGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. AND WE WERE THERE. LAST YEAR WAS THE GREATEST YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. AND I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS PRACTICALLY THAT WAY FROM ALMOST EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. BUT IT WAS FLORIDA'S BEST YEAR. THE YEAR COMING IS GOING TO BE, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A GREAT THIRD-QUARTER SET OF NUMBERS COMING UP VERY SOON. JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION. I'M PUTTING MYSELF ON THE SPOT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE RECORD-SETTING PHENOMENAL NUMBERS. NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE THE BEST YEAR WE HAVE EVER HAD ECONOMICALLY. [CHEERING] AND AS I HAVE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING, I WILL KEEP EVERY PROMISE AND I WILL ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT RIGHT? YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM OTHER PEOPLE. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ARE DELIVERING A SAFE VACCINE AT A RAPID RECOVERY LIKE NOBODY COULD EVEN BELIEVE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR UPWARD PATH, NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS RECOVERED THE WAY WE HAVE RECOVERED ECONOMICALLY OR OTHERWISE. NOT EVEN CLOSE. [CHEERING] AND IF YOU VOTE FOR ME, PROSPERITY WILL SURGE, NORMAL LIFE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT, WE WANT A NORMAL LIFE. FULLY RESUME AND THE FLORIDA TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY THAT I KNOW SO WELL WILL REACH HISTORIC NEW HEIGHTS. HIGHS LIKE THEY'VE NEVER REACHED BEFORE. BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE THE RECOVERY, DELAY THE VACCINE, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC AND ANNIHILATE FLORIDA'S ECONOMY WITH A DRACONIAN UNSCIENTIFIC LOCKDOWN. THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, LOCKDOWN. LOCK IT DOWN EVERYBODY. IF YOU DON'T FEEL ABOUT GOING OUT COMETS THEY YOU KNOW THE RISK GROUPS THE OLDER PEOPLE, FORTUNATELY I AM NOT AN OLD PERSON PAID I'M A YOUNG PERSON. [CHEERING] RIGHT? I AM IN SUCH GREAT SHAPE. [CHEERING] UNITE SAID THAT THE OTHER DAY. I SAID I'M VERY YOUNG AND I'M IN GREAT SHAPE, PERFECT SHAPE. AND THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP MISREPRESENTED TODAY AGAIN PRETTY SAID HE WAS IN GREAT SHAPE BUT HE IS VERY YOUNG. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE SICKEST OF THEM ALL. [CHEERING] BUT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COMMENTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED, IT JUST CAME OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THEY ADMITTED DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT. THE LOCKDOWNS ARE DOUG TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO THESE DEMOCRAT RUN STATES WHERE THEY ARE LOCKED DOWN, SEALED UP, SUICIDE RATES, DRUG RAIDS, ALCOHOLISM, DEATH BY SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE GOVERNOR AND EVERYONE IN FLORIDA. YOU ARE OPEN AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS. WE GOT TO REMEMBER, SET IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE THE PROBLEM ITSELF. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE. BUT IF YOU DO NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, IF YOU WANT TO STAY, STAY, RELAX STAY. IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT THERE, GET OUT. ONE THING WITH ME, THE NICE PART I WENT THROUGH, NOW THEY SAY I AM. I FEEL SO POWERFUL. [CHEERING] I WILL WALK IN THERE I WILL KISS EVERYONE IN THAT AUDIENCE. I WILL KISS THE GUYS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AND EVERYBODY. I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A BIG FAT KISS. THERE IS SOMETHING NICE, I DON'T HAVE TO BE LOCKED UP IN MY BASEMENT. AND I WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. I WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WE ARE THE PRESIDENT YOU CANNOT LOCK YOURSELF IN THE BASEMENT AND SAM NOT GOING TO BOTHER. YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT AND IT IS RISKY. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT GIVES YOU A GOOD FEELING WHEN YOU CAN BEAT SOMETHING AND NOW THEY SAY YOU ARE IMMUNE, I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG SOME SAFER LIFE SOME SAY FOR FOUR MONTHS OUR TIME HERE GETS. SHORTER AND SHORTER AND SHORTER BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. IT IS A GREAT FEELING PRETTY WANT TO THANK FOR THE WHITE WALTER REED MEDICAL HOSPITAL, JOHN HOPKINS, THESE GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE. WE ARE 90% BETTER NOW THAN WE WERE SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO IN TERMS OF A CURE FOR PEOPLE THEY GET REALLY SICK. 90%. IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. AND WITH CHILDREN IT'S 99.9%. YEAR GOING TO BE OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY BETTER THAN YOU HAVE, BETTER THAN WE ALL HAVE. BUT WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOLS UP WITH IT ARE BUSINESSES GOING BACK, WITH GOT A GET A COUNTRY ROLLING. IT IS ROLLING IT ARE GOING TO SEE THAT WHEN IT COMES UP HE TOOK H1N1, HE CALLS IT AND 1H WHEN HE GETS CONFUSED. I SAID NO H COMES FIRST JOE. BUT IT'S CALLED THE SWINE FLU, RIGHT? WAS A DISASTER THE WAY THEY RAN IT THE TOTAL CATASTROPHE WAS SO BAD ON IT LOCKDOWN CHINA WHICH WAS IN JANUARY, MONTHS EARLIER THAN WHAT HE SAID. AND ULTIMATELY ADMITTED I WAS RIGHT. BUT OH HE SHOULD'VE DONE IT FASTER THIS WAS MONTHS LATER AND HE SAID IT SHOULD HAVE ACTED FASTER PRINT NO ONE ACTED FAST LIKE I DID PRETTY ALSO SHUT DOWN LOCKDOWN EUROPE IF YOU REMEMBER. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES. WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT IF WE DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB THEY WOULD TAKE TWO-POINT TO MILLION PEOPLE WOULD DIE. WE ARE 210,000, WE SHOULD NOT , WE SHOULD BE AT ONE POINT CHINA'S FAULT THEY ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN THEY ALLOWED IT TO ESCAPE CHINA. BUT TWO-POINT TO MILLION PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED, JUST REMEMBER THAT, JUST REMEMBER THAT. OF FACTLY DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY THE WAY THEY HAVE HANDLED IT. IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE LOVE FEST TOGETHER BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT HAS BEEN. AND FROM ALL OF US THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE DIAPERED HIS FRIENDS. I HAVE LOST FRIENDS. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOING TO LOVE ME EVEN MORE. FOR GOING TO LOVE ME EVEN MORE BECAUSE WE ARE YEARS I HAD ON VACCINES. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED VERY SHORTLY. I MEAN FRANKLY IT IS A BIG POLITICAL DEAL GOING ON REALLY DON'T WANT IT TO BE BEFORE THE ELECTION. DON'T LET IT BE THAT WE HAVE GREAT VACCINES COMING. JOHNSON AND JOHNSON, MADERA, FISA, WE HAVE GREAT, GREAT THINGS HAPPENING WITH THE VACCINE. I THINK EVEN GREATER WITH THE CURES IN THE THERAPEUTICS. AND MAYBE IT'S WHY I'M HERE FOR YOU. I MAYBE IT'S NOT I'M NOT SURE PUT ANNA ONE THING I WAS VERY HAPPY TO TAKE IT. BUT THEIR OPERATION WARP SPEED WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE 1 MILLION DOSES FOR THE END OF THE YEAR END THEY'LL BE DELIVERED BY THE MILITARY AND THEY'RE ALL SET TO GO. THEY ARE WAITING FOR FINAL APPROVAL BILL AND THE PANDEMIC FOR LAUNCHING A STORK EFFORT TO BRING THE MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN BACK HOME. IN 1996, JOE BIDEN VOTED TO OBLITERATE PUERTO RICO'S THRIVING PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. REMEMBER THEY SENT A GREAT PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. HE CUT IT OUT. AND WHEN HE CUT IT OUT, HE SENT PUERTO RICO INTO A NOSEDIVE LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SEEN BEFORE. SO WE ARE BRINGING IT ALL BACK. WE ARE BRING IT BACK TO FLORIDA TO BIRD WE ARE BRINGING IT ALL THE WAY BACK. TAKING OUR JOBS AWAY FROM CHINA. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK FROM CHINA BUT I WILL REVERSE THE BIDEN'S CATASTROPHIC DECISION. WE WILL BRING IT ALL BACK PRAYED THAT DRUG INDUSTRIES COMING BACK INTO PUERTO RICO. BY THE WAY PENNSYLVANIA COMING BACK INTO NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA. COMING BACK INTO MICHIGAN, COMING BACK INTO OHIO, WE ARE BRINGING IT ALL BACK. LAST MONTH, I ALSO ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL $13 MILLION IN DISASTER RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO AND FOR FLORIDA. HAVE I TAKEN CARE FLORIDA? BY TAKING CARE FLORIDA? MY ADMINISTRATIONS ALLOCATED OVER $60 BILLION AND IF YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA IF YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA THEY'RE ALWAYS GREAT FOR THEIR ALWAYS CALLING ASKING FOR MONEY BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOUG. WE TOOK CARE OF THE PANHANDLE I WAS ASKED FOR THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO. WANDO. [INAUDIBLE] SHE WAS SO NICE WE WERE ALSO JOINED BY SEVERAL GREAT PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY LEADERS, J. [INAUDIBLE] DAISY LOPEZ, KENT FOR CONGRESS DOCTOR LEO BALLANTINE, WHERE ARE YOU. [CHEERING] I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THE BEST BUT I'M JUST ABOUT THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO PUERTO RICO. YOU BETTER VOTE FOR REPORTER RICO, YOU BETTER VOTE FOR HIM. BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING FOR PUERTO RICO THERE BETTER THAN THE WAY THEY WERE TREATED BY DEMOCRATS. AND WHILE FIGHTING WILL SURRENDER YOUR JOBS TO CHINA, YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR POLITICIANS AND I HAVE A LOT OF GREAT ONES RIGHT HERE INCLUDING YOUR GOVERNOR. [CHEERING] WOW. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO SURROUND , WE WILL NEVER ALLOW OURSELVES TO EVEN THINK ABOUT SURRENDERING TO THE LEFT WING MOB. THEY ARE ON THE RUN. THEY ARE ON THE RUN. BETTER NOT HAVE THEM HAVE A VICTORY BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE EVEN A LITTLE VICTORY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. OR BRING YOUR JOBS HOME AND PUTTING VIOLENT CRIMINALS BEHIND BARS FROM WORKING WITH YOUR POLITICAL LEADERS. WE ALSO DIRECTED THE FBI TO IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATUES. AND TO PROSECUTE THE OFFENDERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF FEDERAL LAW. BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE CAUSING MAYHEM IN THE STREETS. IF HE WINS THERE'LL BE NOTHING BUT BEDLAM ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THERE HE WILL NOT WIN. HEY MAY BE THE WORST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN HISTORY AND I HAVE GOT HIM. I GOT HIM. IT ACTUALLY PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON PREVIEW RUN AGAINST A GREAT CANDIDATE THERE'S ACTUALLY LESS PRESSURE IF YOU KNOW THE TRUTH. THANK YOU. NOW WE WANT TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY GREAT. OUR MILITARY HAS EQUIPMENT THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. SNELL'S COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN AND MADE IN THE U.S. ROCKETS, THE LIKES OF WHICH JUT FIGHTERS BOMBERS THE TANKERS THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO THINK ABOUT USING IT. AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO USE IT COULD NOT NAME A SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT SUPPORTS HIM NOT ONE. AND BY THE WAY DID VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO GREAT JOB? [CHEERING] HE DID A GREAT JOB. BUT HE DID BIDEN AND HARRIS, THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT ONE. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S NOTHING SO MEAN TO BIDEN THE NOBODY. PRETTY BRILLIANT HE CAN'T PICK HER BECAUSE NO ONE TREATED HIM AS BADLY. ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS HAD ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS WORN GOT OUTRIGHT AT SUPER TUESDAY WE WOULD'VE HAD BERNIE INSTEAD. BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE BIDEN BECAUSE HE IS NOW ALIENATED THE (HE HAS ALIENATED THE RIGHTS, NOBODY HAS WHAT THAT HELL HE SAYS PRETTY GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR YEAR END A HALF IS AGAINST FRACKING. WITH A LITTLE LUCK, OF COURSE SHE DID NOT GET OUT SO SHE TOOK ALL OF BERNIE VOTES. THE FOLLOWING DAY HE SAYS I AM IN FAVOR OF FRACKING. BUT HE IS NOT. IN IT DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE THE RADICAL LEFT WILL NEVER LET PENNSYLVANIA AND TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA AND NORTH DAKOTA AND OHIO CAN YOU IMAGINE, THE PRESS WHICH IS FAKE AND CORRUPT, THE PRESSES NEVER SAID HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ONCE, FOR ONE YEAR YOU SAID THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. AND HE SAID IT STRONGLY PROP, READ MY LIPS TO USE AN AUDIT. READ MY LIPS WILL BE NO FRACKING PRAYED THAT DID NOT WORK OUT TOO WELL. SO NOW HE DOESN'T SAYS THERE WILL BE FRACKING. NOT ONCE HAVE I HEARD THE QUESTION, NOT ONCE HAVE I ASKED WHY HUNTER WAS ABLE TO TAKE THREE AND HALF MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW. [BOOING] NOT ONCE HAVE I HEARD FAKE NEWS, NOT ONCE HAVE I HEARD THEM SAY A BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THAT PROSECUTOR YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BILLION DOLLARS.

WHEN IT FIRST CAME IN WE GAVE AWAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS IN STORAGE FOR IT WAS NOT DOUG ANYBODY ANY GOOD.

WE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS, REVERSING THE DAMAGE OF BIDEN HAS INFLICTED OVER THE PAST 47 YEARS BUT THAT RIDICULOUS DUMB ENOUGH, PPP AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WTO A DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY. YOU NOTE CHINA IS CONSIDERED A DEVELOPING NATION BUT I STOP THAT. CHINA IS CONSIDERING A DEVELOPING NATIONS IN OTHER WORDS IT'S WONDERFUL AT DEVELOPING IS THAT NICE? AND BEING A DEVELOPING NATION THEY GET MUCH MORE BENEFITS THAN THAT BEING NOT DEVELOPING US AND WE ARE DEVELOPING NATION TO IF THEY ARE A DEVELOPING NATION. AND WE JUST ONE, YOU KNOW THIS. WE JUST WON SEVEN HALF BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. AND FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION I TOOK THIS OUT, I SAID WHY DID YOU DO THAT? I SAID NUMBER WHEN THEY WERE WRONG I NEVER THINK OF IT CORRECT THEM SELVES TODAY AND SAID I WAS RIGHT FOR THE LOCKDOWN. I SAID NUMBER TWO, WIDE AWAKE 500 PLATE JET MILLION A YEAR IN CHINA WITH JUST 1.4 BILLION PEOPLE IS PAYING 39 MILLION YEARS EXPLAIN THAT? THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN. SO I TOOK US OUT FOR THAT AND OTHER REASONS BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT. BUT THESE ARE THE DEALS I COULD GO OVER HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WITH YOU. AND JUST COMMON SENSE, COMMON SENSE WHAT WE DO THINK OF IT WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WE HAVE THREE AND 20 MILLION PEOPLE PEOPLE. WE SPENT $500 MILLION CHINA SPENDS $39 MILLION IN CHINA DOMINATES THEM. I SAID IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. [CHEERING] THEY WILL TAKE US BACK IN SO FACET MUCH LESS MONEY. FOR DECADES OUR BASEMENT TRILLIONS AND CHILEANS OF DOLLARS WERE BILLING FOR NATIONS NATIONS. FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS AND FIGHTING FOREIGN BORDERS. FINALLY WERE PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS AND OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA. BUT THOSE DISMAL DAYS OF BETRAYAL, THAT IS WHAT WE WERE. WE WERE BETRAYED BY OUR OWN POLITICIANS BUT WHETHER IT WAS THE PURPOSE OR THEY WERE JUST PLAIN STUPID. WELCOME BACK WITH UNPRECEDENTED FORCE IF WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE CONTROL AGAIN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. [CHEERING] SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, IT WASN'T HIM IT'S A PEOPLE WHO CONTROL HIM. HE IS CONTROLLED TOTALLY. PUT FORTH THE MOST RADICAL PLATFORM INCLUDING A PLAN TO ELIMINATE U.S. BORDERS. THAT IS WONDERFUL, WHERE'S OUR BORDERS COME ON AND EVERYBODY COME ON THEN. COME ON AND IF YOU ARE A MURDERER, IF YOU'RE A A RAPIST IF YOU ARE VERY, VERY SICK WITH A DISEASE THAT COULD SPREAD ALL OVER, JUST COME ON IN. NOW, YOU KNOW WE ARE UP TO ALMOST 400 MILES OF WALL. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. [CHEERING] AND WE NOW HAVE THE TIGHTEST, SAFEST BORDER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. WE ARE OF THOMAS 400 MILES, IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON. IT IS TOP OF THE LINE. IT IS WHAT BORDER PATROL WANTED. BUT BY IMPLEMENTING NATIONWIDE CATCH AND RELEASE IMPOSING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES NATIONWIDE, NATION WIDE THEY WENT SANCTUARY CITIES THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. I'LL EVEN THINK , MCKAY WILL TAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT WANT SANCTUARY CITIES. IT'S LIKE THE POLITICIANS WANT TO I DON'T THE PEOPLE WANT IT. BUT THEY WANT US TO SPEND ALL REMOVALS OF ILLEGALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY WHETHER THEY ARE MURDERERS, RAPISTS, THUGS, BANK ROBBERS, THEY DON'T CARE THEY WANTED SUSPENDED. [BOOING] YOU ALMOST SAY WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY COMING FROM? WHERE DOES THE THOUGHT PROCESS COME? IT IS DEMENTED. IT WOULD MEAN THE TOTAL NULLIFICATION OF ALL U.S. BORDERS OVERWHELMING EVERY CITY IN TOWN IN AMERICA INCLUDING THIS WONDERFUL PLACE WE ALL LOVE VERY MUCH. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN U.S. HISTORY. AND WE ARE FINISHING THAT WALL. IT IS GOING TO BE FINISHED AND SO BEAUTIFUL. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE IT. WE ARE DOUG 10 MILES A DAY. AND BY THE WAY, MEXICO IS PAYING PAYING. I HATE TO SAY IT, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR. MEXICO IS BEEN GREAT. MEXICO IS 27000 OF THEIR SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDER. AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE OF TARIFFS BECAUSE WERE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR. WE HAVE THE WORST LAWS BECAUSE CONGRESS OVER THE YEARS HAS MADE IT SO WEAK. IF YOU ARE A SOLDIER AND TALK RUDELY TO SOMEBODY THEY END UP GIVING YOU THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. IT IS SO HORRIBLE. MEXICO HAS BEEN GREAT. 27000 SHOULDERS WE HAVE. NOW THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, THE GOING TO SAY HE'S EXAGGERATING HE SHOULDN'T DO THAT. THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE. BUT IT IS TRUE, WE HAVE 27000 MEXICAN SOLDIERS GUARDING OUR BORDER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DON'T PLAY GAMES FOR THEY DON'T LET THEM THROUGH. IF THEY DO GET THERE WE GET VERY ANGRY WITH MEXICO. THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO HAS BEEN GREAT, OR PUTTING A BORDER TAXON FOR CARS AND TRUCKS TO GO ALONG THE MUCH MORE THAN PAY FOR OUR WALL. STARTING SOON. [CHEERING] REMEMBER IN THE OLD DAYS WE SAID WE WILL BUILD A WALL EVERY THOUGHT THERE IS NO WAY. HE KNOWS WHERE THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF VIALS. FIFTY-EIGHT OR 40 MILES AND WE MAY EVEN ADD SOME MORE TO OTHER AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE NATURAL BARRIERS LIKE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND A LOT OF OTHER PRETTY TOUGH AREAS. WE ARE DOUG SO GREAT WITH IT. 10 MILES AND THEY PRETTY WANT TO THANK THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, YOU HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. SOME OF THEM ARE HERE THEY ARE VERY PROUD PEOPLE. ONE THING WITH THE ARMY CORPS, THEY MAY BUILD IT A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT YOU CANNOT RIP THAT SUCKER DOWN. THAT WILL NEVER COME DOWN. WE ENDED THE CATCH AND RELEASE RIDICULOUS PROGRAM FOR YOUR CATCH SOMEBODY COME YOU TAKE THEIR NAME AND THEN YOU RELEASE THEM. AND YOU SAY COME BACK IN THREE YEARS TO A COURT CASE. NOBODY EVER COMES BACK EXCEPT FOR THE REALLY DUMB ONCE THEY COME BACK. BUT NOBODY EVER COMES BACK PREPARE IN OUR COUNTRY THEY COULD BE MURDERERS AND ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS. WE ARE NOT HAVING THAT. WE ENDED IT, WE STOPPED US SILENT AND WE DEPORTED 20000 GANG MEMBERS INCLUDING 13. BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY. WE BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY, WITH NOW DEPORTED OVER HALF A MILLION CRIMINALS ILLEGAL ALIENS THINK ABOUT THAT, THINK ABOUT THAT. AND OUTSIDE A POORLY RUN DEMOCRAT STATES AND CITIES, YOU DON'T HAVE CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY BUT OUR COUNTRY IS DOUG FANTASTICALLY. AND I CALL OF GOVERNORS IN PORTLAND AND MY CALL UP FROM THE STATE AND I CALL UP THE GOVERNOR AS AN EXAMPLE I SAY WE WOULD LOVE TO SEND SOME PEOPLE TO HELP YOU WITH OREGON. AND TO HELP YOU WITH PORTLAND. WE WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN HALF AN HOUR LIKE WE DIDN'T MINNESOTA WITH MINNEAPOLIS. WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM QUICKLY REMEMBERED MINNEAPOLIS WAS BURNING DOWN DAY AFTER DAY AND I CALLED LET US COME IN LET US COME IN HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM? ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. THEY LINED UP, THEY WERE NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCE BUT THAT'S OKAY. THEY LINED UP THAN ANOTHER LINE FOR NAY ANOTHER LINE, THEY WALKED FORWARD AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. BECAUSE OF IT. [CHEERING] THAT HAS NOT BEEN ONE SINCE 1972. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY. BUT GIVE THE GOVERNOR CREDIT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO LONG. HE LET US. WE SENT IN THE U.S. MARSHALS TODAY SENT BY, THREE DAYS ON BY AND WHY HASN'T HE BEEN ARRESTED? WAS SENT IN THE U.S. MARSHAL AND IN 15 MINUTES IT WAS ALL OVER. FIFTEEN MINUTES. IT WAS SO EASY TO DO IMAGINE FOR THESE PEOPLE YEARS AND YEARS THERE HAS BEEN ANARCHY IN PORTLAND. IT HAS BEEN YEARS AND YEARS. BUT NOT FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THIS IS WHY YOU CANNOT HAVE THE DEMOCRATS AND THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY BOTH RAISE AN ISSUE CANNOT HAVE THEM INVOLVED IN RUNNING YOUR COUNTRY. WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION IN THE U.S. MILITARY INCLUDING FUNDING TO SAVE AIR FORCE BASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS WIPED OUT BY THE HURRICANE, RON CALLED AT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CALLED. RICK SCOTT CALLED, THEY ALL CALLED AND THEY WANTED TO SAY WE DID IT NOW IT'S BRAND-NEW, GORGEOUS AND REALLY MOVING ALONG WELL, RIGHT? WE DID A GOOD JOB. THINK SO. WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES IN NEARLY 75 YEARS. CALLED SPACE FORCE. YOU KNOW FOR AN ADMINISTRATION IF YOU THINK OF IT, AT THE 75 YEARS WE CREATED A NEW FORCE, RIGHT? THE ARMY, NAVY, AIR FORCE, MARINES. COAST GUARD. AND NOW, WE JUST CREATE A NEW WHAT THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS? IF I DID NOTHING BUT THAT THAT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT IS PEANUTS. BECAUSE HE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY. WE CUT TAXES MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT BY FAR IN HISTORY. WE CUT REGULATIONS WITH I THINK IS MAYBE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE TAXES. THAT'S WHY OUR BUSINESSES ARE ROLLING BACK. WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS DONE, NOBODY ELSE HAS. THESE PEOPLE BACK HERE THEY DO NOT EVEN CHALLENGE ME ON IT WHICH IS SHOCKING. USUALLY THEY CHALLENGE YOU EVEN IF YOU ARE WRONG. WE ALSO BROUGHT BACK NASA THE GREATEST SPACE CENTER IN THE WORLD PASSIVE BA AND MVA CHOICE IN VA ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT? WE JUST GOT A 91% APPROVAL RATING, 91% APPROVAL RATING THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AS A THREAT INTO OBLIVION WE KILLED AL-BAGHDADI THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, GUESS WHO GOT HIM. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND THE MASS MURDER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND MANY, MANY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD SOLID MANEY, HE IS GONE. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEER WHICH WAS A CATASTROPHE. PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVE US ONE OR $50 BILLION WE WILL GIVE YOU, GIVE US 1.8 BILLION IN GREEN, AND CASH HE GAVE THEM 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. THAT IS WHEN I REALIZE HOW POWERFUL THE PRESIDENCY IS BURIED WHEN YOU CAN DO THAT. WHAT A HORRIBLE DEAL. BUT WE BROKE THE DEAL PART I WILL TYPE PROBABLY THE FIRST CALL I WILL GET AFTER WE WIN THE ELECTION WILL BE FROM IRAN DYING TO MAKE A DEAL. BECAUSE THEY ARE DOWN 28% GDP. NOBODY IS EVER HEARD OF THING LIKE THAT. THAT BELIEF FIRST CALL LIKE THAT THAT. THEY CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I KEPT MY PROMISE, RECOGNIZE THE TWO CAPITALS OF IT ARE ISRAEL OPEN THE CAPITAL IN JERUSALEM AND EVERY PRESIDENT PROMISED TO DO IT NOBODY DID IT BECAUSE ONCE THEY GOT IT OFF AS THEY GOT THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE NOT TO DO IT. I CAN SAY IS CALLED BY EVERY FOREIGN LEADER PLEASE DON'T DO IT, PLEASE DON'T DO IT. I TELL THE STORY SAID LISTEN I SAID HEY WHAT'S UP. I ALSO RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY 52 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT PEOPLE FLY IN STAY, WINE, DINE AND LEAVE AND NOTHING FOR 52 YEARS AND I GOT IT DONE ONE DAY.

MEMBER WHEN OBAMA GOT IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHY HE GOT IT, IT WAS THE BIGGEST STORY YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

MY OPPONENTS A STAND WAS SOCIALISTIC COMMUNIST, HE WANTS TO GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY TO CUBA. HE WANTS TO GIVE AWAY TO NICARAGUA AND VENEZUELA, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THE COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTEL, THEY SURRENDERED THE NARCO TERRORIST FOR TOTALLY GIVE UP TO THEM. AND THAT CAUSED ILLICIT DRUG AND DRUGS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN EVEN RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF COLOMBIAN SOCIALIST, A FORMER MEMBER OF THE M19 GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION. HE TOOK IT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? HE DID NOT WHO IN THE HELL IT WAS, IS THAT I WILL TAKE IT I WILL TAKE WHOEVER. NOW HE'S A BAD GUY JOE'S ACTIVE BAD GUY.

WHAT A HISTORY. [CHEERING] 41 DAYS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE COMMONWEALTH PENNSYLVANIA AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS ELECTION IS THE SIMPLE CHOICE. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS AND ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. WE GET RIPPED OFF BY EVERYBODY. IF WE WIN, YOU WIN, PENNSYLVANIA AND AMERICA WINS. VERY SIMPLE. [CHEERING] FOR YEARS, THE SELFISH AND CORRUPT POLITICAL CLASS, THE TRADE, YOU KNOW THAT, THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY. CAREER POLITICIANS LIKE JOE BIDEN, I DON'T THINK , HE ABUSED YOU AND CRUSHED YOUR DREAMS AND OUTSOURCED YOUR JOBS TO CHINA AND DISTANT LANDS ALL OVER THE WORLD. HIS LAST AMERICAN TRADE POLICIES WERE A TOTAL DISASTER. THEY DECIMATED ENTIRE TOWNS IN THE AREA AND WE BROUGHT BACK STEEL AND WE PUT TARIFFS AND STOP DUMPING STEEL AND ALUMINUM. AND AS VICE PRESIDENT HE CLOSED DOWN 10,000 FACTORIES WHILE RAKING IN CASH FROM CORPORATIONS THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS AND HIS FAMILY GOT RICH. WE KNOW THAT. HOW DID HUNTER MAKE $3.5 MILLION FROM THE MAYOR OF RUSSIA, REAR OF , MAYOR OF MOSCOW. SO YOU HAVE THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW WHO GAVE HUNTER 3.5 MILLION. I WONDER WHAT HE DID FOR THAT MONEY. THE FAKE NEWS REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE WEALTHY DONORS, SPECIALISTS WHO SHUTDOWN THE FACTORIES AND YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOU REALLY SUFFERED IN THIS AREA. RAVAGED THE CITIES WHILE SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN THESE RIDICULOUS FOREIGN WARS. DON'T WORRY, THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK HOME. 2016, PENNSYLVANIA VOTED ON THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO FINALLY PUT AMERICA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WE DIDN'T COME THIS FAR TO OVERCOME THIS MUCH AND FIGHT THIS HARD ONLY TO SURRENDER THE COUNTRY BACK TO THE WASHINGTON SWAMP AND DID WE TAX THEM, WE CAUGHT THEM. WATCH WHAT HAPPENED. THEY SPIED ON THE CAMPAIGN. WHAT THEY DID SHOULD NEVER, EVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN. WATCH WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. THE CORRUPT BURDEN EXCHANGE HE'S HANDED CONTROL TO THE SOCIALISTS AND MARXISTS AND LEFTIST EXTREMISTS LIKE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE GREAT THING ABOUT AIR FORCE ONE, WE HAVE MORE TELEVISIONS, IN CLOSETS, ALL OVER THE PLACE, CEILINGS. I WATCHED AND COMPARED TO AMY, GREAT FUTURE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] YOU KNOW BIDEN, HE CAN'T STAND UP TO THE LUNATICS RUNNING HIS PARTY HE DIDN'T KNOW THE NAME. YOU KNOW THE GUY I THINK THAT HE'S A MORMON. HE'S TALKING ABOUT MITT ROMNEY. FORGOT MITT ROMNEY'S NAME. IMAGINE THAT. THEN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. HE SAID WHERE AM I. I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE SINGLE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS AND THAT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON ME. IMAGINE IF YOU LOSE TO A GUY LIKE THIS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S DISGRACEFUL. IF HE WINS, THE RADICAL LEFT WILL BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. HE WON'T BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY, THE RADICAL LEFT WILL TAKE OVER. HOW ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAYS THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. ELIZABETH WARREN REFUSED TO GET OUT, SO THEY STOLE ANOTHER ONE FOR BERNIE THE GREATEST LOSER OF THEM ALL. SO SHE REFUSED TO GET OUT. THEY WANTED ME TO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING THE WORD POCAHONTAS. SHE TOOK ENOUGH VOTES AWAY AND THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN, BUT IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. [CHEERING] THINK ABOUT IT, YOU TALK ABOUT POLITICIANS. NO FRACKING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND THEN HE GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA AND SAYS THERE WILL BE, LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. IMAGINE IF I DID THAT. NO FRACKING, THEN YOU WIN AND HAVE TO GO A LITTLE TO THE OTHER DIRECTION. ALTHOUGH HE WENT FOR THEIR LEFT WHICH IS AMAZING BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN HE COMES OUT IN FAVOR OF FRACKING. AND IT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST THING THAT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE. THEY WILL LOSE, YOU WILL LOSE AND PENNSYLVANIA, A MILLION JOBS THERE WILL BE NO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NO FRACKING WHATSOEVER AND DID YOU SEE THE PARTY NOW BECAUSE HE'S SAYING MAYBE THERE WILL BE. IT'S A VERY CONDITIONAL BUT WITH ME YOU ARE GOING TO. WE ARE NOW ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IT IS BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU. RIGHT NOW I'M FIGHTING TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY, SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM THE RADICAL LEFT AND THAT IS A BIG THING, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE, THIS WILL END UP BEING A LARGE-SCALE VERSION OF VENEZUELA. THEY DON'T HAVE WATER OR MEDICINE OR FOOD, THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT IS THROWN AT US WE'VE DONE MORE THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] A RECENT GALLUP POLL JUST CAME OUT , [CHEERING] JUST CAME OUT TO THAT FOUND 56% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE UNDER SLEEPY JOE AND OBAMA. IT'S THE HIGHEST OF ANY PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT IN HIS TERM. AS WE ROUNDED THE CORNER OF THE PANDEMIC, 56%. THEY WERE MUCH MUCH LOWER. IF THEY WERE ANY GOOD I WOULDN'T HAVE RUN FOR PRESIDENT BUT THEY'VE DONE A HORRIBLE JOB. HOW WILL THE HELL DO YOU LOSE TO A GUY LIKE THIS. [CHEERING] BY THE WAY, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. [CHEERING] A LOT OF PEOPLE. I WISH THE FAKE NEWS WOULD SHOW IT BUT THEY NEVER TURN THE CAMERA. THE GREAT FIRST LADY ALWAYS SAYS HOW WAS THE CROWD. SHE SAID THEY JUST SHOW YOUR FACE AND ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU. WHY DON'T YOU DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND SHOW THE CROWD. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IS THE SURVIVAL OF YOUR FRACKING INDUSTRY. JOE BIDEN HAS REPEATEDLY PLEDGED TO ABOLISH FRACKING. HOW DO YOU DO IT, HE WENT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND THEY SAID REMEMBER THE DEBATES WITH THE RADICAL LEFT. THEN HE GETS UP. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY LIFE. NOT ONE REPORTER BACK THERE SAID WAIT A MINUTE WE HAVE BEEN PLEDGING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF THEN WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WHO IN THIS GROUP IS GOING TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. EVERYBODY RAISES A HAND. WHO IS GOING TO PROVIDE I SAY SOMETIMES JOKINGLY, SARCASTICALLY, EVERYBODY GETS A FREE ROLLS-ROYCE TO WHICH C-SPAN SAYS THEY DO NOT, HE HAS IT MISREPRESENTED. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. [CHEERING] THEY ARE SICK PEOPLE, BUT WAY REMEMBER WHEN JOE SAID RAISE YOUR HAND IF EVERYBODY IS IN FAVOR OF FREE EVERYTHING. FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS, AND SHOW KNOWS. HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING. HE HAD NO CLUE. AND HE IS NOT A NICE GUY SO YOU UNDERSTAND. IF HE WAS, I WOULDN'T HATE HIM LIKE THIS BUT HE'S A BAD GUY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A DUMMY. [CHEERING] NO, NO, AND HIS BEST OF YEARS HE WAS CONSIDERED A DUMB GUY. WHEN ASKED ABOUT FRACKING, HE SAID HE WOULD SURE, ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT, WE WILL, ELIMINATE IT. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, THE EXACT WORDS AND THEN 19 DIFFERENT TIMES. THEN ONE DAY HE SAID I NEVER SAID THAT. IT'S INCREDIBLE AND THEY DON'T QUESTION HIM. I COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT FOR A MINUTE. DID YOU SEE THE TOWN HALL HE HAD WITH NBC? THAT WAS A TOWN HALL FOR A CHILD. A YOUNG CHILD. [APPLAUSE] BARON TRUMP, ACTUALLY, HE'S TOO ADVANCED , THAT WAS A TOWN HALL , [CHEERING] LESTER HOLT, THAT WAS A BEAUTY. THAT WAS SOME TOWN HALL. THEY SAID YES, WE HAVE A RANDOM SAMPLING OF PEOPLE, YES, ALL TRUMP HATERS. WHAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HE RAISED HIS HAND AND SAID ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL GET HEALTHCARE. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT MEANS YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY GOES DOWN THE TUBES, YOUR COUNTRY GOES BANKRUPT, THE WHOLE THING IS A DISASTER. BUT HE RAISED HIS HAND AND NOW HE'S TRYING TO SAY HE DIDN'T DO IT BUT THEY DON'T CALL HIM OUT. A COSPONSOR OF THE GREEN GREEN NEW DEAL THAT ELIMINATES ALL FOSSIL FUELS. SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING OUT OF THAT ONE. DID YOU HEAR THE OTHER DAY SHE CAME OUT IN FAVOR. SHE'S FURTHER LEFT. I THOUGHT BERNIE WAS THE FURTHEST. THEN INSTEAD OF SOCIALIST, YOU GO. SHE IS FURTHER LEFT, CONSIDERED FURTHER LEFT. AND THEY ARE LOOKING WHEN NANCY PELOSI DOES THE AMENDMENT SHE'S DOING IT FOR BIDEN. AT THIS VERY MOMENT IT INCLUDES A PLEDGE THAT MEANS FOSSIL FUEL, EVERYTHING IS GONE, AND IT'S GONE SOON. AND WITH THAT GOES OUR ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HATES THIS CLEAN COAL, DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, AND BIDEN WILL SHUT YOU DOWN JUST LIKE YOUR GOVERNOR HAS YOU SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAID HE WAS RIGHT. THEY SAID YOU CANNOT MAKE THE CURE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR A LONG TIME. WE SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES. THE VACCINES ARE COMING SOON, THE THERAPEUTICS AND FRANKLY THE CURE. I TOOK SOMETHING AND WHATEVER IT WAS I FELT GOOD VERY QUICKLY. I TOOK IT AND FELT LIKE SUPERMAN. I SAID LET ME ASK THEM. I COULD HAVE BEEN HERE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO. I WANT TO THANK THE DOCTORS AT WALTER REED AND JOHNS HOPKINS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] ONE GREAT THING ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING 100% HAVE MORE DOCTORS THAN YOU THOUGHT EXISTED IN THE WORLD. I WAS SURROUNDED BY LIKE 14 OF THEM. I'M FROM THIS ONE. I'M FROM JOHNS HOPKINS. I'M FROM WALTER REED BUT WHAT GREAT TALENTED PEOPLE. THEY DID A GREAT JOB. WHILE I'M PRESIDENT, AMERICA WILL REMAIN THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE ENERGY PRODUCER WITH PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS LEADING THE WAY AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY. YOU HAD THE BEST YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR PLACE IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA YOU NEVER WANT TO SAY STATE, DON'T SAY STATE, ACTUALLY NOBODY CARES BUT YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TWO OF THEM, THE COMMONWEALTH. I WENT TO SCHOOL YEAR AND PROBABLY SPEND MORE TIME HERE THAN A SLEEPY JOE. I WENT TO SCHOOL HERE BUT WE ARE PUTTING THEM BACK TO WORK, JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS, DISMANTLE THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS, YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING. AND WE'VE GOT I SAID NAME ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT SUPPORTS YOU AND HE COULDN'T DO IT. THEN CHRIS WALLACE BAILED HIM OUT. I SAID HOW CAN WE GET TO 3.5 MILLION FROM RUSSIA AND THEY BAILED HIM OUT AGAIN. HE WAS JOKING. THEY BAILED HIM OUT BUT THEY WANTED TO SOLVE THE BORDERS. CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS AND GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SOMEBODY SAID I DON'T KNOW IF A SUBURBAN WOMAN LIKES YOU. I SAID , [CHEERING] I LOVE YOU TOO. THEY SAID THEY MAY NOT LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK, BUT I AM ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AND HAVING YOU SAFE AND HAVING YOUR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES. I DON'T WANT TO BUILD LOW INCOME HOUSING NEXT TO YOUR HOUSE IF THAT'S OKAY. AND I ENDED THE REGULATION THAT MADE THE ZONING SO IMPOSSIBLE YOU HAD TO DESTROY YOUR COMMUNITIES. THEN I HEAR THE SUBURBAN WOMAN , I THINK THAT THE SUBURBAN WOMAN , AND I USED TO SAY SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE BUT DOES ANYBODY CARE, THEY WERE ALL SAYING NO. THE ONLY ONE THAT CARES, TRUMP SAID SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE, BUT I DIDN'T SAY IT. YOU LEARN VERY QUICKLY. BUT SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY SHOULD LIKE ME MORE THAN ANYBODY HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I ENDED THE REGULATION THAT DESTROYED YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I ENDED THE REGULATION THAT BROUGHT CRIME TO THE SUBURBS AND YOU CAN LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. REMEMBER THIS, 29% OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE SUBURBS HAPPEN TO BE MINORITY. 29%, AND WE ARE DOING THIS FOR EVERYBODY. WE ARE NOT DOING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND I ENDED IT. THEY SAID WE CAN AMEND IT. I SAID I DON'T WANT TO. IT WAS A HORROR SHOW, AND THIS LOSER IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE. HE'S A STONE STONE COLD LOSER. HE WILL BE IN CHARGE. SO I ASK YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. SUBURBAN WOMEN, PLEASE LIKE ME. [CHEERING] I SAVED YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, OKAY. I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO DO IT AND BE NICE. THEY WANT ME TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS, NO, NO. WE SAVED SUBURBIA IN THE U.S. I GOT RID OF A REGULATION THAT WAS A DISASTER AND UNFAIR AND YOU'VE BEEN READING ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME. IT BECAME MUCH WORSE UNDER OBAMA AND BIDEN. I GOT RID OF IT. EVEN MY OWN PEOPLE SAID YOU WILL NEVER GET RID OF IT AND I SAID I WANT TO GET RID OF IT. WHY DON'T WE JUST AMEND IT. I SAID I WANT TO GET RID OF IT. GET RID OF IT. OKAY. AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT THE WOMEN LIKE TRUMP A LOT. THAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. REMEMBER THE LAST, FOUR YEARS AGO THEY SAID WOMEN WILL NEVER VOTE FOR THEM. THEY SAID THE WOMEN WILL NEVER VOTE AND THEN I GOT 52%. THEY SAID WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WOMEN. EXCEPT THIS TIME, THIS IS MUCH EASIER BECAUSE THEN I WAS A DEVELOPER. I WAS DOING GREAT, EVERYTHING WAS NICE BUT I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I CAME IN AND SAID I'M GOING TO REBUILD THE MILITARY AND CUT THE TAXES AND REGULATIONS AND TO GET YOU THIS AND THAT AND TAKE CARE OF THE VETERANS. I DID THINGS THAT FRANKLY I NEVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT LIKE THE SPACE FORCE. THE WALL IS UP TO 392 MILES, AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL BY THE WAY. THEY HATE TO HEAR THAT, BUT WE ARE PUTTING A CHARGE ON WHERE THE CARS GO THROUGH AND IT WILL MORE THAN PAY FOR THE WALL. BUT WE HAVE NOW THE MOST SECURE SOUTHERN BORDER THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO, THEY HAVE 27,000 MEXICAN SOLDIERS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER STOPPING PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO THE U.S. ILLEGALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BUT WHEN YOU DID ALL THESE THINGS, SO THIS TIME IN THEORY IT SHOULD BE EASIER BUT DON'T FORGET, I HAVE GONE THROUGH YEARS OF A FAKE WITCHHUNT AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY WERE THE GUILTY PARTY. THEY WERE THE ONES DEALING WITH RUSSIA. THEY WERE THE GUILTY. THINK IF I DIDN'T HAVE EVERY NIGHT THAT FAKE CNN RIGHT OVER THERE WITH THEIR LIGHT ON , THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. EVERY TIME I POINT TO THEM, THE LIGHT GOES OFF. THAT'S OKAY. NOBODY'S WATCHING THEM ANYWAY. THINK IF I DIDN'T HAVE RUSSIA, RUSSIA, AND NOBODY'S BEEN TOUGHER. RAISED $130 BILLION A YEAR FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE NOT PAYING THEIR BILLS. THEY WERE DELINQUENT. AND THAT GOES UP TO $410 BILLION. NOBODY DID THAT. OBAMA USED TO SEND THEM PILLOWS, MAY BE FROM THE PILLOW MAN ON FOX. DID YOU EVER SEE A MAN ADVERTISE SO MUCH, THE BIGGEST ADVERTISER, THE GREATEST ADVERTISING GENIUS. IF I GAVE HIM OUR BUDGET, YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT WATCH TRUMP ADS. THE PILLOW MAN. I NEVER SAW SO MANY IN MY LIFE. NOW HE CAME OUT WITH A SHEET AND I'M GOING CRAZY. THAT'S ALL WE NEED NOW IS A NEW SHEET. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE'S ON OUR SIDE, BY THE WAY, HE'S ON OUR SIDE. [CHEERING] AND NOW BIDEN EVEN REFUSES TO ASK THE QUESTIONS ON PACKING THE SUPREME COURT. YOU KNOW, ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. WINNING AND LOSING. THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE, AND WE HAVE BEEN WINNING ELECTIONS. THEY SAID YOU KNOW, TRUMP SHOULDN'T BE APPOINTING THE NEW JUSTICE BECAUSE, WELL, I'M PRESIDENT. IN FACT, AS YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOUR GREAT JUSTICES SAID THEY ARE APPOINTING, JUSTICE GINSBURG SAID RECENTLY, NOT SO LONG AGO, HE'S PRESIDENT FOR FOUR YEARS, NOT FOR THREE. SHE WAS REFERRING TO OBAMA I THINK, WASN'T REFERRING TO ME I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT. [CHEERING] DON'T WORRY. IT'S BEING FILLED. IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN BUILDING THE WALL THAT GOES FOR A LOT. REMEMBER IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROJECTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. AND WE HAD A PARTY DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THERE WOULD NEVER, EVER BE A WALL. THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE. INSTEAD OF SAYING WE WILL BUILD A WALL I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NEVER EVER BUILD A WALL AND THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH MONEY. WHAT A BIG MISTAKE. ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME BY THE WAY? HE SAID THE VOTERS DON'T DESERVE TO KNOW. AFTER THE ELECTION YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. I HAD A LIST WITH 45 PEOPLE. EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A STAR. SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY, JUST ENJOY YOURSELF. WHAT THE HELL. LOOK AT THIS, I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE YOU ARE ALL STANDING. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD SEATS. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CROWDS TO BE PROVIDED SEATS. IT'S BECAUSE IT'S PENNSYLVANIA, I GUESS. IF THEY WIN THE, DEMOCRATS WILL PACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH RADICAL LEFT JUSTICES WHO WILL SHRED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT GUNS, AND POWER THE VIOLENT MOBS AND DEADLY CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION FROM THIS MADNESS. I PROUDLY NOMINATE JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SHE WILL BE A GREAT JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. SHE HAS DONE SO WELL. I FOUND IT FASCINATING. I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME. I TRIED TO WATCH AS MUCH AS I COULD. THE RADICAL LEFT IS HELL BENT ON DESTROYING EVERYTHING WE LOVE AND CHERISH. THROUGH THE RAGE AND UNHINGED AS THEY ARE, GOING CRAZY. THINK OF IT, VERY MANY PRESIDENTS NEVER HAVE ANYBODY TO A POINT. I WILL HAVE BY THE END OF THE FIRST TERM ALMOST 300 FEDERAL JUDGES. THEY WANT TO CANCEL YOU, SHAME YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS SHAME. THIS WHOLE CANCEL CULTURED CULTURE THING. THEY DON'T LIKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN. I SAID THIS THREE YEARS AGO. REMEMBER WHEN THEY TOOK DOWN A COUPLE STATUES OF PEOPLE YOU NEVER HEARD OF, THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS. WE ARE PROTECTING THE LEGACY OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. IT'S AMAZING THE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO LIVE IT DOWN DISAPPEARED QUICKLY SO LET ME TELL YOU, CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WILL ALWAYS BE HERE ON MY WATCH THAT I CAN TELL YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I HAD TO PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY THAT WANTED TO WISH ME HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY. HAPPY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DAY. SO I TALLY AND SAY THANK YOU I LIKE YOU, TOMAC THEY WANT TO PUNISH THE MIDDLE CLASS, EXPUNGE EVERY PHASE OF THE TRADITIONAL VALUE AND THAT'S WHAT COULD HAPPEN. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD I'D RATHER RUN AGAINST JOE BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENTHUSIASM OR ENERGY OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF LIKE NO COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN RIPPED OFF. SHE BIDEN'S AGENDA WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR SENIORS. HE TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. LET ME JUST TELL YOU THIS AND I SAY THIS STRONGLY WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED THEY ALWAYS PLAY THE SOCIAL SECURITY CARD AND NOTHING HAPPENED. YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY IS BETTER THAN EVER. HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT. WHILE I'M PRESIDENT, NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR MEDICARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY. [CHEERING] UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ARE DELIVERING A SAFE VACCINE AND RAPID RECOVERY. IF YOU VOTE FOR ME, PROSPERITY WILL SURGE. NORMAL LIFE, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT, NORMAL LIFE. WE WANT NORMAL LIFE. WE WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. HOW ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. HE WHO HAS A 4O1K AND THE AUDIENCE. I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING, I AM GETTING ALL OF YOUR VOTES. AS WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN ON THE PANDEMIC I COULD HAVE STAYED IN THE BASEMENT OR THE TOP FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I'M THE PRESIDENT. I COULDN'T DO THAT. I HAVE TO GET OUT AND MEET PEOPLE AND I KNOW IT'S RISKY TO DO THAT BUT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I CAN'T SAY LET'S WAIT THIS OUT. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I'M IMMUNE NOW. THEY TELL ME I COULD COME DOWN AND START KISSING EVERYBODY. I WILL KISS ANYBODY, MAN AND WOMAN. LOOK HOW HANDSOME HE IS. NOT WITH A LOT OF ENJOYMENT, BUT I WILL. JOE BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE THE RECOVERY, DELAY THE VACCINE, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC AND ANNIHILATE THE ECONOMY WITH DRACONIAN UNSCIENTIFIC LOCKDOWNS LIKE YOU ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH THIS GOVERNOR WHO IS KILLING YOU. OPEN UP PENNSYLVANIA. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. NOVEMBER 4TH. THEY WANT TO KEEP THE NUMBERS AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO COME OUT JUST BEFORE THE ELECTIONS WE HAVE NOVEMBER 3RD. THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO COME OUT. PENNSYLVANIA IS A LATE VOTING STATE. GOING TO THE POLE BECAUSE YOU SEE ALL THE SHENANIGANS. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WHEN I CAME HERE I PROMISED YOU A LOT OF THINGS. I'VE DONE MUCH MORE THAN I PROMISED YOU. THE BEST YEAR YOU'VE HAD. ALMOST 90%, THE MORTALITY RATE IS AT LIKE 85 IF YOU HAVE IT SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS AGO IT'S NOT AS GOOD AND SOON IT'S GOING TO BE PERFECTO. I SAID THE DRUG THEY GAVE ME WE ARE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTING IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO HOSPITALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I TELL YOU, THAT SUCKER WORKS. THE PEOPLE THAT DID IT, THEY ARE PHENOMENAL PEOPLE THAT HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH OTHER VACCINES AND DRUGS. WE LEARNED ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE BIDEN FAMILY IS GETTING RICH OFF CONNECTIONS TO JOE. SON-IN-LAW CASTING IN ON THE CHINA VIRUS PANDEMIC JUST LIKE HUNTER. WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN HE WALKS OUT WITH 1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE FOR CHINA I SAID TO A FRIEND OF MINE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ON WALL STREET DOES THAT EVER HAPPENED HE SAID I'M THE BIGGEST GUY IN WALL STREET. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. TEN MINUTES HE HAD $3.5 BILLION. MAYBE IT ISN'T SO STUPID. WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST GLOBALIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II AND WE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE I TELL YOU ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE WORKED 24 HOURS AROUND THE CLOCK. REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO BAN CHINA GIVE ME A DEFINITION OF XENOPHOBIC AND HE WAS UNABLE TO DO THAT. THERE WERE LIFESAVING THERAPIES AND FATALITIES. BY 85%, I'M WORKING TO MAKE THE ANTIBODY TREATMENTS I'VE RECEIVED AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE SHIPPED VERY SOON. WE ARE WORKING ON AND EMERGENCY YOUTH AUTHORIZATION AND THE FDA HAS NEVER RESPONDED. THIS COULD HAVE TAKEN YEARS WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE'VE DONE IT IN WEEKS. WHEN DO YOU NEED IT, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW. THE FDA HAS BEEN GREAT. EVERYBODY FIGHTING TO RECOVER FROM THE VIRUS, I FEEL YOUR PAIN BECAUSE I FELT YOUR PAIN. WE WILL BEAT THE VIRUS TOGETHER. WHO HAS HAD IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO BECAUSE YOU ARE IMMUNE OR THEY SAY THAT. THEY HATE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE I HAD IT. IF YOU HAVE IT YOU ARE IN THE AFTERLIFE. ONCE I GOT IT THEY GIVE YOU FOR MONTHS. ANYBODY ELSE BUT ME. OPERATION WARP SPEED WILL HAVE 100 MILLION VACCINE DOSES BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND IT WILL LEND THE PANDEMIC ONCE AND FOR ALL. REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE I HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF I THINK EVERY MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MINOR LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THAT LEFT THEIR PARTY. I CAN TELL YOU BY LOOKING, LOOK AT THIS GROUP OVER HERE I KNOW THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE. NOBODY'S DONE BETTER WE HAD ALL OF THE SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT NOBODY WANTED TO GIVE IT OUT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT LOOKED TO MILITARISTIC. I SAID I WANT TO SAVE LIVES AND WE GAVE OUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS SITTING IN WAREHOUSES ALL OVER, MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT THERE'S NOBODY LIKE THE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [CHEERING] BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT , LOOK AT THAT. SEE, THEY LOVE YOU. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT. [CHEERING] THAT'S GREAT. IT'S ABOUT LAW AND ORDER. YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND. WE KEEP SAYING TO THE GOVERNOR LETS US SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN 30 MINUTES. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU TO COME IN. WE DID A GREAT JOB IN MINNESOTA. INSTEAD OF TEN DAYS THEY COULD HAVE CALLED US LIKE TWO HOURS LATER. BUT THEY CAME IN AND LINED UP AND WERE NOT SOCIALLY DISTANCED. THEY CAME IN WEARING BLACK UNIFORMS, 250,000, THE MOST EXPENSIVE UNIFORMS. ICE NEVER SAW EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS ON A HELMET BUT THEY HAD THEIR TEAR GAS AND PEPPER SPRAY WHICH THE OTHER SIDE DOESN'T WANT US TO USE ANYMORE. THERE'S A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE. THEY ARE IN OUR ANARCHISTS, RADICAL LEFT ANARCHISTS. SO THEY CAME IN. THERE WAS ONE PERSON, THEN ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER AND YOU HAD ONE LINE AND TO LINE AND TWO LINE AND THEY STARTED MOVING FORWARD. IT ENDED WITHIN 30 MINUTES IT WAS OVER. WE WOULD LOVE TO GO INTO PORTLAND. ONE MAN, A HORRIBLE GUY SHOT SOMEBODY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, HE WASN'T HURTING ANYBODY. TWO DAYS WENT BY, THREE DAYS WENT BY. WE SENT IN THE U.S. MARSHALS AND IN 15 MINUTES IT WAS OVER. BIDEN, HARRIS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DECLARED WAR ON OUR POLICE AND WE PROUDLY RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE NATIONAL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF POLICE ORGANIZATIONS, THE NATIONAL TROOP COALITION, THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF POLICE ASSOCIATIONS, THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPERS ASSOCIATION THE ORDER OF POLICE INCLUDING THOSE IN PHILADELPHIA PITTSBURGH, SCRANTON AND EVERY SINGLE POLICE ORGANIZATION AND DURING THE DEBATE I ASKED JOE GIVE ME ONE ORGANIZATION LAW ENFORCEMENT ENDORSING YOU AND HE COULDN'T DO IT. CHRIS WALLACE SAVED HIM AND I SAID REMEMBER SO SAY THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER AND HE WOULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE HE WOULD BE RUN OUT OF HIS PARTY. AT THE END DIDN'T HE SAY LAW AND ORDER AND SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND ALL THE STUFF, NO, SAY LAW AND ORDER. HE COULDN'T DO IT. SO WE ARE JOINED TIME NIGHT BY WARRIORS OF A DIFFERENT TYPE, POLITICAL WARRIORS AND FRIENDS OF MINE, GREAT PEOPLE, REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JOYCE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] HE'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND FIGHTS LIKE HELL. GP THOMPSON. BE CAREFUL I HEAR YOU ARE UP 40 POINTS. ANOTHER ONE ONLY ABOUT 44 POINTS, A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND TOUGH AS HELL, MIKE KELLY. IF YOU NEED ANY HELP I WILL COME AND HELP YOU IN THE DISTRICT. THE A FRIEND OF MINE AND GREAT GENTLE MAN OF THE FIRST ONE THAT PREDICTED I WAS GOING TO WIN THIS THING, FORMER CONGRESSMAN LOU BARLETTA. HOW ARE WE DOING ARE WE DOING OKAY, HOW DO WE COMPARE TO FOUR YEARS AGO. BETTER. HE SAID THE RIGHT THING. I THINK A LOT BETTER BECAUSE WE PRODUCED, AGAIN FOUR YEARS AGO I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS. NOW WE'VE DONE THEM ALL, PLUS ADDITIONAL THINGS. I NEVER TALKED ABOUT SPACE FORCE. THAT'S A MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT FOR FOUR YEARS. THAT'S ONE THING OUT OF SO MANY THINGS BUT I NEVER USED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. AND THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN PARTY, A FRIEND OF MINE AND WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA THAN ANY HUMAN BEING ON EARTH, ROB GLEASON. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] HOW ARE WE DOING, GOOD. OKAY, GOOD. HE SAID AND ANOTHER GROUP CAME DOWN THAT DIDN'T WANT HIS ADVICE, THEY CAME DOWN FROM BOSTON AND PUT EVENTS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY SAID YOU ARE GOING TO THE WRONG LOCATION. ANYWAY THEY ENDED UP LOSING BIG. WE CAME AND SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BEST PLACES ARE AND WE AGREED WITH YOU. HE'S BEEN A FANTASTIC FRIEND. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. APPRECIATE IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WITH THEIR HELP AND YOUR HELP WE ARE DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE NO NEVER BEFORE. NO ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER DONE THIS IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. MY FIRST THREE YEARS IN OFFICE FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY 6,000 AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ENERGY WHICH I THINK YOU COULD DOUBLE IT UP. MORE THAN FIVE TIMES IN ALL EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCOME GREW NINE TIMES MORE THAN IT DID UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. THINK OF IT, AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCOME GREW NOT TWO OR THREE BUT NINE TIMES MORE. AND THESE ARE OUT-OF-THE-BOX. THESE NUMBERS ARE OUT OF THE BOOK. REAL WEALTH FOR THE BOTTOM 50% GREW NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AND THE TOP 1%, HISPANIC FAMILY NET WORTH INCREASED BY 64% IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, 64. WE ADDED NEARLY 600,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS AND WE ADDED 15,000 FACTORIES AND OBAMA SAID HE WILL NEVER PRODUCE MANUFACTURING JOBS, REMEMBER, YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND. WELL, WE FOUND THE MAGIC WAND AND LIFTED 4.6 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING 1 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION HISPANIC AMERICANS DOING GREAT WITH BOTH GROUPS AND WE LOVE THEM. THOSE ARE GREAT NUMBERS. WAGES ARE THE LOWEST INCOME THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS GREW TWICE AS FAST AS THOSE NEAR THE TOP. YOU NEVER HEAR THAT STUFF. THE BIG BENEFICIARY WITH THE LOWEST INCOME AMERICANS. POLICIES HAVE BENEFITED THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AFTER THE VIRUS CAME IN FROM CHINA AND WE HAD A CHANGE, WE HAD TO DO THINGS. THIS CAME OUT, IT WAS A SUDDEN HORRIBLE THING. CHINA SHOULD HAVECHINA SHOULD HAVE NEVER, EVER LET IT HAPPEN. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET IT HAPPEN. WE'VE SEEN THE SMALLEST ECONOMIC CONTRACTION OF ANY MAJOR WESTERN NATION BY FAR AND WE'VE SEEN BY FAR THE FASTEST RECOVERY OF ANY NATION. IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS WE HAVE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION JOBS, THAT'S AMERICAN JOBS, THAT'S THE FASTEST RECORDED. JOB GROWTH HAS BEEN 23 TIMES FASTER THAN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS. THINK OF THIS, THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THE OBAMA BIDEN RECOVERY, 23 TIMES. WE CUT UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN HALF. IT TOOK 30 MONTHS TO RECOVER MORE THAN HALF THE JOBS LOST IN THE CRISIS. WE DID IT IN FIVE MONTHS, SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS NOBODY COULD BELIEVE. HOMEBUILDER CONFIDENCE HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC AND IT'S REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH. MANUFACTURING OPTIMISM HAS DOUBLED. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WHICH JUST CAME OUT SURGED NEARLY 20% AND SMALL CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER THAN ANY TIME IN THE ENTIRE DECADE PRECEDING MY ELECTION AND WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN ON THE PANDEMIC. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE LAST 47 YEARS. HE MADE EVERY BAD DEAL IN THE BOOK AND BY THE WAY IF YOU LOOK AT THE H1 N1, REMEMBER, JOE, H COMES BEFORE IN. WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN, SENATOR, MAYBE HE WAS A GOVERNOR, THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS ROMNEY. IT'S AMAZING AND HE GETS AWAY WITH IT. YOU ONLY SEE IT ON THE INTERNET. THEY NEVER REPORT IT. THEY SHOULD. THEY ARE DOING THE COUNTRY A GREAT DISSERVICE BY NOT REPORTING IT. BUT HE SUPPORTED NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WTO WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE COUNTRY. FOR HALF A CENTURY, BIDEN TWISTED HIS WEIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN WORKER. HE SHOULDN'T BE ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE, HE SHOULD BE ASKING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. HE DID A ROTTEN JOB. .. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING]. TO SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY THE LAST TPP THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A DISASTER TO DESTROY THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY INTO THE AND THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM WORKERS I PROPOSE POSTERIORS REMEMBER THEY WERE DUMPING STEALING WERE GETTING KILLED SAVING THEM FROM TOTAL DESTRUCTION AND FRANKLY HAVE AT NOT COMMON YOU HAVE A STEEL INDUSTRY THAT NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE AT THAT LEVEL PROPOSE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO SOME STUPID PERSON COMES IN DOES IT FOUR TIMES OF WHAT IT SHOULD BE I ENDED THAT NAFTA NIGHTMARE SIGNING INTO A BRAND-NEW USMCA AGREEMENT AND ALSO THE PARENTS CLIMATE ACCORD. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS GOING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE PROGRESS THIS NATION HAS MADE YOU WILL SEE IT IT WAS HAPPENING AT EVERY SINGLE RECORD BUT THE JOBS ARE COMING BACK AND THE MARKET WILL ALMOST BE TOPPING THE MARKET FROM BEFORE THAT PLAGUE. THAT IS PRETTY AMAZING. [APPLAUSE] BIDEN WAS TO REJOIN THE WHOLE BALLGAME IN WHICH IS A DEATH SENTENCE APPEARS ACCORD. TERRIBLE I KNOW MY JOB IS TO REPRESENT PENNSYLVANIA, NOT PARIS. PENNSYLVANIA.

HONORED TO PRESIDE AT TODAY'S EVENT. THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK, FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF CHICAGO, WASHINGTON, PITTSBURGH, FLORIDA, OREGON HOSTING TODAY'S SPECIAL EVENT. MANY OF YOU KNOW THE LEADERSHIP DESCENDED AN INDICATION FOR MAJOR NOMINEES TO PRESENT THEIR ECONOMIC AGENDAS, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN HAS NOT CONFIRMED, WE REMAIN HOPEFUL, THE SCHEDULE WILL PERMIT HIM TO JOIN US BEFORE THE ELECTION. STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS. WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A SPECIAL WELCOME TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND THE 2020 CLASS OF ECONOMIC CLUB FELLOWS AND STUDENTS JOINING US FROM THE CLUB IN FLORIDA BUSINESS SCHOOLS. IT IS AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO INTRODUCE THE 40 FIFTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD J TRUMP, A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE, FOLLOWED IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS IN THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, MAKING HIS MARK IN NEW YORK ON THE WAY TO DEVELOP A WORLDWIDE BRAND. HE WON THE PRESIDENCY IN 2016, HIS FIRST EVER RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS HIS ECONOMIC AGENDA INCLUDED PERSONAL INCOME AND CORPORATE TAX CUTS, REDUCTION OF REGULATORY, REPLACING NAFTA WITH THE UNITED STATES MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT AND NEGOTIATING COMPREHENSIVE TRADE REFORM, NOTABLY CHINA. PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE ECONOMY GREW STEADILY, THE EMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST IN 50 YEARS AND INFLATION WAS UNDER CONTROL. THE STOCK MARKET ACHIEVED RECORD HIGHS AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PRESIDENT TO PRESENT HIS ECONOMIC AGENDA FOLLOWING HIS ADDRESS, WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM TWO CLUB CHAIRS. THE CONVERSATION IS ON THE RECORD, WE HAVE MEDIA COVERAGE FOLLOWING THIS EVENT. THE MICROPHONE IS YOURS. THAT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL. WE HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS AND WE HAVE DONE MORE. WE ARE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE ROSE GARDEN, VERY SPECIAL PLACE. IT IS AN HONOR TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORK AND ECONOMIC CLUBS OF CHICAGO, WASHINGTON DC, SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROUD MEMBERS AND GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS KIND OF YEAR. DOING IT REALLY QUITE NICE WAY TO DO IT. THE CHOICE FACING AMERICA IS SIMPLE, A CHOICE BETWEEN HISTORIC PROSPERITY ON PRO-AMERICAN POLICIES, DEEP DEPRESSION UNDER THE RADICAL LEFT. I WILL DELIVER OPTIMISM, OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH, DELIVER PESSIMISM, STAGNATION AND HIGH TAXES, A CHOICE BETWEEN A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND WE HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE AT THE END OF THE YEAR , END A PANDEMIC, BRING BACK VERTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN TO LIFT OUR ECONOMY TO UNPRECEDENTED NEW HEIGHTS. OF THE LEFT GAINS POWER THEY WILL SIT DOWN THE ECONOMY, CLOSE OUR SCHOOLS, DELAY THE VACCINE, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC AND IMPOSE THE MOST EXTREME POLICIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. LET'S REVIEW THE RECORD. WHEN I JOINED YOU IN PERSON LAST YEAR OUR NATION WAS ENJOYING THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY. THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT. THIS WAS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION WHICH DELIVER THE WEAKEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IT WAS WEEKEND IT WAS SAD. MY FIRST THREE YEARS REAL INCOME FOR TYPICAL FAMILY INCREASED $6,000, MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE GAINS OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, FIVE TIMES THE GAIN. BLACK AMERICANS GREW NINE TIMES MORE UNDER MY LEADERSHIP OF VAN DURING THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. THEIR POLICIES PUNISH AMERICAN WORKERS, MY POLICIES PROMOTE AMERICAN WORKERS. AT THE END OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE PROJECTED FEWER THAN 2 MILLION JOBS WOULD BE CREATED IN THREE YEARS. WE DID A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT. WE CREATED 7 MILLION, CLOSE TO 8 MILLION JOBS BY THE TIME THE FINAL NUMBERS CAME IN BUT WE LIFTED 6.6 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY ACHIEVING THE LARGEST POVERTY REDUCTION IN MODERN US HISTORY. POVERTY RATES FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANIC AMERICANS REACHED RECORD LOWS. INEQUALITY DECLINED DRAMATICALLY. COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THE OBAMA YEARS. MY POLICIES HAVE BENEFITED THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST, THE BOTTOM 50% OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE ASTONISHING 40% INCREASE OF NET WORTH. WAGES ROSE THE FASTEST FOR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN-AMERICAN, UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION SOLD OUT AMERICAN WORKERS LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND THEY SOLD THEM TO DONOR SPECIAL INTERESTS AND GLOBALISTS AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK WE HAVE PROBABLY PLENTY OF THEM WATCHING RIGHT NOW. DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL WITH ME. WE SUCCEEDED BY REVERSING THOSE CRUEL AND HEARTLESS BE TRAILS. INSTEAD OF REWARDING COMPANIES ARE OUTSOURCING JOBS I IMPLEMENTED MASSIVE TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS TO KEEP JOBS OPPORTUNITY AND WEALTH IN AMERICA, THE TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS WERE THE BIGGEST EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. INSTEAD OF WAGING WAR ON THE AMERICAN ENERGY WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY TO MAKE THE UNITED STATES A NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, WRITTEN BY LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS, SOME OF YOU, NEGOTIATED PRO-AMERICAN TRADE DEALS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND RECIPROCITY. VERY IMPORTANT. I ENDED THE NAFTA NIGHTMARE AND SIGNED THE BRAND-NEW US-MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. THE TOUGHEST EVER ACTION AGAINST CHINA'S GREAT ABUSES THAT WE KNOW SO WELL. I IMMEDIATELY CANCELED THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S JOB KILLING TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND RENEGOTIATED THE SOUTH KOREA DEAL WHICH WAS A DISASTER. CHINA - WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. IF I DON'T GET ELECTED IN A LITTLE WHILE, 20 DAYS, CHINA WILL OWN THE UNITED STATES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THE CHINA VIRUS ARRIVED, SINCE WORLD WAR II TO DEFEAT THE VIRUS, BREAKING THROUGH EVERY OBSTACLE CUTTING EVERY PIECE OF RED TAPE, THE FDA HAS BEEN FANTASTIC, IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO YEARS. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING FRIENDS IN THE CORRUPT MEDIA AND IT IS CORRUPT. MY SOUL FOCUS IS PROTECTING AMERICAN LIVES AND MAKING LIVES GOOD FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL BEAT THIS VIRUS AND WE WILL ERADICATE THIS PESTILENCE AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY, OUR LIVES AND OUR PLANET, AGGRESSIVE AND EARLY ACTION SAVED UP TO 2 MILLION LIVES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL NUMBERS IT WAS PROJECTED AT 2.2 MILLION LIVES. WE ARE AT 210,000, ONE IS TOO MANY, IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. WE PIONEERED IN RECORD TIME, WE REDUCE THE FATALITY RATE 85% SINCE APRIL. THE NUMBER HAS GONE EVEN BETTER. I'M WORKING TO GET EMERGENCY APPROVAL FOR THE POWERFUL ANTIBODY TREATMENT I RECEIVED THAT HAS SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY PROMISE AS YOU KNOW. A WEEK AGO I WASN'T FEELING SO HOT AND I HAD A DRUG, REGENERON THAT MADE ME FEEL, CALL IT THERAPEUTIC. IT WAS VERY GOOD. WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY, MAYBE I WOULD HAVE RECOVERED BEAUTIFULLY ANYWAY. ALL I KNOW IS ONCE I HAD REGION ON IT WORKED OUT VERY WELL. UNDER OPERATION WARP SPEED WE ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER 100 MILLION DOSES OF VACCINE WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE TO QUICKLY FOLLOW. OUR MILITARY WILL BE DELIVERING IT, THE BEST PEOPLE ON EARTH IN OUR MILITARY. WE WILL DELIVER THE DRUG, DELIVER THE VACCINE RAPIDLY. THE MEDIA'S CONSTANT EFFORTS TO STOKE PANIC AND HYSTERIA TO CHANGE AN ELECTION IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, UNDERMINE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND PUT INNOCENT LIVES IN DANGER. THEY WILL NOT HAVE SUCCESS IN CHANGING THE ELECTION, THEY TRIED THAT FOUR YEARS AGO. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. AMERICANS SHOULD BE TRUSTED WITH THE FACTS, THE DATA AND THE TRUTH. FOR THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY THE RISK IS EXCEEDINGLY LOW. 99.98% OF THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 50 SURVIVED. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THOSE WHO SUCCUMBED TO THE VIRUS IS 78 AND USUALLY A PERSON WHO IS 78 BUT HAS BAD HEART, DIABETES, OTHER PROBLEMS. THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROTECTING ELDERLY AND HIGHER RISK AMERICANS. OUR GROUNDBREAKING THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THINGS FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS BUT I WILL NOT REST AND I WILL NOT REMIND UNTIL ALL-AMERICAN SENIORS ARE SAFE. THAT IS MY SACRED OBLIGATION. I LOVE OUR SENIORS. I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST ALLOW LOWER RISK AMERICANS TO RESUME NORMAL ACTIVITY. THE UNSCIENTIFIC LOCKDOWN PUSHED BY LEFT-WING POLITICIANS ARE NEEDLESSLY DESTROYING MILLIONS OF LIVES, THEY DECIMATE LIVELIHOOD, AND HEART DISEASE, DELAYED MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND LIFE EXPECTANCY. THE CURE COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF AND THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF STATES RUN BY DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE TO THEIR PEOPLE AND IT IS TURNING OUT VERY BAD FOR THEM. THESE LIVES MUST BE PROTECTED AS WELL. I HAVE ACTED SWIFTLY TO RESCUE THE US ECONOMY WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED $2.5 TRILLION IN AID. WE DELIVERED $160 MILLION IN RELIEF PAYMENTS FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS THROUGH PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM THAT ALL OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. MY ADMINISTRATION APPROVED $650 BILLION IN FORGIVABLE LOANS, 5.2 MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES, IT HAS BEEN A SAVIOR. THIS ACTION HAS SAVED OUR SUPPORTED AND SUPPORTED 50 MILLION JOBS AND WE THINK THAT NUMBER WILL BE WHEN IT IS FINALLY PUT DOWN IN ACTUAL FACT, EVEN MORE THAN THAT. WE INCREASE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BY $600. WHEN DEMOCRATS FAILED TO EXTEND THIS ASSISTANCE, I PROVIDED $400 A MONTH IN CONTINUED RELIEF. I FROZE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS, STOPPED EVEN ACTIONS, SUSPENDED PAYROLL TAXES AND DELIVERED $500 MILLION TO SAVE MAJOR US EMPLOYERS INCLUDING AIRLINES. AS A RESULT OF THESE DECISIVE ACTIONS THE US HAS BEEN THE SMALLEST ECONOMIC CONTRACTION IT HAS SEEN. THINK OF THAT. WITH ALL THE WE HAVE DONE AND ALL THE COUNTRIES OUT THERE SOME GREAT AND NOT SO GREAT WE HAVE SEEN THE SMALLEST ECONOMIC CONTRACTION AND THE FASTEST RECOVERY OF ANY MAJOR WESTERN COUNTRY. PEOPLE I TAKING NOTE OF THAT AND IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION AMERICAN JOBS SINCE MAY. THAT IS ANOTHER RECORD. UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, IT TOOK 30 MONTHS TO RECOVER HALF THE JOBS LOST, WE SURPASSED THAT MILESTONE IN FEWER THAN FIVE MONTH. A FEW MONTHS AGO MOST EXPERTS WERE PROJECTING UNEMPLOYMENT WELL OVER 10% THROUGH THE END OF 2020. WE HAVE CUT UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW 8%, SOMETHING IT TOOK THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THREE YEARS TO DO. JOBS HAVE BEEN RECOVERING 23 TIMES FASTER THAN THE OBAMA RECOVERY. 23 TIMES FASTER AND I KNOW THESE NUMBERS MUST BE TRUE BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME BY THE GREAT LARRY KUDLOW WHO IS SITTING ON MY LEFT. CONSUMER SPENDING IS ALMOST 10% HIGHER TODAY THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION HAS RECOVERED 100%. HOME SALES ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST SINCE DECEMBER, 2006, HOMEBUILDER SENTIMENT IS THE HIGHEST IN RECORDED HISTORY. THE HIGHEST HOMEBUILDER SENTIMENT IN RECORDED HISTORY AND WHEN A PANDEMIC AND WE ARE ROUNDING THE FINAL TURN, IF THE LEFT GAINS POWER THE RECOVERY WILL BE TERMINATED, THE ECONOMY WILL BE DESTROYED. THEY TOLD US THEIR EXACT PLANS. LEFT-WING POLITICIANS HAVE PLEDGED TO THE $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE WHICH WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AND THIS WILL RAISE TAXES ON 80% OF OUR TAXPAYERS, CUT THE CHILD TAX CREDIT IN HALF WHICH IS $1,000 PER CHILD AND PUNISH WORKING FAMILIES. THE HIGHEST BUSINESS TAX RATE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD WOULD BE CREATED, SENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS OUT OF AMERICA INTO CHINA, THEY WOULD BE THRILLED, IT IS NOT HIM WHO WANTS TO DO IT. IT IS AT A HIGHER LEVEL. REENTERING THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, ELIMINATING FOSSIL FUELS, SHUTTING DOWN FRACKING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN FRACKING, WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AS THEY WANT TO CLOSE UP SHUT DOWN FRACKING AND THEN ACTING THE RIDICULOUS GREEN NEW DEAL WHICH WILL COST $100 TRILLION WHICH IS MORE MONEY THAN THIS COUNTRY CAN MAKE AN HUNDRED YEARS IF EVERYTHING WENT PERFECTLY. DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS SPONSORED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD OUTLAW THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS FOR 180 MILLION AMERICANS, PRIVATE PLANS PEOPLE LOVE, THEY NEGOTIATED AND FOUGHT FOR AND GREAT COMPANIES, 180 MILLION PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM, IT IS OVER, THEY TAKE IT AWAY. THE DEMOCRAT PLATFORM WOULD SUSPEND ALL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, GAIN MASS AMNESTY TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, THE COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND AS SOON AS YOU ANNOUNCE THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DESPITE THE WALL WHICH IS ALMOST FINISHED AND BY THE WAY PAID FOR BY MEXICO DESPITE ALL OF THESE THINGS WE HAVE DONE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD FLOOD INTO THE COUNTRY, THIS WOULD A RATE MEDICARE AND DEMOLISH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON ARE ALSO PUSHING A PLAN TO ABOLISH THE SUBURBS BY ELIMINATING SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING AND LINKING FEDERAL HIGHWAY GRANTS TO A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF LOCAL ZONING. YOUR SUBURB WILL BE GONE. THE AMERICAN DREAM WILL BE GONE. THIS PLAN WILL DEVASTATE THE PROPERTY VALUES OF MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS HOMEOWNERS INCLUDING THE MAJORITY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS WHO LIVE IN THE SUBURBS. THE POLICIES OF THE LEFT WOULD UNLEASH A LONG-LASTING ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE OF UNIMAGINABLE PROPORTIONS. I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO SOME DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF YOU ARE FRIENDS OF MINE, YOU WILL SEE THINGS HAPPEN. AND DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE BACK IN SUCH POLICIES BUT I CAN ONLY ASSUME IT IS HAVE IT. THEY WILL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY WILL GO INTO A DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH WE'VE NOT SEEN SINCE 1929 AND MAYBE WORSE. KEEP BACKING THEM BUT YOU KNOW IT IS WRONG AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT IS ONLY HAVE IT, THAT IS THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN BE DOING IT. UNDER MY CONTINUED LEADERSHIP WE WILL CONTINUE OUR V-SHAPED RECOVERY AND LAUNCH A RECORD SMASHING ECONOMIC BOOM. WE WILL END THE PANDEMIC WITH A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE, CREATING MILLION JOBS, A PHENOMENAL YEAR AND WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING IN MY OPINION A PHENOMENAL, PHENOMENAL RECORD SETTING THIRD-QUARTER AND QUICKLY RETURN TO FULL EMPLOYMENT. I WILL IMPLEMENT A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT, REDUCE REGULATIONS THAT THE PLAYFUL SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE ALREADY CUT REGULATIONS MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY WHETHER FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS OR ONE CASE LAW I CUT REGULATIONS FAR MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY, A HIGHWAY THAT WOULD TAKE 21 YEARS TO GET APPROVED, WE CAN GET DONE NOW IN ONE YEAR AND IT MADE ME REJECT IT FOR SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS BUT YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW IN ONE YEAR WE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO A LEVEL NOBODY COULD BELIEVE. IT MAY GET REJECTED BUT REJECTED BEST BECAUSE IT GETS BUILT, EXPANDING OPPORTUNITY ZONES. ABLE INITIATIVE TO RESTORE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAINS AS PART OF THE EFFORT. I WILL REVIVE THE PARNAS , PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, KEEP TAXES LOW AND MOVE JOBS TO AMERICA AND IMPOSE DEEP TARIFFS ON ANY COMPANY THAT LEAVES. THEY WANT TO LEAVE, WANTS TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT AND SELL IT BACK AFTER FIRING EVERYBODY, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE WILL BE TARIFFS, WE WILL STRIP FEDERAL CONTRACTS FOR COMPANIES THAT OUTSOURCE CRITICAL INDUSTRIES, NEGOTIATE MORE, THIS HAS TO DO. NEGOTIATE MORE FAIR AND RECIPROCAL TRADE DEALS. WE WANT RECIPROCAL DEALS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT EUROPE HAS DONE OVER MANY YEARS, WE ARE BRINGING IT BACK INTO BALANCE BUT IT IS WAY UNBALANCED. WE PROTECT THEM MILITARILY AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US WITH TARIFFS AND NONMONETARY TARIFFS WHICH ARE WORSE. WE HAVE TO PUT AMERICA FIRST LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PUT THEMSELVES FIRST BUT WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER IN THE WORLD, ENDING RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE WILL ENSURE THAT AMERICA REMAINS THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE ENERGY PRODUCER, WE WILL END SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRED TRANSCRIPT THE GO INTO EFFECT. AND FURTHER REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, THOSE OF YOU IN THE DRUG INDUSTRY ARE NOT A BIG FAN OF DONALD TRUMP BUT I INSTITUTED A CLAUSE WITH GERMANY OR OTHER NATION BUYING THE DRUG FOR ONE TWENTIETH OF WHAT WE ARE PAYING AND IN SOME CASES YOU HAVE PRICE DISCREPANCIES LIKE THAT. WE GO TO THE LOWEST RATE IN THE WORLD FOR THE LARGEST PURCHASER OF DRUGS WE GO TO THE LOWEST PRICE, SOMEBODY SELLING A BILL FOR $0.10 AND WE ARE PAYING $2.50, WE GO TO $0.10 AND THE $0.10 WILL COME UP A LITTLE BIT BUT YOUR DRUG PRICES WILL BE REDUCED BY 50, 60, 70, 80, 90%. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS. WE STRONGLY PROTECT MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY, PATIENTS WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS AND AS FAR AS THE MIDDLEMAN IS CONCERNED THE MIDDLEMAN IS OUT AS FAR AS PURCHASING DRUGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES UNTIL EVERYTHING ELSE KICKS IN, CANADA PAYS 50% WHAT WE PAY. I HAVE GIVEN GOVERNOR'S PERMISSION TO GO TO CANADA AND BUY DRUGS DIRECTLY FROM CANADA, RON DESANTIS, THE STATE OF FLORIDA, APPROXIMATELY 50% AND MORE ON THE PURCHASE OF DRUGS, THEY BUY THE SAME DRUGS FROM THE SAME PLAN TO A LAB, 50% LESS. I OUTLINED A NEW PLAN TO PROVIDE HISTORIC PARITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PLAN CREATING NEW WEALTH, NEW ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SCHOOL CHOICE AS CIVIL RIGHT FOR EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY, WE NEED SCHOOL CHOICE. THE DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER GIVE YOU SCHOOL CHOICE, THEY WILL NEVER GIVE YOU CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE WORKED SO WELL. WE ARE LIFTING UP CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, RELIGION AND CREED, DELIVERING THE FUTURE OF FAIRNESS, JUSTICE AND DIGNITY FOR EVERY COMMUNITY IN OUR LAND AND WE ARE DEFENDING OUR VALUES AND PRINCIPLES AND OUR CHERISHED WAY OF LIFE. GUIDED BY TIMELESS CONVICTIONS WE WILL MAKE NEXT YEAR ONE OF THE SINGLE GREATEST YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. I THINK I WILL BE WITH YOU NEXT YEAR AGAIN BUT WE WILL HAVE 2 C. IF I DON'T WHEN THE ELECTION YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT ME AND THAT IS OKAY WITH ME TOO BUT I THINK WE WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. WE ARE HAVING LINES OF PEOPLE, 30, 40, 50,000 PEOPLE LINING UP TO SEE A SPEECH WITH ONE DAY NOTICE AND MY OPPONENT IS GETTING 22 PEOPLE WITH WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THEM. WE WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. I HOPE SO BUT NEXT YEAR WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY, WE WILL SEE GROWTH LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE AND AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. WE WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS PLEASE. THANK YOU, MISTER PRESIDENT. I WILL SAY THIS, YOU'RE LOOKING VERY FIT. THAT IS ALL FOR THE GOOD. WE ENTER THE Q AND A, TWO VERY ABLE QUESTIONERS TODAY ARE CINDY O'CONNELL OF THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF FLORIDA AND DAVID LUCASSIGN OF THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF WASHINGTON DC. EACH WILL BE ASKING TWO QUESTIONS IN ALTERNATING ORDER. YOU HAVE THE FIRST QUESTION. ON BEHALF OF THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF FLORIDA AND THE SUNSHINE STATE WE ARE HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THE QUESTION. HOW IMPORTANT IS FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS LIKE AIRPORTS, BRIDGES, ROADS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO NATIONAL SECURITY. HOW DO THESE FIGURE INTO YOUR NEXT TERM? VERY BIG. WE HAVE A PLAN NOW BUT WE WILL MAKE IT BIGGER. WE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING'S THINGS THROUGH THE DEMOCRATS. WE GOT THE WALL, THE WALL IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS EVER, THE WALL IS A MASSIVE HIGHLY TECHNICAL, HIGHLY EXPENSIVE WALL, HAS GIVEN US A TREMENDOUS BORDER, WE HAVE ACTUALLY SHUTDOWN THE ILLEGALS COMING IN, VIRTUALLY SHUT THEM DOWN AND THE DRUG TRAFFIC, EVERYTHING IS WAY DOWN AND WE CONSIDER THAT INFRASTRUCTURE, ONE OF THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS EVER. WE WANT TO REVIEW OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS, TUNNELS AND BRIDGES, SOME ARE IN SAFE. IF YOU LOOK AT A LIST, THEY CALL THEM UNSAFE. THEY CAN'T BE SO UNSAFE, HOW WOULD THEY LET THEM OPEN BUT IN VERY BAD CONDITION, AND BRIDGES, IT IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS LOOK GOOD, THEY WANT TO MAKE THINGS LOOK BAD. I WAS TELLING SOMEBODY, CAN THE COUNTRY COME TOGETHER? IT WAS COMING TOGETHER PRIOR TO THE PLAGUE COMING IN FROM CHINA SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENS. PRIOR TO THE PLAGUE COMING IN, PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME THAT WERE NOT CALLING ME FOR YEARS, THEY WANTED TO MAKE DEALS, WANTED TO GET TOGETHER AND BASICALLY SUCCESS IS GOING TO BRING US ALL TO GATHER, WE WILL HAVE GREATER SUCCESS NOW, RELATIVELY SPEAKING NOT MUCH, SUCCESS IS GOING TO BRING US TOGETHER, INFRASTRUCTURE IS A BIG PART OF IT. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TO WAS. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE FEDERAL DEBT. WE HAVE $27 TRILLION OF FEDERAL DEBT NOW. IF WE HAVE A STIMULUS BILL OUT OF CONGRESS, ARE YOU WORRIED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL DEBT WILL BE TOO LARGE TRUST TO PAY OFF IN A SENSIBLE WAY? YOU AND I TALK ABOUT FEDERAL DEBT A LOT. I KNOW WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND. IT IS ON MY MIND. THE ONE THING I WILL SAY IS WE WERE STARTING PRIOR TO THE PLAGUE TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN. WE WERE GETTING THAT NUMBER, INTEREST RATES WERE SO LOW AND SEEING THINGS ON SUCH A POSITIVE SCALE, WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT MONEY IN. YOU HAD TO PUT MONEY IN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT WE WERE STARTING TO FOCUS ON THAT VERY DEEPLY. WE WERE MAKING IT LONG-TERM, GETTING READY TO PAY OFF INTEREST, GETTING READY TO PAY OFF THE DEBT AND A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WERE HAPPENING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE RUNNING A COUNTRY AND IT IS GOING BEAUTIFUL YOU HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY AND YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO START THINKING ABOUT PAYING OFF LARGE CHUNKS OF DEBT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING LIKE THE PANDEMIC HAPPENS, THE PLAGUE BUT IT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME AND WE WILL START DOING THAT AND TREMENDOUS GROWTH, THE GROWTH WILL GET IT DONE. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. IT IS VERY MUCH ON MY MIND, ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS ASK ME AND ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I TALK TO YOU ABOUT AND THE SAD THINGS, WE WERE GETTING READY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WILL BE JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER AND THAT WILL BE NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE BIG THING IS TAXES ARE MUCH LOWER. DAVID CAN TELL YOU. WE TALK ABOUT THIS. MANY COMPANIES HAVE COME TO THIS COUNTRY THAT WOULD NEVER BE HERE IF WE DIDN'T CUT TAXES. THAT IS CORPORATE TAXES BUT WE CUT MIDDLE INCOME TAXES AND WE ARE GOING AGAIN FOR BIG MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT. THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND THEY WANT TO RAISE IT ON THE NONSENSE, THE GREEN NEW DEAL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIVISIONAL POINTS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL IT IS INSANE, IT IS ABSOLUTELY RELIGIOUS, LET'S TAKE DOWN BUILDINGS AND BUILD BUILDINGS WITH SMALLER WINDOWS BECAUSE THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY MORE EFFICIENT. THE WHOLE THING IS INSANE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A POLITICAL HOAX BUT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT AND DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE LOW TAXES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO BE LOW TAXES, WE ARE LOW REGULATION AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN REGULATION BUT NOT WHERE IT TAKES 21 YEARS TO GET A HIGHWAY APPROVED. I BELIEVE IN REGULATION WHERE IT TAKES ONE YEAR WITH TWO YEARS AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A DOWN. YOU CAN HAVE LOW TAXES, ONE OF THE THINGS I SPOKE WITH FARMERS TODAY AND WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED, THEY COLLECT THE DEATH TAX, THE ESTATE TAX ON FARMS, AND BUSINESSES, WE GOT RID OF. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE TAXES TO A LEVEL QUADRUPLE, TO A LEVEL NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. WHAT IS EVEN WORSE IS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND WANTS TO SQUANDER IT ON THIS GREEN NEW DEAL NONSENSE THAT WAS MADE UP BY A PERSON THAT HAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL SENSE, NO SENSE PERIOD. PURELY POLITICAL AND I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT POLITICALLY. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE CUTTING TAXES FURTHER AND THAT INCLUDES BUSINESS TAXES. BUT MIDDLE INCOME TAXES. WE HAD A POINT DURING THIS INCREDIBLE RUN PRIOR TO THE PLAGUE WHERE FAMILIES WERE SAVING $9,000 A YEAR WHEN YOU ADD ENERGY INTO IT, WHAT OBAMA HAD, THAT WAS SOMETHING. THE NUMBERS, FANTASTICALLY BIG NUMBER, BIG DIFFERENCE. FINAL QUESTION. SOME INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN VERY HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC LIKE THE CRUISE INDUSTRY, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THE HOTEL INDUSTRY, THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. WHEN DO YOU THINK THOSE INDUSTRIES WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER AND BE BACK WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC? ONE OF THE TOUGHEST QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS WAS A VICIOUS VICIOUS PANDEMIC, VICIOUS DISEASE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE OF A CERTAIN AGE ETC. ETC.. PEOPLE IN THE CRUISE INDUSTRY WERE SAILING HIGH, DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM IN THE WORLD AND ALL OF A SUDDEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES, SAME WITH HOTELS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE ARE TRYING TO HELP THEM. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE VACCINE WILL BE A BIG FACTOR. I ALSO THINK IT IS ROUNDING THE TURN WITH OR WITHOUT. IT WILL GET BACK, WE ARE TRYING TO GET STIMULUS MONEY WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. THE AIRLINE BUSINESS. PEOPLE ARE NOT HOPPING INTO AIRPLANES TO TRAVEL, YOU HAVE TO QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS. WHO IS GOING TO DO THAT? WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. IT WILL ALL COME BACK. THIS THING IS GOING AWAY AND IT IS ALL GOING TO COME BACK BUT IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DEMOCRATS LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS BAIL OUT THERE BADLY RUN CITIES AND STATES, THEY WANT BAILOUT MONEY. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WORKER, DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BAILOUT MONEY SO THEY CAN BAILOUT NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, ALL THESE STATES THAT FRANKLY NEED MORE HELP THAN THAT. THAT IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL THIS ELECTION IN THOSE PLACES. THEY NEED MORE HELP THAN THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THOSE INDUSTRIES, THEY WERE GREAT INDUSTRIES, THEY WILL BE BACK AND IT WILL BE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. I'M LOOKING AT THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, I ALWAYS THINK OF DAVID, MORE THAN GEORGE WASHINGTON WHEN I LOOK AT THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT BECAUSE HE REALLY DID A FANTASTIC JOB. HE SAVED IT, NOBODY IS TAKING IT DOWN, NOBODY IS GETTING CLOSE TO IT. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT SPEAKERS, LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW NAMES. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE'VE GOT GENERAL HR MCMASTER THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC CLUB IN NEW YORK THAT IS THIS AFTERNOON. THAT SHOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION. AFTER THAT TOM HARKIN, THE PRESIDENT OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF RICHMOND. THE EDITOR OF POLITICAL REPORT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE ORDER OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE CEO OF MORGAN STANLEY. THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MOODY'S ANALYTICS, IN THAT COMMISSION. THAT IS A GREAT AGENDA AND I WILL SEE YOU SOON.

THANK YOU. YOU MAKE SURE YOU ARE OK. MAINTAIN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WE HAVE NOW. STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY, SUPPORT OUR POLICE, PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. I DO NOT SEE YOU PEOPLE. I DO NOT THINK YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO GIVE UP THOSE GUNS. THAT IS NOT ARIZONA. ARREST VIOLENT CRIMINALS, CONFIRM OR JUDGES TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, PROSPERITY WILL SURGE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. NOBODY HAS EVER DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THEIR IS NO , THERE IS NO ADMINISTRATION HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. NOT EVEN CLOSE. OPTIMISM WILL BOOM. THE PANDEMIC IS ROUNDING THE TURN. I LOOK FINE, DON'T I? WE WILL GET BACK TO A NORMAL LIFE. SEVEN MONTHS AGO, WE WANT TO GET BACK. WE WILL BE BETTER THAN THAT VERY SOON. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. STOCK MARKET THROUGH THE ROOF. YOUR 401(K) IS THROUGH THE ROOF. YOUR STOCK THROUGH THE ROOF. YOUR HOUSING, THROUGH THE ROOF. YOUR OPTIMISM. WHAT ABOUT 56% OF THE PEOPLE? A POLE JUST CAME OUT. 56% OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE THAT ARE OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE A PANDEMIC. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR OF THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE CUTTING TAXES. THEY ARE RAISING YOUR TAXES. THAT IS AN EASY ONE TO FIGURE OUT. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY OR A BIDEN DEPRESSION. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING A SAFE VACCINE AND GETTING BACK IN AND WORKING. YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR HERE TODAY. HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AND HE HAS KEPT YOU OPEN. UNLIKE SOME OF THEM LIKE MICHIGAN. WE WON THE CASE IN MICHIGAN. THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WAS THE GOVERNOR'S HUSBAND. HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SAFE VACCINE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT BIDEN IS GOING TO DO? HE IS GOING TO LOCK THEM DOWN. WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY EVER. WE HAD TO CLOSE IT DOWN. WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES. THEN WE BUILT IT BACK UP. NOW WE ARE DOING RECORD TYPE NUMBERS. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE. BIDEN WILL DELAY THERAPIES, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC, CLOSE YOUR SCHOOLS AND SHUT DOWN OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE OPENING RAPIDLY. WE HAVE A V-SHAPED. IT IS MAYBE A SUPER V, WHICH NOBODY EVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE. HE WILL MASSIVELY RAISE YOUR TAXES. WE CUT REGULATIONS. IT WOULD TAKE 18 TO 21 YEARS TO GET A HIGHWAY APPROVED. WE HAVE IT DOWN TO ONE YEAR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? RIGHT NOW, IT IS LESS THAN TWO. IT MAY GET REJECTED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. THAT IS OK. PROBABLY NOT, BUT THAT IS OK. YOU CAN HAVE IT APPROVED OR NOT APPROVED AND IT IS A ONE YEAR PROCESS, NOT A 21 YEAR PROCESS. IN MY OPINION, WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON REGULATIONS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE GOING TO BRING ALL THOSE REGULATIONS BACK. THEY WANT TO DISMANTLE YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. DISSOLVE YOUR BORDERS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE BORDERS, YOU DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY. CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, BAN AMERICAN ENERGY, WIPEOUT PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. TERMINATE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. THIS IS FOR THE WOMEN. THE WOMEN WHO LIVE IN THE SUBURBS, THEY WANT TO DESTROY YOUR SUBURBS. I ENDED THE REGULATION. WOMEN FROM THE SUBURBS WILL NOT LIKE TRUMP. I SAID WHY, BECAUSE I AM STOPPING CRIME? YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SUBURBS BE SAVED. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS BUILT NEXT TO YOUR HOUSE. WE ENDED THE REGULATION THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED YOUR SUBURBS. IT IS AMAZING HOW THE WOMEN LIKE ME ALL OF A SUDDEN. AS YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CUT OUR MILITARY TO THE BONE. WE BUILT THE GREATEST MILITARY RIGHT NOW IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FRANKLY, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD. BIDEN WILL SURRENDER YOUR JOBS TO CHINA. HE WILL SURRENDER YOUR FUTURE TO THE BUYERS AND HE WILL SURRENDER THE FUTURE OF YOUR COUNTRY TO THE RADICAL SOCIALIST LEFT. THE ONLY THING BIDEN WANTS TO DO IS GET AS MUCH AS HE CAN FOR HIMSELF. I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HERE IS A PICTURE OF BIDEN PLAYING GOLF. I DID NOT KNOW MY SON WAS TAKING MONEY FROM BURISMA. I DID NOT KNOW MY SON GOT $3.5 BILLION FROM THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW. AND THEN YOU SEE ALL THE THINGS, RIGHT? WE HAVE TO GIVE THE MAN 10%, RIGHT? OH, BOY. [CHANTING LOCK HIM UP] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN , AND THE MEDIA, THEY WILL NOT ALLOW IT. CHARLIE KIRK, DO YOU KNOW CHARLIE KIRK? THEY SHUT DOWN A SITE BECAUSE HE MENTIONED , LOOK, HE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN, THIS GUY. BIDEN HAS MADE A CORRUPT EXCHANGE FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION. . HE HAS HANDED CONTROL OF HIS PARTY OVER TO THE SOCIALIST, THE COMMUNIST AND TO THE LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS. THAT IS BEFORE WE GET TO HIS OWN PERSONAL CORRUPTION, WHICH IS MORE THAN ANYBODY IN HISTORY. IT IS THE SECOND BIGGEST SCANDAL POLITICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. NUMBER ONE WAS SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN AND GETTING CAUGHT. BIDEN EVEN CHOSE AS HIS RUNNING MATE THE MOST LIBERAL SENATOR IN AMERICA. KAMALA, KAMALA. SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS IS THE SPONSOR OF THE SOCIALIST GREEN NEW DEAL AND LEGISLATION TO STRIP AWAY THE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS OF 180 MILLION AMERICANS. YOU KNOW, HER AND BERNIE SANDERS WANT TO DO SOMETHING IN ARIZONA. THEY HAVE SOME DEAL IN ARIZONA WHERE YOUR TAXES ARE GOING TO GO WAY UP. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? YOUR GREAT GOVERNOR WAS SAYING HE IS NOT HAPPY WITH IT. BUT BERNIE SANDERS, THE SECOND MOST LIBERAL PERSON , HE IS FIRST. , SHE IS FIRST. THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 8.5%. HE IS SAYING MORE. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT? RULE WHAT? RIGHT? YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. THEY CONTROL BIDEN 100%. BIDEN IS SHOT. HARRIS ALSO , URGED SUPPORTERS TO DONATE TO THE RIOTERS. NOT REPUBLICAN AREAS ALL THE WHY , AREAS BY THE WAY. YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND. WE COULD HAVE TAKEN 15 MINUTES. WE TOLD THE GOVERNOR, LET IS IN. WE WENT IN TO MINNEAPOLIS. IT TOOK US A HALF AN HOUR. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY COULD HAVE CALLED A LITTLE EARLIER. IN SEATTLE, THEY GAVE UP ON THEY HEARD WE WERE GOING IN THE NEXT MORNING. ALL DEMOCRAT AREAS. NEW YORK GOING TO HELL. I FEEL SO SAD WITH NEW YORK. CRIME IS UP 250%. A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED IN NEW YORK. LOOK AT CHICAGO. DEMOCRAT AGAIN. CRIME IS THROUGH THE ROOF. THEY HAD A WEEKEND, 87 PEOPLE WERE SHOT AND 16 DIED. THIS IS , WE ARE IN AFGHANISTAN. WE DON'T LOSE THAT MANY PEOPLE. WE ARE COMING OUT. WE ARE ALL COMING BACK HOME. EVEN IN WAR ZONES, YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT. WE COULD SOLVE IT SO EASILY. THANK YOU. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THAT CHANCE BEFORE. WE ALL LIKE RONALD REAGAN. HE NEVER HAD THAT CHANT, WE LOVE YOU. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME CRY. DO NOT DO THAT. I DO NOT WANT TO CRY. MAKE ME CRY, YOU WILL DESTROY MY IMAGE AND THEN YOU WILL NOT LOVE ME ANYMORE. I HAD A GOOD LIFE BEFORE I DID THIS. MY LIFE WAS VERY SIMPLE AND VERY NICE. THE DEMOCRAT PARTIES IS PUTTING POLICE OFFICERS IN AMERICAN FAMILIES IN GRAVE DANGER. UNLIKE JOE BIDEN, I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I WAS ENDORSED BY ALMOST EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING NEW YORK'S FINEST AND CHICAGO AND FLORIDA AND TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA AND EVERY PLACE AND I WAS JUST NAMED THE MAN OF THE YEAR IN THEIR BIG MAGAZINE, THE BLUE MAGAZINE, GOOD NAME FOR IT , MEN OF THE YEAR AND I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON I TELL YOU. I'M THE ONLY ONE STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND A LEFT RATE , LEFT WING CRUSADE. THEY WANT TO CHANGE OUR WHOLE COUNTRY. THE THING THAT IS GOING TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER IS SUCCESS. I WAS GETTING CALLS SEVEN MONTHS AGO, WE HAD THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WE EVER HAD. WE HAD THE GREATEST SUCCESS WE EVER HAD. WE WERE BEATING CHINA AT EVERYTHING. WE WERE BEATING EVERYBODY. THEY WERE CALLING ME, PEOPLE I WOULD NOT BE SPEAKING TO GENERALLY, LET'S GET TOGETHER, IT WAS HAPPENING AND THEN WE GOT HIT I THE CHINA PLAGUE AND WE HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. SUCCESS BRINGS US TOGETHER , I SAW IT AND WE SAW IT FOR TWO MONTHS IT WAS REALLY GOING ON. A NEW STUDY OF THE BIDEN HARRIS AGENDA FOUND THEIR PLANS WILL CRATER THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY BY MORE THAN 6005 HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEY ARE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PLANS TO FINANCE THE NEW GREEN DEAL. [BOOING] THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS THE CRAZIEST THING. NO MORE AIRPLANES, NO MORE DOUBLE COWS , DOUBLE CARS. NO MORE YOU. YOU WILL BE NEXT. IN JUST THREE YEARS, I INCREASED FAMILY INCOME BY $6,000. AND WE ARE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE ENERGY. DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD BE SEEING TWO DOLLAR GASOLINE AND WE SAVED ALL OF OUR ENERGY JOBS. ALL OF OUR ENERGY JOBS WE SAVED. BIDEN WILL EVISCERATE THE MIDDLE CLASS. MY POLICIES WILL LIFT THE MIDDLE CLASS TO RECORD HIGHS AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE GOING VERY QUICKLY. FOR THE LAST 47 YEARS, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN SHIPPED AWAY YOUR JOBS, SHUT DOWN YOUR FACTORIES, THROUGH OPEN YOUR BORDERS AND RAVAGED OUR CITIES WHILE SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN THESE ENDLESS, RIDICULOUS FOREIGN WARS. [BOOING] IN COUNTRIES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. JOE BIDEN IS A SERVANT OF THE LEFT-WING GLOBALISTS, THE WASHINGTON VULTURES WHO GOT RICH BLEEDING AMERICA DRY. THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE THEY MADE DEALS. I WOULD BE THE GREATEST FUNDRAISER IN HISTORY IF I WANTED TO CALL WALL STREET, I KNOW THEM ALL, I WANT $10 MILLION FOR MY CAMPAIGN, YES, ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS I WANT 10 MILLION, 15 MILLION , YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU ARE SELLING YOURSELF OUT. YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY. YOU SEE THEM SITTING ALL SORTS OF RECORDS , EVERY TIME THEY SET A RECORD THEY GAVE AWAY EVERYTHING. IN 2016, YOU VOTED TO FIRE THIS CORRUPT AND DECREPIT ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS PRESIDENT WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ABOUT TIME. IT'S ABOUT TIME. JOE BIDEN IS ALWAYS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNEW THAT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE KNEW THAT FOR A LONG TIME BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE LAPTOP, IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS. A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. SMOKING GUN EMAILS , WE JUST FOUND THEM, YOU SAW THAT , DID YOU SEE THAT , WE THINK THE LAPTOP WAS MADE BY RUSSIA. HE JUST SAID IT WAS MADE BY RUSSIA. HERE WE GO AGAIN. RUSSIA DID IT. RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. THE HEAD OF DNI WAS FANTASTIC AND CAME OUT AND SAID THAT WAS FALSE INFORMATION. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE, THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. YOU NOTICE THEY NEVER SAY IT WAS MADE BY CHINA BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ON THE TAKE. SMOKING GUN EMAIL JUST CAME OUT THE BIDEN FAMILY USED THE VICE PRESIDENCY AS A FOR-PROFIT CASH MACHINE AND JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN LYING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO COVER IT UP. REMEMBER HE SAID I NEVER MET ANYBODY FROM MARIE'S MOTHER. , FROM BURISMA. IS IT BURISMA? THEN THEY SHOW A PICTURE OF HIM PLAYING GOLF WITH THE HEAD OF BURISMA. OH BOY, OH BOY. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS AND CHINA WILL OWN THE USA. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. [BOOING] THE MEDIA AND BIG TECH IS TRYING TO HIDE THE ENTIRE SCAM. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING? THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLE LIKE CHARLIE KIRK OFF IF THEY EVEN MENTION BIDEN'S CORRUPT AND THEY KNOW HE IS CORRUPT BUT HE IS THERE CORRUPT, HE SO PERFECT FOR THEM. THEY KNOW PUBLICIZING THESE REVELATIONS WOULD MEAN AN END OF BIDEN'S PRESIDENTIAL RUN. I THINK IT IS AN END RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS AN END RIGHT NOW. HOW THE HELL , WHEN YOU SEE THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY DO, WHERE THE BIG GUY HAS TO GET AT LEAST 10%, THE BIG GUY. I WONDER WHO THE BIG GUY IS? WHEN YOU SEE , IF YOU PUT HIM AS PRESIDENT YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES. I'M NOT JUST RUNNING AGAINST BIDEN, I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE LEFT-WING MEDIA, THE BIG TECH GIANTS, AND THE WASHINGTON SWAMP AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING AGAINST IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND HERE I AM ALL BY MYSELF. ANYBODY OUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A CORNER RIGHT NOW, THUMB AND MOUTH SAYING MOMMY, TAKE ME HOME, MOMMY I WANT TO GO HOME. IT'S GREAT. DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S GREAT? NO ONE HAS EVER DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THEY FLOOD YOUR COMMUNITIES WITH CRIMINAL ALIENS, DRUGS AND CRIME WHILE THEY LIVE BEHIND BEAUTIFUL GATED COMMUNITIES. THEY TRY TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS WHILE THEY ENJOY PRIVATE SECURITY, FULLY ARMED, BY THE WAY. HOW ABOUT BLOOMBERG , HE'S FIGHTING GUNS AND HE'S GOT FIVE GUYS AROUND HIM WITH GUNS. THEY SUPPORT CRIPPLING LOCK DOWNS WHILE THEIR INDUSTRY REMAINS TOTALLY EXEMPT. IT'S TIME TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THESE WEALTHY HYPOCRITES IN WASHINGTON AND SILICON VALLEY, SHOW THEM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE IN CHARGE BY DELIVERING THEIR CANDIDATE, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, WHO SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THEIR CANDIDATE, HE SHOULD HAVE LOST BECAUSE ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS WARREN, IF SHE WOULD HAVE DROPPED OUT THE DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY, JOE WOULD HAVE LOST EVERY SINGLE STATE TO CRAZY BERNIE, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BUSINESS. WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM A THUNDERING DEFEAT ON NOVEMBER 3. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. IF I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IT'S BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR YOU. AND I'M FIGHTING SO HARD. I HAD A GREAT LIFE. I FOUGHT SO HARD BECAUSE I LOVE MY COUNTRY AND BECAUSE I'M DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN AGAIN. AND THEY WON'T BE. AND WE TALKED THAT LESSON FOUR YEARS AGO BUT WE ARE GOING TO TEACH THEM AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. I USED TO GO A FEW MONTHS AGO , I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS IMPORTANT, THAT'S IMPORTANT, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE BIDEN AGENDA WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR ARIZONA SENIORS. DO WE HAVE ANY SENIORS IN THE HOUSE? BIDEN IS PLEDGING MASS AMNESTY AND FREE FEDERAL HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS. YOU SAW THAT WHERE HE WAS UP ON THE STAGE WITH HIS RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS. WHO'S WILLING TO GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? EVERYBODY RAISED THEIR HANDS AND BIDEN COULDN'T GET HIS UP. YOU KNOW IT WAS WRONG BUT THEN HE LOOKS AND HIS BRAIN IS SHOT SO HE LOOKS OVER HERE IN THEIR HANDS WERE ALL UP AND THEN THEIR HANDS WERE ALL UP, THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM, HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO HORRIBLE FOR OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS GOING TO FLOOD OUR COUNTRY IF YOU GET FREE HEALTH CARE, YOU GET FREE EDUCATION, I JOKINGLY SAID EVERYONE GETS A ROLLS-ROYCE AND CNN SAID THAT'S ALIVE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS HE COULDN'T GET IT UP AND HE LOOKED AND HE GOT IT UP AND I SAID AND Q, WE JUST WON THE ELECTION. , I SAID THANK YOU, WE JUST WON THE ELECTION. IT'S HIS PARTY, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT, THEY WANT SOCIALIZED MEDICINE AND THEY WILL DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. WHILE I'M PRESIDENT, NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR MEDICARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BIDEN IS ALWAYS COMPLAINING, WE DIDN'T STOP CHINA FAST ENOUGH EXCEPT HE DIDN'T WANT TO STOP HIM AT ALL. HE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING AND YET HE WAS HERE FOR 47 YEARS. I SAID JOE, JOE, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE OUT TIGHTER. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO, 47 YEARS AND ALL HE DOES IS COMPLAIN. BIDEN HAD 47 YEARS TO FIGHT FOR SENIORS AND REDUCE PRESCRIPTION DRUG CUSSON LOOK WHAT I HAVE DONE. I JUST , THEY ARE GOING TO COME DOWN 70%, 80%, 90% BECAUSE I JUST DID SOMETHING NOBODY THOUGHT I WOULD DO. WE PAID THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD. YOU WILL SEE NUMBERS THAT ARE SHOCKING. THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ME, THE BIG PHARMA. BIG PHARMA IS SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE ADS, EVERY ONE OF THOSE ADS MEANS YOUR DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. I TRIED TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THEM, BUT WE COULDN'T. IN THE END THEY GOT TOO GREEDY, TOO MUCH MONEY, TOO MUCH MONEY. WE BROUGHT DRUG PRICES DOWN 1%. IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS DRUG PRICES CAME DOWN, BUT NOW WE ARE GOING FOR THE BIG ONE. NOW WE ARE GOING FOR THE BIG ONE. REBATES, THE RICHEST PEOPLE, THE MIDDLEMAN, YOU KNOW WE HAVE MIDDLEMEN, NO ONE KNOWS WHO THE HELL THEY ARE. WE WILL MAKE IT POLITICALLY CORRECT , THEY ARE CALLED MIDDLEMEN. NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. THESE GUYS ARE SO RICH, WHO ARE THEY? I BET YOU HUNTER GETS A PIECE OF THE ACTION. HUNTER BIDEN IS A MIDDLEMAN ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. HE GETS IT FROM CHINA, HE GETS IT FROM UKRAINE, HE GOT THREE AND A HALF MILLION FROM RUSSIA, FROM MOSCOW, AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE HE'S A MIDDLEMAN. I BET HE IS. HE PROBABLY GETS A PIECE OF THE ACTION. INSTEAD, HE IS SELLING OUT TO THE DRUG PHARMACIES. I'M TAKING ON THE POWERFUL INTERESTS, NOBODY'S EVER DONE THIS BEFORE. NOBODY HAS EVER DONE IT BEFORE. FOR YEARS, YOU HEARD ABOUT DRUG PRICES, NOBODY EVER DID ANYTHING. NOW YOU HEAR ABOUT DRUG PRICES AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE DROPPING LIKE A ROCK. I'M LETTING YOUR GOVERNOR, YOUR GREAT GOVERNOR BY, UNTIL THE THING KICKS IN AND PROBABLY LITIGATION, BUT EXERCISE THIS WHOLE THING WITH FAVORITE , IF GERMANY PAYS $.10, WE PAY A DOLLAR AND IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MATCH AND WE GET THE LOWEST PRICE BUT UNTIL IT KICKS IN, CANADA PAYS HALF OF WHAT WE PAY. SO I'M LETTING YOUR GOVERNOR AND OTHER GOVERNORS GO TO CANADA, BY YOUR DRUGS ARE CANADA, SAVE 50%. WE GET RID OF THE MIDDLEMAN. THE OTHER THING WE DID, MUCH LESS THAN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, WE CAPPED INSULIN COST FOR MEDICINE. MEDICARE PLANS AT LESS THAN $35 A MONTH, PEOPLE WERE DYING BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD INSULIN. 33 MILLION SENIORS , THINK OF THIS. 33 MILLION SENIORS ON MEDICARE WILL SOON BE RECEIVING $200 TO HELP WITH THEIR DRUG COSTS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. BY THE WAY, IN ALL FAIRNESS, NOBODY HAS DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS, BUT YOUR BIG THING, YOUR BIG THING IS GOING TO BE WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FAVORED NATIONS BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS WERE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE PAYING A TINY FRACTION AND WE BEAR ALL THE COST BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS SOLD US OUT. THEY SOLD US OUT. THAT I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I COULDN'T STAND WATCHING THEM. NOW THE CHINA VIRUS, WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. OUR EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION SAVED MORE THAN 2 MILLION LIVES. I ACTED EARLY TO BAN TRAVEL FROM CHINA , HOW ABOUT THIS , YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER. IN THE MEANTIME, HE CALLED ME XENOPHOBIC, RIGHT? MUCH LATER HE AGREED I WAS RIGHT AND NOW HE'S SAYING I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER. THIS GUY. I ALSO BANNED FROM EUROPE BECAUSE IT WAS ITALY AND SPAIN AND FRANCE AND BY THE WAY THEY HAVE A BIG SPIKE RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE A VERY BIG SPIKE RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE DOING GOOD. WE HAVE THE VACCINES COMING AND EVEN WITHOUT, WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. PEOPLE ARE PANDEMICED OUT. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO GREAT WHAT YOUR GOVERNOR HAS DONE. HE'S OPENED UP YOUR STATE AND YOU ARE DOING GREAT. BY THE WAY, YOU GET IT YOU KNOW HERE I AM , I'M HERE. AND NOW I'M IMMUNE. I CAN JUMP INTO THIS AUDIENCE AND KISS EVERY MAN AND WOMAN. I'M IMMUNE. RIGHT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT USED TO BE YOU ARE IMMUNE FOR LIFE AND WHAT I SAID AT , THEY SAID IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR FOUR MONTHS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT? I WILL JUMP INTO THAT AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW. WE PIONEERED LIFESAVING THERAPIES AND REDUCE THE FATALITY RATE 85%. THINK OF THAT. I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD , I FEEL NOT SO GREAT AND I'M NOT USED TO THAT AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR GAME. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T LET BIDEN BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE'S NOT AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME MENTALLY. YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT. ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU. AND, PRESIDENT CHEE OF CHINA, THEY ARE VERY MUCH AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME. YOU CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. YOU CAN'T. IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT, ONE THING YOU ARE GUARANTEED LOTS OF DOCTORS AND THEY WOULD GRAB ME AND THEY GRABBED ME BY EVERY PART THEY HAD HANDS ALL OVER ME AND I SAID GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD. I USED THE DRUG READ WHICH NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO AND I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND I WAS LIKE I FELT LIKE SUPERMAN. GET ME OUT OF HERE. I SAID GET ME OUT OF HERE. ELI LILLY MAKES A SIMILAR PRODUCT AND WE ARE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND GET EMERGENCY YOU SO WE CAN DO IT FASTER BECAUSE IT'S EARLY BUT IT'S FANTASTIC, ANTIBODIES AND WE ARE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE IT ALL OVER AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM, THEY CAN GET THE SAME DRUGS I GOT AND I'M TELLING YOU IT WILL BE THE SAME RESULT. IT WILL BE THE SAME RESULT AND IT'S FREE. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT FREE. COMPANIES ARE WORKING WITH US. BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT, IT'S CHINA'S FAULT. BUT I WOKE UP AND I FELT GOOD AND SAID GET ME OUT OF HERE. BOOM, SUPERMAN. THROUGH OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE WILL HAVE 100 MILLION VACCINE DOSES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR AND OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THEM AND THERE'S NOBODY LIKE OUR MILITARY. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] , THE VACCINE WILL END THEIR PANDEMIC, BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE PANDEMIC, IT GOING TO END. THIS CAN GO QUICKLY , THIS CAN MAKE IT GO A LOT FASTER. BIDEN'S LOCKDOWN WILL CRUSH AMERICA. MY PLAN WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS AND BRING BACK YOUR AMERICAN DREAM. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY SOME VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE BEGINNING. HE'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING FROM THE STATE MONEY, HE WILL CALL ME ALL THE TIME AND I SAY DO ME A BREAK. I GUESS THAT IS WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO DO. I WILL SAY ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT, PROMISE NOT TO CALL AND HE WILL CALL ME TWO WEEKS LATER. HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR, ONE OF THE GREATEST GOVERNORS, HE'S DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. YOU ARE DOWN TO LOW NUMBERS, BY THE WAY. DOUG DUCEY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WE WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR RHONDA MICK SALLY. SAVE YOUR SECOND. SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. DO YOU WANT TO COME UP? COME HERE FOR A SECOND. COME ON, DOUG. THIS GUY , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE HIM OR NOT, I DON'T CARE. HE'S BEEN A GREAT GUY. DONALD TRUMP WIN ARIZONA. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE REELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND ALONG WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, MARTHA MCSALLY ON NOVEMBER 3 WILL JOIN THEM IN THE U.S. SENATE. MR. PRESIDENT, BECAUSE OF YOUR POLICIES, ARIZONA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING. OUR HOME VALUES ARE RISING FASTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE NATION AND AMY CONEY BARRETT WILL BE CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS WRONG FOR AMERICA. JOE BIDEN WOULD LOCK US DOWN. JOE BIDEN WOULD REDUCE YOUR INCOME $6,500 AND JOE BIDEN WOULD MAKE WASHINGTON DC A STATE. AND HOW MANY PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD PROTECT ARIZONA BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT BERNIE SANDERS WANTS TO DO HERE BY ENDORSING PROP 208, WANTING TO RAISE OUR TAXES 77%? SO ON NOVEMBER 3, VOTE NO ON PROP 208 AND VOTE YES FOR DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE TO GO BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. HE'S A GREAT, GREAT GOVERNOR. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE HER TIME OR ANYTHING BUT MARTHA MCSALLY IS HERE. SHE IS SAVING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. SHE HAS BEEN A GREAT, GREAT SENATOR. COME HERE, HONEY. SHE HAS BEEN A GREAT, GREAT SENATOR AND JUST GO OUT AND VOTE FOR MARTHA MCSALLY. SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THANK YOU, DARLING. SHE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AND SHE'S A WORKER AND SHE'S A GREAT FIGHTER PILOT. THEY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HER, SOME OF THE PILOTS SAID SHE WAS A GREAT FIGHTER PILOT. THANK YOU MARTHA, THANK YOU, DOUG. WE ALSO HAVE A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE THEY SAY IS A STAR IN THE MAKING. I'VE HEARD IT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. VOTE FOR BRANDON MARTIN. RENDON, GOOD LUCK, MAN. I HEAR IT'S GOING GOOD. BRANDON MARTIN. THANK YOU, BRANDON. YOU ARE GOING TO DO GREAT. I HEARD YOU ARE DOING REALLY WELL. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. WE DID IT AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. AND IT'S HAPPENING MUCH FASTER. IT LOOKS LIKE , IN MY FIRST THREE YEARS, WE INCREASED FAMILY INCOME MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE GAIN IN ALL EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION , PINK OF THAT. FIVE TIMES MORE IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS. FIVE TIMES MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN , THAT'S NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT ALL REACHED RECORD LOWS, THE LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. SIX POINT 6 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF POVERTY, INCLUDING MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION HISPANIC AMERICANS, THAT IS A RECORD. AND I'M DOING VERY WELL IN THE POLLS WITH HISPANIC AMERICANS, BUT I ALWAYS LIKED YOU AND YOU ALWAYS LIKE ME, THE FAKE NEWS JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT. OUR POLICIES ARE LIFTING UP ALL AMERICANS OF EVERY INCOME SINCE THE CHINA VIRUS, WE CREATED 11.4 MILLION AMERICAN JOBS, IT'S A RECORD. NOBODY'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT , NORMALLY I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS BUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE A WEEK AGO HIT 7.8%. THINK OF THAT. WE WERE HEARING 42, IT'S GOING TO GO TO 44, GOING TO GO TO 38, IT'S , THINK OF THAT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT? NORMALLY I WOULD NOT SAY IT BECAUSE WE WERE AT 3.4, 3.5 AND BETTER THAN THAT BUT WE WILL BE THERE SOON. AFTER THE VIRUS LEFT CHINA, WE EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST CONTRACTION OF ANY MAJOR WESTERN COUNTRY AND THE FASTEST RECOVERY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD FROM AN ECONOMY STANDPOINT. AND WE HAVE ALREADY CUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN LESS THAN HALF. THAT'S A FANTASTIC THING. UNDER BIDEN AND OBAMA, IT TOOK THREE AND A HALF YEARS FOR ARIZONA TO REGAIN 60% OF THE JOBS LOST IN THE CRISIS AND WE HAVE DONE IT IN FOUR MONTHS. THINK OF THAT. AND IT WASN'T OUR FAULT. MANUFACTURING, PRODUCTION IS UP 61%. RETAIL SALES ARE UP EXCUSE ME 121%. THAT MEANS MORE THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION, NOBODY IS GOING TO BELIEVE THIS ONE, IS UP 350% SINCE APRIL LOWS. 350%. I HAVE A WAY WE CAN STOP IT, ELECT SLEEPY JOE. WHO HAS A 401(K)? IF I TOLD YOU YOUR 401(K)S AND YOU ARE ALL AT RECORD HIGHS ARE VERY CLOSE, IF I TOLD YOU YOUR 401(K)S WILL BE CUT IN HALF AND MUCH WORSE THAN THAT, THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU ARE GOING TO END UP IN A DEPRESSION. HE'S GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES BY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND THEY ARE GOING TO PUT ON REGULATIONS, EVERY COMPANY IS GOING TO SAY LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THE REGULATION CUTS WHICH ARE MORE THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER DONE, THE REGULATION CUTS IN THEIR OWN WAY WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE BEEN DELIVERING FOR OUR INCREDIBLE HISPANIC AMERICAN AND I'M FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE, SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND HISPANIC OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD WIPE OUT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LOCKDOWNS AND REGULATIONS. HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, I WOULD LOCK IT DOWN. THANK YOU JOE, WE APPRECIATE IT. AND DEVASTATE YOUR FAMILIES WITH MASSIVE TAX HEIGHTS. HE WILL WAGE WARS ON CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS, AND CHARTER SCHOOLS, FUND EXTREME LATE TERM ABORTIONS. AND HE WILL LET SOCIALISTS RUN WILD AND WE WILL NEVER HAVE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. WE WILL NEVER HAVE IT. WE CAN'T. WE WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO WIN A RECORD SHARE OF THE HISPANIC VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. GET OUT AND VOTE, GET OUT AND VOTE. FOR DECADES, OUR , FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS, DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS BUT NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES, WE ARE PROTECTING OUR BORDERS. YOU KNOW THE WALL IS ALMOST FINISHED. AND BY THE WAY, THE GUEST BENEFICIARY MAY BE HAPPENS TO BE ARIZONA. THAT WALL. HOW GOOD IS THE WALL. THE GOVERNOR WAS TELLING ME NOW THEY ARE COMING LEGALLY , THE WALL IS GREAT. IT GOES DOWN DEEP AND GOES UP HIGH. AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES, OUR TROOPS BACK HOME IN THE USA WHERE THEY BELONG, RIGHT? UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN HISTORY. AND I WANT TO THANK MEXICO. MEXICO HAS RIGHT NOW 27,000 TROOPS GUARDING OUR BORDER. HOW ABOUT THAT? AND WE BUILT ALMOST 400 MILES OF THE WALL. WE ARE AVERAGING ABOUT 10 MILES A DAY AND IT'S THE BEST. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT BORDER PATROL WANTED. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT UP CONCRETE PLANKS AND THEY SAID NO SIR, WE HAVE TO HAVE IT THIS WAY, SIR. WE GAVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANTED AND THEY ARE REALLY HAPPENING , THEY ARE REALLY HAPPY AND WE'VE GOT THE BEST BORDER WE'VE EVER HAD AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAVE A BIG CHUNK OF IT RIGHT HERE AND IT HAS REALLY WORKED. YOU HAVE 200 MILES, THEY TELL ME. 200 MILES. 200 MILES , THAT'S A LOT OF MILEAGE. YOU ARE NOT PAYING A DAM SENT FOR IT. ALL COMPLEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, RIGHT? REMEMBER NANCY PELOSI , THEY SAID WE DON'T NEED A WALL. WALLS ARE OBSOLETE. TWO THINGS DON'T GET OBSOLETE , WALLS AND WHEELS. EVERYTHING ELSE IS OBSOLETE. THEY DEVELOPED A NEW CHIP YESTERDAY IN 15 MINUTES IT'S GOING TO BE OBSOLETE. NEW COMPUTER, 15 MINUTES, OBSOLETE. TWO THINGS WILL NEVER BE OBSOLETE , A WHEEL AND A WALL. DEMOCRAT SAID WE WANT DRONES. YOU CAN HAVE DRONES WATCHING EVERYBODY POUR INTO THE COUNTRY. NO THANKS. 200 MILES OF ALL IN ARIZONA AND YOU'VE GOT IT ALL AND IT'S ALL DONE. JOE BIDEN'S PARTY CONTINUES TO ATTACK OUR INCREDIBLE BORDER AGENTS AND MORE THAN HALF OF WHOM HAPPEN TO BE HISPANIC AMERICANS. I KNOW A LOT OF THEM. AM I RIGHT? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF ICE AND BORDER PATROL. THEY ARE DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS. MY OPPONENT'S IMMIGRATION PLAN IS THE MOST EXTREME PROPOSAL EVER PUT FORWARD. HAYDN'S PLAN WOULD ELIMINATE U.S. BORDERS BY IMPLEMENTING NATIONWIDE , THEY WANT NATIONWIDE CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU KNOW WHAT CATCH AND RELEASE IS? YOU CATCH THEM, YOU TAKE THEIR NAME, THEY COULD BE MURDERERS, RAPISTS AND THEY RELEASE THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY. GUESS WHAT? WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. IT WOULD HAVE MADE , THEY WANT TO MAKE EVERY COMMUNITY INTO A SANCTUARY CITY. [BOOING] AND THEY WANT TO SUSPEND ALL REMOVALS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS. AND THIS IS DONE BY CRAZY BERNIE, RIGHT? BERNIE SANDERS MADE A DEAL, WE CALL IT THE MANIFESTO WITH JOE BIDEN AND ITS FURTHER LEFT THAN BERNIE EVER WAS. JOE DID A GREAT JOB OF NEGOTIATION. SUPPOSED TO BRING THEM TO THE RIGHT, HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE LEFT. IT WOULD MEAN THE TOTE , TOTAL NULLIFICATION OF U.S. BORDERS. MS 13 AND CRIMINAL CARTELS WOULD RAMPAGE THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY FREELY. IF BIDEN WINS, YOUR BORDERS ARE GONE, WHICH MEANS YOUR HEALTH CARE IS GONE. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GONE AND YOUR SAFETY IS GONE. OTHER THAN THAT, HE'S DOING QUITE A GOOD JOB. FROM THE MOMENT I TOOK OFFICE, I WORKED NIGHT AND DAY TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT WASN'T EASY AND NOW WE'VE GOT IT. AND STOPPING IT FOR ARIZONA WAS A BIG DEAL. I ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, I TOOK DOWN THE SMUGGLERS AND COYOTES. THESE ARE NOT NICE PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, AND I KEPT MY PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ARE FINDING THE DRUG DEALERS ALL OVER AND WE ARE RESTING THE DRUG DEALERS LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE. WE ARE FINDING THE PREDATORS, WE ARE FINDING THE GANG MEMBERS, WE ARE FINDING MS 13 KILLERS AND WE ARE EITHER THROWING THEM IN JAIL OR SENDING THEM THE HELL BACK HOME WHERE THEY CAME FROM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE INVESTED 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT NOW ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE, A VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED GENERAL TOLD ME WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION. I SAID NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HEAR THAT. TRULY THIS WAS A GENERAL I DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR BUT HE SAID WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION SO I SAID WELL, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE ARE NOW THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE WEAPONS THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS. RUSSIA, CHINA, NOBODY. AND FOR OUR VETS, WE PASSED THE A CHOICE NVA ACCOUNTABILITY. WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS AND TOOK DOWN THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND MASS MURDERER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND MANY PEOPLE, SALOME KNEES DAD. , STELLA MANEY , IS DEAD.

CSPANDT2610202094	Donald Trump	2020-10-26	President Trump Campaigns in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania	THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. HELLO. HELLO. WE TRIED TO COME HERE VERY LOW-KEY. HE WANTED TO MAKE A LOW-KEY APPEARANCE. DID ANYBODY NOTICE THE HELICOPTER FLYING A LITTLE LOW? GREATEST PILOTS IN THE WORLD, GREATEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. GREATEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD, BUT THE GREATEST PILOTS. NOBODY CAN DO WHAT OUR PILOTS CAN DO. RIGHT, MIKE? HELLO, PENNSYLVANIA. EIGHT DAYS FROM NOW -- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? EIGHT DAYS. STARTED OFF FOUR YEARS AGO. IT WAS A LOVE FEST RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING AND NOW IT IS MORE SO THAN IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE FINDING THAT OUT VERY SOON. I HAVE THE RATINGS RIGHT ON ME. JOE BIDEN -- SLEEPY JOE BIDEN SAID A LITTLE WHILE AGO HE WAS A LID -- A GARBAGE CAN, THEY PUT THE LID ON IT. WE HAD TWO OF THESE, THEY WERE FANTASTIC. DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA. SLEEPY JOE WAS THERE AND THEY SAID, YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS BASEMENT. HE TRAVELED FROM DELAWARE TO A TINY CORNER OF PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT NEXT TO DELAWARE AND MADE A SPEECH. HE SAID HE DOESN'T DO THESE KIND OF RALLIES BECAUSE OF COVID. HE DOESN'T DO THEM BECAUSE NOBODY SHOWS UP, THAT'S WHY. COVID, COVID, COVID. THAT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT, THE FAKE NEWS. COVID, COVID, COVID. THAT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT. WHAT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE ON IT, TOO. WE UNDERSTAND IT. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE HARD, DIABETES PROBLEMS. WE HAVE THE BEST TESTING IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MANY CASES. HERE I AM. I AM HERE, TOO. I DIDN'T FEEL SO GOOD ONE DAY. ONE DAY I DIDN'T FEEL EXACTLY GREAT, MIKE -- OUR GREAT CONGRESSMAN. I DIDN'T FEEL EXACTLY GREAT. I SAID, WHAT'S THE STORY? SIR, YOU HAVE TESTED POSITIVE? I SAID, POSITIVE FOR WHAT, TELL ME? AS PRESIDENT, YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB. YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE BASEMENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU CAN'T STAY IN A BEAUTIFUL BEDROOM UPSTAIRS. YOU HAVE GOT TO DO YOUR JOB. I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY. ONE DAY THEY CAME BACK AND THESE DOCTORS WERE SO GREAT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM. WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT, THERE IS SO MANY DOCTORS. I HAD 12 DOCTORS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I HAVE NEVER HAD 12. EACH ONE WAS A SPECIALIST, DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY. THEY WOULD GRAB MY BODY, AND I HATED IT. GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY BODY, DOCTORS. LET'S MAKE ME FEEL GOOD. WE TOOK SOMETHING INCREDIBLE, REGENERON. MAYBE I WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT DOING NOTHING, BUT WHO THE HOUSE WANTS TO TAKE A CHANCE? I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND I FELT LIKE SUPERMAN. [CHEERS] GET ME BACK, GET ME BACK. THE FIRST LADY HAD IT. SHE DID GREAT. SHE IS GREAT. AND SHE IS POPULAR, TOO. PEOPLE LIKE HER. SHE HAD IT, DOESN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS. OF COURSE, BARRON HAD IT. YOUNG, STRONG, IMMUNE SYSTEM. I SAID, DR., WHAT'S THE STORY WITH BARON? HE TESTED POSITIVE. LIKE 15 MINUTES LATER, SIR, IT'S GONE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL. [CHEERS] YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO DOESN'T WANT US TO DO ANYTHING IN PENNSYLVANIA. DID YOU SEE THE POLLS JUST CAME OUT? WE ARE UP TWO, IN ANOTHER ONE WE ARE UP FOUR. I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THE POLLS THAT JUST CAME OUT. EIGHT DAYS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA AND WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN OUR GREAT WHITE HOUSE. A FEW HOURS FROM NOW, THE SENATE WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THAT WAS A GOOD CHOICE, WASN'T IT? I'M GLAD SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WOULD MUCH RATHER GO AGAINST SLEEPY JOE, MUCH EASIER. SHE IS A FANTASTIC PERSON, FANTASTIC WOMAN, A GREAT STUDENT. HER GREAT PROFESSOR AT NOTRE DAME SAID -- AND HE HAS BEEN TEACHING A LONG TIME, A LOT OF GREAT LEGAL MINDS HE HAS TAUGHT -- HE SAID SHE IS THE SINGLE GREATEST STUDENT HE HAS EVER TAUGHT. THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. HE IS HIGHLY RESPECTED. HE SAID, SHE IS THE GREATEST I HAVE EVER HAD. JUDGE BARRETT IS ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST BRILLIANT LEGAL MINDS. SHE WILL DEFEND OUR RIGHTS, LIBERTIES, GOD-GIVEN FREEDOMS. WE WERE ALL WATCHING IN GREAT AMUSEMENT AS SHE WAS SO-CALLED GRILLED BY THE OPPOSITION. THAT WAS EASY, RIGHT? THAT WAS LIKE ONE OF OUR GREAT FOOTBALL TEAMS FROM THE AREA PLAYING A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. THAT WAS SOMETHING. JUDGE BARRETT WILL BE THE THIRD SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALONG WITH ALMOST 300 -- RIGHT AROUND THE NUMBER -- BY THE TIME WE END THE FIRST TERM. I WILL HAVE 300, MAYBE A LITTLE MORE, A LITTLE LESS, FEDERAL JUDGES THAT WE HAVE CONFIRMED TO UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONS. [CHEERS] PART OF THAT WAS THAT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA ALLOWED ME TO HAVE 142. WE STARTED WITH 142 -- I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY HAS EVER HAD ONE, YOU DON'T DO THAT. HE LEFT ME 142, COULDN'T GET THEM CONFIRMED. TO THIS DAY JOE BIDEN REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS LIST OF NAMES. IT IS MORE THAN PACKING THE COURT. HE HAS GOT TO SAY WHO HE IS GOING TO PUT ON, BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE RADICAL LEFT JUSTICES THAT ARE GOING TO DESTROY OUR NATION. AND WE WILL BE VERY CAREFUL AS TO WHO WE CHOOSE. I LEFT A LIST OF 45. I HAD A LIST OF 25 AND NOW I ADDED 20 NAMES, ALL TOP SCHOLARS. AMY WAS ONE OF THEM. TOOK AMY OFF. THE FACT IS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I WON BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT, BECAUSE I GAVE A LIST AND SAID I WILL PICK SOMEBODY LIKE THIS. THEY SAID, THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, PICK SOMEBODY IN THAT LIST. SO ULTIMATELY THERE WAS A LIST OF 25, ALL GREAT SCHOLARS, ALL PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE CONSTITUTION, IF THAT'S OK. [CHEERS] I DON'T THINK HIS LIST WILL. THEY SAY THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE REASON WE WON FOUR YEARS AGO. HE HAS TO DO THE SAME THING. HE HAS TO NOT ONLY AGREE TO NOT PACK THE COURT, OR YOU CAN PUT HIM ON -- IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR OUR NATION -- EVEN JUSTICE GINSBURG SAID YOU CAN'T. DO THAT. NINE IS THE RIGHT NUMBER. WE HAVE A SENATE, WE HAVE A HOUSE. NINE GREAT PEOPLE, THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER. HE HAS TO AGREE TO NOT PACK THE COURT, BUT HE HAS TO AGREE TO GIVE US A LIST OF 5, 10, 30, 40 -- GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE TO PICK FROM. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT LIST, YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR HIM, AND YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR HIM FOR ANOTHER REASON. DURING THE DEBATE -- I'M SURE NOBODY WATCHED. DID ANYBODY WATCH THE DEBATE? [CHEERS] THE LAST QUESTION WAS JUST LIKE TO REMAIN SAID. IT WAS AT THE END, THIS GUY WAS DOING SO WONDERFUL -- NOT REALLY. MEANING HE WAS GETTING THROUGH. THE LAST ONE, I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, OLD JOE? KRISTIN, WHO I THOUGHT TREATED ME GOOD, COMPARED TO CHRIS WALLACE, MUCH BETTER. CHRIS WALLACE, I WAS FIGHTING TWO PEOPLE. I THOUGHT SHE TREATED US GOOD. SHE WENT IN AND SAID, WHY DID YOU SAY THAT TO HIM? THAT'S WHEN HE REALLY BLEW IT. BASICALLY HE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO FRACK AND YOU HAVE A MILLION ENERGY JOBS, PROBABLY MORE, AND IT IS A BIG PART OF OUR NATION, WHAT YOU DO. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA, BUT FRACKING IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. WHO ARE YOU POINTING TO? [APPLAUSE] OH, LOOK AT THAT. OH, BOY, THE COAL MINERS. DIG WE MUST. DIG WE MUST. CLEAN COAL -- I DON'T CALL IT COAL, I CALL IT CLEAN COAL. THEY CAN DO MORE WITH COAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMEMBER HILLARY, SHE SAID, WE WILL STOP ALL COAL MINERS, NEVER DIG COAL AGAIN. FOUR WEEKS LATER SHE ENDED UP IN WEST VIRGINIA. THAT DID NOT WORK OUT WELL FOR HER. SHE WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN SHE WAS JUST KIDDING, JUST LIKE HE IS DOING, SLEEPY JOE IS DOING. HE WAS JUST KIDDING. BUT HE IS DOWN. IF THAT DOESN'T WIN US -- WE JUST HAD A POLL COME OUT, WE ARE PLUS TWO, BUT WE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH PLUS TWO. YOU DO A GREAT JOB. DIG WE MUST. WE BROUGHT IT BACK. WE ARE SELLING COAL TO VIETNAM AND MANY PLACES. ARE YOU COAL MINERS FROM PENNSYLVANIA? [APPLAUSE] THAT'S GOOD. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. NOT LIKE HE IS A SOPHISTICATED ENVIRONMENTALIST. OUR OPPONENT'S AGENDA IS OF DOOM AND GLOOM AND DEPRESSION, DECLINE AND DESPAIR. OUR AGENDA IS ONE OF UNLIMITED OPTIMISM. WE WANT TO BE OPTIMISTIC. REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATE HE SAID, IT IS GOING TO BE A DARK WINTER. NOW, IT IS GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL WINTER, A BEAUTIFUL SPRING. OUR COUNTRY IS COMING BACK STRONGER THAN ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR GOVERNOR TO OPEN UP YOUR ESTATE -- YOUR STATE. WE HAD A BIG, BEAUTIFUL SITE AND HE MADE SURE WE DIDN'T DO IT. WE HAD TO GO SCOUTING FOR SITES. THIS IS MY THIRD ONE, ALL IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE PROBLEM IS, HOW IS HE GOING TO BE THE ONE, WHEN HE TRIES TO PLAY GAMES WITH SITES, THAT COUNTS BALLOTS? HE COUNTS BALLOTS, THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN THEY SUE US BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE POLL WATCHERS. POLL WATCHERS WATCH YOU COUNT THE VOTES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, IF YOU ARE DOING IT STRAIGHT? WE ARE IN COURT AND HAD A PENNSYLVANIA JUDGE WHO SAID, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE POLL WATCHERS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WE LOST THE FIRST CASE, BUT WE WILL GO UP AND END UP IN THE SUPREME COURT. THEY WANT TO DRAG OUT THE ELECTION LONG BEYOND THE THIRD. [BOOS] IN ALL FAIRNESS, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE AND WE CAN'T DRAG IT OUT ANY LONGER. WE ARE IN LOTS OF COURT HAVING TO DO WITH THIS AND HAVING TO DO WITH MANY STATES, ABOUT FIVE. SO FAR WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF GOOD VICTORIES AND WILL CONTINUE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS ELECTION BE TAKEN AWAY FROM US. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO WIN IT. FOR THE LAST HALF-CENTURY, 47 YEARS, JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN OUTSOURCING JOBS, OPENING YOUR BORDERS, AND SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN RIDICULOUS, ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS, COUNTRIES YOU NEVER HEARD OF FOR THE MOST PART. NOW JOE BIDEN IS TRYING TO DELIVER AN ECONOMIC DEATH SENTENCE FOR PENNSYLVANIA'S ENERGY SECTOR. YOU CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. FOR A YEAR I WATCHED HIM SAYING, THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. WE SAW THAT WITH THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE ALL SCREAMING, NO FRACKING. THEY COULDN'T SCREAM LOUD ENOUGH. HE GETS THE NOMINATION BECAUSE ELIZABETH WARREN, POCAHONTAS, REFUSED TO GET OUT. HAD SHE GOTTEN OUT, CRAZY BERNIE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR OPPONENT. I THINK I LIKE JOE BETTER BECAUSE HE HAS NO ENERGY. BERNIE HAD SOME ENERGY. WE HAD A LOT OF HIS PEOPLE. A LOT OF THEM WITH CROOKED HILLARY WENT FOR BERNIE. I WON'T USE IT BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY YOUNG PEOPLE HERE. HE GETS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY HILLARY AND THEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE DEMOCRATS THE LAST TIME WITH MOSTLY ELIZABETH WARREN AND THE OTHERS THAT GANGED UP ON HIM. HE GOES BACK AND GOES INTO THE SENATE. I THINK HE IS THE GREATEST LOSER. HE IS A GOOD LOSER, A GREAT SPORT. CRAZY BERNIE. IN LAST WEEK'S DEBATE, JOE BIDEN CONFIRMED HIS PLAN TO ABOLISH THE ENTIRE U.S. OIL INDUSTRY. THAT'S WHY KRISTIN SAID, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? BECAUSE SHE IS ON HIS SIDE. BECAUSE THAT'S NBC, OWNED BY COMCAST, CNON. SHE IS SAYING, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, ALMOST PLEADING, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? I AM SAYING, JUST BE QUIET. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED ON. MASON. THE GUY WAS ALWAYS GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. THEN AT THE END, I DID IT. SLEEPY JOE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. YOU DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT LIKE THAT. NO FRACKING, NO NATURAL GAS, NO COAL, NO JOBS, NO ENERGY, NO PENNSYLVANIA FAMILIES BEING WELL TAKEN CARE OF. FRACKING IS SAVING PENNSYLVANIA FAMILIES $2500 A YEAR AT LEAST. IT IS SAVING FAMILIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND YOU ARE A BIG PART OF IT. THEY WANT TO END THAT. THEY WANT TO GO TO WIND. A NICE WINDMILL ALONGSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE. YOUR HOUSE IS NOW WORTHLESS. WHEN THOSE WINDMILLS GO UP NEAR THE HOUSE, IT COSTS MANY TIMES THE ENERGY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, MANY TIMES. LIKE $.32 VERSUS THREE CENTS, WHETHER IT IS NATURAL GAS OR OTHER THINGS, BUT MANY TIMES. YOU PUT UP A WINDMILL, IF YOU WANT TO SEE A BIRD GRAVEYARD, GO UNDER A WINDMILL SOMETIME. YOU WILL SEE IT KILLS YOUR BIRDS. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. AND IT NEEDS MASSIVE SUBSIDY. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE GIVING SUBSIDY TO ENERGY WHEN THERE IS NO REASON TO DO IT. HE WANTS WIND AND SOLAR. I LIKE SOLAR TOO, BUT IT IS NOT DEVELOPED AND IS NOT GOING TO POWER YOUR BIG PLANTS, WHICH WE HAVE TO HAVE TO COMPETE AND BEAT THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT IS NOT GOING TO DO IT, AND NEITHER IS WIND. HE WILL ERADICATE PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY PRODUCTION AND SEND YOUR ESTATE INTO A CRIPPLING DEPRESSION. PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW THAT ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA, IT IS A BIG ENERGY STATE. IT IS FUNNY, TEXAS -- HE IS AGAINST OIL, HE IS AGAINST GUNS, SECOND AMENDMENT, AND HE IS AGAINST GOD. AND THEN THEY SAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FOUR POINTS UP IN TEXAS. THE GOVERNOR CALLS ME FROM TEXAS. HE SAID, SIR, THAT IS NOT TRUE, YOU ARE UP A LOT. THINK OF IT, YOU ARE AGAINST OIL. WE ARE IN TEXAS. YOU ARE AGAINST OIL, AGAINST GOD, AGAINST GUNS. TRUMP IS ON FOUR POINTS, A VERY CLOSE RACE -- NO, NO. SAME THING HERE. YOU COULD SAY THE SAME THING ALMOST, TO A LITTLE LESSER EXTENT, BUT TEXAS WAS JUST AMAZING. THAT'S WHY TEXAS AND PENNSYLVANIA, I HOPE YOU ARE LOOKING AND LISTENING. THAT GOES FOR OHIO AND OKLAHOMA AND A LOT OF OTHER PLACES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAD POLLS, BECAUSE THE FAKE NEWS IS ALWAYS GIVING FAKE NUMBERS. SUPPRESSION POLLS. HERE THEY ARE, ALL BRAND-NEW. RASMUSSEN, DID YOU EVER HEAR OF RASMUSSEN? VERY HIGHLY REGARDED POLL. WE ARE AT 53 AND 52. IT IS HARD TO LOSE AT 53 AND 52. RASMUSSEN -- AND THAT IS NATIONAL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM DOING. I GO TO PLACES -- HILLARY USED TO CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER, ALTHOUGH IF I WERE IN CALIFORNIA, I WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP BECAUSE THE PLACE IS GOING TO HELL. TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, CRIME IS TOO HIGH. NEW YORK, TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, PEOPLE ARE FLEEING, CRIME IS TOO HIGH. I PUT OUT, BOTH FOR TRUMP. AFRICAN-AMERICAN, I SAID THE SAME THING. VOTE FOR TRUMP. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? THAT WAS LAST ELECTION. NOW WE ARE DOING SO WELL WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, THE BLACK COMMUNITY, AND THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, THEY GET IT. BECAUSE WE DID CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, WE DID THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE HAVE DONE OPPORTUNITY ZONES WITH THE GREAT TIM SCOTT, SENATOR FROM -- WE HAD A POLL TODAY AT 40. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS. IT IS A NUMBER NOBODY HAS HEARD OF WITH RESPECT TO THE REPUBLICAN. IT SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. JOE BIDEN IS A GLOBALIST WHO WIPED DOWN YOUR STEEL MILL, KILLED YOUR COAL JOBS, OUTSOURCED YOUR INDUSTRIES, AND SUPPORTED EVERY TERRIBLE AND DISASTROUS TRADE DEAL FOR MORE THAN 47 YEARS. HE WAS A CHEERLEADER FOR NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE. USMCA JUST KICKED IN, IT'S GREAT. YOUR COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO BE MOVING TO MEXICO OR CANADA ANYMORE, I CAN TELL YOU. BIDEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY VOTED FOR CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, DECIMATING YOUR MANUFACTURING AND ENRICHING CHINA AT YOUR EXPENSE. YOU WERE ONE OF THE BIGGEST VICTIMS, THIS STATE. YOU LOST 50% OF YOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER BIDEN'S NAFTA AND CHINA DISASTERS. HE SIGNED IT ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE, BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT PUSHED IT. DECADE AFTER DECADE, VOTE AFTER VOTE, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN HAS BETRAYED PENNSYLVANIA. HE REPEATEDLY TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT UNTIL A WEEK AGO WHEN WE STARTED SHOWING THE CLIFFS. BERNIE SANDERS EXPOSED HIM ON THAT. NOW AFTER YEARS OF ECONOMIC TREACHERY, HE WANTS TO BAN FRACKING, AND HE IS GOING TO. WHAT ABOUT HIS WONDERFUL RUNNING MATE? [BOOS] THEY ASKED HER ABOUT FRACKING. SHE HAS ONLY SAID ABOUT 300 TIMES THERE WILL NEVER BE FRACKING. NOW SHE SAYS JOE WANTS IT. SHE SAYS IT WAS THE HARRIS-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD OF THAT ONE. SHE CAME FIRST. SHE IS NOTHING SPECIAL, NEVER WAS. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WAS PICKED. NOBODY TREATED HIM WORSE THAN HER, PLUS SHE WAS A DISASTER. HER POLL NUMBERS WERE SO BAD, SHE LEFT BEFORE IOWA. SHE STARTED OFF AT 12, WENT TO 10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0. THEN SHE SAID, I THINK I AM GOING TO GET OUT OF THE RACE. SHE TREATED HIM SO BADLY, WHAT SHE CALLED HIM AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THEN HE SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE I AM GOING TO PICK, KAMALA TO BE MY RUNNING MATE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD, WE HAVE JOE ON TAPE. I ONLY DO THIS WINTER LOCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE THIS COSTS A FORTUNE. BUT GO AHEAD, ROLL THE VIDEO. SO YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. ISN'T THAT GREAT? IT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE DEAL, BUT IT SAVES ME A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS IT BETTER THAN THAT. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE TO OFFSHORE YOUR JOBS, BAN FRACKING, AND DELIVER ECONOMIC RUIN TO PENNSYLVANIA AND YOUR FAMILIES. IN 2016 PENNSYLVANIA VOTED TO FIRE THIS CORRUPT FAR-LEFT PENNSYLVANIA ESTABLISHMENT, AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS PRESIDENT WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WITH YOUR VOTE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, LOWER DRUG PRICES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING ON DRUG PRICES? HAD THE FIRST YEAR IN 52 YEARS WHEN DRUG PRICES CAME DOWN, BUT WE ARE DOING FAVORED NATION, SO WE PAY THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD. RIGHT NOW WE PAY THE HIGHEST, AND THE DRUG COMPANIES DON'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. THEY ARE SPENDING MORE ON ADVERTISING THAN SLEEPY JOE. SUPPORT POLICE, PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. DEFEND OUR BORDERS, MAINTAIN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROUDLY STAFFED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. RIGHT? WE WILL DELIVER RECORD PROSPERITY, EPIC JOB GROWTH, A SAFE VACCINE THAT QUICKLY ENDS THE PANDEMIC. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN -- THEY HATE IT WHEN I SAY IT -- WITH OR WITHOUT THE VACCINE, IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT. WE HAVE NUMEROUS COMPANIES, GREAT ONES. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. WE UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE. WE CLOSED IT UP, THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY, SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES. IT WAS GOING TO BE 2.2 MILLION LIVES. WE SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES AND WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. NORMAL LIFE, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. NORMAL LIFE WILL FULLY RESUME. WE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT CHINA DID TO THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE HEADING IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB NUMBERS. AUTOMOBILE NUMBERS, IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSING. I GAVE WORKING FAMILIES RECORD-SETTING TAX CUTS. IN MY SECOND TERM, I WILL CUT MIDDLE TAX CLASSES -- MIDDLE CLASS TAXES EVEN FURTHER. THIS IS THE CRAZIEST CAMPAIGN. ALL MY LIFE I WATCHED POLITICIANS RUNNING. THEY ALWAYS SAY, WE ARE GOING TO CUT YOUR TAXES, RIGHT? I GOT A GUY RUNNING NOW. HE GOES, WE WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. I SAY, WHAT THE HELL? DID HE JUST SAY THAT? YEAH, HE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BIGGEST TAX CODE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING REGULATIONS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF, WHICH MADE IT SO GOOD FOR US. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY OR A BIDEN SUPER DEPRESSION. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A DEPRESSION IF YOU GO WITH THIS GUY. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A BOOM ANTI-LOCKDOWN. WHO WANTS TO LOCK DOWN YOUR COUNTRY? YOU ARE ALREADY LOCKED DOWN WITH GOVERNOR WOLF. THERE IS A BEAUTY FOR YOU. SURE, GOVERNOR, WE TRUST YOU TO COUNT OUR BALLOTS. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE RULE OF THE PEOPLE OR THE RULE OF THE CORRUPT POLITICAL CLASS. IF JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC-SOCIALIST -- THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE HEADING. I ALWAYS SAID THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY, NEVER, EVER. BUT IF JOE BIDEN AND IS DEMOCRATIC-SOCIALIST'S ARE ELECTED, THEY WILL DELAY THE VACCINE, DELAY THE THERAPIES, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC, CLOSE YOUR SCHOOLS. THEY ARE ALREADY CLOSED. OPEN UP THOSE SCHOOLS. AND SHUT DOWN OUR ECONOMY. WE ARE COMING BACK WITH NUMBERS LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. THE END OF LAST WEEK, THE ATLANTA FED PROJECTED GDP FOR THE THIRD QUARTER IS GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED JUST BEFORE NOVEMBER 3 OF 35%. NOTHING EVER EVEN CLOSE. I THINK THE RECORD IS 8%, 9%. 35% AND HE WANTS TO CLOSE IT DOWN. NOT A GOOD IDEA, JOE. BIDEN SAYS HE HAS A PLAN FOR THE VIRUS, AND HE DOESN'T. HE COPIED OUR PLAN. IT IS THE SAME PLAN. EVERYTHING HE HAS PROPOSED, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY DONE, INCLUDING MASS PRODUCTION OF RAPID TESTS AND PPE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE VENTILATORS IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WE WERE NOT PREPARED. OUR HOSPITALS DID NOT HAVE THEM, GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE THEM. WE WENT INTO A PRODUCTION OF VENTILATORS THE LIKES OF WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II. BIDEN DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DEFEAT A PANDEMIC. HIS OWN CHIEF OF STAFF SAID WHEN HE MANAGED THE H1N1 -- WHICH HE ALWAYS REVERSES -- THE SWINE FLU , A MUCH LESS LETHAL FLU, IT WAS AN OUTBREAK. HE SAID, QUOTE, WE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND WE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLY WRONG. WE WERE A DISASTER. 60 MILLION AMERICANS GOT H1N1 IN THAT PERIOD AND IT IS PURELY FORTUNE IT WAS NOT A MASS CASUALTY. HE SAID, WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL WE WERE DOING. THIS GUY COMES IN. HE SHOULD HAVE CLOSED IT DOWN SOONER, BUT HE IS SAYING I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE BAND TO CHINA, TO EUROPE. IF THE H1N1 HAD THE SAME FATALITY AS THE CHINA VIRUS, OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PERISHED BASED ON THE WAY THEY RAN IT. IT WAS A DISASTER, AND HIS OWN PERSON SAID IT. HE SAID, WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL WE ARE DOING. NOW HE IS GOING TO HELP US. THIS GUY CAN'T HELP HIMSELF. IN AN INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT, BIDEN SAID HE OPPOSES LETTING YOUNG AMERICANS RESUME THEIR LIVES. 99 POINT 90% OF THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 50 RECOVER, AND MOST RECOVER VERY QUICKLY. BIDEN WANTS TO KEEP THEM LOCKED DOWN IN THEIR HOMES WHILE LETTING WRITERS -- RIOTERS AND LOOTERS RUN WILD. IN PENNSYLVANIA YOU CAN'T GO TO CHURCH, RESTAURANTS, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING. BUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE LITTLE RIOT, A PROTEST -- WE CALL EVERYTHING A FRIENDLY PROTEST. YOU CAN'T GO TO CHURCH, BUT IF YOU WANT TO BURN DOWN CENTER CITY, WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. WE ARE BRINGING OUR COUNTRY BACK. DO YOU THINK IT IS EASY WITH THE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH? DIVIDE IN LOCKDOWN WILL CRUSH AMERICA AND MY PLAN WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BOOM LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WHEN THE CHINA VIRUS ARRIVED, WE MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. WE BAND EVERYTHING WE COULD. WE AIRLIFTED MEDICAL SUPPLIES, BUILT HOSPITALS FROM SCRATCH. LOOK WHAT WE DID IN NEW YORK 2800 BEDS WE PUT IN THE SHIP. UNFORTUNATELY GOVERNOR CUOMO BARELY USED IT. IF HE WOULD HAVE USED IT FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS, HE WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THE DEATH OF 40,000 PEOPLE. /THE RED TAPE, PIONEERED GROUNDBREAKING THERAPIES, REDUCED THE FIDELITY RATE 85%. THINK OF THAT. LOOK AT REGENERON FOR ME. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE REGENERON AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY WHO FEELS THEY WANT IT, NEED IT, SAME AS I HAVE, FREE. AND THE VACCINES BEING PRODUCED -- IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT, IT IS CHINA'S FAULT. WE ARE NOT FORGETTING THE VACCINE IS GOING TO BE FREE, DISTRIBUTED FREE TO EVERYBODY. WE WILL DELIVER 100 MILLION DOSES OF A SAFE VACCINE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, MAY BE QUITE A BIT SOONER. SENIORS WILL BE THE FIRST IN LINE, AND FRONTLINE WORKERS. I WILL BREAK THROUGH EVERY OBSTACLE, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY DONE, USE EVERY RESOURCE, AND I WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE ERADICATE THIS DISEASE THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER COME TO OUR SHORES OR TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. SHOULD HAVE NEVER,. -- NEVER COME. WE WILL VANQUISH THE VIRUS AND EMERGE BETTER, STRONGER, MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER BEFORE. IF BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC-SOCIALISTS ARE ELECTED, THEY WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES TO A LEVEL YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN, BURIED YOU IN REGULATIONS, DISMANTLE POLICE DEPARTMENTS, DISSOLVE BORDERS -- THEY DON'T WANT BORDERS. THEY HAVE EVEN SAID, MAYBE WE WILL TAKE DOWN THE WALL, WHICH IS ALMOST COMPLETE. THE BORDER CONTROL SAID, GIVE ME YOUR SPECS. I SAID, LET ME USE CONCRETE PLANK, IT IS QUICK AND CHEAP. THEY SAID, WE CAN'T DO THAT, WE NEED STEEL, CONCRETE, AND REBAR. WE GAVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. WE ARE NOW BEYOND 400 MILES AND IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON. [CHEERS] IT'S AMAZING. IT USED TO BE ALL ABOUT THE WALL. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET IT BUILT. -- THE WALL WILL NOT HAPPEN, NOW IT IS ALMOST FINISHED. YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE WALL ANYMORE. THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA DOES NOT TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. THAT IS A LOT OF VALUABLE EQUIPMENT. A LOT OF VALUABLE EQUIPMENT. MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL, IN CASE YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS. THEY SAID, BUT MEXICO WILL NOT -- NO, MEXICO IS PAYING. THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT SOON. THEY WILL CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, TERMINATE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, DESTROY THE SUBURBS. WOMEN OF THE SUBURBS, YOU MUST LOVE ME. I TELL YOU. I GOT RID OF THE REGULATION THAT WAS GOING TO DESTROY YOU, SUBURBS. UNLESS YOU LIKE CRIME. THEY DIDN'T THING ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO. SUBURBAN WOMEN DON'T LIKE TRUMP, HE IS LOSING SUBURBAN WOMEN. THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW TWO THINGS ABOUT SUBURBAN WILLIAM -- WOMEN. THEY DO NOT WANT LOW INCOME HOUSING NEXT TO THEIR HOUSE. THEY DO NOT WANT THAT, A PROJECT . AND THEY DO NOT WANT CRIME IN THE SUBURBS. ANTIFA SAYS THAT IS THE NEXT PLACE THEY WANT TO HEAD. THEY ARE NOT HEADING TO THE SUBURBS. AS SOON AS I SAY THOSE WORDS, THEY WANT LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, THEY WANT THEIR FAMILIES TO BE SAFE. I THINK WE WILL DO WELL WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN. WE GOT RID OF REGULATION AND BEN CARSON, A GREAT GUY, SAID IF YOU ALLOW THIS, IT WILL BE AMENDED. IT IS HORRIBLE. THEY CHANGE THE ZONING AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND RUIN EVERYTHING. I SAID, LET'S TERMINATE IT. BEN, LET'S TERMINATE IT. HE SAID, THAT IS A TOUGH ONE, BUT WE WILL DO IT. IT IS GONE. IF SLEEPY JOE COMES BACK, YOU KNOW WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE? CORY BOOKER. THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW WORK, NEW JERSEY WHO NEVER LIVED IN NEWARK. DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT AWAY WITHOUT ONE. THEY WILL CENSOR YOU AND INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN WITH ANTI-AMERICAN LIES, BUT WE DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. YOU SAW THAT TWO WEEKS AGO. JOE BIDEN MADE A CORRUPT BARGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS PARTY NOMINATION, HE HANDED CONTROL OF THIS PARTY TO THE RAGE-FILLED SOCIALIST, MARXISTS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS. JOE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE, LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES. HOW ARE YOU DOING JOE? NOT WELL. I HAVE TO SAY IT. WINNING 52% AND 53%, NOT BAD. THAT IS NATIONAL. AS CRAZY AS IT IS, IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING. NEVADA, TRUMP IS THAT BY 2%. REMEMBER, GUNS, OIL AND GOD. I AM ON THEIR SIDE. LET ME ASK YOU, IF A CANDIDATE IS RUNNING IN TEXAS AND SAYS, WE ARE AGAINST OIL, I THINK THAT IS IT, RIGHT? NOW ADD GUNS TO IT AND RELIGION. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING, CLOSING YOUR CHURCHES. IT IS REALLY TERRIBLE. OHIO, THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE IN OHIO. JIM JORDAN. NCAA WRESTLING CHAMP, THEY DON'T KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM. A GREAT GUY. FLORIDA WE ARE UP. JUST CAME OUT. GEORGIA WE ARE UP VERY NICELY. DON'T FORGET IF WE ARE UP FOUR, ADD ANOTHER 5, 6, 7 TO IT. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. ARIZONA, WE ARE UP. WE ARE UP IN IOWA AND MONTANA, UTAH AND 22 POINTS IN WEST VIRGINIA. BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THIS. THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU NEGATIVE STUFF. THEY ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE. BUT THAT IS OK. THEY WERE DISHONEST LAST TIME. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WE HAVE TO PUT THIS THING AWAY. WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, WE WIN THE WHOLE BALLGAME. YOU NOTICE A LATE VOTING STATE, WHICH IS A GOOD THING. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE SOON? WHO IS GOING TO VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3? ONE OF THE FEW. YOU DON'T LIKE A BALLOT SENT OUT AND THEN PUT INTO A GARBAGE CAN. YOU ARE SMART PEOPLE. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR SLEEPY JOE BIDEN? ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. PLEASE DON'T DO IT. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP? [CHEERING] NOW -- THEY ARE CALLING IT THE GREAT RED WAVE AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR IT. ALL THESE BALLOTS ARE POURING IN FROM ALL OVER. NOBODY KNOWS WHO IS SENDING THE BALLOTS, SIGNING THEM. THEY WANT TO HAVE A THING IN NEVADA WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE YOUR SIGNATURE, MINOR THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY WILL HAVE A WAVE. I THINK THE GREAT RED WAVE WILL BE BETTER THAN -- BIGGER THAN PEOPLE HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. YOU DON'T HEAR THOSE NUMBERS, IT IS SUPPRESSION. THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU NICE AND DEPRESSED. TAKE YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND AND SAY, I LIKE THE PRESIDENT, BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN WIN BECAUSE I LISTEN TO FAKE CNN. OR FOX. FOX THEY HAVE THE WORST -- DID YOU HEAR THAT, JOHN ROBERTS, WHO I LIKE A LOT -- HE IS RIGHT THERE. HI, JOHN. THEY HAVE THE WORST BOLSTER, -- BOLSTER, FOX'S TERRIBLE. YOU LISTEN TO THESE POLLS AND SAY, WE WILL GO TO DINNER, DARLING AND GO HOME AND SADLY WATCHED TELEVISION. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO? PEOPLE SAID NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DINNER, WE ARE GOING TO VOTE. HILLARY WITH HER STATEMENT ABOUT THE DEPLORABLES. THE DEPLORABLES -- WAS THAT INCREDIBLE WHEN SHE SAID THAT? WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS SO BAD. SHE ACTUALLY SAID A WORSE WORD THAN THAT, THE IRREDEEMABLES. I THOUGHT IRREDEEMABLE WAS WORSE THAN DEPLORABLE, BUT IT DID NOT CATCH ON. DEPLORABLE. NEXT DAY I MADE A SPEECH LIKE THIS, CAME OUT, WE ARE DEPLORABLE AND THEY CAME OUT BY THE MILLIONS. THAT SHIRT SOLD LIKE CRAZY. THE FAKE NEWS -- EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS -- IT IS HAPPENING WITH BIDEN, BECAUSE THAT IS A CRIME FAMILY. NEVER THEY SAY LOCK HIM UP, THEY GO CRAZY. THEY SAY YOU INCITED THAT, I DID NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS A HOSTILE ATTACK BY A WOMAN I DO NOT NAME. IF BI WINSD, THE FLAG BURNING LIBERALS WILL BE RUNNING YOUR GOVERNMENT. EN JOB. IF YOU LOOK AT SEATTLE, WE SAID, WE ARE GOING IN. THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY SAID, WE ARE LEAVING NOW. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE ASKED. WE DID A GREAT JOB IN MINNESOTA. MINNEAPOLIS. THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD US TO GO A WEEK AND A HALF EARLY. IT WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT OF DISTRACTION. REMEMBER THAT CNN ANCHOR -- THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIOTS BECAUSE IT IS BAD FOR THEM. WE ARE AT A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AND THE ENTIRE CITY IS BURNING DOWN. THEY HAD A FIRE THAT LOOKED LIKE BERLIN ON ITS WORST DAY. HE SAID, THE MILITARY -- IT WAS A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. YOU SAW THAT, THE NATIONAL GUARD. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE LINE ,TWO LINES. THEY MARCHED FORWARD, TEAR GAS. DIDN'T HE GO DOWN? I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS, I JUST REMEMBER. [INDISCERNIBLE] I DECIDED AGAINST IT. I DID NOT WANT TO GO DOWN 25 POINTS IN THE POLLS. HE GOT HIT ON THE KNEE WITH TEAR GAS. HE WAS NOT THE BRAVEST GUY. THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST -- I NEVER SAW FIRE LIKE THAT. IT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING. RESET IN THE NATIONAL GUARD IT WAS OVER AND A HALF HOUR MAX. THEY STARTED WALKING. MOST EXPENSIVE UNIFORMS. THE HELMET, LIKE A GIANT COMPUTER. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY NICE ABOUT IT. AFTER WATCHING WHAT WENT ON FOR A WEEKEND A HALF. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ASK US. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS WAITING. A CHICAGO PROBLEM. HOW DO LIKE HER AS A MAYOR? ALL RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THIS ELECTION DAY THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA NEED TO DEFY THE CORRUPT MEDIA, THE BIG TECH MACHINES. THEY WON'T WRITE ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT A MAN WHO IS CORRUPT. THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL ALLOW TO GO IN AS FORCES TRIED TO KEEP YOU DOWN AND HOLD YOU BACK, IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING. I GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE NEW YORK POST, WHICH ENDORSED ME BY THE WAY. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH COURAGE TO DO IT. YOU MUST STOP THE ANTI-AMERICAN RADICALS FROM DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU CANNOT LET THE DEMOCRATS AND JOE BIDEN HAVE A FAR-LEFT VICTORY. THIS HAS TO BE A THUNDERING DEFEAT. NOT JUST A DEFEAT, A REBUKE. A REBUKE OF SOCIALISM. AS CORRUPT AS HE IS AND HIS SON IS LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER. LET ME FOLLOW YOU TO CHINA, DAD. I WILL BE MANAGING $1.5 MILLION. HAVE YOU DONE IT BEFORE? NO. CHINA DOES NOT DO THAT. THEY DO NOT GIVE OTHER PEOPLE MONEY TO MANAGE. THE SCARY PART, THE BIG GUY GETS 10%. HE IS THE BIG GUY. THE BIG ONE WITH CHINA, THEY WANTED $10 MILLION A YEAR FOR INTRODUCTORY PURPOSES. I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. UKRAINE, $183,000 A MONTH TO SIT ON AN ENERGY COMPANY WITH QUESTIONABLE REPRESENTATION. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF ENERGY. THIS YOUNG PERSON KNOWS MORE ABOUT ENERGY THAN HUNTER. 'HUNTERS REAL FIRST NAME IS WHERE IS HUNTER? REMEMBER WE MADE THE T-SHIRT. JOE WANTS TO SEND YOUR JOBS TO CHINA WHILE HIS FAMILY RAKES IN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. THEY WANT HIM TO WIN. COULD YOU IMAGINE? I HAVE MILLIONS IN TARIFFS, JOE SAID HE WOULD TAKE THOSE OFF. 28 MILLION. JOE WANTS TO TAKE THE TARIFFS. REMEMBER, 25%. THEY WERE KILLING OUR STEEL COMPANIES. OUR STEEL COMPANIES ARE DOING GREAT NOW. IF AYDIN WINS, CHINA WINS. IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN IT IS BECAUSE I AM NOT A POLITICIAN, IF THAT IS OK. I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR YOU BEFORE. YOU THINK THIS IS FUN? I HAD A GOOD LIFE BEFORE THIS. A NICE, BEAUTIFUL -- I COULD GO ANYWHERE, DO ANYTHING. THANK YOU. [CROWD CHANTING] THANK YOU. THAT IS THE CHANT THEY SAY THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER HEARD IN POLITICS. I WILL NOT REPEAT THE CHANCE BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO CRY. I WILL START CRYING. NOW THEY WILL SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP BROKE DOWN IN TEARS TODAY. WE ARE JOINED BY A COUPLE OF WARRIORS. REAL WARRIORS. GREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WITH ME DAY AND NIGHT FIGHTING THIS MOVEMENT, THIS HORRIBLE RADICAL LEFT MOVEMENT. CONGRESSMAN JOHN JOYCE. [APPLAUSE] CONGRESSMAN THOMPSON. GREAT PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] AND UNMANNED SO POPULAR HE WAS WITH ME THE OTHER NIGHT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION. IT WAS ABOUT 30 DEGREES OUT AND HE REFUSED TO PUT ON A JACKET. BY THE END OF THE EVENING I THINK HE REGRETTED IT, BUT HE IS A POWERFUL GUY, A GREAT GUY. HE LOVES EVERYBODY AND THEY LOVE HIM. CONGRESSMAN MIKE KELLY. AS WELL AS STATE SENATOR JUDY WARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB YOU ARE DOING. WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY AND NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AGAIN AGAIN. WE DID IT AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. IT IS HAPPENING FASTER THAN ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE. WE INCREASED MIDDLE, -- IN ALL EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. IT IS REALLY SOMETHING. DID YOU SEE THE GRAPH PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TODAY? NOBODY SHARED OUT. DID NOT HAVE A CROWD LIKE THIS. NOBODY SHOWED UP. THEY SAID HE WILL START CAMPAIGNING. WHO? BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. WE CAMPAIGNED HARDER THAN HILLARY. HOW DID THAT WORK OUT? HE WENT TO A FEW LOCATIONS. HE IS AVERAGING 25 PEOPLE. IT IS DISAPPOINTING. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, PEOPLE WITH DIPLOMAS FROM HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE DIPLOMAS, M.I.T. FIRST IN THEIR CLASS. WOMEN HAD THE BEST THEY HAVE HAD IT IN 71 YEARS. ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED. SINCE APRIL WE CREATED A RECORD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 11.4 MILLION JOBS. WE ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE BORDER. MEXICO HAS 27,000 TROOPS AT OUR BORDER, PROTECTING IT. MY OPPONENTS -- OPPONENT'S INSANE IMMIGRATION PLAN WOULD IMPLEMENT NATIONWIDE CATCH AND RELEASE. THAT IS WHEN YOU CATCH A KILLER AND RELEASE HIM INTO OUR COUNTRY AND WE SAY, COME BACK IN FOUR YEARS. HE SAID THEY COME BACK. THEY DON'T COME BACK. ONLY ONES WITH EXTRAORDINARILY LOW IQ COME BACK. THEY DON'T COME BACK. REMEMBER WE HAD AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT. MAKING EVERY COMMUNITY A SANCTUARY CITY FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THEY WANT SANCTUARY CITIES FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS. HIS PLAN WOULD INCREASE REFUGEES 700%. THEY PLAN TO -- ALL TRAVEL BANS. I HAD A TRAVEL PLAN THAT WAS TOUGH. NO THANK YOU, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND BLOW UP OUR STORES AND STREETS AND PEOPLE. I PUT IN A VERY STRONG TRAVEL BAN AND WE WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. AND WE KEEP OUT RADICAL ISLAMIST TERRORISTS. WE KEEP THEM OUT. WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION IN THE MILITARY. TRILLION WITH A T. JOE WOULD SAY WE INVESTED 2.5 TRIP -- MILLION DOLLARS. NO, IT IS TRILLION. THE WORST IS WHEN HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING HE IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT HAS ONLY HAPPENED THREE TIMES. WORST OF ALL IS WHAT HE SAID TONIGHT. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE STATE OF OHION. O, NO. JOE, YOU ARE IN PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS OHIO, ISN'T IT? OR HE WAS IN IDAHO AND SAID IT WAS IOWA. NO, IT IS IDAHO. REMEMBER, POTATOES. IDAHO POTATOES. OR IN MIAMI WITH BEAUTIFUL PALM TREES AND HE SAYS HE IS IN VERMONT'S. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE STATE OF VERMONT AND YOU HAVE PALM TREES ALL OVER THE PLACE. I ALWAYS SAY IF YOU EVER DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING -- IF YOU EVER DO THAT, JUST WALK OFF THE STAGE BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO MAKE UP FOR IT. YOU CAN BE THE GREAT WINSTON CHURCHILL, A GREAT ORATOR. WOULD NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. THEY WOULD SAY THE SPEECH IS A DISASTER. WE ALSO PASSED V.A. CHOICE NVA ACCOUNTABILITY. AND EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TODAY WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS, BLOODTHIRSTY AL-BAGHDADI. AND WE TOOK UP A NUMBER ONE TERRORIST IN THE WORLD. SAUL AMINI -- SOLEIMANI IS DEAD. I WITHDREW FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN DEAL. $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. $150 BILLION FOR NOTHING. THE DEAL WOULD ALMOST BE TERMINATING NOW, SHORT-TERM DEAL. JOHN KERRY WENT INTO A BICYCLE RACE, BROKE HIS ARM AND LEG. I KEPT SAYING, LEAVE THE TABLE, NEGOTIATE. HE LEFT, WENT INTO A BICYCLE RACE AND DID NOT COME BACK FOR TWO MONTHS. SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT MUCH LONGER THAN THAT. WHAT A DEAL. WE TERMINATED IT. IRAN IS HAVING A VERY BAD TIME. THE FIRST PERSON THAT WILL, AFTER WE WIN, THE HEADS OF IRAN BECAUSE THEY ARE LOSING A FORTUNE AND I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THEY CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THAT CANNOT HAPPEN. THEY WILL CALL TO MAKE A DEAL. THEY SAID, YOU BETTER WAIT UNTIL THE ELECTION. I WANT TO DO IT RIGHT. I RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM. I OPENED AN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. EVERY PRESIDENT FOR DECADES SAID THEY WOULD DO IT. IT WAS TOUGH. ONCE YOU GET IN THERE THERE IS A LOT OF OPPOSITION, BUT WE DID IT. WE GOT IT DONE AFTER MANY YEARS. INSTEAD OF NEVER ENDING WARS, WE HAVE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. NO COST AND NO BLOOD. THAT WAS AMAZING. WE SAW THREE COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE COUNTRIES LINED UP TO GET THE DEAL. THEY ALL SAID, YOU COULD NOT DO IN THE -- DO IT THIS WAY. I REVERSED IT AND WE JUST DID SUDAN, UAE, BAHRAIN AND A LOT OF COUNTRIES WILL BE IN THERE. NO BLOOD IN THE SAND, NOTHING. THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THAT STUFF FOR SO MANY YEARS. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS TRULY OF VOTE -- OF VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU KNOW WE ARE THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. THE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, A MAN I HAVE ALWAYS COMPETED AGAINST. I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY PRESIDENT EVER, WITH THE POSSIBLE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHEN HE IS WEARING THE HAT. MUCH EASIER THAN WHAT I DO. WE WOULD NOT HAVE QUITE THIS AUDIENCE WHICH GOES TO A POINT YOU CANNOT SEE IT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE CAMERAS SHOW IT, BUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW THE CROWD BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK LIKE WE HAVE TOO MUCH SUCCESS. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, FREE SPEECH AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. SECOND AMENDMENT. YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, UNDER SIEGE, BUT WE HAVE IT OK FOR YOU. WE WILL END AT SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY, A BIG DEAL. ALREADY SIGNED. IT GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1. FIGURE THAN HEALTH CARE. LOWER DRUG PRICES EVEN MORE, AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS. THEY AGREE. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG, ALWAYS. WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. FOR YEARS YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. STANDING UP. TO THE LAST FOUR YEARS YOU HAVE SEEN ME FIGHT FOR YOU AND I AM RELYING ON YOU TO DELIVER ANOTHER HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR COUNTRY. ON NOVEMBER 3 OR SOONER WE MUST FACE THE JOB AND DRAIN THE SWAMP. IT IS DEEPER AND MORE VICIOUS, BUT WE HAVE THEM ON THE RUN. THINK OF IT. THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN. AND THIS NEW ONE IS JUST INCREDIBLE. I SAY IT IS NUMBER TWO. THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN AND TRIED TO HARM A DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT AND TALK ABOUT PEACEFUL TRANSITION. WHAT WE DID AND THE FACT WE ARE ABLE TO FIGHT THEM AND BEAT THEM AND KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM, WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. GET YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS AND GET OUT TO VOTE. YOU HAVE TO VOTE. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT TO VOTE. FROM ALLENTOWN TO ALTOONA, FROM PITTSBURGH TO RIGHT HERE IN MARTINSBURG, YOU LIKE THIS LOCATION, RIGHT? WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF PENNSYLVANIA PATRIOTS WHO GAVE THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS FOR THIS BELOVED NATION. THIS IS THE STATE WHERE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DECLARED INDEPENDENCE. THINK OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, HOW IMPORTANT PENNSYLVANIA IS. IT IS WHERE THE ARMY WEATHERED THE WINTER AT VALLEY FORGE WHERE GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON -- THEY WILL NOT BE TOUCHING THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, I PROMISE. LET HIS MEN -- LED HIS MEN ON A DARING MISSION IN DELAWARE, AND WHERE OUR UNION WAS SAVED BY THE HEROES OF EDDY'S BERG. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE GENERATIONS MIND OF THE CALL, WORKED THE RAILROADS AND FORGED THE STEEL THAT MADE AMERICANS INTO THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE ARE MAKING IT STRONGER AND STRONGER EVERY SINGLE DAY. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH YOUR HEALTH , DEVOTION AND DRIVE WE WILL KEEP WORKING, FIGHTING AND KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING.

CSPANDT2710202095	Donald Trump	2020-10-27	President Trump Campaign Rally in West Salem, Wisconsin	I want to start off by saying a very big. Hello, Wisconsin. It's great to be with. I'll also say this. I have never spoken where I had so many people behind me. E have a whole stadium behind. I want to just thank everybody. It is a great turnout. They wanted a bigger space. They got a bigger space because seven days from now we're going to win this state and we are going to four MAWR. Incredible years in the White House. Thank you, Thistle. Election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. That's what you're gonna have with the raise of taxes, the biggest tax increase in our history. It's ridiculous. It's a choice between a trump boom or a Biden locked down. Let's lock it all down. And by the way, speaking of lockdowns, let's get your governor toe. Open it up, Let's get him open. It's a choice between our plan to cut your taxes or even and I have to tell you, you know, we've given you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. You know, that biggest regulation cut in the history of our country and sleepy Joe Biden. His plan is to raise your taxes at a level that our country has never raised taxes before. Somehow, that doesn't work too well. Do you agree? I don't think so. I don't think so. I've never heard of it before, but that's okay. You can't hear of everything, right? All my life, I've watched people want to cut taxes. Here's the guys he's running on the basis of Let's raise everybody's taxes. Next week, Wisconsin's going to answer the call of history once again. We had a great victory here. Did we have a great Remember that four years ago? They said, Donald Thas won The state of Wisconsin has been a long time since Republican did that, but we're actually much higher now than we were then. We have a campaign that's actually more enthusiastic, and that was I would say, that had to be number one in history four years ago. But you know what? This is going to be the most important election in the history of our country because you see what's happening, the radical leftists and you're going to defeat Biden and dark money donors and corrupt special interest. One of the most important issues in this election is law and order. We say it long away. Joe Biden and his party incite violence and hatred against our police officers. And we're not doing that. No, we're not doing that. Remember the debate? The first debate? As which one. Did you like better the first one or the second one? Jesus book? Yeah, that's a fat. He said. Man, my man is there. Yep. Did anybody see the last one? Anybody watching? Seems to have had a very big impact. We learned a lot about him. He's number one. He's against oil deaths. Probably likes wind, but wind is very intermittent. Let's watch the president tonight on television. I'm sorry, darling. The winds not blowing Last night, Philadelphia was torn up by Biden supporting radicals, 30 police officers, Philadelphia police officers, great people. They were injured some badly. Biden stands with the rioters and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And you know what? They can do their job very easily. Just let them do their job. The Biden Harris plan would end cash bail. You know they wanna have cash bail so everyone just walks around, no matter what they do. Ends cash, bail freeing 400,000 dangerous criminals. It would slash police budgets all over the country. It would tie the hands of every police officer in the country, and they would a point. Anti police prosecutors in every community in America. I don't think that's for Wisconsin. We know each other well. Biden this often weak and too scared to be present. He doesn't want to be president. Let's face it, I have. You know, you got his bad body language. There's a lot of bad, but his men knows buddy language better than any man I know. That's a lot of bad body language from Joe. You know, he got out yesterday. You saw that because we're making speeches all over Pennsylvania. He got out and he got out of Delaware. He said, What's the closest point to Pennsylvania? It was just a few minutes from his basement, and he went and made a speech, and that was a mistake because I had to take him off the stage because they didn't. He didn't know where the hell he waas that didn't work out too well because he had a lid, you know, like a garbage Can you put it in the can. It's a lid. It's called the lid, but he doesn't want to be president. One thing about this job, you gotta want it. You gotta want it. This is tough and doing this. I don't usually say it, but I say it doing this on. Unlike Biden, who's made a fortune in politics, What a fortune. The press is not allowed to write about that, though, but Biden made a fortune. You know what? This has cost me billions of dollars, and you know, I could not be happier because we have done things that nobody else could have done in the 1st 3.5 years. There's been no administration that's done what we've done in the 1st 3.5 years with our military, with our vets, with regulations, with cutting taxes. Biden's running mate, the most liberal member in the U. S Senate, she makes Bernie Sanders look like he's a conservative, even urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bailout rioters in Minneapolis, where they had such problems until the National Guard went in and they stopped it. Would you say that was about what, 22 minutes it was all over, including an attempted cop killer. They wanted to bail them out. The policies will set cop killers free. We believe if you murder a police officer, you should get the death penalty. And I know you're a statement. You murder a police officer you saw a month ago. The two young officers sitting in a car and the guy comes up. Now you do that stuff and you can't get away with it. When the Violent Mob came. Thio Kenosha. You know Kenosha. Everybody know Kenosha. Biden oppose sending in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved Kenosha. Kenosha wouldn't be standing and I got a lot of credit. Thank you to the sheriff and so many others for their support. They've actually came out and supported me. Thank you very much. Where's the sheriff? Busy around here someplace. What a hell of a shelf. Thank you very much. That's great. I appreciate too. That's the first time you ever did it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. It has good man. Good man. It took generations to build the America that we know and love. But if the radical left gain power. It would take them only a matter of months to burn it down, tear it down or destroy it. I'm the only one standing between you and the left wing mob. I hate to tell you, there aren't too many of us, but we're standing in your Second Amendment and many other things, right? Biden is not only declared war on one police, I mean, you know, it really is. My father told me a long time. Don't use the word cops, because the word cops, that's a little slang always calling police, so I never use it. You know, I see cops, but sometimes it's not bad. Sheriff, let me ask you cops or police, or doesn't it matter if it's done with the heart? Who cares, right? Right. If it's done with the heart. So, like I said, he declared war on the cops and it's not working out too well. You're gonna see something. You're going to see a giant red wave on Tuesday. You're going to see a red wave like they've never seen before. And they saw a very big one. I'll tell you what, they got a glimpse on four years ago because that was I remember. They said, Where did these people come from? Where did they come from? They're great Americans. They don't want anything. They just want that level playing field. And they came out and they voted. And this is gonna be bigger. This is gonna be bigger and they know it. They know they know it. They don't like to report it. They see what's happening. They see what's happening. Mike, Don't they get it? It's gonna be very big, and it's gonna be beautiful and it's probably going to start. It doesn't have to start on Tuesday. It could sort earlier. Early voting. You want to be there? You know these ballots. You see what I write about the ballots? It's messed up like you wouldn't believe. Now they say we'd like Thio get the ballots and maybe get him within a few days of the election and we'll take 10 days to count them up. Good. Let's let the whole world wait while you count your balance. And you know what happens while they're counting them? They're dumping more balance in their okay. Where they Where did they come from? Now they have to. We had a great ruling right here. We had a great ruling, right? Got that? Yesterday, Supreme Court said No, that's your date. That's it's called November 3rd. That's your date, right? But sleepy Joe declared war on American workers, and Biden spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs. You got hit hard, opening your borders. You don't have borders, you don't have a country and sacrificing American blood and treasure and endless foreign ridiculous wars. Countries most of you, including even most of the people they never even heard of these countries. We're bringing them all back home. You know that, right? They're all coming back home. Afghanistan, Iraq, keeping some in Syria. What if you don't mind? We're keeping the oil. You know, they should have done that. They should have done that with Iraq. Remember, I said, don't go into Iraq, But if you go and at least keep the oil, we didn't keep the oil. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He repeatedly tried to slash Medicare and Social Security. He's a shill, in a sense, for foreign countries. You got to take a look at this guy's record. Of course, right now he has no idea where he is. That's a That's a That's an entirely different problem. That's a very big, different problem. But who the hell look, we have to say it like it is? Hey, we have the greatest country in the world. We have potential like no country has way. Can't play games way can't play games way can't. Besides that, he's not a nice guy. Okay, just so you know, he was never a nice guy, so I feel better. He was a nice guy. I wouldn't say. That's thank you very much. Thank you. Decade after decade, Biden twisted his knife into the back of Wisconsin workers. But workers throughout the United States You don't have to take my word for it. For a special group of people. The people of Wisconsin. I spent a lot of money on this crazy video. Look at this and you're going to see. And I hope that people back here can see it. Can you see it too, I hope. Oh, that's terrible. All right. You'll take my word for it. Go ahead, play. I'm My problem is I voted for NAFTA. I'm supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do, and I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters. Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people of making pennies an hour, has resulted in the loss of 160 0 jobs. The president is absolutely right when he says that China has been cheating for 25 years and that Bill Clinton did and didn't do enough about it. George W. Bush didn't do enough about it. Barack Obama didn't do enough about a rising China is an incredibly positive development for not only China but the United States and the rest of the world. Rising in China is a positive, positive development. It is in our self interest that China continue to prosper. We want to see China rise. China is a great nation, and we should hope for the continued expansion. China is not our enemy way. Talk about China is our competitors. We should be helping China is gonna be our lunch bizarre. They're not bad folks, folks. China is not a problem allowing China into the World Trade Organization, which he supported. Extending most favored nation status to China, which you supported that those steps allowed China to take advantage of the United States by using our own open trade deals against us. Do you think, in retrospect, that you were naive about China? Who doesn't he deserve some credit for that? It's better. The USMC is better than NAFTA. It is better than NAFTA. I never said I oppose fracking. You said tape. I did show the tape. Put it on your website. I'll put it on, put it on the website. Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? No way would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated. Guaranteed. We're gonna end fossil fuel no more, No new fracking. I gradually move away from fracking. Andi. I think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuel leases on public lands. Well, what about stopping fracking and stopping pipeline infrastructure? And there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. I have one final would be closed down. Erlinda, would you close down the other way? Transition from the oil industry? Yes. Oh, transition. That is a big in terms of business. That's the biggest thing. Because basically, what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that? Texas. We remember that. Pennsylvania. Oklahoma. Now, to be fair, maybe Biden's not telling us because he's forgotten his own plans. Watch Biden staff quickly swoop in to shuffle them along during a quickie. Escaped the basement trip to Pennsylvania. Here's the deal. One of the things that that is important is that keep in mind, although they're gonna vote on, uh, Barrett. That was terrifying. What kind of country? We're gonna be? Four more years of George, uh, Georgia. He gonna find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're gonna be We're gonna be in a different world. That was yesterday. That was all yesterday. So that took place yesterday. Every day we could put up another treat. It's the whole thing is ridiculous. The whole thing, You know, until the plague came in from China, I didn't even have a race. And then it came in and we did a great job. We saved millions of lives. Two million lives. 2.2 million. Who was supposed to this'll guy, You know he didn't see Oh, don't ban it. Your xenophobic Don't ban China. Don't ban China. This is in January very early on very, very early. Everybody said don't band. I'm not blaming anybody, but they all said, Don't bad. I said It's a heavily infected country and starting from there I banned China. Then I banned Europe with all of the problems they were having with Spain and Italy and France of everybody. And I banned I bad Europe. And 2.5 months later he was saying, Don't ban and then he runs for president. He looks out because Pocahontas decided to stay in. So she took a lot of votes away from Bernie, Not too many. She didn't do too well, but she took enough away that he ends up winning on Super Tuesday. Right? And all of a sudden I got this guy running and he starts complaining that I should have moved faster. But he was 2.5 months behind, and I said, That's gonna be hard to explain, but I have to explain it to people. One thing nice is when you put this thing up here, saves you a lot of words, right? It saves you a lot of words. And then the other thing, remember, for a year we will not frack. Now it affects you because of your energy costs and all of the things that affects everybody. We're right now. Energy independence. It's a great thing first time, but it really effects. Can you imagine Texas, Pennsylvania, The different places? Ohio. So many places. So many places. North Dakota. Can you imagine? Take Texas. I mean, he's a good soil. He's against guns and he's against religion, right? Other than that, he's wonderful. He's just perfect. And then they say it's a very close race in Texas. I don't think so. Year against year against oil, guns and God, you don't have a close race in Texas. I don't think, but they said it the same thing four years ago that Texas is too close to call. It's going to be a very, very tough race for Donald Trump that it was Donald right now, they call me President out of respect, I'm sure for the office it will be a very, very, very tough race. I mean, the polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won. The state of Texas was like, Well, they're one thing. They don't do that unless you have a landslide. So we had like, and now they do the same thing again. Well, this time at least they say I have a little lead. How can you have a little lead when I'm the oil person Who we needed to fire up your factories and you just we can't. They don't even know how to do it. They have, like, a O C plus three. They say, Okay, we'll get rid of all fossil fuels. We have a problem in Wisconsin. We're doing very well. We have a lot of factories. We have a lot of plans. How are we gonna fire him up? She has no clue. She has no clue. I don't even think she studied it. It may be in high school. She studied it, but probably not in college. Did she go to college? Tell me, did she? Because I don't know. I don't know her background, but it is not heavy into the environment. All of a sudden, she comes up with the green New Deal, and these people all did because they have to, because the radical left wants him. The green New Deal will cost $100 trillion. If we have 100 perfect years the greatest years of the history of our country, we can't make it. With 100 trillion spent on the Green New Deal in 2016 Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. It's one of the reasons I was elected. E was a politician. I probably wouldn't have been elected right. If I don't always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, and I'm fighting for you harder than any president has ever fought for you. Together, we'll continue to fight for American workers, support our police, defend our second amendment, which is under siege. But don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It's fine, but it is under siege. Secure our borders and you know the wall is upto over 400 miles right now. We have very soon over four. We're gonna have it finished very soon. They don't talk about it anymore. You know, They used to go. He will never get it built because that was like you could The Democrat Party were so against it. They said it was obsolete. Use drones so we could watch everybody pour into the border. Let's send a drone up there. Right. Walls and wheels, right? Walls and wheels never get obsolete. There's about the only two things I know of that don't get obsolete. Everything else is obsolete. About 15 minutes after you figure it out and ensure mawr products air proudly stamped with that wonderful, beautiful phrase made in the Yusa right way will deliver record, prosperity, epic job growth and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends this pandemic. And, you know, with fake news everything is Covic. Covic, Covert Covert. I had it. Here I am, right. I had it. First lady had it. Baron had it, but Baron had it for about 12 seconds. Young, young and immune. System young. No, it z co vid you turn on the news covert Cove in. You know when they're going to stop talking about it so much November 4th. You're right, November 4. It's a whole crazy thing. I mean, it's too complicated to explain. These people are very corrupt, very dishonest. But they got a lot of problems. On November 4th, you'll hear we're doing extremely well and you'll see it. You'll see, you know that You always say that Europe look a Europe Look at Europe Well, first of all, they count their cases totally differently. But look at your well. They have a big spike and you know what? It's going to go down. And we had a spike in Miami. We had a spike in Texas, Arizona. It's all way down to very low numbers, but I'll tell you all they want to talk about is co vid. But the good news on the fourth, they'll stop talking. You watch, they'll stop talking. You get out that red wave. Just get out. We have to win this election. This is the most important election we've ever had. We can't let this radical left socialist group takeover on. I've been saying it now for a long time because I see it. This this inclination by a group of people, Our country will never be a socialist nation. We will never become a socialist nation. Normal life will fully reason. That's all we want is normal life seven months ago, right? We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. Everybody was doing well, best numbers we've ever had. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what's happening. You see how it's being built up. And by the way, I'd love to do stimulus. But crazy Nancy doesn't wanna do it. She wants to get bailout money for her Democrat run states that are high crime and doing badly. And I spoke for Wisconsin. What? I said, No, thank you, Nancy. Have a good time. We'll get big stimulus right after the elections over. Hopefully, we can take back the house, too. Be nice. Get rid of her. Get rid of her speaker, will get Kevin and their Kevin would be good. You know who Kevin is? Kevin McCarthy. If Biden and the Democrat Socialists were elected, they will bury your regular. You know what's going on right with your regulations. I've got your regulations down to a level, but we can go further. We have statutory requirements were going further. They'll bury your really your family and yourself and regulations terminate religious liberty, dissolve our borders, indoctrinate our Children with that really bad stuff that they want to teach in schools, which we've largely ended. But it could be started again and destroy the suburbs beyond repair. Suburban women. You're gonna love me. You better love me. Did you see 60 minutes the other night? I always joke. I say suburban women. I'm getting rid of that regular. You know, there's a regulation that essentially destroyed the suburbs. Okay, It would have. You know who was in charge of it? Who would have been Cory Booker? Good luck, Corey. He's another beauty. He's another. We deal with the real beauties, but we had a regulation where they can build low income housing and projects in in the neighborhood near you, You know, right in the neighborhood, near you, in the suburbs, right? So the fake news was saying We think that Donald Trump is having problems with suburban women. I said, Why? Because I'm going to stop crying from going to the suburbs because you know, Antifa and the anarchists they view the suburbs is next. That's what they would like. So the suburban woman wants law and order. They want safety and they don't want a regulation that's going to destroy the suburbs. And then I listen to these people talk about how so Four years ago, they talked about the same thing. They said women will not be voting for Donald Tand then after about four hours and they declared total victory for Trump, you know, they said he cannot get 2 to 70. He cannot. This was in the afternoon. He can, and for about six months before that, by the way, didn't just started there. Donald Trump cannot get you need to 70 right? Cannot get to 270. He cannot get. And they were right. We got 306 way picked up a place called Wisconsin that helped me. Oh, that wasn't That wasn't high on the list of victories. Now it is, but we just know it just came out. Were leading by like, three points. That's good. They won't report. They they won't report that they look at 30 polls. They look at 30 polls. Some of them are totally fake. Some of them are sick coz, right? They look at Paul's, where they interview 38% Democrats, 21% Republicans. I said, That doesn't sound like to fair to me and they'll say Trump is down by five. Well, if I'm down by five when they're doing 38 to 21 that means I'm winning in a landslide. What kind of polls are these now? Seriously, what kind of polls are these? People are crazy. Joe Biden will delay the vaccine. Postponed therapies, prolonged the pandemic. Shutter your schools, open you schools, please bankrupt your small businesses and shut down our country. He will destroy our country. And by the way, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. I said that a long time ago, except what I originally said that I had no, you know, I felt it. I felt it was bad. I just felt it was an instinct. It can't be worse than the problem itself. So the shutdown, with alcoholism, with drugs, with abuse, with suicides, with all the things that happened, it's worse. You can't do this. You gotta get your governors to open up. There aren't many of them. There aren't many of them now. But you gotta now one of the reasons this is another one on. We'll go to the fourth, right. November 4th. They'll be announcing We're opening our ST one of them stupidly, like, three weeks ago. Now, you know, we think we're gonna open probably around November 4th. How about that, genius? Okay, no, there'll be alot be open around a couple of days after the election. Biden even wants toe lock down young and healthy Americans. Yet for those under age 50 the recovery rate is 99.98%. Think of that 99.98 And for school kids, it's lower than it's better than that. Biden's cruel and sensors lockdowns would cause countless deaths from suicide and from all of the problems we have. And we would have problems and economic people lose their jobs. They lose their jobs, they're small businesses go out or they work for small businesses or big businesses that go out, get open up our states. We got to tell you, Governor, we gotta open up our states Does anybody like your governor? Do you like him? Okay, let's have Who likes the governor? Is he gonna win re elections? Who does not like the governor? All right. It's interesting. Lots of lot, Governor. They're gonna open up now. A lot of governors that did this, you know, Michigan. She the only one that it was allowed toe go around. And Rome was her husband, right? He was allowed to go fishing and sailing. Nobody else was there to stay locked up in their house. But we want a Supreme Court case against them. They found it unconstitutional that she locked down the state of Michigan. I just left Michigan. I gave a speech in 32 degree weather in the rain. And they're great people. They're strong people. So I said, You know what I'll do? I won't put on a hat, Okay? And I'll just stand there in Iran on. I'll freeze it. I'll make a speech. But I'll tell you, there was such love. It was incredible. We're winning. We're winning Michigan, too. No, no, e had a nice hat. I was gonna put it on and they were waiting for four or five hours. I mean, I said I feel so guilty. I mean, I wasn't there, but to get there very early. Like probably some of you. You got here very early. Right, Elise? Front rowers I know. Got here. I know the front rowers get here very early. I mean, we have it where they get 34 days in advance. They were you here? 34 days. Yeah, I know. Will you vote? You promise? You voted for Trump? She's great. Now we have great people we've never had. Four years ago, we had the most enthusiastic campaign anyone's ever seen. Probably there ever waas this this campaign. And I never thought I'd say it has mawr enthusiasm mawr support that we did four years ago. Uh, because, you know, four years ago, I was a business guy. I was successful. I was very successful. I came and I said I was gonna dio get it out of your sister. So four years ago I came and I saw trade. I probably trade was you know, I just drove me crazy. We're losing all our factories, closing all our factories. They're moving to Mexico. They're making it in China. They're doing all these things. A lot of people, a lot of places moved up to Canada. Canada was very tough with us, But a lot of I saw this. That's really the main reason I ran. But I saw it all happening. It was so easy to see. I saw it all happening, and that's probably the main reason I ran. But four years ago, I was just saying, I'm gonna cut your taxes. I'm gonna cut regulations. I'm gonna rebuild your military. I'm gonna dual the things I said. And actually, I did more because, like Space Force, we opened up Space Force. I never said I was gonna do that. I learned that after watching Russia and China and everything else, I learned that after us here. But I never took one of these people right back there. Said he may be the only politician that actually did Mawr than he promised during the campaign. I believe that's true. So we have. So we have actually Mawr enthusiasm because I did everything. I mean, I said the wall, the wall was I mean, the wall was just a very expensive. The Border Patrol wanted a certain way very expensive. I mean, they're right. They wanted vision. They wanted steel. They wanted rebar. They wanted concrete inside and they said, You know what? I'll do it. I want to do it the way you want it. I don't want to give you any excuses for doing a bad job in the border G if you only would have built the wall right? But all of the things that I said I did everything I said I did, and that gives this campaign more energy than a guy that was successful. That said, Hey, I'm going to do a lot of things because you've been hearing that for years from politicians and they don't do it, they don't get the job. As I said about buying the other night at the debate, Joe, you're all talk and no action and it's true on I'd look at him and say, Joe, why didn't you do it? You know so well, we should have done this. We should have been I said, Joe, you've been there for 47 years and you left 3.5 years ago. It's not like you left 30 years ago. You left 3.5 years ago and I only ran because of you, Joe, because if you and Obama did a good job, I wouldn't have run. I mean, there would have been no reason. And if I did, I probably wouldn't have been able to win, so I only ran. It was quite it was quite insulting to him, but that's the way it is. Biden had no plan. No idea. He didn't have a clue. He just wants to lock up this country. I mean, he really does. He's gonna lock it up if one guy walks up and says, Sir, I think we should close up our country. Okay, that sounds good to be while letting rioters and looters run wild. Or is Joe calls them peaceful protesters. I call you protesters. You know why? Because there's a legal definition. You can't have a political rally. They did that to keep me out, right? So I said, Oh, I see. You're protesters. The only thing you can do is protest. Because they wanted to protect anarchists, rioters, people that were burning down your stores. So you have the absolute right to protest. So I call this a friendly protests. Okay, Officially, not a rally. A thistle is not a rally. It's a friendly protest. Okay, Now we've gotten over the legal hurdle, haven't we? These people don't believe in science. They believe in whatever gives them powered. Whatever gives them control. The Biden plan will crush you and crush your family. We will crush the virus and make our success make this country mawr successful than it's ever been. We have that kind of potential. We have the foundation set. You see what's happening. You see the kind of numbers we're doing. We're going to make our country mawr successful quickly than it's ever been. When the China plague arrived, we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We airlifted medical supplies, pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of the 85. And now it's actually higher than that. Well, here I am. I mean, I'm here, right? I said, give me that stuff. Whatever the hell it is, Doctor, I want it. Next day I woke up and I felt like Superman. Right? I said, Get me the hell out of here. I have to go toe Wisconsin tonight on saved Over two million lives are excess mortality rate has been 42% less than Europe's. Think of that. 42% and I'm working and we're working with your very closely look. They have a problem. We all It should have never been allowed to leave China ever. It should have never been allowed. It didn't go once it got Wuhan Wuhan province. It never got out, but it came to the U. S. A. And Europe and the rest of the world. I'm working to make the breakthrough treatment I received. So what we're doing is we're going to make the Regeneron and Eli Lilly a great company has a similar anti body drug antibody drug, and we're going to make that available to people that needed free. All I know is I didn't feel great. And after I took that, I woke up the next morning and I wanted I tell you, I felt like I could take on the world. I said, Let me at it. And here we are, standing here Freezing. Thanks are relentless efforts. 97% of all current emergency room visits are for something other than the virus. You don't hear these numbers from the fake news? Think of that 97% and we're on track to deliver 100 million doses of safe vaccine. And I say we're turning the corner. We're turning the corner. We're rounding like this racetrack. Look at this is perfect. We're rounding the curve. We will vanquish the virus. And by the way, we're gonna have the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Modern, great companies. And others, too. We have the vaccine. We're gonna have it very soon. Like very soon. We're going to deliver it. But without it also, we're rounding the curve. We're rounding the corner. It's happening. We're gonna emerge stronger than ever before. Biden's made a corrupt bargain. And the Democrats, in exchange for his party's nomination, he has handed control of his party over to a rage, Phil, Socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists. You see it? You see it in Portland? How about Portland? We could solve that problem in. That's a half A Now, er anarchists. You know what happens to him, right? They go back home to mom and Dad, and they also stay in the basement. That's what they have in common with Jill. Well, no Joe in that one clip, you know, that was yesterday. That took place. That was what happened? He was in the basement. He heard that we were doing really well in Pennsylvania, which we are at least two or three points up. Doesn't sound like much. You know what happens with us. They'll say he's three points up and then you win by, like, 10. There's a lot of hidden votes out there. I don't know if I'm supposed to be complemented by that or not, but they're hidden votes. They don't want to talk. See, they are. They know what they are. All action, right? They call that all actions. If Biden wins the flag burning radicals on the streets will be running for you know that they'll be running your government. They'll be running your government this election day. You must stop the anti American radicals by delivering Joe Biden and those far left Democrats, all Democrats, a thundering defeat. This has to be a big defeat so we can end. It just ended, and Joe Biden, as you see, is a corrupt politician. He wants to send your jobs to China while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party. Million's on. He gets money from Ukraine, he gets money from Russia. How about Ukraine? His son sits on the board. No energy experience, No nothing. Didn't have a job. Father becomes vice president. He becomes in charge of Ukraine. Son goes on. The board of Karisma goes on the border. Paris. 183,000 month. Would you say that's good? Would you say that's good. If Biden wins, China wins. China will own the use. A. If this happens and they don't want me to win, they don't want me. We charge them tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs. We never took 10 cents from China, and now we gave out. Where is that? Please go. Where's Hunter? Where is Hunter, by the way? Come to think of it, how about the laptop from hell? Let's call the laptop from them on. Then you see shifty shift. It was Russia that created the laptop. It was Russia. Shifty shift. He says it with a straight face water melon shaped head like a water. It was Russia, I said. Oh, no. Here we go again. When we win, you win. Wisconsin wins and America wins. That's what's goingto happen. We're joined today by members of Wisconsin manufacturers and commerce. That really helped us with this location. And, you know, we're gonna be out of the airport. But the governor made it very difficult. So I said, That's alright. Get a location. Friendly people and your state's there really are your states Chamber of Commerce. And I wanna thank them very much. Where are you folks? Where are you guys? What a group of people. Where? What the hell are you? I met your there, but there they are. Good job. You did. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good job. I said, how are we doing? They said, sir, you're gonna win easy. That's pretty good. They know the They slightly know the area. I'm thrilled to receive their first ever presidential endorsement. They've been around a long time, and they gave us. We've got a lot of endorsements, Got a lot of newspaper endorsements today to a lot of them all over the country. And every virtually every law enforcement group has given us the endorsement. Even New York's finest. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate, and they wanna be given back. We've got to respect our law enforcement. We've gotta let him do what they have to do. Also with us. His candidate for Congress, Derek Van Orden, is terrific. Quiz. Derek. Derek. Good luck. I hear good things, Derek. I hear good things. Derek Van Orden, please vote for him when his competition is not good. Not good. And also, state GOP Chairman Andrew hit Andrew. Thank you. Are we winning? Andrew, please. If we don't win, we're gonna fire you so fast. Uh, I hear good. Yeah. Just get out that vote. Get out the vote. Together, we built the greatest economy in history, and now we're doing it again. Make America great. Again. Again. Right again. Again. See all those hats. Those hats are obsolete. It's make America great again. Again. We increased middle class family income over $6000 mawr than five times thens made under the last administration. Think of that in a short period of time. African American, Hispanic, American, Asian American unemployment reached their lowest levels ever recorded since April. We created a record 11.4 million jobs. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and proudly signed the brand new U. S. M. C A into law. That's gonna be a big deal just just kicked in Wisconsin, dairy farms were decimated under the Obama and Biden nightmare. They were decimated. And now you are doing very well. And, you know, Canada took advantage of you very much. You know that, right? Not anymore. Under the U S. M c a r dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by at least 100%. We got rid of the tariffs. You know the tariffs. You know, they used to charge. You didn't know that you like the song o Canada, right? Hockey game. Nice song O Canada. Their national anthem, right? By the way, they stand for nationalism. Are people have to stand for our national anthem? They have to stay, but Canada treated us badly. 287% tariff. Can you believe that? Think of it. I learned about that. I said it's time to get out of that crazy NAFTA. NAFTA was a terrible thing When GM went bankrupt. Biden and Obama, through the workers of Delphi Corporation to the wolves, their pensions were wiped out. I signed in order to restore the pensions of Delphi and others and health care benefits promised the workers and these air workers in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin that got really promised a lot of things and it never happened. We took care of it. I will never let anyone rip off our great American worker. They were treated very badly with a lot of promises from Biden and Obama under my By the way you see this, you see the people that get for the crowds. Obama was up. He drew flies. Today, flies do nobody dead court, you know the cars are honking, right? Hong Kong, Kong, Let's go home. I never saw anything like this. They have cars. They have, like 12 cars. Now they have circles. There's a bigger circles for cars together. I never saw anything like it. Obama has no crowd. I thought he had, like a crowd, right? He doesn't have anything. The only one that has smaller crowds. A sleepy Joe Biden. He's got nobody and the press doesn't like covering our crowds. We have the opposite. We have so many people, they don't like it, but they never show. They never show that nobody. Joe was speaking yesterday. There was nobody there before they carried him off the stage. Think of it. He got nervous speaking to nobody. But that wasn't nervous. That was another problem. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History. My opponent's insane immigration plan completely eliminates US borders. By implementing nationwide catch and release, he would make every you know that is You catch a criminal murderer rapist, You catch. I mean, you have to release them into the United States. Then within two or three years, they're supposed to come back for a trial. We had an argument during the debate. I said, Sleepy Joe. They don't come back. Yes, they do. They proudly come back. No, no, Joe, they're murderers. They don't come back here. I turned out to be right, but, you know, he would make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U. S. Military. You know that, right? You were a big beneficiary, this state. Ah, lot of business in the state, including nearly $6 billion to save the historic shipyard. Marinette Marine. You know that, right? And they're great. I was there four or five months ago. I was watching. They built beautiful, Beautiful. It looks like a yacht with lots of weapons on it. The only difference is you got rockets all over the damn thing. But it is beautiful. We killed the leader of Isis, al Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist. Soleimani is dead Way took out 100% of the Isis caliphate. Also, when I took over when I took over, it was a mess. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion.1.8 billion in cash. You know, we got nothing. I recognize the true capital of Israel and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We're doing it. It's like it's like working out really well. Three countries already, and many are lined up there. All wanting to get in a vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln. It's a vote for the American dream on. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already happening. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States right here in Wisconsin. Way will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You don't want the sanctuary. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Very important. Supreme Court. You got to do that. You've got to remember a lot of people think that's why I got elected because of the Supreme Court. And we've got already three great justices Amy yesterday. And by the end of the first time we have close to three, maybe more. But approximately 300 federal judges, including Court of Appeals, judge the record. It's a record we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. So the $2.5 trillion the greatest rockets and missiles hydro sonic, the greatest in the world. They go seven times faster than what we have today. We have tanks, we have planes, we have bombers, We have submarines. We've rebuilt our military. We have the greatest. We have the greatest equipment, the greatest military force in the world. Russia, China, everybody. They are envious. Nobody thought we could do this and we've done it all. It's a lot of it's made right here, but all made in the Yusa, all made in the USA. Our nuclear is now in tippy top shape and just hope, just hope that we never have to use it. That's Ah, we will end surprise Medical building Require price transparency already signed January 1st. That goes into effect. Lower drug prices, even further. Favorite nations. Nobody can believe I did it. We're going to get the lowest prices in the world and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman in the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and NASA right now is the talk of the world is a space center again. It was closed and a mess when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school way will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag on We will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust, right? For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Wisconsin. That's what we're doing. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, even grab your boss if you have Thio. Come on, boss. You got to go out and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out. This is a thing you gotta do. Just remember the great Red Wave. It's now just starting to form is and they know it's coming. They know it's coming.

And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting.

CSPANDT2710202096	Donald Trump	2020-10-27	President Trump Campaign Rally in Omaha, Nebraska	THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I HOPE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS TURNING THEIR CAMERAS WAY, WAY BACK THERE. HELLO, OMAHA. AND I HAVE TO ALSO SAY, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HERE FROM IOWA, HELLO, IOWA. OK, WAIT A MINUTE. WHO IS FROM IOWA? GO. WHO IS FROM OMAHA? YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE GOING TO BE IN IOWA SOON. WE WILL DO THAT ONE SEPARATELY. THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. SEVEN DAYS FROM NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO WIN NEBRASKA. AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE GREAT WHITE HOUSE, THAT BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSE. LOOK AT THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. 29,000 PEOPLE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 29,000. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO WIN BOTH NEBRASKA'S, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TWO. WE ARE GOING TO WIN BOTH. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE HAVING, OR A BIDEN DEPRESSION. SAD TO SAY. AND SOME BAD NEWS CAME OUT ON AYDIN BUT I WILL NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. YOU WILL FIND THAT OUT TOMORROW. WE WILL GET TO IT. MAN. THAT IS SOMETHING. BIDEN PLEDGED THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FIRST MAN THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN CAMPAIGN ON THE FACT THAT I AM GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. WHAT IS GOING ON? I GAVE WORKING FAMILIES RECORD-SETTING TAX CUTS, AND IN MY SECOND TERM, I WILL CUT MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES VERY SUBSTANTIALLY. BY THE WAY, A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING ON. THE POLL NUMBERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. WHERE IS THE FAKE NEWS? IT'S OVER THERE. THAT'S A LOT OF CAMERAS. THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED. THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED FOR IT ALL OVER, FLORIDA IS LOOKING GREAT. NEBRASKA WE KNOW IS LOOKING GREAT. IN THEORY, I DID NOT REALLY HAVE TO BE HERE, BUT IT'S NICE TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS, TOO. WITH YOUR VOTE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS, SUPPORT OUR POLICE, DEFEND OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDERSERVED. MAINTAIN AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, EXPAND SCHOOL CHOICE, AND ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE PHRASE, THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, "MADE IN THE USA." RIGHT? I WILL DELIVER REP RECORD PROSPERITY, EPIC JOB GROWTH, AND A SAFE VACCINE THAT ERADICATES A VIRUS AND QUICKLY ENDS THE PANDEMIC AND WE ARE MAKING THAT VITAL TURN. THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. WE ARE MAKING THAT TERM. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE VACCINE, WITH OR WITHOUT IT. NORMAL LIFE WILL FULLY RESUME. THAT IS ALL WE WANT. WE WANT TO NORMAL LIFE. GO BACK SEVEN MONTHS. WE WILL TAKE NORMAL LIFE. GREATEST ECONOMY WE EVER HAD. WE WANT NORMAL LIFE. NEXT YEAR, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE HEADED. JOE BIDEN DOES NOT EVEN RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO CAMPAIGN. HE NEVER CAME HERE, RIGHT? DID HE COME HERE? OH, SO THAT IS THE END OF THAT. I WILL SEE YOU GUYS. MOMENTS AGO, WE LEARNED ABOUT THE OTHER REASON JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN HIDING IN HIS BASEMENT. IN A NATIONAL TELEVISION INTERVIEW, YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU THE REST? THE BIDEN FAMILIES BUSINESS PARTNER REVEALS EXPLOSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT JOE BIDEN CORRUPT AND ELICIT FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS WHILE HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT. THE BUSINESS PARTNER MADE CLEAR THAT BIDEN'S DENIAL OF INVOLVEMENT AND HIS SONS CORRUPT BUSINESS DEALINGS WAS A BLATANT LIE. HE STATED WITH FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING CORRUPT BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH CHINA AND GETTING MONEY FOR IT. THIS HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME AS BIDEN WAS LETTING CHINA STEEL AMERICAN JOBS AND PLUNDER AMERICAN WEALTH. YOU SAW THAT FOR EIGHT YEARS. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINAS. BIDEN WILL DO BAD THINGS. BY THE WAY, HE IS NOT A GOOD GUY, SO YOU UNDERSTAND. [CROWD CHANTING "LOCK HIM UP"] IS THERE ANY PLACE YOU WOULD RATHER BE THAN A TRUMP RALLY ON ABOUT A 10 DEGREE EVENING? 10 DEGREES. IT IS COLD OUT HERE, BUT THAT IS OK. WE JUST LEFT WISCONSIN. IT WAS COLD. IT WAS COLD AND RAINING. I SAID I WILL NOT PUT ON A HAT BECAUSE I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TOUGH WE ARE. IT WAS POURING AND IT WAS FREEZING. IT IS THE COLDEST RIGHT HERE. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, I HAVE TO SAY. WHEN WE WIN, YOU WIN. NEBRASKA WINS, AND ALL OF AMERICA WINS. JOE BIDEN SPENT THE LAST 47 YEARS , THINK OF IT, 47 YEARS, OUT SO SENIOR, OPENING YOUR BORDERS, AND SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN ENDLESS FOREIGN RIDICULOUS WARS. COUNTRIES YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. IN 2016, NEBRASKA VOTED TO FIRE THIS CORRUPT POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS PRESIDENT WHO FINALLY PUT AMERICA FIRST. , AND IF I DO NOT SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT IS BECAUSE I AM NOT A POLITICIAN. IF I DO NOT ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, IT'S BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU, AND I THOUGHT HARDER FOR YOU THAN ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS EVER HELD THIS WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL OFFICE. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. THIS ELECTION IS A MATTER OF ECONOMIC SURVIVAL FOR OMAHA AND FOUR COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN , LET'S FACE IT, IT'S NOT HIS AGENDA. IT SOUNDS NICE, BIDEN'S AGENDA. HE IS SO GONZO. HE SAW HIM YESTERDAY. I WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH TREMENDOUS CROWD LIKE THIS, TREMENDOUS RALLIES, AND HE HAD THE LID ON, YOU KNOW, THE LID, LIKE FROM A GARBAGE CAN. THEY SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WENT TO THREE OF THEM. I DID THREE OF THEM YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE WENT FROM DELAWARE TO THE CLOSEST WHERE PENNSYLVANIA HITS DELAWARE, WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM HIS BASEMENT. AND HE MADE A SPEECH. JUST BEFORE THAT, HE CALLED ME GEORGE. I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GEORGE BUSH. HIS WIFE WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM, AND YOU COULD SEE SHE WAS NOT HAPPY. IT'S HARD TO CORRECT HIM. YOU KNOW, THE CAMERA IS ON. HE DID THE LITTLE SPEECH AND IT WAS NOT GOOD. THEY SORT OF MOVED HIM OUT. IT TOOK HIM AWAY. HIS OWN PEOPLE BRUSHED HIM OFF. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU CAN HAVE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE POTENTIAL THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE CANNOT PLAY GAMES. WE CANNOT PLAY GAMES. SO THE DEMOCRATS, LET'S SAY THE DEMOCRATS, THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE AN EXTREME AGENDA. HE IS JUST THE VEHICLE. HE WILL BE THERE FOR FOUR WEEKS OR SO AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE COME ALLAH , KAMALA HARRIS. THAT WILL NOT BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT, MAY BE SOON, MAYBE SOON, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE KAMALA HARRIS. SHE IS FURTHER LEFT BY FAR THAN CRAZY BERNIE. YOU KNOW, BERNIE IS LIKE A CONSERVATIVE COMPARED TO HER. BUT BIDEN'S EXTREME AGENDA INCLUDES A RADICAL REVISION TO DESTROY SUBURBS ACROSS OUR NATION. HOW ARE YOUR SUBURBS DOING? ARE THEY GOOD? THEY WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR LONG. COMPLETELY DISMANTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIPPLE POLICE DEPARTMENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU SEE IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. BIDEN'S PLAN TO DESTROY SUBURBS AND POLICE, JUST TAKE A LOOK. ROLL THE TAPE. WE DO THIS ALL NIGHT. THE SUBURBS TODAY ARE NOT THE SUBURBS OF HALF A CENTURY AGO. THE SUBURBS ARE FAR MORE DIVERSE . THEY ARE BEING TARGETED, TARGETED FOR WHAT? FEDERALIZED, CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BY THE LEFT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH THE SUBURBS. THEY ARE TO CLEAN AND NICE, AND THEREFORE, BY DEFINITION, THEY ARE RACIST. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS PLANS ON HOW TO DO THIS. IT'S CALLED AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING TO HUD REGULATIONS. IT WAS WRITTEN DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. BIDEN'S ADVISORS PLAN TO ENFORCE IT. THEY WILL BE ORDERED TO ABOLISH ZONING FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING BECAUSE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ARE RACIST. WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED APARTMENTS, , WE WILL BUILD ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS. THANKFULLY, TRUMP HAS REPEALED THIS RULE IN JULY, BUT NOW, THE LEFT IS BACKING AND EVEN MORE RADICAL PLAN. IT WAS A BILL PUT FORWARD BY CORY BOOKER TO PUSH LOW INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS INTO THE SUBURBS. THIS WOULD BE A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF LOCAL ZONING LAWS, AND BIDEN, HE FULLY SUPPORTS IT. THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION PILED UP MORE THAN 600 MAJOR NEW REGULATIONS AND CRUEL AND PUNISHING REVELATORY BURDENS THAT COST THE AVERAGE AMERICAN AN ADDITIONAL $2300 PER YEAR. THINK OF THAT. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, $2300, REGULATION. PITTING , HITTING LOW INCOME AMERICANS THE HARDEST. REGULATORY RELIEF IS PROVIDING THE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD $3100 EVERY SINGLE YEAR. I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TRUMP TAX CUTS, YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DROP IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THE LOWEST YES, ABSOLUTELY. JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA, WE WILL ALL BE IN DANGER. IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE IN YOUR HOME AND YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN SAFE, SO DONALD TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PRETTY EFFECTIVE, RIGHT? IT SAVES ME A LOT OF WORK. I CAN SIT HERE AND WATCH AND SAY, SEE. HE'S NOT THE RIGHT GUY. HE IS NOT THE RIGHT GUY. HE IS NOT RIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY. HE IS NOT THE GUY FOR THIS COUNTRY, THIS ELECTION. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM, WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT, AND A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE WHICH IS WHERE YOU WOULD HEAD IF YOU HAVE , WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WILL DO. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP BOOM AND ABIDE IN LOCKDOWN. HE WANTS TO LOCK IT ALL DOWN. WE CLOSE IT UP. WE UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO COME HERE FROM CHINA. SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. JOE BIDEN WILL DELAY THE VACCINE , POSTPONE THERAPIES, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC, SHUTTER YOUR SCHOOLS. DESTROY YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SHUT DOWN YOUR COUNTRY. WE ARE SETTING RECORDS, 11.4 MILLION PEOPLE. IT HAS ALL OPENED UP. WE UNDERSTAND IT. WE ARE DOING A JOB. WE ARE LITERALLY SETTING RECORDS . LOOK AT HOUSING, AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION. LOOK AT HOW YOU ARE DOING IN NEBRASKA. LOOK AT HOW YOU ARE DOING IN NEBRASKA. BIDEN EVEN WANTS THE LOCK , TO LOCK DOWN YOUNG AND HEALTHY AMERICANS, YET FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 50, I HATE TO SAY THIS, HOW MANY ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 50? PRETTY YOUNG. WELL, I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. 99.99, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? THAT MEANS YOU ARE IN GOOD SHAPE. THAT IS WHAT THAT MEANS. YOU NOTICE THE FAKE NEWS NOW, RIGHT? ALL THEY TALK ABOUT IS COVID, COVID, COVID, AND WE HAVE MADE SUCH PROGRESS. IT'S INCREDIBLE. EXCUSE ME. I AM HERE. I MEAN, I WAS NOT EXACTLY FEELING GREAT. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. I WAS NOT EXACTLY FEELING GREAT, AND I MET WITH GREAT DOCTORS. ONE THING WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT, YOU GET PLENTY OF DOCTORS. WE HAVE ONE OF THEM HERE TONIGHT I THINK, RIGHT? WE HAVE OUR GREAT WHITE HOUSE DOCTORS TRAVELING. HE HAS BECOME VERY FAMOUS. IS THAT SEAN? LOOK AT SEAN. LOOK AT HIM. WOW. HE HAS GOT A BIG EGO. HE LOVES IT WHEN I MENTION HIS NAME. HE IS A GREAT DOCTOR. THEY WERE GREAT DOCTORS FROM JOHN HOPKINS, WALTER REED, EVERYTHING ELSE. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNEW SIX MONTHS AGO. INCREDIBLE. THE PROGRESS THEY HAVE MADE. AND WITH THE VACCINES, WHICH ARE COMING IMMEDIATELY, EVEN WITHOUT, WE ARE TURNING THAT CORNER. AT SOME POINT, WE ARE TURNING THAT CORNER, AND IT HAS BEEN PRETTY AMAZING. FLORIDA HAD A ROUGH TIME. IT'S ALL THE WAY DOWN. TEXAS, ALL THE WAY DOWN, ARIZONA. GREAT GOVERNORS. ALL THE WAY DOWN. BIDEN'S CRUEL AND SENSELESS LOCKDOWNS WOULD CAUSE COUNTLESS DEATHS FROM SUICIDE, DRUG OVERDOSE, AND DELAYED MEDICAL CARE. ALCOHOL. I MEAN, SO MANY, SO MANY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. REMEMBER, THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE. B WHEN I TRIEDANNED , WHEN I BANNED TRAVEL FROM CHINA, HE SAID HE IS ENOUGH YOU BOOK , XENOPHOBIC. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER. HE HAD A THING CALLED THE SWINE FLU. IT WAS A DISASTER. MUCH LESS LETHAL. IT WAS A DISASTER. HE WAS A DISASTER. HE IS STILL A DISASTER, ACTUALLY. IF WE LISTENED TO JOE, COUNTLESS MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED. THEY WERE ANTICIPATING IT COULD BE 2.2 MILLION. 2.2 MILLION. AND YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS. ONE IS TO MANY AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. ONE IS TOO MANY. SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. HE COULD HAVE BEEN 2.2. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT. BIDEN WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIVES ON THE ALTAR OF OPEN BORDERS. HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS. WITHOUT BORDERS, YOU DO NOT HAVE , WITHOUT BORDERS, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, THE WALL IS NOW OVER 400 MILES LONG. AND WE ARE BUILDING 10 MILES A WEEK AND IT'S VERY SOON GOING TO BE FINISHED AND WE HAVE THE STRONGEST SOUTHERN BORDER WE HAVE EVER HAD AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MERIT, MERIT. BIDEN HAS NO PLAN, NO IDEA, NO CLUE. HE HAS NO CLUE. THAT IS FOR SURE. HE JUST WANTS TO LOCK UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEYS, LETTING RIOTERS AND LOOTERS RUN WILD, AND YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. THEY CALL THEM PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. THEY BURN DOWN YOUR CITIES, THEY DO THINGS THAT NOBODY HAS SEEN BEFORE, ALL IN RADICAL LEFT, DEMOCRAT RUN CITIES AND STATES. CITIES, ALL OF THEM, ALL OF THEM. AND EVERY TIME WE GO IN, WE WERE GOING TO GO INTO SEATTLE. WE LET THEM KNOW WE ARE COMING IN. THE NIGHT BEFORE WE CAME IN, THEY GAVE UP. THEY LEFT. THEY TOOK OVER A PIECE OF SEATTLE. THAT WAS NOT GOING TO LAST. MINNEAPOLIS, THE SAME THING. WE WENT INTO MINNEAPOLIS HAD WE WENT IN. WE HAVE TO BE ASKED BY THE STATE , WE WENT INTO MINNEAPOLIS AND IT ALL ENDED. IT TOOK ABOUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 25 MINUTES OR SO. IT WAS JUST BOOM, RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN RUN CITIES ARE DOING VERY WELL. THE REPUBLICAN RUN CITIES. I HOPE YOU AGREE. YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. YOU DO. THIS INTO THAT , HI, PETE. I'M GLAD THEY DID THAT. JUST KEEP IT QUIET. THEY LIKE YOU. THE BIDEN PLAN WILL CRUSH YOU" FAMILY. MY PLAN WILL CRUSH THE VIRUS AND YOU WILL SEE ECONOMIC BENEFITS LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN OUR COUNTRY BEFORE. WHEN THE CHINA PLAYED ARRIVED, WE MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO FIGHT THE DISEASE. WE AIRLIFTED MEDICAL SUPPLIES, PIONEERED GROUNDBREAKING THERAPIES, REDUCED THE FATALITY RATE 85%. THINK OF THAT. AND SAVED OVER 2 MILLION LIVES. OUR EXCESS MORTALITY RATE HAS BEEN 42% LESS THAN EUROPE. YOU HEAR ABOUT EUROPE? 42% LESS. MUCH BETTER THAN EUROPE. I AM WORKING TO MAKE THE BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT I RECEIVED. I HAD THIS THING CALLED REGENERON. I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT HAD NOTHING TO DO , I WOULD LIKE TO SAY MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS JUST LIKE BARRON TRUMP, YOU KNOW? THE FIRST LADY HAD IT. I HAD IT. BARRON HAD IT. THEY SAID, SIR, HE TESTED POSITIVE. 12 MINUTES LATER, HE'S OK NOW. HE THREW IT AWAY. HE TOOK THAT AND THREW IT AWAY, YOU KNOW? THE YOUNG HAVE STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEMS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT TREATMENT DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME. DR., DID YOU , DOCTOR, DID YOU HEAR THAT? I WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE MY CHANCE. I SAID YOU HAVE SOMETHING, GIVE IT TO ME. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AFTER BEING WITH THESE DOCTORS. THEY WANTED TO TOUCH EVERY SINGLE PART OF YOUR BODY AND I DID NOT LIKE THAT. EACH ONE WAS A SPECIALIST, RIGHT? EVERY SINGLE ONE. THEY WERE GREAT. I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING, AND I WILL TELL YOU, I FELT LIKE , GET ME OUT OF HERE. IT WAS AMAZING. I REALLY THINK THIS THING WAS GREAT. I THINK IT WAS GREAT. AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF STAYING IN A BASEMENT. I CANNOT , I REALLY CANNOT. I HAD A LOT OF MEETINGS. I WOULD MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE. AS PRESIDENT, I HAD THAT OBLIGATION. WE HAVE BASEMENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BEAUTIFUL BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS. I COULD STAY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. I CANNOT DO THAT. I HAVE TO BE WORKING FOR YOU AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS. THEY CAME IN. THEY SAID, SIR, YOU TESTED POSITIVE. I SAID TESTED POSITIVE FOR WHAT? AND THEN YOU GO INTO ONE OF THE 27 DIFFERENT NAMES. CORONA, THIS, THIS, THIS, CHINA VIRUS, THE CHINA PLAGUE, THE CHINA PLAYED. THAT'S , PLAGUE. THAT'S WHAT I TESTED POSITIVE FOR. UNTIL I CAME ALONG, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LIFETIME IMMUNITY. I RECOVERED. I FEEL GREAT. I CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO THIS ROAD. I CAN KISS EVERY MAN AND WOMAN. BECAUSE IT WAS ME, NO, IT'S NOT FOR A LIFETIME. IT'S ONLY FOR FOUR MONTHS. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN. IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE FOR A LIFETIME. NOW, IT'S FOUR MONTHS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ON NOVEMBER 4, YOU WILL BE HEARING AS MUCH ABOUT THIS. IT IS COVID, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD THING. THE VACCINE WILL MAKE IT GO AWAY A LOT FASTER. THEY WILL BE GREAT. THE GREATEST COMPANIES OF THEIR KIND IN THE WORLD. TO GO BACK, 97%. , THINK OF THAT, 97%. THEY WILL BE BACK IN TWO WEEKS, JUST LIKE THEY DID IN FLORIDA.

IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK IN THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE COMING BACK. THIS WAS A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED. A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED. A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED. JOE BIDEN HAS MADE A CORRUPT BARGAIN. HE CANDID , HANDED HIS , CONTROL OF HIS PARTY OVER TO THE LEFT-WING MARXISTS, COMMUNISTS. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM TOO UNFORTUNATELY. IF BIDEN WINS, THE FLAGBURNING EXTREMISTS WILL BE RUNNING YOUR GOVERNMENT. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE FAKERS BACK THERE. THE FAKE NEWS.

THEY INCREASED , BON JOVI ALONG AND THAT INCREASED THE CROWD BY 22 PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS CREDIT IN MICHIGAN AND A TREMENDOUS CROWD IN WISCONSIN. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF TRUMP IS GETTING THESE CROWDS, YOU KNOW THE CIRCLES. HE FILLS IN THE CIRCLES. YOU HAVE FIVE OF THEM. A LOT OF TIMES, THEY PUT REPORTERS IN THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PEOPLE. TODAY, HE TRIED TO BLAME THAT ON COVID AS WELL. HE SAID WE DON'T SEEK LARGE CROWDS BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS. THAT IS NOT THE REASON. THAT IS NOT THE REASON. IT IS A GREAT EXCUSE BUT IT IS NOT THE REASON. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY THE MEN WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.

NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES AND WRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TRIPS BACK HOME , TROOPS BACK HOME , NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES, BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME. 19 YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN.

MOST OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. IT IS RIDICULOUS. BY THE WAY, MAKING OUR MILITARY STRONGER BY FAR. I ENDED THE NAFTA NIGHTMARE AND SIGNED THE U.S. NDA. IT IS A GREAT DEAL. IT JUST KICKED IN. COMPANIES WILL NOT BE LEAVING NEBRASKA AND IOWA. IT IS A VERY BIG DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO THAT. WHEN CHINA TARGETED OUR FARMERS, I DELIVERED $28 BILLION FROM OUR INCREDIBLE FARMERS IN ALASKA AND IOWA AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DON'T FORGET TO TELL THE PEOPLE OF IOWA THAT. PLEASE. SONNY IS GREAT. I SAID HOW MUCH WHERE THE FARMERS TARGETED QUESTION MARK HE SAID 12 AND 16. I TARIFF TO 28 BILLION. I TOOK IT FROM CHINA AND DISTRIBUTED IT TO OUR FIRMS. NOBODY ELSE WILL DO THAT. SOMEBODY , SOME PEOPLE SAY OUR FARMERS DO BETTER NOW THAN WHEN THEY HAD A FARM. WE DID HAVE THE BIGGEST ORDER OF CORN AND THE BIGGEST ORDER OF SOYBEANS AND THE BIGGEST BE FORWARDED. TWO WEEKS AGO. WAS JOE BIDEN POSSIBLY MAKE THE MOST LIBERAL MEMBER OF THE U.S. SENATE? YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS. HE SPONSORS THE INSANE GREEN NEW DEAL. $100 TRILLION. YOU TOO CAN HAVE NO WINDOWS IN YOUR BUILDINGS. THAT WOULD WIPE OUT THE ETHANOL INDUSTRY. IT WOULD TOTALLY WIPE OUT THAT INDUSTRY. WE WORKED HARD ON THAT INDUSTRY. THEY ARE NOW IN GOOD SHAPE. DEVASTATING NEBRASKA AND DEVASTATING IOWA. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS DEFEND ETHANOL. DOES NEBRASKA LIKE ETHANOL TOO? GOOD. I NEED THAT LITTLE ASSURANCE. I NEED THAT LITTLE BIT OF ASSURANCE. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN U.S. HISTORY. OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE WALL. MY OPPONENT'S INSANE IMMIGRATION PLAN WOULD COMPLETELY ELIMINATE U.S. BORDERS, OPEN BORDERS. EVERYONE CAN JUST POUR IN LIKE THEY USED TO. WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION. $2.5 TRILLION, EQUIPMENT, OUR MILITARY IS IN THE BEST SHAPE IT HAS EVER BEEN. WE HAVE THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE ARE IN THE ENVY , WE ARE THE ENVY OF EVERY OTHER COUNTRY. WE HAVE THE BEST TANKS AND FIGHTER JETS, SUBMARINES AND ERA NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE NOW RENOVATED. WE ONLY HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE THEM. WE HOPE TO GOD. OUR MILITARY WAS IN BAD SHAPE. IT WAS DEPLETED. IT WAS EXHAUSTED. IT WAS RIDICULOUS. WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS. AL-BAGHDADI. THERE WERE LOOKING FOR HIM FOR A LONG TIME. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S TOP TERRORIST. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS AND NICHOLAS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. IN HUNDRED $50 BILLION. WE PAID. $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. I AM MORE IMPRESSED WITH THAT. 150 BILLION OR ONE POINT BILLION , 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. I RECOGNIZE THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY. I ALSO RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. THEY WORKED ON THAT FOR 52 YEARS. I GOT IT DONE IN TWO HOURS. INSTEAD OF NEVER ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THREE COUNTRIES, WE HAVE FIVE LINED UP. WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER. IT IS AN EASY ONE. IT IS A LOT EASIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK. THEY WORKED ON THIS FOR 35 YEARS. THEY HAD THE WRONG PEOPLE. THEY HAD THE WRONG CONCEPT. YOU KNOW I GOT NOMINATED FOR THREE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE'S. AND FOR ALL DIFFERENT REGIONS LIKE SERBIA, YOU KNOW TRADE DEALS, NORMALLY WE ARE DOING TRADE DEALS. ARE THEY ALWAYS KILLING EACH OTHER? FOR MANY DECADES. I SAID HOW DO YOU KNOW? THEY FIGHT EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME. TELL THEM WE WILL NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THEM. THEY WANT OUR BUSINESS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY BUSINESS UNLESS WE MAKE A DEAL WHERE THEY STOP KILLING EACH OTHER. IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR 40 YEARS. I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN FINDING FOR 400 YEARS. THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR A LONG TIME. ALL OF THE SUDDEN, TWO MONTHS AGO, THEY ARE IN THE OVAL OFFICE, HUGGING AND KISSING. THEY WERE SAYING THAT IS EASY. IT JUST MAKES SENSE. I SAY WHY DON'T THEY GET THEM TOGETHER? TELL THEM TO STOP FIGHTING. WE SAVE A LOT OF LIVES. THAT IS A GOOD THING. BUT WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT BLOOD ALL OVER THE SAND AND WE ARE NOT SPENDING MONEY TO DO IT EITHER. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT IS A VOTE FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. IN CONCLUSION, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD. WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA, THAT HAS LARGELY ALREADY BEGUN. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES AND BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL DEFEND RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, FREE SPEECH, THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. WE WILL END SURPRISED MEDICAL BILLING. IT KICKS IN ON JANUARY 1.

WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS.

CSPANDT2810202098	Donald Trump	2020-10-28	President Trump Campaign Rally in Goodyear, Arizona	Hello, Phoenix. Six days. Can you believe the six days from now we're going to win Arizona and we're going to win four more years in our great beautiful White House. A vote for me is a vote for massive tax cuts. Regulation cuts, fair trade, strong borders. Our second Amendment. We will save our Second Amendment on American energy independence. It's a vote to support our police, our military stand up to China, which we've been doing. They gave $28 billion to our farmers. That's very nice. Thank you very much, China. And it's your more products that are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus. The China plague is what it is and quickly ends the pandemic. Normal life, which is what we want. We just want normal life like we had seven months ago, will fully resume. And next year we will be the greatest economic power. We are going to be stronger than we've ever been before. And you see that all happening. Next year will be the best economic year in our country's history. And last year Waas and then we were interrupted. We were interrupted. It's called Make America Great. Again, again. They vote for Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe is a vote for the biggest tax hike in history. I've never seen this before. A man is campaigning on the fact that he's going to raise your taxes. I haven't seen Yeah, yeah, they're going to crush regulations that will be crushing. You have no idea what they wanna do. We took off more regulations than any administration in the history of our country. They are going to put those regulations back, and all they do is cause waste. And a lot of other problems slash Medicare and Social Security. And they want to abolish American energy. You know what he said? No fracking. He said no fracking until he went to Pennsylvania that he said, Maybe we can frack his people won't let him. Frank and Joe doesn't have any clue where he is. You know that. Where am I? Where am I? What state of my head? He's only got it wrong about seven times. Where am I? Is this Arizona or is this Nevada? Where am I? Tell me, where am I? Is this Iowa? 00 it's very hot. I know where I am. This is Florida. Isn't no Joe. No, Joe. A vote for Biden is a vote for open borders, offshoring jobs, Shredding the Second Amendment. Confiscating your guns on eliminating private health care. 180 million people on private health care. It's called bye bye on. They love their private health care. Biden and the Democrats Socialists will delay the vaccine, prolonged the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country on your state is open right? Your state is nice and open. Your state is nice. That Okay. Thank you. Bye. The governor did a good job. I don't know if you appreciate it, but he did a good job. You had a spike and he just sort of did what he had to do. And you stayed his fully open. Good job. He may be here. He may be in this crowd of about 25,000 people. He may be here. I may get lucky and introduced him a little while he is here. He's a great governor. This election is a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare. As long as I am president, America will never, ever be a socialist country. E am fighting for the dreams of all America's including million's of truly amazing. And they like me. My poll numbers are through the roof with Hispanic Americans, right? E. I always knew that like me, it's a big story. They say, What's going on? I just thought, What's going on with Trump in the Hispanics? What's going on with Trump? His poll numbers. They're getting very nervous. You know, our poll numbers are looking very good. We had one little upset this morning. We're doing very well in Wisconsin, right? I was there yesterday. We had 25,000 people. At least. I will tell you. It was called. I made one yesterday. Did three of these yesterday? Yeah. Yeah. Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry. They'll say the president was crying. I don't know. I don't know about what The president of Christ, but it's okay, but you know, that's the phrase. One of the greatest men in the country right here. Did you ever hear Did you ever hear that friends before? I don't think so. We have Mike Lee here too. We have Rand Paul here in Sergio and the King of Europe. We have right here. Brand. Did you ever hear that phrase for politicians, Redwood? Like that phrase I could tell you right now? Uh huh. Way got some great poles and we are getting great polls. We're doing great in Florida, doing great in North Carolina. Doing great, I think in Pennsylvania I think I think it's gonna be great. We wanted last time. First time in many years, Republican one we've done good, brought a lot of business there. There's a lot of business went back to Pennsylvania. So I think they appreciate it but haven't seen the numbers. They vote late, you know, They vote like on Tuesday. That's what they like. I like that, too. But we're doing good all over, and we're doing good in Wisconsin. We have a poll. Were one up in Wisconsin. Don't Don't clap yet today. The fake Washington Post, ABC. Now, you know, you think they'd come out that he's four down? He's five 17 down in Wisconsin. I don't. I had the same fraudsters here four years ago. They had me 12 down a week before the election, right. Remember that I was 12 down, ABC, Washington Post. Bad. I mean, just dishonest people. And we sent them a legal letter, and by the time we got to the election, were like, even I wonder what happened. But, you know, they interviewed slightly more Democrats and Republicans. We looked at it. I think there's some kind of a law that you have to do that they interviewed a few more like a number that you wouldn't even believe. I agree. I agree. I agree, but they're all sort of in that bag. They're all you know, ABC Terrible. NBC is probably the worst of all. It's called Con Casio and not com CEO and con cast because their cons it's a big con job. It's a big contract. You know, they spend all that money for public relations. And then I talked about him at the end of the public relations con job. How did you guys do today, please, On section 2. 30 Mike Lee. How are you doing? Section. You know what? What they're doing is a disgrace. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and they refused to talk about it. You got to do it. You gotta do it. I mean, it's crazy. They're getting away. What the big tech is getting away with. They will not allow anybody to even discuss it with me. They write false stories. They could do whatever they want. Section 2. 30 rand. I hope you're all looking at it. Okay. I hope you're all looking at it because there was a lot of stuff today, You know? They were up there and they were very nervous in front of the Senate. They were very nervous. I have to tell you that they were shaking up a little bit, because without Section 2 30 they don't even exist. They don't even exist. For 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed the American people, and he betrayed Hispanic Americans. Over the last four years, I've been delivering for Hispanic Americans like never before on Hispanic. American unemployment reached an all time low prior to the pandemic. It's crazy. I love you, too. Nobody knows what happened to fake news. They're going to look at all of them back there. That's a lot of that's a lot of fake news back then. Look at that. Those red lights just went off, you know, Anytime I refer to them, they turned the light off very quickly. They don't wanna have it broadcast what I call CNN. Bad names. Hispanic American families saw their network skyrocket by 64% and I'm sitting in the hottest sun I've ever felt. This is hot. My last stop. Also in your great state. It had a different problem. The sun was hot. I have never seen wind like that. It's lucky I don't need teleprompters like Sleepy Joe because the teleprompters were falling down. They were going all over the place I was getting a headache. I'm trying to look, but I have a good memory. I remember things unlike, unlike the sleepy one. You know, he's in a lit again. Do you know that, fellas? He's in a lid. You get these guys in a lit every single day lid that refers to a garbage can. They put the lid on the can. He's in his. He's in his basement. You know, by the way, I'd like to be in a basement. I'd like to be in some place. I'd like to be in a beautiful bedroom. Nice for a year and a half. Two years never come out the White House. But I'm your president. I have to I have to come out. I have to make nice to meet with way have to meet people. And I said, You know, this could be a little bit shaky, right? A lot of people, but we have no choice. And you probably haven't heard. But I caught it. I caught it. Did anybody know that I caught it? And then you get better and your immune and they say you're immune for a year. They used to say your immune forever. But when I got it, I said I'm immune. They said It's only for four months. I don't know what happened. They said You're immune for a lifetime, right? Remember until I had it once I had it. Now it's only up the four above, but I got better. Great doctors at the White House. We have great doctors, great doctors all over the country. I had doctors from all over the country. You know, one thing I learned quickly when you're the president and not feeling too good. I did feel great. You have more doctors than you've ever seen in your life before. I was like it was like a public place on. They were gathered around my bed. They said, What's the problem? I said, I don't know, Doc, but I'm not feeling too good on. I gotta get back on the trail. You know what the trail is, right? The campaign trail. I got to get back on the trail. Get me the hell out of here. Doc. Johns Hopkins was great. We have all the great hospitals represented. And I'll tell you, Walter Reed is incredible. I've seen what they do to the soldiers they come back so badly wounded, they fix them. Thank you. Thank you. Walter Reed is so great, but they're all around in this thing. Sir, I think you're gonna have to take it easy for a little while. And they gave me something called Regeneron. Do you ever hear of re General? And we're gonna make it available to everybody that needs it. Free, free, right? Free antibodies and all I know. And I don't want to give any credit to this drug. I want to say it was me because I'm in perfect physical condition at a very young I'm very young and I'm in perfect physical shape. Perfect. You know, I said that jokingly. I said that a couple of weeks ago. CNN fake news. CNN went crazy. He's not in perfect shape, but he's not young. They went crazy. They thought it was horrible, horrible, horrible statement way did a great job. And I would like to say that the anybody that what they gave me didn't help. But it probably did, because I woke up the next morning and I felt like Superman. I want Oh, I want to rip my shirt off just like Clark Kent. Anybody ever hear of Clark Kent? Just like the legendary clock at? Yes. You know, we're gonna win the election. You know that We're gonna win. This is not This is much more so than four years ago. I'm looking at some of our great senators. We're gonna win this election, We're gonna have a great victory. And a lot of people want to go out on Tuesday. They don't wanna go out early. It's called the Great Red Way. They always say, Sir, could you please ask them to go out on Monday? Sunday? You know, because you could go out now you control it, right? But I said they don't really want that. They want to go out. You know, they want to make it a little more convenient for you, but when those booths open up, you're gonna see something that probably has never seen before. You've never seen in Florida? They're not doing well. They had to get that lead that leads gonna be taken over. I think very, very quickly. The biggest problem we have is if they cheat with the balance. That's my biggest problem. That's the only thing. That's the only thing I worry about. If they cheat with the ballots, right, if they cheat with the ballots and you know they did find some of the garbage can from the military military ballots had the name Trump written, they wanted to go for Trump. They found them in the garbage can. Now, if they hundreds of thousands every day, you don't wake up and not read a story about it. Every day there's cheating with the ballots, and you have governors, Democrat governors that our players wiseguys, wiseguys, and it's a disgrace, you know, in Nevada we like Nevada, but you gotta governor there. That's a player. And even if you want to speak, they make it very hard to find a location. But we found one and 50,000 people showed up a couple of weeks. Latino homeownership is now at an all time high, all time high. And by the way, if you look in new houses, if you look at automobile production is hard to believe. It literally is superseding what we had prior to the pandemic, and nobody's even imagining that to bring even greater opportunity and prosperity toe Latino and Latino community. And I say the Latinos and I say the Hispanics and have a lot of friends. I say, What do you like better? They said You can call us anything The Latino community in Arizona and around the country today I'm announcing the American Dream Plan. Over the next four years, the American Dream Plan will bring more than two million new jobs. Two Hispanic communities create over a half a million new Hispanic owned small businesses, which will end up being large businesses. If I know you and I know you will, great businesspeople, great natural business people expand opportunities for federal contracting. It's gonna be much easier for you to get some of those jobs and increase access to capital by hundreds of billions of dollars. You're gonna be in great shape. You're gonna say I liked him very much. Now, if sleepy Joe gets said they're gonna ask him about, he's not gonna have a clue. He's not gonna be able to tell you this. More Hispanic Americans will be able to buy a home to afford quality health insurance and to raise their families in a beautiful, safe neighborhood on. I will provide school choice to every parent in America School choice Joe Biden would obliterate everything. Hispanic Americans have worked for. Wiping out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations, gutting your police departments and devastating your families with massive tax hikes. He will attack Catholic organizations. By the way, Hispanics, generally speaking, don't like that too much and band charter schools fund extreme late term abortion and surrender your country to the violent socialist mob. And you see that happening? How about Portland, right? You know how quick we could fix that? Mike Lee. We could fix that in about, what, 30 minutes, Right? The governor has to call up, he said, Maybe a little bit less. That's why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this election day. We're going to win a number that's never been won by Republican. And maybe maybe we're gonna beat the Democrats. That will be incredible. That will be. That means you're on your way to great business. In 2016 Arizona voted to fire our failed and corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first by, uh, taking a long time. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician. It's because I'm not a politics. And if I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for their constituents before. To show you how corrupt the Washington media is, I was just And did you say this? This was just revealed. It was just revealed that, you know, anonymous. You know, there's anonymous that everybody has been looking for, that law enforcement could have found early if they wanted Thio. But everybody was looking for anonymous. Turned out to be a low level staffer, a sleazebag who's never worked in the White House. Anonymous was a nobody, a disgruntled employee who was quickly removed from his job a long time ago, for they tell me incompetence. I don't know what for, but they tell me incompetence. You know where he works now he works to CNN. Can you believe works? In CNN, he wrote a phony book. It was just basically, if you read, if you heard about Anonymous was like somebody that was right next to me, I thought it might have been hope. Hicks was right. I thought I might have been Jared. I thought it might have been Mike Lee. I was worried from the great state of Utah. I was extremely worried about Rand Paul. Maybe it was Rand. This guy said, Low level low life that I don't know. I have no idea who he is other than I got to see him a little while ago on television on. I think they threw him out a long time ago. His phony book was just based on fake articles and left wing outlets. He worked with the Listen to this, the fake news New York Times, right? And he's an employee of a Google. He works for Google. Isn't that nice? Go. The people that you guys are looking at right now, the whole thing was just one more giant hoax from the Washington swamp and a corrupt special interest group. I'll tell you what. This guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted. He should be prosecuted. Yeah, yeah. The left wing media on the swamp are doing everything in their power to try and stop us. And by the way, we're here and they're not, and their heads are exploding, their heads arrested. The media has been peddling their lives for the last four years, and they've had a lot to say. But in the meantime, here we are and we're gonna win the greatest election. And you know what? This election is more important than any election in the history of our country, including the last one. And I never thought I'd say that, But you get the last word on November 3rd, you could ensure that when the results pour in the corrupt media or they're gonna have Are you guys ready for this? Look at all of them. Look at all of those corrupt paper. Look at all of those corrupt people, the corrupt media. I used to call them the fake news. I thought it was one of the great terms I made. But it's not strong enough. The corrupt media is bowing their heads in shame, not cheering for sleepy Joe. I can't imagine why they want him. I mean, I can't figure it that one. I can't figure, but it's up to you. This is your country, and you have to save and create a great, beautiful pathway for your country. Get out and vote. You're going to show up in record numbers, vote for America and against the corrupt media and against the swamp. And nobody ever told me the swamp was that deep or that vicious swamp creatures. They are there and some of the worst creatures in the swamp of the rhinos. We got some rhinos, but they are a dying breed. They are a dying breed. They're getting a little tired. They're getting a little tired of calling it wrong. It's incredible. Under Biden's cruel and senseless lockdowns, countless Americans will die from suicide drug over. Does deferred medical care, alcoholism, abuse. So many different things to cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We would say that we talked about that. Rand right Brand knows that's what happens. What happens to a society? What happens to a country? You take a look at Michigan, where she has everybody locked down. We want a case in the Supreme Court, Michigan. The constitutionality we wanted. They said it was unconstitutional, but in the meantime, she goes on with the appeals. The only one that's free to roam in Michigan is her husband. It's the only one he's allowed to go boating and do whatever he wants. Way gotta open up, Pennsylvania. We gotta open up. North Carolina got open up. California got open up. New York. If I lived in California, New York, Illinois, I'd vote for Trump. Yeah, and you know what I used to say? And it's come so well, our relationship because of criminal justice, reform and prison reform and all the other things with the African American community. I used to say, What the hell do you have to lose? And they agreed with me. And we're doing incredible the relationship. What we've done is incredible. What we've done is incredible, but I say the same thing that the people living in New York, California, Illinois, automatic wins for the Democrats. I say, Vote for Trump. We'll cut your taxes. We'll get you back. We'll bring it back, I say, What the hell do you have to lose? Vote for Trump Those three big space. You know, it's tough when you have those three big states automatically. It's like automatically put into it Doesn't matter who runs, no matter who. If we brought back the late great Abraham Lincoln, New York, California, Illinois. So we gotta run the gauntlet. We gotta run coast, right? We And that's what happened last time we won Florida and we won. South Carolina. We won Georgia. We won North Carolina, remember? That was gonna be there. Firewall. That didn't work out too well for them. And we won Pennsylvania. And we just ran the coast, didn't we? Was that a beautiful? Was that? That was one of the most exciting evenings. Mike Lee, right? Mike Lee, Utah. And we won Utah, right? We want a mall. We want them all we had. They said there is no way to to 70. Remember, to 17 8 to 70. There is no way for Donald Trump. This was a five o'clock before the polls close. There is no way for Donald Trump to get 2 to 70. Like we're wasting our time. I said I don't think so, but they turned out to be right. We couldn't get 2 to 70 but we did get to 306. All right, did you? There is no way. Remember that one, Ohio. Ohio is great. One by eight points they thought were gonna tie. They thought it was going to be close. you know, close and they called immediately. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio, and then they said, not only won, he's won by eight points. They said That is that That was the beginning. They said, What's going on here? We're gonna have a bigger surprise in six days, is there? If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school. No graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas and no fourth of July together. Other than that, you have a wonderful life. I can't see anybody. But that's all right. You have a wonderful He wants everyone thio and it's not really again. It's not him. I'm using this thing. It's it. But it's not him. Hey, did it? Pop? He is a puppet. He's a puppet. He's a beauty, I'll tell you. Look, look, look, I shouldn't say this because it's very disrespectful, but I don't care, because he's not a nice We have some historians, your true American historians. Here he is the worst candidate ever to run in the history of a of a presidential election. So worse. That's why there's tremendous pressure on me. I wish it was a good candidate at least if you lost, you could say, Hey, you lost to a good candidate. How the hell do you lose to a guy like that? I don't care. I don't care. We're gonna win. We gotta win. You're gonna lose your country. If you know what, The worst in presidential politics now you're gonna lose your country. It will be a disaster. He's not gonna be running things you have, Kamala. Kamala. You know, if you don't pronounce your name exactly right, she gets very angry at you and then she starts. You know what she does when she gets angry? She starts laughing like she did on 60 Minutes. Uncontrollable laughs. That means she's angry. Sleepy Joe wants to keep everyone locked down forever. Including young people, which will cause enormous harm to Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, men, everybody. The Biden plan will crush you and your family. My plan will crush the virus and make our strong. We're gonna be stronger, stronger than ever before. Our country will be stronger than ever before. Biden is the candidate of layoffs, lockdowns and misery. I am the candidate of jobs, vaccines and prosperity. Our early and aggressive action saved over two million American lives. Way saw way had to make a decision. We closed it up. We understood it. We say, Remember, we're supposed to be 2.2 million people were going to die. We started doing ventilators. We didn't have ventilators. We became the king of ventilate all over the world. We're now sending ventilators all over the world. We did a great job. We weren't acknowledged. We have governors saying what a great job we did. Everybody was saying what a great job we did. A great job wasn't acknowledged and that's okay. But the generals, the Admiral's Mike Pence, all of these people that worked on this, they should be acknowledged. We did a job the likes of which nobody thought. Remember Joe Biden with the H one n one, which he always reverses H one N one, right? He goes in one h one, I said, No jokes. The swine flu, right? It's the swine flu. He was a disaster, his chief of staff said. They didn't know what the hell they were doing, and now he's always telling me I should have acted quicker except when I closed our country to China because it was so heavily affected and Europe he was totally against it, he said. It's, he said, xenophobic. I said, Do me a favor, Give me a definition Joe. He couldn't do that because he didn't He had no idea. He had no idea what it meant. But here are some of the governor's talking about what a great job we've all done. We've done. But what a great job we've done in fighting the China virus, Right? Called the president. He's quickly gotten on the line. When we asked to get support for that mercy ship in Southern California, he was able to direct that in real time. What the federal government did working with states was a phenomenal accomplishment. We got 2000 of these vehicle field medical sites that are up almost all operational now in the state because of his support. Those of the fax his team has been on it. I know a team when they're on it. I know a team. When they're not on it, his team is on it. They've been responsive late at night, early in the morning, wear working very well with FEMA Region tool with the army Corps of Engineers building four field hospitals. That was a decision the president himself took, and I'm grateful for it. These were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilization, and the federal government stepped up. We needed help, and they were there, he said. Everything that I could have hoped for on. We had a very long conversation on every single thing he said they followed through on. We've gotta have double the number of ventilators that we requested for that area of the state, and in fact, we got them in, frankly, short order. Have we lost anyone because we didn't have a bed or we didn't have a ventilator or we didn't have health care staff know that the president was extending support for new swabs. So conversation, commitment, promise made promise kept. Yeah. Now, to be fair, maybe Biden's not telling us because he's forgotten his own plants. Watch Biden staff quickly swoop in to shuffle him along during a quickie escaped the basement trip to Pennsylvania. Here's the deal. One of the things that that is important is that keep in mind, although they're gonna vote on hard. Yeah, that was terrifying. What kind of country we're gonna be four more years of George Georgia. He gonna find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're gonna be we're gonna be in a different world. 56% of Americans said that they were better off today than they were four years ago Would have been under the Obama Biden administration. So why should people who feel that they are better off today under the Trump administration vote for you? Well, if they think that they probably shouldn't, I think 54% American people were better off economically today than they were on our administration. Well, their memory is not very good. Quite frankly, a few moments later, I'm running is a proud Democrat for the Senate Shall vote visit. I will, com slash Ohio Got in trouble when we're running again. The senator who is a Mormon. This is the governor. Okay, Well, their memory is not very good. Quite frankly, it saves a lot of words. In fact, I couldn't go home now. Goodbye, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. We only bring those very expensive boards to a very special group of people. It's quite costly, but it does save a lot of talk, doesn't it? Joe Biden has surrendered his party to the rage filled Socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists. The Democrats know that Biden is just a vessel to implement their socialist takeover, and that's what they're trying to do. We can't let that happen. That's why his running mate is the number one most liberal member of the U. S. Senate, a sponsor of Insane This insane, a green New deal. $100 trillion. I mean 100 Children. If we made. If we had the greatest 100 years in history, we couldn't pay $100 trillion thing was made up by a O. C. Plus three who I don't know if she's ever even studied the environment. Has she ever taken? Of course, on the environment, I doubt it. Biden and his party have spent the entire year inciting violence and hatred against our police are great police. Last night, the city of Philadelphia was ransacked by violent Bob's of Biden supporters. For a second night in a row, we could have stopped that that one we could have stopped in 12 minutes. Stores were looted. Nearly a dozen people were shot and dozens of officers were injured would have been so easy. We're waiting for a call. We'll send in the federal government, have to get a call. We'll send in the federal government. We'll solve that problem so quickly. In Seattle, they took over a big part of the city. We said, Finally, we have to go in. We didn't have the permit. We were doing it anyway. We let them know we're going in as soon as we let him go. We're going in tomorrow morning. We told them a soon as we did that. They held up their hands and they said, We're going home in Minneapolis. We went in a week and a half later and I give the governor some credit. He said, Let's go. But it should have been a week earlier Week and a half earlier and they formed a line and it ended in 25 minutes. It was all over Minneapolis. That's why we're gonna win the great state of Minnesota. We're gonna win Minnesota because of the for two reasons. We're gonna win because of that. And Ilhan Omar, we're gonna win because I hurt, too. How the hell does she get elected. She does not like our country. I could tell you. Biden and Harris stand with the writers and the Vandals. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement, and I think I've been endorsed by almost every major police group in the United States. And during the debate, I asked him. I said, Joe, who endorsed you? Any of the law enforcement groups he couldn't name one couldn't name one thing I said. You say the words law enforcement say the words Law and order. He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. Number one. He couldn't remember the two words in conjunction. But more importantly, he didn't wanna lose the radical left, because if he says those words, he loses the radical left this Election day, you must stop the anti American rattle. People say. I mean these air radicals from delivering the far left and thundering defeat. You have to deliver them a defeat like they haven't seen before. Not just a little one. We don't wanna win this close. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. Last night we learned that Joe was intimately involved in the Biden families, corrupt business deals with China while he shipped American jobs to China by the thousands. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, you win. Arizona wins in America wins, right? And you know that as Bigas. That story was last night, not one mention on social media. Not one mention in big tech. Not one mention in any of the major outlets. Not one mention on any of the networks. Onley. Fox had it. Fox had it. Tucker did a good job. Shawn did a good job. Laura did a good job. Now one mention. So it's not freedom of the press. It's You know what? We have suppression of the press. We have thought This is not. This is no longer freedom of the press. This'd is suppression of the press, and we have some very powerful people right here. We cannot let this go on its suppression. It's unthinkable what's going on. And yet they'll right the little this thing. If somebody else does anything or doesn't have to do it, they make up fake stories. We're thrilled to be joined by somebody that's done a great job and been your great governor. Doug Ducey. Done a great job. Thank you, Doug. Great job. A woman who's running for the Senate. Currently a senator respected by everybody. Her opponent wants to terminate your second Amendment. Martha McSally. Martha here. Right, Great. Martha. Right, Mother, come up. Just their sweat. Fast fares. Come on, quick! You got one minute. One minute, Martha sake. They don't want to hear this. Martha, come on. Let's go! Quick, Quick, quick, quick. Come on, let's go. Right, I'm coming. Thank you, President Trump, Arizona. We are ground zero to save the country. We have six days in just a few hours. President Trump and the country are counting on us to send him back to the White House. Four more years, everything is on the line and my race is about the Senate majority. Everything I wore the uniforms for and all you veterans did is on the line. Everything is on the line. We've got to bring it home. Arizona in my race will decide the direction of the country The radical left can take over in the Senate. So if you want someone who's gonna be Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer's 51st vote to take away our freedoms and our Second Amendment rights and all the things the president talked about. Then you got a guy named Mark Kelly. But if you want a fighter, if you want to continue to have a fighter who is proud to work with President Trump for the Great American comeback and strong military and secure our borders and your second Amendment right, then I'm your girl. Arizona. I'm your girl. Both. Trump McSally. Let's save the country. God bless you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Very important. And, you know, you could think of a lot of things, but think about your Second Amendment. His sole function is determinate your Second Amendment and all of them, that's what they want to do. And they're in lock step. A friend of mine, a great senator. Somebody that has extraordinary common sense. It's one of the reasons he's a successful man at what he does. Senator Rand. Paul. Okay, find Brad. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on, come on. Thank you, Mike. Wow. Good job. Thank you very much. Rand and Mike want a job. Thank you. That's why they're successful. Senators and respected by everybody. Thank you. We have another great friend. I think he's going to be replacing Nancy Pelosi soon. I really believe House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy come up. Kevin, Where's Kevin? Come up. He's going to replace Craziness is he's an incredible guy, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin McCarthy. Thank you, Kevin. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Thank you. Right. Okay, right. So two people that have fought hard love your state. They're tough, they're brilliant. And they are warriors. Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko. Where are you? Look at you. No, thanks, Andy. Thanks, Debbie. A friend of mine, A lot of people say one of the most powerful men in Europe. Nigel Farage. Yes. Come on up, Nigel. He's a very non controversial person too, right? That's what we like. Come on, Nigel. He's very shy. Thank you, Nigel. That's something. Wow. Thank I'm glad I called him up. I'm glad I could Thank you very much, Nigel. That's something he's responsible for. A lot of things that have happened over in Europe. Very positive things to thank you very much. A friend of mine who is a brilliant, brilliant gentleman. He loves fights. He just loves fighting. He's somebody that's made a lot of money with fighting. A lot of people say, Let's not fight. But he disagrees. He owns that He's the head of the UFC. You know what that is? Dana White. The great Dana White. Thank you, Dana. Thank you guys something. I'll tell you what a job he's done. State treasure. Kimberly Yee. Kimberly. Kimberly, Where is Kimberly? Thank you, Kimberly. Good job you're doing. How are the finances? Okay, you're doing well. Good. Maricopa. County Supervisor Clint Hickman. Thank you. Click the job. Let GOP chair. She's tough, she's smart and she's with us. And she's always been with us. She works hard. Kelli Ward? Yeah, he's great. It is great. So thank you all very much. I was very interesting. I didn't think you'd have anyone speak, but it was one after another. I'm glad they did it right. That was great. We don't usually do. That usually gets a little boring when people speak. And this group was a hell of a group. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Together we built the greatest economy in history and now we're doing it again. We increased middle class family income over $5 more than five times agains under the last administration. After the virus arrived, we passed $3 trillion in economic relief and saved over 50 million jobs. Many in your state, many, many in your state, we've experienced the smallest contraction and the fastest recovery economically by far of any major nation in the world. That's a big thing. And our numbers, they're gonna be coming out very shortly very soon. G d, p and the Fed in Atlanta just made a prediction. They said 35%. Now I'll take 25 right now 35 would be many times larger than the largest number we've ever had. GDP. The all important GDP 35 is what they predict and let's see what happens. And it will be three days before the election. So I'll make you a deal. If the numbers a bad number, you don't have to vote for me, okay? But I think it's gonna be incredible if you look at housing starts. If you look at automobile and all the productivity's that we've had. If you look at hiring 11.4 million people over a short period of time under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History, and we built over 400 miles of New Wall, including 200 miles right here in the state of Arizona. 200. It goes down very deep and it goes up very high. You know, they're to reason. It goes down deep. One is toe, hold it up and the other is for tunnels. You never had it so good and your numbers of fantastic. Joe Biden has pledged to open borders. He even said, Maybe we'll rip down the wall. I don't think that's gonna happen. He wants open borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country. His plan would completely eliminate our borders by implemented nationwide catch and release. You catch him a killer, a rapist, whoever it is and you release him into our country. And then in the debate, he said. Oh, but they come back for trial. No, they don't, Joe. They don't come back. You don't see him again. This would trigger a tsunami of illegal immigration from every corner all over the world. He's also pledged to and you know what he wants to do. Give free health care and mass amnesty for all illegal border crosses, bankrupting your Medicare and your Social Security systems? I don't think so. And you know, we all have a heart. We want to take care of people, but everybody all over the world would pour into our country. Way wouldn't be able to do it. Under Biden's plan, you'll have no borders, no healthcare, no middle class. You'll have no country. Frankly, we invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including nearly $1 billion to build the world's most advanced guided missiles. Guess where we're building them right here in Arizona. Okay, We also passed V A Choice and VA accountability thing said that you'll never get him done, sir. You'll never get it done. We got them both done. Accountability where we can fire bad people that work at the VA that don't love our vets way. Take care of our vets And now they don't have to wait for two weeks. Three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks Now they go on if they can't get good service. We have great doctors in the VA, but if you can't get the service, you go to a local doctor, local hospital. We take care of the bill. We have a 91% approval rating now the highest ever by far with our best. We took 100% of the Isis caliphate and we killed the leader of Isis al Baghdadi. We took out the world's top terrorist Salomon. He is dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion for nothing for nothing. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and even got it and even got it built, right? I even got it built, Got it built for, Supposed to cost $2 billion. We did it for 500,000, a slight costs under UN that was called the cost under. And you don't see that in government too much. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in about two hours. Every president promised these things, but they never got him done. A lot of pressure on people when you have that Jerusalem, Golan Heights. A lot of pressure, but we got it done. And instead of never ending wars were forging peace in the Middle East. We have four g p and I've said this and I've said it a lot, but I meet it with every breath. I've dunmore in 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden is done in 47 years. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and the American dream. You know, Abraham Lincoln was a great Republican. Just remember that I couldn't be more presidential than any president other than possibly Abraham Lincoln. When he's wearing the hat. That's a tough now. He was a great Republican. Over the next four years, in conclusion, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all that's already started. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States right here in Arizona. Yeah. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty, free speech, the right to life and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment, We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. So what? We're and the 2.5 trillion all made in the Yusa. We have the finest missiles and rockets and tanks and submarines and jets. The F 35 stealth. You can't see it, sir. You can't see it. That makes it good. I said, I think that makes it good. What do I know? But I know if you're the opponent and you can't see the jet, you know what? You got a little advantage there. Now we have the best in the world and our nuclear arsenal has been refurbished and restocked and hope to God we never have to use it. We will end surprise. Medical billing require price transparency already completed goes into effect bigger than healthcare. You watch on January 1st, Lower drug prices, even Mawr. First year in 52 years that drug prices prescription went down. But I instituted what's called the favorite nations laws we pay the most in the world. We're now going to be tied for the lowest price in the world. We will protect your Social Security and your Medicare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman in the moon on the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. On NASA, NASA is now again the preeminent space station. There's nothing like what we have, what a job they've all done, including our great Vice President, Mike Pence. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our Children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great American flag way will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. Yeah, For years you had a president who apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Arizona from Tombstone Thio, Tucson, right, Tucson. Does anybody come from Tucson? My friend comes from Tucson, from Messa to Yuma, from Prescott to right here in Good Year Goodyear. We inherit the legacy of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their hearts, sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever. Toe walk the face of this great, wonderful, beautiful planet. Arizona is where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday became American legends. It's where the Great American West became the American dream, and Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, miners and ranchers, cowboys and cattle hands, marshals and lawmen came the frontier brave the blazing sun like I'm doing right now and showed the entire world how the West was won. They help make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive. We're going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning. Winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Arizona, go out and vote, go out and vote way have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. Proud. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Go out and vote. Thank you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477460-1/president-trump-campaign-rally-goodyear-arizona	President Trump delivered remarks at a campaign rally in Goodyear, Arizona.

[CHEERING] NICE HAT. I WANT TO KNOW, HAS WORN THIS HAPPY FOR? [CHEERING] AM I ALLOWED TO DO IT? I'LL DO IT IF YOU WANT. OTHERWISE , [CHEERING] [CHEERING] WHAT A GUY. BETTER? NICE HAT. YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE HAT. WE'VE CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THEN WE HAD THE PLAGUE COME FROM CHINA AND NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. BIZARRE UNBELIEVABLE. BY THE WAY, YOU WILL HAVE A VERY BIG NUMBER. A LOT OF YOU WANT TO WAIT ANYWAY ANYWAY. IT WILL BE A GREAT, GREAT, RED WAVE. [CHEERING] BEFORE THAT HAPPENED, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THE ATLANTA PREDICTED A VERY BIG NUMBER, BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED PROBABLY ON THE FIRST, MAYBE A DAY BEFORE THE FIRST. IF THE NUMBER IS NOT BIG, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO VOTE. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MAYBE THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. GGP. THAT IS OUR BIG NUMBER. I'M TAKING A CHANCE WHEN I SAY YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME. WHO HERE IS VOTING FOR TRUMP? [CHEERING] THANK YOU. [CHEERING] THANK YOU. [CHEERING] ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD. ARE YOU WAITING UNTIL TUESDAY? [CHEERING] IS ANYBODY SENDING IN ABOUT IT? OR YOU DOING IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY? [CHEERING] I JUST DID THAT. WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO VOTE. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR SLEEPY JOE BIDEN? [CROWD BOOING] I HAD LEADER OF THE COUNTRY CALL UP, TOUGH LEADER. THEY WOULDN'T, IF IT'S GOOD, THEY WOULDN'T REPORTED. HE SAID I HOPE BIDEN DOESN'T WIN BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS FLIPPING. A KILLER. I HOPE HE DOESN'T WIN BECAUSE HE'S SLEEPY. I SAID YOU HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY AND BIDEN DEPRESSION. YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION, LIKE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. MAYBE 1929. WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, BUT REGULATION BACK ON AND REMEMBER THIS, GET RID OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. REMEMBER THIS. [CROWD BOOING] PRO-LIFE, ANYBODY PRO-LIFE? [CHEERING] THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ELECTION, IN MY OPINION, AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IT, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING] THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN LOCKDOWN. YOU CLOSE IT UP. IT'S REALLY SOMETHING. WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM DREAM, YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, IT WAS ALL TOGETHER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HE'S GETTING CALLED FOR PEOPLE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEN WE HAD A MAN THAT CAME IN, WE WENT BACK TO WORK SAVED 2 MILLION PEOPLE, 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE THAN THAT. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE, THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES, OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERING] THAT'S WHY THEY WANT IT BACK. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE DREAMS OF ALL AMERICANS INCLUDING MILLIONS OF TRULY AMAZING HISPANIC AMERICANS. [CHEERING] WHOSE HISPANIC? [CHEERING] OTHERS ARE SHOCKED, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. THEY ARE REPORTING ON IT, I SAID I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. I ALWAYS LIKED HISPANICS BUT THEY ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND ME. THEY'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS SO THE POLLS FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE THE HIGHEST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN BUT IT COULD BE THAT WE ARE GOING TO STOP, TOP THEM. ONCE WE TOP THEM, FORGET ABOUT IT. WE'VE REALLY GOT THE BALL. BY THE WAY, WHO SOUGHT THE DEBATE THE OTHER DAY? [CHEERING] NINETY-ONE , NINE. I DON'T KNOW THE RULES. THAT'S NOT BAD. [CHEERING] I GET ANGRY AT THE MEDIA. HE ADMITTED RIGHT AT THE END, I SAID DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T LIKE IT, JOE? WELL, IT'S AMAZING. YOU HAVE A WATCH? HOW ABOUT COLOMBO? RIGHT AT THE END. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING FIVE DAYS AND THEN THEY HAD TO GO TO PENNSYLVANIA WHERE FRACKING IS A BIG DEAL. HOW ABOUT TEXAS? YOU THINK THEY LIKE HIM IN TEXAS? NO GUNS, SECOND AMENDMENT. NO RELIGION. THEN I HEAR, TRUMP HAS A ONE POINT LEAD IN TEXAS. I DON'T THINK SO. I USED TO HEAR THIS FOUR YEARS AGO ALL THE TIME. HE CANNOT WIN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. HE WON BY EIGHT POINTS. [CHEERING] TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, HE CANNOT WIN TEXAS UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES. HE CANNOT WIN TEXAS. HE WON BY I DON'T KNOW, A LOT. I DON'T KNOW. REMEMBER THE GUY FROM UTAH? IS A SPECIALIST IN UTAH, HE WOULD WIN UTAH. EVEN HILLARY, CROOKED HILLARY BE THAT GUY. NICE SHAVED HEAD, NICE GUY. REMEMBER HIS NAME? I REMEMBER HIS NAME. ANOTHER RHINO. [CHANTING] I DIDN'T START IT. [CHANTING] I'M AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. EVERY TIME, HE STARTED IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MENTION THEIR NAME. DISGRACEFUL, DEPLORABLE. HE REDEEMABLE. THEY SAID DEPLORABLE, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER SPEECH WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE, SHE CAME OUT AND SAID GLOBAL BUT SHE ALSO SAID YOU REDEEMABLE. TO SHOW YOU WHAT I KNOW, SHE USED THAT WORD, HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS DEPLORABLE BUT WHOEVER HER SPEECH WRITER IS, I DON'T WANT HIM OR HER. THAT WAS A DISASTER BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THAT BAD. THE NEXT DAY I SHOWED UP AT A RALLY, EVERYBODY SAID I AM A DEPLORABLE. OH BOY. SHE WAS A LOT SMARTER THAN SLEEPY JOE BUT THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON. THEY ARE MORE DESPERATE. THEY ARE TOTALLY DESPERATE. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES, COMING OFF THE STAGE YESTERDAY, HE SAW THAT HE CALLED ME GEORGE. HE THOUGHT I WAS GEORGE. HE CALLED ME GEORGE. [LAUGHTER] UNBELIEVABLE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS HAPPY OR IF I WASN'T BECAUSE HE CALLED ME , YOU KNOW, HIS WIFE WAS STANDING NEXT TO HIM AND SHE'S LOOKING LIKE, YOU COULD SHE WAS UNDER GREAT, GREAT STRESS. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THESE SUCKERS ARE MOVING. ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T NEED A TELEPROMPTER? [CHEERING] [CHEERING] THEY ARE MOVING LIKE CRAZY. THEY ARE MOVING LIKE CRAZY. THAT'S OKAY WITH ME. [CHANTING] WE WANT TRUMP EXCAVATION.! WE WANT TRUMP! [CHANTING] AND I LOVE YOU. I DO. [CHEERING] THAT'S THE PHRASE, AND THEY SAY IT, NOBODY'S EVER HEARD, WE ALL LIKED RONALD RAGAN BUT NOBODY EVER SAID WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU. YOU WOULDN'T GET CROWDS LIKE THIS. IF RONALD REAGAN, WHO I CONSIDERED TO BE TOP-NOTCH, IF HE CAME HERE, HE'D HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE, LEGITIMATELY. HE WOULD GO TO A BALLROOM AND THEY WOULD BE TWO OR 300 PEOPLE. THAT'S THE STANDARD. TWENTY-FIVE, 30, 35000 PEOPLE. [CHEERING] AT LEAST SOME OF THESE CROWDS, WE WERE PACKED IN FLORIDA AND ALL THESE PLACES. AT LEAST SOME OF THE CROWDS, LOOK AT THEM, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE END. IF THEY WERE LEGITIMATE, THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT ON. THEY NEVER SHOW IT ON CAMERA. [CHEERING] THEY NEVER SHOW IT. THEY DON'T LIKE TO SHOW IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO SHOW? BARACK OBAMA YESTERDAY, THEY MADE THE MISTAKE, THE CAMERA SLIPPED AND THEY SHOWED HIS CROWD, ABOUT 20 PEOPLE THERE APPROXIMATELY. WHICH WAS ABOUT TEN PEOPLE MORE THAN SLEEPY JOE HAD YESTERDAY. [LAUGHTER] WE WERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU SAW THAT. WE HAD THREE RALLIES, IT WAS INCREDIBLE. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. JOE WAS IN HIS BASEMENT AND YOU THOUGHT. HIS HAND, THEY SAY SLEEPY JOE, WE HAVE TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE. WE GOT TO MOVE YOU. HE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. THEY PUT A LID ON. A LID FOR GARBAGE CANS. [LAUGHTER] THEY PUT A LID ON. HE HAD THE LEAD AGAIN TODAY. HE HAS A LID EVERY DAY. THEN HE SAID, HE DOESN'T WANT BIG CROWDS. REALLY? BECAUSE OF COVID. HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY. WHY DID HE CHEAT SO MUCH WITH HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? REMEMBER WE DID THE TEACHER, WHERE IS HUNTER? NOW WE HAVE THE LAPTOP FROM HELL HELL. THE GREATEST LAPTOP I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY REFUSED TO LOOK AT IT. THE WORST. NOBODY HAS EVERYTHING EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. EXCEPT FOR ANTHONY. [LAUGHTER] MAYBE ANTHONY IS EVEN WORSE. ANTHONY, THAT WAS NOT GOOD. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, I'VE BEEN DELIVERING THE HISPANIC AMERICANS MESSAGE LIKE THEY HAVEN'T HEARD FOR A LONG TIME. [CHEERING] FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. [CHEERING] SCHOOL CHOICE, BIG DEAL. HISPANIC OWNED BUSINESSES. WE HAVE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE HERE. I KNOW SOME OF THEM. INCREDIBLE, ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE. LET ME RECOVER MY EARS FOR A SECOND. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] WHOEVER DID THIS MICROPHONE, DON'T PAY THEM. [LAUGHTER] HAVE A REPUTATION FOR NOT PAYING PAYING, IT IS A FALSE REPUTATION. WHEN SOMEONE DOES A LOUSY JOB LIKE A MICROPHONE THAT'S NO GOOD FOR TELEPROMPTERS THAT FLY WITH THE WIND. [LAUGHTER] I SAY DON'T PAY THEM. BUT WE LOVE OUR INCREDIBLE HISPANIC MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM. [CHEERING] WE'VE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST HISPANIC AMERICANS, UNEMPLOYMENT EVER RECORDED. NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE ARE GETTING BACK TO THOSE NUMBERS AGAIN. THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS, 11.4 MILLION, A RECORD PEOPLE WERE HIRED. JOE BIDEN WOULD OBLITERATE EVERY SINGLE THING WE'VE DONE, HE IS LOOKING TO DO THAT. HE'S LOOKING TO OBLITERATE TAX CUTS. SO WE GAVE TAX CUTS THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY, HE WANTS TO END THE TAX CUT. WE WANT TO END THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. $1000 CHILD. WIPING OUT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LOCKDOWNS, REGULATIONS, GETTING YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND DEVASTATING YOUR FAMILIES MASSIVE TAX HIKES. THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN. [CHEERING] HE WILL ATTACK RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND HIS RUNNING MATE, THE MOST LIBERAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS. SHE MAKES BERNIE SANDERS LOOK LIKE A SUPER CONSERVATIVE. WE WANT TO KNOW, WHO ARE THE JUDICIAL NOMINEES? WHO ARE THEY? WILL YOU PUT ON THE COURT? THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURTS. OUR NOMINEE. AMY. RIGHT? [CHEERING] FIGHTING WANTS TO BAN CHARTER SCHOOLS. EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. LATE-TERM, EVEN BEYOND LATE-TERM. YOU SAW THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE CHILD IS BORN AND THEN THEY MAKE A DECISION AS THE EXECUTION OF THE CHILD. YOU SAW THAT. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. BIDEN TOTALLY SUPPORTS HIM AND SURRENDER YOUR COUNTRY TO THE VIOLENT SOCIALIST MOB, TAKE A LOOK AT PHILADELPHIA LAST NIGHT. WE OFFERED TO GO IN, OFFERED TO GO IN AND THEY SAID STAND BACK, STAND BACK THE POLICE WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I THINK THEY ENDORSED ME, TOO. ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS ENDORSED ME. THAT'S WHY WE ARE GOING TO WIN A RECORD SHARE OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN HISTORIC SHARE OF WOMEN. REMEMBER LAST TIME? [CHEERING] HE WILL NOT GET WOMEN. REMEMBER? [CHEERING] HE WILL NOT GET WOMEN. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE DID VERY WELL WITH WOMEN. YOU KNOW WELL? THEY WANT SECURITY, THEY WANT SAFETY. IF THEY ARE FROM SUBURBIA, SUBURBAN WOMEN, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT? THEY WANT SECURITY AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS DESTROYED. I ENDED THE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD DESTROY THEM. [CHEERING] BUT I AM NOT JUST RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN, I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE LEFT WING MOB AND LEFT WING MEDIA. THE BIG TECH GIANT AND I'M ALSO RUNNING AGAINST THE RHINOS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A RHINO IS? A RHINO MAY BE THE LOWEST FORM OF HUMAN LIFE. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF THE OTHERS MORE THAN THE RHINOS. DO YOU KNOW WHY? [CHEERING] [CHEERING] THAT PLANE WAS ABOUT FOUR DAYS OLD. BRAND-NEW EQUIPMENT. [CHEERING] WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. LOOK AT THAT. HE'S TRYING TO SHOW OFF FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT IS ONE OF OURS. GOT TO BE CAREFUL. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT THE SAME FOR YOU, THEY LECTURE YOU ON OPEN BORDERS. WE ARE JUST NOW COMPLETING. VERY SOON MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT. [CHEERING] THEY LECTURE YOU ON EVERYTHING. I LOVE THAT SOUND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH TO GET THOSE SUCKERS UP THERE. I HAD TO GET THE MONEY FROM THE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERING] LOOK AT THAT. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! THEY GAVE THE PRESIDENT A LITTLE DISPLAY. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHANTING] HOW ABOUT THAT? I WONDER IF THE FAKE NEWS CAUGHT THAT. DID YOU SEE THAT? THEY NEVER TURNED THE CAMERA. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW ANYTHING THAT'S GOOD. THAT WAS SOMETHING. WE ARE TRYING TO GET ATTENTION WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OVER HERE. THEY GOT MY ATTENTION EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY HIGH BUT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS THE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE. I LOVE IT. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET DEMOCRATS TO PAY FOR THAT STUFF. THEY DON'T REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. THEY SUPPORT LOCKDOWNS WHILE JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. THEY KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO TEACH IN SCHOOL? WE DON'T WANT TO TEACH THAT IN SCHOOL. WE ENDED THAT. FAMILIES HAVE PRIVATE TUTORS. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS, SECOND AMENDMENT. SECOND AMENDMENT IS SO UNDER SIEGE. BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. NOTHING WILL BE CHANGED. I DON'T SEE THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA OR NEVADA, DON'T WORRY. I JUST LEFT NEVADA, BY THE WAY. I'LL BE BACK THERE VERY SOON. [CHEERING] THEY ALL HAVE ARMED GUARDS. WE HAVE TO TELL THESE PEOPLE, FROM NOW ON, NO MORE ARMED GUARDS. LET'S OUT LAW THE GUARDS. HOW ABOUT NANCY PELOSI? SHE GOES TO SAN FRANCISCO. [CROWD BOOING] SHE WANTS TO GET HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR REDONE IN SHE ENDS UP WITH A TOTAL TRUMP SUPPORTER AS THE OWNER OF THE BEAUTY PARLOR. [CHEERING] I LIKE THAT WOMAN. I'M GOING TO GO AND HAVE MY HAIR DONE BY THAT WOMAN. SHE WAS GREAT. WITH YOUR VOTE, IT IS WINDY. I THINK IT IS FROM THE F35 WE JUST SAW. [CHEERING] YOU CAN STAND THE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES, THEY WILL NEVER FORGET. UNDER BIDEN'S CRUEL AND SENSELESS LOCKDOWN, HAVE AMERICANS WILL DIE. FROM SUICIDE. DRUGS, MEDICAL CARE, SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. IT CANNOT BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. [CHEERING] ARIZONA, BUT NEVADA, GET YOUR GOVERNOR TO OPEN UP YOUR STATE, PLEASE. GET THEM TO OPEN YOUR STAY UP. THAT, GET THEM TO OPEN. GET THEM TO OPEN IT UP. IF YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN, YOUR KIDS WILL NOT BE IN SCHOOL. HE WANTS TO SHUT IT DOWN. HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, WE WILL SHUT IT DOWN. IT IS DEVASTATING FOR OUR NATION. WE DID JUST THE RIGHT THING, WE CLOSED IT DOWN. WE UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE, IT AFFECTS LIKE AS AN EXAMPLE, ME. GUESS WHO HAD IT? I HAD IT. I'M SURE NONE OF YOU HEARD THAT STORY. [LAUGHTER] IN FACT, THIS RALLY, USUALLY WE SET UP, WE DON'T GO TO RALLIES ANYWHERE, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PROTEST BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO CHURCH. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING. WE CALL EVERYTHING A PROTEST SO WE HAVE NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE STATES WHERE YOU CAN ONLY PROTEST, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. ... ONE GENTLE LITTLE TOUCH TO THE FACE AND HE'S DOWN. THESE DOWN AND HE WOULDN'T GET UP VERY QUICKLY, WOULD HE? JOE BIDEN SAID I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM TO THE BACK OF THE FARM. OKAY . I SAID TO HIM , TO SAY HE PRACTICES VIOLENCE . THE PRESIDENT PRACTICES VIOLENCE . REMEMBER HE SAID ? I WOULD TAKEN TO THE BACK . IF YOU HAVE TO FIGHT SOMEBODY, THAT'S YOUR DREAM FIGHT . SLEEPY JOE . THIS GUY NEVER LIVES. I'M DOING 34 OF THESE A DAY AND YOU THINK THAT'S EASY, RIGHT ?

NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT'S ALL BEEN DONE WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD TIME AND I SAY, SO I HAD IT, MY WIFE HAD IT, OUR GREAT FIRST LADY. THAT'S EVERYBODY LIKE OUR FIRST LADY ?

I'M WORKING TO MAKE , TO BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT THAT I RECEIVED AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WHERE MAKING IT BECAUSE I HAVE A THING CALLED REGENERON AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY WHO NEEDS IT FOR FREE AND I DO SUGGEST, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HEALTHY , I MADE A STATEMENT AND THEY TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY, CNN, TOTAL THINK NEWS . AND I GOT VERY CORRECTLY AND I SAID I SHOULD BECAUSE I AM A PERFECT PHYSICAL SPECIMEN AND I'M VERY YOUNG. IT WENT CRAZY . HE IS NOT YOUNG AND HE'S NOT A PERFECT ACCIDENT, THEY WENT CRAZY . THEY WENT CRAZY. THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR WHATSOEVER . NEXT TO OUR RELENTLESS EFFORTS, 97 PERCENT OF ALL EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS , 97 PERCENT ARE FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE VIRUS, THINKING THAT . BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW, WE UNDERSTAND . PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER AND YOU KNOW YOUR IMMUNE, THAT'S WHY I CAN JUMP RIGHT THERE YOU NEED THOSE MEN, I'LL KISS THEM AND I'LL KISS EVERY MAN THERE AND KISS EVERY WOMAN THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND ALSO . THEY WON'T CATCH ANYTHING AND I WILL CATCH BECAUSE THEY SAY UNTIL I CAME ALONG, THEY SAID IF YOU HAVE IT, YOU GET BETTER. YOUR IMMUNE FOR LIFE. BUT WHAT I SAID, BETTER AND THEY SAID HE WILL.THE WHOLE MEDICAL CENTER. WAS THAT WAS GOOD FOR LIFE , BUT WITH ME THEY SAID I'M NOW GOOD FOR 4 MONTHS AND I THINK IT'S A MUCH LONGER PERIOD BUT WHO KNOWS, WE WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH . WE'RE ON 1 MILLION DOSES OF A REALLY GREAT STATE THAT SCENE AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, THERE RIGHT AT THE DOORSTEP AND IF I WERE PRESIDENT, IF YOU HAD SLEEPY JOE AS YOUR PRESIDENT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU FOR YEARS TO HAVE A VACCINE, YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD A VACCINE BUT WHAT WE DID WITH THE FDA THEY SAID WE WILL NEED APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS AND I SAID HOW ABOUT ONE WEEK ? WE'VE MOVED UP THE SCHEDULE AND GET WE WILL VANQUISH THE VIRUS AND EMERGE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE EVER STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE . NOW, WHAT I DID ONLY BECAUSE OF YOU AND THE DOUBLE STATE WITH A DOUBLE TREATMENT, WE NOW HAVE A NEW LITTLE THING, WE HAVE A BIG BOARD THAT SHOWS DIFFERENT THINGS AND HERE'S SOME OF THE GOVERNORS TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE JOB WE DID ON COVID OR THE CHINA VIRUS . EVERY TIME I CALL THE PRESENT HE'S GOTTEN ON THE LINE QUICKLY AND WE HAVE TO GET SUPPORT FOR THAT MERCY SHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HE WAS ABLE TO DIRECT THAT IN REAL TIME CLASS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DID WORKING WITH STATE WAS A PHENOMENAL ACCOMPLISHMENT . HAS BEEN ON IT AND I KNOW A TEAM WHEN THEY'RE ON IT AND I KNOW THE TEAM WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON IT . HIS TEAM IS ON IT YET THEY'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE , LATE AT NIGHT, EARLY IN THE MORNING . WERE WORKING WELL WITH FEMA AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS A FOR FIELD HOSPITALS. THAT WAS A DECISION OF PRESIDENT HIMSELF TOOK AND I'M THANKFUL TO BE FAIR, MAYBE BIDEN IS NOT TELLING US BECAUSE HE'S FORGOTTEN HIS OWN PLAN . WATCH BIDEN'S STAFF QUICKLY SWOOPED IN TO SHUFFLE HIM ALONG DURING A QUICKIE ESCAPE THE BASEMENT TRIP TO PENNSYLVANIA . WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO BE ? 4 MORE YEARS OF GEORGE, WERE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE POSITION WHERE IF TRUMP GETS ELECTED WHERE GOING TO BE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD . 56 PERCENT OF AMERICANS THAT THEY WERE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN AND MINISTRATION SO WHY SHOULD FEEL PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE BETTER OFF TODAY UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VOTE FOR YOU ? IF THEY THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T . 54 PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY TODAY AND THEY WERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION , THEIR MEMORY IS NOT VERY GOOD QUITE FRANKLY . I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR THE SENATE . SO VOTE. VOTE. I GOT IN TROUBLE AND WERE RUNNING AGAIN, THE SENATOR WAS A MORMON RED OR IT WAS THE CAN'T DO IT. CAN'T DO IT.YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A GREAT, GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE A COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL . A COUNTRY THAT COULD BE GREATER AND EVER BEFORE . WE CAN'T DO THIS TO OURSELVES . WE CAN'T AREA AND I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK HE'S A NICE PERSON BUT THAT'S OKAY, I DON'T THINK HE'S A NICE GUY. IF HE WAS A NICE GUY I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THOSE CLIPS UP BUT THOSE CLIPS ARE JUST A FEW OF MANY, MANY CLIPS . THAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WE CAN'T DO IT . FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE HERE TODAY HE SAY I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF OHIO FOR BEING WITH US. HE'S DONE THAT SEVEN DIFFERENT TIMES AND ONCE YOU DO THAT IT'S OVER . YOU JUST WALK OFF THE STAGE, YOU CAN NEVER MAKE A GOOD SPEECH AFTER THAT . NOBODY'S GOING TO GO HOME AND SAY THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH EXCEPT FOR THE FACT HE CALLED US THE WRONG STATE . JOE BIDEN IS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE RAGE FILLED EXTREMISTS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO AND YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN . THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR INCITING VIOLENCE , HATRED AND HATRED AGAINST OUR POLICE . OUR POLICE. WITHOUT OUR POLICE WE HAVE VERY LITTLE. LAST NIGHT THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA WAS RANSACKED BY VIOLENT MOBS AND BIDEN SUPPORTED PEOPLE, THESE WERE ALL BIDEN SUPPORTED PEOPLE AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CALL THEM OUT . THIS MORNING THEY SAID PLEASE CALL THEM OUT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THE RADICAL LEFT STORES WERE LOOTED, POLICE CARS WERE BURNED AND DOZENS OF OFFICERS, GREAT OFFICERS WERE INJURED . BIDEN AND HARRIS STAND UP AND A STAND WITH THE RIOTERS AND THE VANDALS AREA I STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] IT TOOK GENERATIONS TO BUILD THE AMERICA WE KNOW AND LOVE , BUT IF THE RADICAL LEFT GAINS POWER IT WILL TAKE THEM ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO DESTROY IT . THIS ELECTION DAY YOU MUST STOP THE ANTI-AMERICAN CRAZY RADICALS. THEY ARE CRAZY. THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY . I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY IT BECAUSE WE HAD A TIME LAST FOUR YEARS AGO , BUT BASED ON ABSOLUTELY INSANE . JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN BUT BIG TECH WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO BE SAID AND THE MEDIA WILL NOT SAY . WHAT HE HAS DONE IS HORRIBLE , THE MONEY FROM CHINA, FROM UKRAINE, FROM RUSSIA . THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW GAVE HIM THREE AND HALF MILLION TO THE SUN, THE SUN HAD NO JOB, NO NOTHING . GOT 3 AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS . THEY PUT HIM ON THE BOARD OF BURISMA, 100 E $3000 A MONTH AND I UNDERSTAND $3 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT, THEY COULD HAVE HAD HIM FOR LESS . CHINA GAVE HIM ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO MANAGE EVEN THOUGH HE'S NEVER MANAGED MONEY BEFORE YOU AND I ASK PEOPLE ON WALL STREET IS THAT COMMON? THEY SAID IT'S NOT COMMON EVEN FOR US, WE DON'T DO THAT AND THAT WAS AFTER THE MEETING LASTED 10 MINUTES, FLEW IN WITH HIS FATHER . FLEW BACK WITH 1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE FROM CHINA . AND THEN BIG ONE AND I GUESS THIS ONE MAYBE GOT CAUGHT . I GET A LOT OF CREDIT FOR LAST NIGHT . TUCKER CARLSON DID A GREAT JOB. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO CALL IT OUT . BY THE WAY, FOLLOW-UP , SEAN HANNITY DID A PHENOMENAL JOB. YOU LOOK AT SEAN HANNITY AND LAURA DID A PHENOMENAL JOB . THEY'RE GETTING THE WORD OUT, THE GREAT LOU DOBBS . YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD SUPPORT BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE BECAUSE LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE UP THERE, LOOK AT THEM . EVERY ONE OF THEM, THEY TURN THEIR CAMERA OFF IF I EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS . THEY TURN THEIR CAMERA OFF IF I MENTIONED BIDEN CORRUPTION. THEY TURN THEIR CAMERA OFF AND YET THEY'LL DO STORIES ABOUT ME LEFT AND RIGHT , STUFF THAT'S SO UNTRUE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S A LOT OF FUN BEING PRESIDENT, I GOT IMPEACHED OVER A TELEPHONE CALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE BUT WE HAD THE REPUBLICANS STOOD BY IN CONGRESS, 197 TO NOTHING, HOW ABOUT THAT ? THAT'S PRETTY GOOD . LAST NIGHT IN THAT HOUR-LONG INTERVIEW, THE BIDEN FAMILY BUSINESS PARTNER REVEALED THE DEPTH AND EXTENT OF BIDEN CORRUPTION AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU WALK OUT YOUR VICE PRESIDENT AND YOUR SON WALKS OUT WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HE'S GOT NO REAL CAPABILITY , I WOULD SAY THAT'S CORRECT.I WOULD SAY THAT'S CORRUPT BUT JOE GOT A PIECE AREA BUT THE BIG GUY, THEY SAID WE'RE GOING TO KEEP 10 PERCENT FOR THE BIG GUY. THEY CALL HIM THE BIG GUY, I DON'T THINK SO . JOE WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING CORRUPT BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH CHINA . AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS LETTING CHINA PLUNDER OUR JOBS AND DESTROY OUR BUSINESSES, OUR FACTORIES, OUR WORKERS . ANOTHER REPORT SHOWED THE EXECUTIVE OF A CHINESE COMPANY THAT PAID THE BIDENS AT LEAST $5 MILLION WAS UNDER SURVEILLANCE BY THE US GOVERNMENT AS A LIKELY CHINESE SPY. IT'S ALL DOWN, DOCUMENTED . THEY WON'T REPEAT IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I DID THIS AFTER MARK I HAD A CONVERSATION , CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY. I NEVER MET THE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE . I CALLED HIM UP, ONE OF MY GREAT PEOPLE PLEASE CALL HIM AND CONGRATULATE HIM AND I SAID IZZY ? PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE AND I GOT IMPEACHED AND WE WENT THROUGH HELL FOR SIX MONTHS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN FOR EYE ONE, THEY SPIED AND AFTER I WON BASELINE . AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. LET'S ALL SEE AND BY THE WAY, OBAMA AND BIDEN KNEW ALL ABOUT IT . OBAMA AND BIDEN KNEW ALL ABOUT IT . IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS BECAUSE CHINA WILL OWN THE USA. THEY'RE GOING TO READ PRESIDENT XI IS NOT GOT THE SAME PROBLEMS BIDEN HAS . HE IS A VERY SHARP GUY, VERY SMART GUY . EVERY CUNNING GUY . HE WILL OWN THE UNITED STATES . I CHARGE THEM BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS AND I GAVE $20 BILLION TO OUR FARMERS BECAUSE THEY WERE TARGETED . WHEN WE WIN , YOU WIN. ARIZONA WINS . NEVADA WINS . AND AMERICA WINS . WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY SOME REALLY GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE AND THEY ARE WARRIORS AND THEIR FIGHTING HARD TO READ YOUR GOVERNORS DOUG DOOCY, HE GOT YOU OPENED UP. YOU LOOK GOOD, DOUG .

GOOD JOB. THEY LOVE OUR FIRST LADY. AND AMERICA IS BLESSED TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE IN MY/OUR HOME STATE, FLORIDA. I LOVE THIS STATE AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. AND FIVE DAYS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WE ARE GOING ON TO WIN A RECORD SHARE OF THE HISPANIC AMERICAN VOTE. DO YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING? THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED, THE FAKE NEWS. MILANI, YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING, DON'T YOU? WE HAVE LED FLORIDA EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING FOR THEM. ACTUALLY, IT IS A GOOD THING FOR THEM. THEY HAVE NOT QUITE FIGURED IT OUT YET. WE ARE DOING INCREDIBLY IN FLORIDA. WE ARE DOING INCREDIBLY ALL OVER. AND THIS IS NOT BASED ON POLLS. IT IS BASED ON FACT. IT IS BASED ON VOTES THAT ARE COMING IN. WE ARE CREATING THE GREATEST RED WAVE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE WHILE. WE WANT TO GET SOME OF THE INTRODUCTORY THINGS OUT. BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY WITH THE BIG TECH. YOU KNOW THE POWER OF BIG TECH? THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. WE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE POWER OF BIG TECH. I HEARD ABOUT IT FOR YEARS AGO. BIG TECH IS POWERFUL. YOU CANNOT BEAT THEM. AND THEN WE ONE. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, 94% OF THE STORIES ABOUT US ARE NEGATIVE. THINK ABOUT IT. 64% OF THE STORIES -- HOW DO YOU HAVE A POSITIVE STORY? THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN MY PLEDGE TO DELIVER HISTORIC -- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE, RIGHT? THIS IS HISTORIC PROSPERITY. ANOTHER MAJOR TAX CUT TO GO ALONG WITH THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. RECORD JOB GROWTH. JOE'S PLAN IS TO DELIVER PUNISHING LOCKDOWNS. HE'S GOING TO LOCK YOU DOWN. FLORIDA HAS OPENED UP. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. HE SPEAK TO YOU TODAY OR NOT? NO. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE LITTLE THING IN THE BOX. THEY SAID HE IS SPEAKING. HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS UP THERE A LONG TIME. SHE SAID YES. I GREAT GOVERNOR. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. HE IS A GREAT GUY. THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU MASSIVE TAX HIKES. I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS ALL MY LIFE. I'VE ONLY BEEN TWO YEARS ON THIS SIDE OF IT. BUT WE HAVE DONE WELL, HAVEN'T WE? A SENATOR CAME INTO MY OFFICE, SAID, SIR -- OLDER GUY, NICE GUY, A TOTAL PRO. I AM A UNITED STATES SENATOR. SAID, SENATOR, I HAVE BEEN IN ONE RACE, AND WE HAVE WON ONE. YOU BETTER WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WE TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO RECOVER. YOU WILL HAVE A CRIPPLING DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IF SLEEPY JOE BECOMES YOUR PRESIDENT. YOUR 401(K), THROW THEM OUT THE WINDOW, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE STOCK MARKET HAS A BIG HEADWIND. WE ARE DOING GOOD. DID YOU SEE THE NUMBER? 30.1 GDP, THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BY ALMOST TRIPLE, RIGHT? ALMOST TRIPLE. NOW IT IS VERY MUCH BIGGER THAN ANY GDP WE HAVE EVER HAD. YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 1950'S. IT IS LESS THAN HALF. THIS IS THE GREATEST NUMBER, 33.1%. I WOULD HAVE SAID I WILL TAKE 12%. 12% WOULD BE VERY NICE. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF 12%. 33.1. LET ME TELL YOU, I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THIS ONE. THEY WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST EVENT IN BUSINESS IN 50 YEARS. NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN A NUMBER LIKE THIS. THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY NATION. NO NATION HAS A NUMBER LIKE THAT. OTHER NATIONS, WE WERE COMPARED TO EUROPE. GERMANY IS DOING SO WELL. FRANCE IS DOING SO WELL. NO, THEY ARE NOT DOING WELL. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. WE WANT THE BEST. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THEM, AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT THEY ARE NOT DOING WELL. THEY ARE SPIKING UP BIG. THEY ARE SHUTTING DOWN. THEY ARE LOCKING DOWN. I DISAGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE WE ARE NEVER GOING TO LOCK DOWN AGAIN. WE UNDERSTOOD THE DISEASE AND NOW WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS, AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THIS IS FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN WHAT THE EXPERTS EXPECTED. 7%, 8% -- YOU ARE GOING TO SAY THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. MILANI WAS UNBELIEVABLE. THE GOVERNOR WAS INCREDIBLE. I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY SPEAK LIKE THAT. TRUMP WAS OK. NOT BAD. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR TRUMP. IT IS BETWEEN TRUMP AND SLEEPY JOE. EVERYBODY BEATS SLEEPY JOE. A COUPLE OF THESE GUYS, THEY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. THEY ARE BETTER THAN JOE, I WILL TELL YOU. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? I AM RUNNING AGAINST THE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. I DON'T CARE, WIN, LOSE, OR DRAW. THIS IS THE WORST CANDIDATE IN HISTORY. HE SHOULD NOT BE THERE. POCAHONTAS KEPT GOING. SHOULD'VE GOTTEN OUT. THEN IT WOULD'VE BEEN AGAINST BERNIE. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WOULD HAVE A MORE ENERGETIC BASE IF WE HAD BERNIE. THAT IS ONE THING. DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE A BASE. HE GOES FOR A SPEECH. THIS IS ALL THE WAY BACK TO THAT BUILDING, AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. AND BIDEN IS LEAVING HIS BASEMENT TODAY. HE TOOK THE LID OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES? HE TAKES THE LEAD OFF, RUNS TO THE CLOSEST PART OF DELAWARE, LIKE IF HE COULD GET A LITTLE PIECE OF PENNSYLVANIA. PEOPLE IN PENNSYLVANIA, THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS. NO FRACKING, NO FRACKING. HE GETS TO PENNSYLVANIA. HE LEARNS IT IS A MILLION JOBS. BY THE WAY, PENNSYLVANIA -- THEY GIVE US THE ENERGY, EXPENSIVE ENERGY. HE GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE CHANGES. THEY DO NOT CALL HIM OUT ON WHERE IS HUNTER. WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? IS HUNTER IN THE CROWD? THEY DON'T CALL HIM OUT. THEY DO NOT CALL HIM OUT ON WHERE IS HUNTER. IT'S CRAZY. IT'S CRAZY. I GET A CALL FROM ALL THE EXPERTS, GUYS WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT 6, 7, 8 TIMES, NEVER GOT PAST THE FIRST ROUND. THEY SAY SIR, YOU SHOULD NOT BE SPEAKING ABOUT HUNTER. I DISAGREE. MAYBE THAT IS WHY I AM HERE AND THEY ARE NOT. THEY SAY TALK ABOUT YOUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS. TALK ABOUT 33.1%, THE GREATEST IN HISTORY. I DO. HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SAY IT? I WILL SAY IT FIVE OR SIX TIMES. 33.1. BUT YOU LOOK AT THAT, AND THEY LOOK AT TUCKER CARLTON, WHAT HE DID THE OTHER NIGHT. GREAT, AND FOLLOWED UP BY SEAN, AND FOLLOWED UP BY LAURA, AND NEXT DAY, NOTHING AT ALL, RIGHT? NOTHING. NOTHING IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES." THE FATE "NEW YORK TIMES." WE SEE ANONYMOUS, THE LOW STAFFER? ANONYMOUS TURNED OUT TO BE A GUY . I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL THIS GUY IS. THE NEW YORK TIMES SAID A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL, NOBODY KNEW WHO HE WAS. LOOK, WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE WITH THE PRESS. THEY ARE TRULY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. SO THIS GUY, THIS GUY GOES OUT, THIS LOWLIFE WHO I NEVER -- I THINK HE HAS A PICTURE OF ME STANDING THERE, LIKE I DO WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THIS LOWLIFE GOES OUT AND HE WRITES A BOOK. WHEN HE LEFT, IT'S INCREDIBLE. BUT THEN SOMEBODY GETS HIM AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THE FAKE "NEW YORK TIMES," AND HE BECOMES NASTY, AND THEY SAY "A TOP WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL." HE WAS A STAFFER, LOW, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HAD NOTHING TO DO. HE GOES IN, AND YOU KNOW, THERE SHOULD BE MAJOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR SCUM LIKE THIS. FOR A YEAR, EVERYBODY WALKS INTO MY OFFICE -- SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO. I COULD NAME EVERY ONE OF THEM. ALL GOOD PEOPLE. I'M LOOKING AT THEM SAYING, I WONDER IF THAT COULD BE THE ONE. IT TURNS OUT TO BE THIS LOWLIFE THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHO THE HELL HE IS. HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US. I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER MET HIM. I MIGHT HAVE MET HIM. SOMEBODY SAID HE HAS A PICTURE OF ME STANDING SOMEPLACE. THIS IS A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY. IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN, AND HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME BACK IN WASHINGTON? HE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. ALONG WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES. THIS WAS A STORY MADE UP. IT WAS FAKE NEWS, MADE UP BY THE NEW YORK TIMES. YOU KNOW WHO HE WORKS FOR NOW? CNN. HE WORKS FOR CNN. YOU SEE THE CAMERA RIGHT THERE WITH THE LIGHTS? IT JUST WENT OFF. DO YOU SEE THAT, HONEY? THAT RED LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. FAKE NEWS, CNN. AND ANDERSON COOPER -- [CROWD CHANTING] AND ANDERSON COOPER ASKED HIM, ARE YOU ANONYMOUS? HE LIED TO HIM, SAID, NO, I'M NOT. HE WORKS FOR CNN. I WOULD THINK CNN WOULD BE FIRING HIM. THIS IS A REAL LOWLIFE. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HE WORKS FOR? GOOGLE. HE WORKS FOR GOOGLE. I THINK GOOGLE SHOULD FIRE HIM QUICKLY BECAUSE BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM. THINK OF WHAT HE DOES TO OUR GOVERNMENT. IT IS LIKE A HORRIBLE, TREASONOUS, HORRIBLE THING THAT YOU CAN DO THIS, THAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. WEEKLY JOBLESS CLAIMS -- THIS IS BORING, BUT IT IS REALLY GOOD. JUST HIT A SEVEN MONTH LOW. IN OTHER WORDS, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC SEVEN MONTHS AGO. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEXT YEAR THE BEST YEAR WE HAVE EVER HAD ECONOMICALLY. AND IT IS TRUE. BIDEN IS HOLDING BACK THE STOCK MARKET BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IS AN ELECTION. CRAZY THINGS CAN HAPPEN. MAYBE 100% OF THE PEOPLE IN FLORIDA DECIDE NOT TO VOTE. YOU NEVER KNOW. WE HAVE A HEADWIND. IT HAS GONE DOWN A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. YOU ARE CLOSE, AND IT COULD BE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION SO BIG. YOU WATCH. AND THAT IS THE ONLY REASON THE MARKET IS GOING DOWN. THE MARKET IS GOING DOWN BECAUSE IF HE GETS HIM, SERIOUSLY, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF HORSE OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE EVER HAD. JOHN ROBERTS FROM FOX IS BACK THERE, AND I THINK HE AGREES. AND JOHN ROBERTS IS UNHAPPY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT HIS 401(K) TO GO DOWN THE TUBE. JOHN HAS TREATED US VERY FAIRLY. NOT PERFECT. HE IS NOT PERFECT, I WILL SAY, THAT HE HAS BEEN OVERALL PRETTY GOOD. HE IS PRETTY GOOD. CNN, GOOGLE, NEW YORK TIMES -- IT IS FAKE. IT IS FAKE. THEY RUN SO MANY FAKE STORIES. THANKS TO OUR POLICIES, AMERICA IS EXPERIENCING THE FASTEST AND BIGGEST RECOVERY. WE ARE HAVING THE BEST RECOVERY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NO OTHER COUNTRY, SMALL OR LARGE, IS RECOVERING LIKE US. THINK ABOUT THIS. IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, WE HAVE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION AMERICAN JOBS, THE FASTEST JOB GROWTH IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. OUR JOB GROWTH HAS BEEN 23 TIMES FASTER THAN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS UNDER OBAMA/BIDEN, RECOVERY WHICH WAS BY THE WAY THE WORST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. YOU DO KNOW THAT, RIGHT? AND JUST, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ALL -- ALL BIDEN DOES IS TALKS ABOUT COVID, RIGHT? HE DOESN'T CALL IT THE CHINA VIRUS. YOU KNOW WHY? CHINA HAS HIM PAID OFF. HE CAN'T USE THAT TERM. THEY GAVE HIS SON 1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE. HE MAKES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR, I ASSUME. THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE WORLD SAID, THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN. WE CAN'T GET IT. HE GOT IT. IT TOOK HIM 10 MINUTES. HE WALKED IN. HE WALKED OUT WITH 1.5 BILLION. MAYBE HE IS NOT SO STUPID AFTER ALL. THAT IS THE ONLY THING. I SAID HE WAS SO DUMB. MAYBE HE IS NOT AS DUMB AS WE THINK. LOOK, HE CANNOT TAKE ON CHINA. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. THE PROBLEM IS BIDEN IS TOTALLY -- THE BIGGEST STORY -- NO, THE SECOND-BIGGEST STORY -- THE WORST WAS WHEN THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN AND THEY GOT CAUGHT. [BOOING] THAT'S THE BIGGEST POLITICAL CORRUPTION STORY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT THIS COULD VERY WELL BE SECOND. WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED THE LAPTOP FROM HELL. THE LAPTOP FROM HELL. FROM WHAT I HAVE UNDERSTOOD, YOU ONLY HAVE SEEN A TINY PORTION OF IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRESS IS NOW DOING? THEY ARE BLAMING RUSSIA. IT'S RUSSIA DID IT. RUSSIA IS THE ONE THAT CREATED THE LAPTOP. AND RUSSIA BROUGHT IT INTO THE LITTLE SHOP TO HAVE IT FIXED. RUSSIA. I THINK RUSSIA IS LOOKING AT US AND SAYING, THIS IS STONE COLD CRAZY. NO, IT WAS RUSSIA'S FAULT. THEY SAID IT LOUD AND CLEAR. IT WAS RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS CRAP? I THOUGHT TWO DAYS AGO, HE LOOKS LIKE A WATERMELON HEAD. REMEMBER HE LIED IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS? HE READ MY CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, BUT IT WAS NOT MY CONVERSATION. HOW GREAT DO WE LOVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT TOOK DOWN THE LANGUAGE, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY PEOPLE. IF I DID NOT HAVE IT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY WORD AGAINST SHIFTY SHIFT -- SCHIFF. QUID PRO QUO. EIGHT TIMES, YOU HAVE ASKED FOR THE SAME THING. AFTER THE THIRD TIME, THE GUY ON THE OTHERS WOULD SAY HE HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM. I CALLED HIM TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. AND FOR THAT, I GOT IMPEACHED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE? WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT REPUBLICANS, AND I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THOSE REPUBLICANS ALSO. GREAT REPUBLICANS. WE HAVE ONE OF THEM HERE, MARK MEADOWS. HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF MARK MEADOWS? TOOK ME THREE YEARS TO GET HIM OUT OF CONGRESS AND BECOME CHIEF OF STAFF. HE IS GREAT. HE WAS ONE OF OUR GREAT ONES. YOU KNOW WHO HELPED ME A LOT, HONESTLY? IN FACT, I SAID DON'T RUN FOR GOVERNOR, RON. HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN, YOUR GOVERNOR. HE IS OUT THERE WORKING WITH THE PHONE. HE HAS GOT THE PHONE GOING. HE USES TWO AT ONE TIME, RIGHT? BUT YOUR GOVERNOR WAS ANOTHER ONE. HE IS HARVARD AND YALE, YOU KNOW THAT? YOUR GOVERNOR, HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT IT. HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT IT. BUT HE WOULD BE ON TELEVISION DEFENDING ME AND FIGHTING FOR ME. DID ANYONE HEAR OF JIM JORDAN? JIM GOES 128 AT ONCE. HE WAS AN NCAA WRESTLING CHAMPION, ONE OF THE BEST. HE WAS A GREAT ONE. HE WAS A GREAT ONE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WIN LIKE HE WON -- HE WON EVERYTHING. YOU WIN LIKE THAT, IT IS ALSO RIGHT HERE. IT IS MUSCLE, BUT IT HAS TO BE MUSCLE ATTACHED TO A LOT OF BRAIN. YOU GUYS KNOW. THE ATHLETES KNOW. JIM WAS GREAT. RON WAS FANTASTIC. GOVERNOR, HE ASKED ME, HE SAID, WOULD YOU SUPPORT ME FOR GOVERNOR? I SAID NOT REALLY. I RATHER HAVE YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE. YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB OF DEFENDING THE. BUT THINK OF WHAT WE HAD TO DO. WE GOT 190 7-0 IN THE HOUSE. THICK ABOUT IT. 197 TO NOTHING. AND THEN WE WENT TO THE SENATE AND WE HAD 52 AND A HALF. KNOW WHO THE HALF WAS, BUT THAT'S OK. THAT WAS THE GUY THAT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HIS NAME. MEMBER, HE SAID THE GUY FROM -- THE GOVERNOR FROM THAT PLACE, UTAH, I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME. WHAT IS HIS NAME? IT WAS ROMNEY. LET'S FACE IT. SLEEPY JOE IS SHOT. AND I'M NOT A FAN OF HIS, AND HE'S NOT A NICE GUY. I'D FEEL BETTER IF HE WAS A NICE GUY. I COULDN'T SAY THESE THINGS. HE IS NOT A NICE GUY. NOW HE CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER OR NOT HE USED TO BE A NICE GUY. HE WAS NEVER CONSIDERED SMART. HE WAS A TOUCHY-FEELY GUY. YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS, TOUCHY-FEELY? BUT NOT A NICE GUY. NOT SMART. ARE INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY IS SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW AND SHE IS SAYING -- AND SHE IS SAYING TO HERSELF, I WONDER IF ALL RALLIES ARE LIKE THIS? NO, MOST OF THEM ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, BUT THAT'S OK. YOU KNOW WHY, HONEY? WE ARE IN FLORIDA. THIS IS LIKE HOME. THIS IS HOME. THIS IS HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE SAY IT LIKE IT IS. WE SAY IT LIKE IT IS. WE CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY, AND NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. SEE ALL THAT HAT, THAT BEAUTIFUL HAT, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A NEW ONE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN. WE DID IT. WE DID IT, NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN, AGAIN. MY FIRST LADY WANTS TO DO IT AGAIN. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, THE FLORIDA TOURISM INDUSTRY, IT'S HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY WILL COME ROLLING BACK VERY SOON. IT IS READY TO HAPPEN. WE ARE MAKING THE TURN. WE GOT THE VACCINES COMING VERY SOON. THE FDA HAS WORKED MIRACLES. THEY HAD NO CHOICE. THEY HAD TO. THIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN, IF JOE WAS IN CHARGE -- HE WOULD NOT HAVE A VACCINE FOR FOUR YEARS. I WAS GOING TO SAY HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SWINE. HE CALLS IT AND WHEN EACH ONE. IT IS ACTUALLY H1N1. H COMES -- IT IS EASY BECAUSE H COMES BEFORE AND. I SAID JOE, JOE, JUST CALL IT SWINE FOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL IT -- THE NUMBERS ARE TOO COMPLICATED. THREE DAYS AGO, HE SAID I AM A PROUD -- THE UNITED STATES SENATE -- YOU CANNOT PLAY GAMES, YOU KNOW? YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH. YOU SEEN A LEFT -- HAVE YOU SEEN ENOUGH? BUT BASED ON THE EARLY NUMBERS I HAVE SEEN, I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL. WE ARE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GO TO PLACES THAT WE HAVE NEVER POTENTIAL OF OUR COUNTRY IS SO INCREDIBLE. USE THE IT HAPPENING ALREADY -- YOU SEE IT HAPPENING ALREADY. YOU LOOK AT GERMANY, YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. YOU LOOK AT OUR RECOVERY, FASTEST RECOVERY. WE WENT DOWN THE LEAST ECONOMICALLY. AS MUCH AS IT'S TERRIBLE, WE WENT DOWN THE LEAST. WE'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. IT WAS PROJECTED AT LEAST 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE, RIGHT? THE PROJECTIONS WERE 2.2 MILLION. BY THE WAY, CHINA SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN, THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET IT ESCAPE, AND WE WILL NOT FORGET. BIDEN'S AGENDA WILL DEVASTATE THE HISPANIC AMERICAN COMMUNITY. HE BETRAYED HISPANIC AMERICANS FOR 47 YEARS. HE HAS BEEN VERY BAD WITH HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THOSE POLL NUMBERS? WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBERS -- WE ARE NOW, ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, THE REAL POLLS, WE ARE BEATING DEMOCRATS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WITH HISPANIC AMERICANS. AND I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THEM AND I THINK THEY HAVE ALWAYS LOVED ME. FIRST TIME EVER. FIRST TIME EVER. AND THE FAKERS ARE GOING CRAZY. AND NOW BIDEN WANTS TO CLOSE SMALL BUSINESSES AND TAKE AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THIS LIKE AN AMENDMENT. WHILE LETTING RIOTERS, LOOTERS, AND VANDALS ROAM FREE. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PHILADELPHIA. HE COULDN'T EVEN COME OUT AGAINST HIM -- THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ASK HIM A QUESTION. WHERE IS PHILADELPHIA, HE SAID. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT STATE IT WAS IN. CAN YOU IMAGINE LOSING TO THE SKY? ATTACHED TO THIS GUY? THE -- CAN YOU IMAGINE LOSING TO THIS GUY? BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL USING THE WORD LOSING. THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WILL SAY HE IS THINKING ABOUT LOSING. I THINK HE'S GOING TO LOSE AND I THINK HE'S LOST ALL CREDIBILITY. AND OUR ELEGANT FIRST LADY SAID WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING HERE? THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE, THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SOCIALISM. VENEZUELA. WE USED TO SAY VENEZUELA ON STEROIDS. THIS WOULD BE A VERY LARGE VERSION OF VENEZUELA, AND IT COULD HAPPEN, WITH THE GREEN NEW DEAL AND ALL THESE -- LOOK. AOC PLUS THREE. I HEAR SHE IS VERY INSULTED THAT I CALL HER AOC -- I'M NOT. I CALL HER AOC PLUS THREE. ELON OMAR, I AM GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF OMAR. SHE TELLS US HOW TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK SO. ELON OMAR -- ILAN OMAR. WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF HER. WHEN THEY CALLED US, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE, 45 MINUTES? IT WAS EXTINGUISHED. WE COULD HAVE DONE IT IN THE FIRST HOUR INSTEAD OF WAITING A WEEK AND A HALF. I GIVE THE GOVERNOR CREDIT. HE EVENTUALLY CALLED. THEY SHOULD CALL US IN OREGON. WHAT I LOVE TO GO IN WITH THE ANARCHIST. THEY WOULD LAST 15 MINUTES. OUR GUYS -- YOU HAVE TO HOLD THEM BACK. LET US IN, SIR. WE WOULD LIKE TO GO IN. WE WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO OREGON. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. IT WOULD NOT TAKE THEM LONG. IT WOULD TAKE THEM ABOUT 15 -- HOW LONG? THE WAY WE DO THINGS. AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD END UP GOING HOME ABOUT 10 YEARS LATER, BACK HOME TO MOM AND DAD WHERE THEY STARTED IN THE BASEMENT. ANTIFA. YOU KNOW ANTIFA? BIDEN CALLED IT AN IDEA. HE SAID ANTIFA IS JUST AN IDEA. IT'S NOT AN IDEA. WE CALLED THE UNITED STATES AND IDEA, TOO. I SAID NO, NO, IT'S NOT AN IDEA. THE UNITED STATES IS A GREAT NATION. HE CALLED US AN IDEA. HE PUTS US IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS ANTIFA. AS LONG AS I AM PRESIDENT, AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. THIS ELECTION WILL DECIDE WHETHER OUR CHILDREN WILL BE CONDEMNED TO THE MISERY OF SOCIALISM OR WHETHER THEY INHERIT THE GLORIOUS LEGACY OF AMERICA'S FREEDOM. THIS ELECTION WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE BIDEN-HARRIS. HOW ABOUT HER? I TELL YOU WHAT. WHEN OUR GREAT VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE DEBATED HER, IT WAS A TOTAL -- YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION . IF IT WAS A FIGHT, THEY WOULD HAVE ENDED IT. WITHIN TWO DAYS THEY WERE SAYING ON THE FAKE NEWS THAT SHE DID MAGNIFICENTLY WELL. NO, YOU DO GREAT. TWO DAYS LATER, YOU REALIZE THEY HAVE IT DOWN. MIKE HAS DONE FANTASTIC. HE IS A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT. HE WORKS VERY HARD. I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING. HIS KIDS ARE IN THE MILITARY AND THEY ARE TEACHERS. I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING, MIKE PENCE HAS NOT MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY SCAMMING FOREIGN COUNTRIES, BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THEY HAVE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LOOK AT THAT. ARE THEY DOING THAT ON PURPOSE? ARE THEY FRIEND OR FOE? I FELT GOOD. I FELT WATER ON MY FACE. THEY MAY BE DOING THAT ON PURPOSE. LET'S FIND OUT IF THEY ARE FRIEND OR FOE, AND IF THEY ARE FOE, LET'S TAKE CARE OF THOSE SONS OF BENCHES. LOOK AT THAT -- BITCHES. LOOK ABOUT. ARE YOU OK? OH LOOK, THEY ARE HITTING THE PRESS. THERE GO THE CAMERAS. THERE GOES A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT. LOOK AT THAT. WOW. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT IS SORT OF COOLING. THAT'S GREAT. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S AMAZING, AND I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE WE LIKE RONALD REAGAN, WE LIKED A LOT OF PEOPLE. GENERALLY SPEAKING, MOSTLY, THEY DON'T DO THE JOB. BUT WE LIKE RONALD REAGAN. HE'S THE ONE I THINK ABOUT. NOBODY EVER CHOWED -- CHANTED. HE WOULDN'T GET A CROWD LIKE THIS. WE WERE IN ARIZONA THE DAY BEFORE, TWO DAYS BEFORE. WE WERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE DID THREE IN PENNSYLVANIA. YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN COMMON? THE LOVE. IT'S ALL THE SAME. THE LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A CHANT. I SEE A BIG STRONG GUY, WIPING AWAY TEARS, I DON'T THINK HE HAS EVER CRIED IN HIS LIFE BEFORE. WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU. THIS GUY HASN'T CRIED SINCE HE WAS A BABY. AND NOW HE'S CRYING. THERE HAS NEITHER BEEN THAT CHANT -- NEVER BEEN THAT CHANT BEFORE. I WOULD CRY BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO SAY YOU'RE PRESIDENT BROKE DOWN IN TEARS TODAY. THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE DON'T WANT PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA TO SAY I JUST SAW SOMETHING THAT SURPRISES ME. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TAKEN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF CHINA. BUT THEN THE PLAGUE CAME IN. WE MADE A GREAT DEAL WITH CHINA. THE INK WASN'T DRY. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT FEELING. THREE WEEKS AGO, THEY ORDERED MORE CORN, MORE SOYBEANS, MORE BEEF THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK I AM GOING TO WIN. THEY THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND THEY WANT TO MAKE US HAPPY, BUT WE ARE NOT HAPPY, BECAUSE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE. IT'S SO SAD. 188 COUNTRIES. WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO THIS WORLD. PEOPLE COME UP TO ME WITH MASKS AND ALL OF THIS, HELLO, PRESIDENT HELLO, LOOK AT WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO OUR COUNTRY. I MAY DO THAT. YOU HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL. WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO THIS COUNTRY, AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME, EITHER. [CROWD CHANTING MAKE THEM PAY] Donald J. Trump I MEAN, WHO IS GOING TO SAY IT BETTER THAN KAYLEE, SO. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. THIS IS A GREAT LOOKING COUPLE. WE ALMOST HAD THE DODGERS. ARE THEY THAT GOOD? THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD.

BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE PANDEMIC, HAS ANYBODY SAID IT BETTER THAN THAT? THAT WAS THIS MORNING ON FOX. FOX AND FRIENDS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT GROUP, THAT THREESOME, THEY ARE GREAT. RIGHT? THEY ARE GREAT. IT'S A GREAT GROUP IN THE MORNING. BUT SHE SAID IT ON FOX AND FRIENDS. AINSLEY, STEVE AND BRIAN HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT, RIGHT? THEY TREAT US GOOD. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY YOUR GOVERNOR, WHO I KNOW IS UP HERE SPEAKING, BUT I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE HIM A SECOND TIME BECAUSE I LOVE HIM AND I KNOW HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA, RON DESANTIS. AND YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO IS A FANTASTIC WOMAN AND SHE LOVES HER STATE, JEANETTE NUNEZ. AND WE HAVE SOME WARRIORS THAT USED TO WORK WITH RON. CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL WALTZ. HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT -- WHERE IS MICHAEL? MICHAEL. DID YOU GET MARRIED YET? PLEASE GET MARRIED, QUICKLY. YOU WILL BE SO DEPRESSED. IF YOU DON'T, YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY DEPRESSED. YOU'D BETTER DO IT QUICK. SHE'S OUT OF HERE, MICHAEL. ANOTHER GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND WARRIOR, BILL RAKAS. THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GREG, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING. THESE PEOPLE ARE TOUGH. WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHLEY MOODY, WHO IS DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB. THANK YOU, ASHLEY, FOR EVERYTHING. DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. FLORIDA HOUSE SPEAKER CHRIS BRAWL. -- CHRIS SPRAWLED. FLORIDA GOP CHAIR. JOE, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE IS JOE? HOW ARE WE DOING? HE WILL BE OUT OF HERE SO FAST IF WE DON'T WIN THIS ELECTION. HE WILL BE GONE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. OUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE TROUBLE. VOTE FOR THE CONGRESSMAN, VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. THEY WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE HAVE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES SCOTT FRANKLIN AND ANNA PAULINA LUNA. THEY HAVE MY FULL ENDORSEMENT. GREAT GOING. I HEAR YOU ARE BOTH DOING VERY WELL. GREAT, GREAT. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE ARE REVERSING THE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN AND HIS ADMINISTRATION DID OVER SEVEN YEARS. THEY DEVASTATED PUERTO RICO. JOE BIDEN VOTED TO ELIMINATE JOBS AND SEND THEM TO CHINA. WE ARE REVERSING THAT. WE HAVE BEEN REVERSING IT NOW FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND IT'S MOVING VERY RAPIDLY. WE ANNOUNCED $13 BILLION IN DISASTER RELIEF FOR PUERTO RICO. THEY GOT HIT HARD. THEY ARE IN A LITTLE PATH THAT CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS. HURRICANE PROBLEMS. SPEAKING OF HURRICANE PROBLEMS, YOU HAVE A LOT OF HURRICANE PROBLEMS, TOO. I'M ALWAYS THERE. RICK SCOTT HAS BEEN GREAT. STRONG GUYS, GOOD LEADERS, GOOD GUYS. GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT LEADERSHIP. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN UNITED STATES HISTORY AND WE HAVE NOW BUILT OVER 400 MILES OF WALL. WE WILL HAVE IT FINISHED VERY SHORTLY. IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON. YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT ANYMORE. THEY WERE WILLING TO CLOSE UP THE COUNTRY OVER THE WALL. I HAD A STRONG PARTY, BAD POLITICS, BUT STRONG PARTY, BAD POLICY. A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. I SHOULD'VE SAID INSTEAD OF WE WILL BUILD THE WALL, I SHOULD'VE SAID WE WILL NOT BUILD THE WALL AND THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE MONEY. THEY SAID WALLS DON'T WORK. I SAID WALLS WORK AND WILL'S WORK. THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT WORK. EVERYTHING ELSE IS OBSOLETE ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER IT'S DISCOVERED. BIDEN WANTS TO TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BANS AND SURGE REFUGEES FROM THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES IN THE WORLD. HE WILL OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. THREE DAYS AGO, A BEHEADING IN FRANCE, AND TODAY IT HAPPENED AGAIN. AND WE GIVE OUR WARMEST REGARDS TO PRESIDENT MACRON, FRIEND OF OURS, FRIEND OF MINE, FRIEND OF THE FIRST LADIES. GREAT PEOPLE. THE FIRST LADY OF FRANCE IS A GREAT WOMAN. UNDER THE BIDEN PLAN, THE HORRIFYING ATTACKS IN FRANCE WILL COME TO OUR CITIES AND OUR TOWNS. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TOO LOUDLY ABOUT THIS. I KNOCK ON WOOD. THIS IS REAL WOOD. ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT -- IT'S REAL WOOD. LET ME KNOCK ON THIS PIECE INSTEAD. BUT LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED. AFTER WE WIN, THE FIRST CALL I GET WILL BE FROM IRAN. THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED. THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GIVE THE MONEY TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS THEY HAVE GIVEN TOO ROUTINELY FOR YEARS. THEIR GDP IS DOWN 27%, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN OF ANY COUNTRY, ONE YEAR. THINK OF IT, DOWN 27. WE WANT TO MAKE A DEAL IF WE CAN. WE WANT THEM TO BE A GREAT COUNTRY, BUT THEY CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THEY CANNOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM. I HOPE THAT HAPPENS. I EVEN SAID, DON'T DEAL WITH THEM NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH SLEEPY JOE. BECAUSE IF HE WON, CHINA WILL OWN US. IRAN WILL MAKE ANOTHER CRAZY DEAL. 150 BILLION DOLLARS, 1.8 MILLION IN CASH, THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THE DEALS WE HAVE MADE. IT'S VERY SCARY TO SEE. THEY SAY THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG BECAUSE NOBODY COULD BE THAT STUPID. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE ARE KEEPING THE TERRORISTS, EXTREMISTS, AND VIOLENT CRIMINALS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY IF THAT'S OK WITH YOU. SOME OF YOU MAY OBJECT IF YOU HAVE A NICE, LIBERAL POINT OF VIEW. BUT IF THAT'S OK WITH YOU, WE WILL KEEP THE HELL OUT. WE INVESTED TWO POINT $5 TRILLION IN THE U.S. MILITARY INCLUDING 11.2 -- THINK OF THIS. $11.2 MILLION RIGHT HERE AT THE AIR FORCE BASE. HAS ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE -- MR. CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GOT IT INCLUDED. AND WE ALSO PASSED VETERANS CHOICE AND VETERANS ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. AND WE TOOK 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE, DESTROYED IT, AND WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI, WHO WE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR 17 YEARS. AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. AND THEN WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST BY FAR, THE WORST IN 50 YEARS, SALOME KNEE IS DEAD. -- SOLOMANI IS DEAD. HE KILLED MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. HE IS GONE. THE HORRIBLE RAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL -- I KILLED THE HORRIBLE I RAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. I GOT THE BUILDING BUILT FOR A TINY FRACTION. YOU KNOW THAT STORY, RIGHT? I CALLED UP OUR GREAT AMBASSADOR, DAVID FREEMAN. I SAID LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IT OPEN. THEY WANT TO SPEND $2 BILLION ON AN EMBASSY. IT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. I SAID GO AROUND, DO WE HAVE ANY LAND WE OWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT? WE OWN EVERYTHING, EVEN ANOTHER COUNTRY'S. HE CAME BACK AND SAID SIR, WE OWN A GREAT PIECE MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE WERE GOING TO BUY. WE DIDN'T BUY IT. I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOCATION. I'M IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS. LOCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. HE SAID WE HAVE A PIECE THAT IS MUCH BIGGER IN A MUCH BETTER LOCATION. I SAID WHAT'S THE BUILDING? HE SAID IT'S BASICALLY UNOCCUPIED, IT'S PRETTY BIG. WE COULD FIX IT UP. HE COMES BACK DAYS LATER, SIR, I THINK WE CAN DO IT FOR $390,000. BIDEN, RIGHT? YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MR. CONGRESSMAN? I SAID IT'S THE FIRST TIME OF EVER DONE THIS. I SAID THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD, THAT SOUNDS TOO CHEAP. MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE. MAKE IT 500,000. AND WE DID, WE DID IT FOR $500,000. AND IT'S JERUSALEM. EVERY TIME HE SHOWS ME JERUSALEM STONE, I GO CRAZY. I DON'T CARE. I SAID DAVID, YOU ARE IN JERUSALEM. CAN YOU GET JERUSALEM STONE? HE SAID YES, WE CAN BUY IT FOR NOTHING. I SAID GOOD. MAKE THE BUILDING OUT OF JERUSALEM STONE. WE HAD IT OPEN FOUR MONTHS LATER FOR $500,000. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT BUILDING BUILT FOR 25 YEARS. WE DID SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WE DO SOMETHING FOR A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST AND WE HAD IT OPEN AND THREE AND A HALF, FOUR MONTHS. IT'S A GREAT EMBASSY. IT'S RECOGNIZED, JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. I ALSO RECOGNIZE IS REALLY SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. WE GOT IT DONE INTO OURS. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT FOR 52 -- WE GOT IT DONE IN TWO HOURS. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR 52 YEARS. INSTEAD OF NEVER-ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE WORKING PIECE DEALS ALL OVER THE PLACE. NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. BIDEN AND OBAMA MADE A PATHETIC ONE-SIDED DEAL WITH THE CASTRO DICTATORSHIP. MY OPPONENT STANDS WITH SOCIALISTS AND COMMUNISTS. I STAND WITH THE PROUD PEOPLE OF CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND VENEZUELA IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM, AND WE ARE WINNING. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ALSO NEGOTIATED THE TERRIBLE OBAMA BIDEN SANTOS DEAL WITH COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS, SURRENDERING TO THE NARCO TERRORISTS. THE FIRST LADY SITS ON OUR COMMISSION. SHE CHAIRS THE COMMISSION ON DRUGS IN AMERICA, HOW TO GET RID OF IT. A BLUE-RIBBON COMMISSION. WE ARE DOWN 19%. WE HAD A LITTLE SETBACK WITH THE RECENT PROBLEM WITH THE CHINA VIRUS, BUT IT'S GETTING BACK UNDER CONTROL. BUT SHE'S TAKEN IT DOWN 19 -- SHE AND THE COMMISSION HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN 19%. SHE DOESN'T WANT IT MENTIONED. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT REALLY DID IF THEY WERE SITTING IN HER POSITION, THEY WOULD BE HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE. I HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. I'M ONLY KIDDING. BUT SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. UNDER MY -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WORK WITH COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS TO SEIZE OR DISRUPT 227 TONS OF POISONOUS NARCOTICS SINCE APRIL ALONE. THE FACT IS I HAVE DONE MORE IN 47 MONTHS VAN SLEEPY JOE BIDEN HAS DONE IN 47 YEARS. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. NO ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS HAS DONE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, BIGGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY, BIGGEST REGULATION CUT IN HISTORY. EVEN ENVIRONMENTALLY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. WE WILL NOT GO OVER -- WE WILL BE HERE ALL DAY, BUT NO ADMINISTRATION, AND THE FAKE NEWS, IF YOU MAKE A STATEMENT AND IT'S LIKE 1% OFF, IT'S LIKE A HEADLINE THE NEXT DAY. IN THE COMING WEEKS, WE WILL DISTRIBUTE A VACCINE TO DEFEAT THE VIRUS. THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK. VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS LIKE THESE PEOPLE DOWN HERE. IT'S A VOTE FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN DREAM. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND REMEMBER, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE GREAT, THE LEGENDARY ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN. HIT WOULD YOU PLEASE REMEMBER THAT -- WOULD YOU PLEASE REMEMBER THAT? NOBODY KNOWS THIS. THEY KNOW IT NOW BECAUSE I LIKE TO SAY IT. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL TURN AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND WE WILL END OUR DEPENDENCE ON CHINA. WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL DEFEND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT WILL BE DEFENDED. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT, AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE SPENT TWO AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS ON OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE THE FINEST ROCKETS, THE FINEST MISSILES, THE FINEST TANKS AND SUBMARINES AND SHIPS. ALL MADE IN THE USA IN OUR NUCLEAR STOCKPILE. WE ARE IN A POSITION LIKE NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. CHINA, NORTH KOREA, NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS WHAT WE HAVE. AND JUST, A LOT OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE, PRAY TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. IT IS MORE LIKELY WE WON'T HAVE TO USE IT NOW THAT WE HAVE IT, BUT JUST HOPE THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. WE WILL REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY, LOWER DRUG PRICES EVEN MORE, AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE THE FIRST NATION TO LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTISM. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG, AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. FOR YEARS, YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.

DURING THE RIOTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN OUR GREAT, WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE AT LEAST 25,000 PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT. WE JUST SAW A LOT OF THEM. WE WANTED TO PAY OUR RESPECTS. THEY WERE HERE FOR A LONG TIME, THEY WAITED, AND IN THE GOVERNOR DID BAD THINGS. YOUR FAR-LEFT DEMOCRAT ATTORNEY GENERAL, KEITH ELLISON, AND YOUR DEMOCRAT DOVE , GOVERNOR TRIED TO SHUT DOWN OUR RALLY, SILENCE THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, AND TAKE AWAY YOUR FREEDOM, AND YOUR RIGHTS. [DOING] , [ BOOING] THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD CANCEL, A WORD THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH, CANCEL CULTURE. I SAID NO, I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA. I WILL NOT.

[APPLAUSE] WHEN LARGE NUMBERS OF RIOTERS AND VANDALS SACKED THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS EARLIER THIS YEAR, KEITH ELLISON DID NOT ASK THEM TO SUBMIT A PERMIT, HE TOLD THE THRONGS OF VIOLENCE DEMONSTRATORS, BY ALL MEANS, EXERCISE YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. HE SAID THAT. PRIOR TO THEM RIPPING DOWN YOUR CITY. KEITH ELLISON SIDED WITH FLAGBURNING EXTREMISTS OVER LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. HE TREATS YOU LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. HE BELIEVES THAT THE PRO-AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE FEWER RIGHTS THAN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATORS. KEITH ELLISON AND JOE BIDEN WANTS TO IMPRISON YOU IN YOUR HOMES WHILE LETTING ANARCHISTS, AGITATORS, AND VANDALS ROAM FREE AS THEY DESTROY YOUR CITIES AND STATES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ONCE YOU TO BE BANNED FROM PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY WHILE THEY ALLOW THEIR SUPPORTERS TO BURN DOWN A POLICE RIGHT HERE. BY THEN AND THE FAR-LEFT INCITE VIOLENCE WITH THEY ARE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC , THEY ARE VILE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC. THEY ALLOW RIOTERS TO LAY WASTE TO THE PUBLIC STREETS THAT THEY WERE FINANCED , AND THEY WERE FINANCED BY YOU WITH YOUR HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE RADICAL LEFT IS DETERMINED TO OBLITERATE THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THEY THINK THEY CAN INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN AND SILENCE YOUR VOICES. BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING MINNESOTA, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR A LONG TIME. THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION ARE GOING TO BE HEARD LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE IN RECORD NUMBERS. YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. AND THEY ARE GETTING VERY CONCERNED. THEY BAN YOU FROM GOING TO CHURCH WHILE THEY LET LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH , BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH. WHILE THEIR OWN JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. THEY KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL WHILE THEIR FAMILIES HIRE PRIVATE TUTORS. THEY FLOOD YOUR STREETS WITH ILLEGAL DRUGS AND GANGS WHILE THEY LIVE IN WALLED OFF COMPOUNDS. THEY WANT TO DESTROY AND WORK HARD TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS, WHICH I'M PROTECTING. AND TERMINATING HORRIBLE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ONLY PERTAIN TO THE SUBURBS, WHILE THEY MOVE INTO GATED COMMUNITIES WITH ARMED GUARDS. THESE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE AND TAKE YOUR GUNS. WHILE THEY ARE PROTECTED BY ARMED GUARDS. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR DIGNITY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY AND COUNTRY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO PRESERVE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. YOU MUST SHOW UP AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3.

ALL HE HAS DONE IS SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELLOUT TO CHINA , CHINA OWNS HIM. SELL OUT TO BIG PHARMA, AND SELLOUT TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. HE WILL LICK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN RIGHT AROUND , LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN AROUND AND STAB YOU. THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT IS POLITICAL POWER AND HE WILL USE THAT POWER TO HURT YOU AND ENRICH HIS CRONIES AND FRIENDS. AND MOST OF ALL TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY.

TERRORISM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, INCLUDING FROM SYRIA, SOMALIA, AND YEMEN. WE ARE KEEPING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.

BIDEN HAS PLEDGED A STAGGERING 700% INCREASE IN REFUGEES FROM THE MOST DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT TERRORIST HOTSPOTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. HE IS ALSO ABOUT TO TERMINATE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY TRAVEL BANS, CHECK FONT VERY HARD TO GET, WHICH I ONE , WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. HE SAID BRING THEM IN. BIDEN'S DEADLY MIGRATION POLICIES WILL OVERWHELM IN SODA AND OVERWHELM TAXPAYERS AND OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO TERRORISTS, JIHADISTS, AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS.

I AM FIGHTING FOR HIGHER WAGES, MORE JOBS, MORE OPPORTUNITY, AND WE WILL KEEP IT RIGHT THERE AND WE WILL BRING IT RIGHT HERE TO THE USA, WHERE IT LONGS. , BELONGS. JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER SUCCEEDED BEFORE. BARACK OBAMA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THINGS SCREWED UP, JUST ASK JOE BIDEN TO DO IT. JOE BIDEN WILL SHIP YOUR FACTORIES TO CHINA, IMPOSE A $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE, ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE, ABOLISH THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY AND FRACKING, AND SEND YOUR STATE INTO A CRIPPLING DEPRESSION. BIDEN'S ANTI-ENERGY ANTI-WORKER POLICIES WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKERS ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. BIDEN WILL ALSO CONTINUE HIS 47 YEARS OF CRUELLY BETRAYING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE CALLED THEM SUPERPREDATORS IN 1994, RIPPED APART THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO WIPE OUT THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I THINK YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE THAT AT THE PHOTO BOOTH THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE HAS DONE BETTER THAN ANYBODY. SUPERPREDATORS, HE SAID NOW BIDEN WANTS TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE INS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ALL-AMERICANS. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE IS DOING. HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BY FAR. BIDEN'S PLAN TO DELAY THE VACCINE, POSTPONE THERAPIES, CRASH THE ECONOMY, AND SHUT DOWN OUR ENTIRE COMPANY.

ANOTHER VITAL ISSUE IS THE MINNESOTA IRON RANGE. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE. IT WAS DEAD, IT WAS CLOSED, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT. AS VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN TRIED TO OBLITERATE THE IRONY RANGE. , IRON RANGE. THERE WAS BARELY A WHIMPER. I BROUGHT THE IRON RANGE GOING BACK TO LIFE. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN MINNESOTA. THEY SAID IT WAS SO UNFAIR. WHEN IT WAS CLOSED, AND MAY COME UP TO ME , I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS , HE WAS A STRONG, POWERFUL MAN AND HE WAS CRYING AND HE SAID, THEY HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE AWAY FROM ME. THAT WAS THE MOST CONVINCING OF ALL. WHEN I SAW HIM I SAID, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT IS FULLY OPENED AND DOING PHENOMENALLY. IT HAS THE BEST IRON, THEY SAY, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS MY HONOR. THAT AREA IS NOW THRIVING. IT WAS DESOLATE. NINE DEMOCRAT MAYORS HAVE ENDORSED ME, BECAUSE THEY KNOW BIDEN WILL SHUT DOWN THE IRON RANGE FOREVER. BY THE WAY, THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN AS FAST AS I OPENED IT UP AND THEY WILL SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY NEXT TIME. HE SAID WE MADE A MISTAKE, WE DIDN'T DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN PERMANENTLY. I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT. ESPECIALLY ON NOVEMBER 3. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BIDEN'S PLAN TO ADMIT FOREIGN WORKERS WILL/INCOMES, SURGE UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DEVASTATE YOU MIDDLE-CLASS. ALL TO ENRICH HIS GLOBALIST DONORS. HE RAISES MONEY LIKE CRAZY BECAUSE HE IS MAKING DEALS. I COULD RAISE MUCH MORE THAN HIM, THAT I WILL NOT BE COMPROMISED. AND WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY. THAT'S HOW THEY RAISED ALL OF THAT MONEY, BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING DEALS WITH WALL STREET. AS PRESIDENT I WILL ONLY ADVANCE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT PUT AMERICAN WORKERS AND FAMILIES FIRST. YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ARE MY ONLY SPECIAL INTEREST. THAT IS WHY I DID THIS. AND I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE BEFORE DOING THIS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER BE FORGOTTEN AGAIN. YOU KNOW THAT AND YOU SAW THAT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A VERY, VERY EXCITING TIME.

A VOTE FOR ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ABOUT FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM , IS A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT IMPORTANT TIME HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. THIS IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THIS TUESDAY OR SOONER, GET OUT AND VOTE. EVERYONE OF YOU. REMEMBER WHAT YOUR GOVERNOR DID THIS EVENING.

WE DEPEND ON YOUR BOAT. WE DEPEND ON YOUR LOYALTY, AND YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY , THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU FOUND OUT. [APPLAUSE] TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY.

Due to state mandated coronavirus pandemic restrictions, the campaign had to limit the attendance to 250 people. Speaking about the crowd limitation, President Trump decried the mandate, saying that Governor Tim Walz (D) and state Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) &ldquo;tried to shut-down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom, and your rights.&rdquo;   Due to technical difficulties, a small portion of the president&rsquo;s remarks could not be shown.	477541-1	Speech
CSPANDT31102020102	Donald Trump	2020-10-31	President Trump Holds Rally in Butler, Pennsylvania	Thank you very much. Hello, Pennsylvania. Let's go, Pennsylvania. We've got to do the same thing we did four years ago. And I have a feeling. Look at this. I have a feeling looking and hello, Butler. Butler. Three days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on. We are going to win for MAWR years in our great on beautiful White House. With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations and ensure mawr products are stamped very proudly with that wonderful term made in the USA. Nobody else talks about that. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You saw what happened the other day. They don't like to report it. GDP 33.1. Biggest in history. Biggest in history, by far. Some people says one of the biggest moments for our country. Economically, they don't like to report it. There's a lot of a lot of fake news out there. A lot of fake news. Thank you. Thank you. Joe Biden. will shut down your economy, ship your jobs to China, where they pay him a lot of money. Raise your taxes $4 trillion and send your state into a deep and catastrophic depression. This was gonna happen. Going to raise your taxes is the only man I've ever seen. He campaigns. We will raise your taxes. All my life I've seen guys, you know, you studied politics and you say I've never seen them and say, We're gonna raise your That's his primary thing. We're going to raise your taxes. It will end. Fracking. That was the other thing, Mama. He said it for a year. And then he came to Pennsylvania. They said We have a million jobs. Okay, well, we'll be fracking. But the people won't let him. His bosses won't let him. Biden has vowed to abolish the entire U. S. Oil industry. No fracking, no mining, no natural gas, no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer, no electricity during peak hours and gas prices. You like that? $2 gas, right? How about $5? $6.7 dollars, darling, let's sell the car. It's a little bit too large Let's get a compact. Biden's plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. He will outlaw fracking and eradicate your great economy. Had the greatest year you've ever had last year. Now, next year, you're gonna have the best. If this happens with the taxes and with the fracking, you're gonna have a real problem in Pennsylvania. Kamala Kamala Harris. You know you have to pronounce your name Exactly. Writer. She gets very upset with you, although are great. Vice President Beat her vory badly in that debate, wouldn't you say? Right? Very badly. By far the most liberal senator and the U. S. Senate. Fact, Bernie Sanders is like a conservative by comparison. She even sponsored the green New deal. That's another beauty. The green new Deal. But I have great news for Pennsylvania. So this has just happened. This is like breaking news. Are you ready for breaking news? Yeah, because we have to protect you. You ready? Moments ago I signed in order to protect Pennsylvania fracking at block. Any effort to undermine energy production in your state. So, in other words, if one of these maniacs come along and they say we're gonna end fracking, we're going to destroy the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. You could say sorry about that. You have just I signed it on the beautiful Marine one. Did you see that? I said go right over them. Did you see it go right over you? Yeah. A good way to arrive, right? I just signed it on the helicopter, just signed it and, uh, on a very honored to have done it. So we're protected. So now if they say we're going to do this or that, let's just say they're gonna have ah, long fight. Pennsylvania oil and natural gas in the Marcellus Shell contributes $45 billion to your local economy. I'd say 45 billion is a lot. No, but he said if so, for what? A year. Right? He's on the stage with the Super Liberals. Had, like, 27 of them. We only had 17 running for the Republican. You remember 17 plus one? I was the one and they said no, he doesn't really want He just wants to have a good time. No. And by the way, you consider this a good time. Okay. Okay. Let me ask you, Is there a better place to be anytime, anywhere than a trump rally. Right? Wait, You know why I have a good time? Because no president, no administration has dunmore in the 1st 3.5 years with tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military and helping our vets and all of the things we've done. And therefore I have a good time, but we're fighting a vory nasty, deep state. And if we win and we're going to I think you know, I don't know if you see what's going on Florida. Oh, it's looking very good. They're very concerned. They say, What's going on in Florida? We love Florida. We're getting a lot of votes down there. This isn't based on polling, you know, Polling. Where they said, Let's see. What are we gonna give him today? Let's put him down like, 30. What are we gonna do? Suppression, You know, let's do a surprise. No, no, the votes are actually coming in. We're looking very good in a place called Pennsylvania. But don't tell me. Thank you. Uh, right. Mike, have you seen Ah, great Congressman Mike, have you seen? Very good. Very good numbers. Very, very good numbers. Incredible. But, you know, when you have crowds like this and honestly, we've This is my third stop. Can you believe I have 1/4 1? I have 1/4. 1 other guys that go home, Darling, what are we having for dinner? I say I got to speak in front of another 25,000 tonight. All right, way gotta do what we gotta do. We gotta get the job done. Just make sure you get out and vote. But Pennsylvania oil and natural gas supports nearly one million Pennsylvania jobs. So when sleepy Joe heard that he said, Yeah, of course. I like fracking, you know? But it's not gonna happen. It won't happen. You know, it's not riel, and it's one of the state's top exports. That's what it is. Energy is your top or one of your top exports is your biggest. The biggest thing you do. If Joe Biden is elected, he will cancel our and you know that he's going toe. Terminate frankly, better word. Terminate your energy industry and every job because they want to goto wind. You know they want to go. They don't even want wind. Honestly, I don't think they want energy period closed down every factory. I don't think they want anything. I don't think they have any idea what they want. I know Joe doesn't for a fact. Even he is now closed. He is totally shot. Okay. You see the new sunglasses, the aviator glasses. They should be a little bit larger. Covers up those new eyes. A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban fracking bad mining and completely destroyed Pennsylvania. Otherwise, he's not bad. You know, a vote for May is a vote to remain energy independent and build the strongest economy in history of your state. And if you're and our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, that was the 33.1% that the fake news doesn't wanna talk about. Think of that faster than any nation in the world. In the past five months, we've created a record 11.4 million American jobs. That's all right. Nobody is. We've never done that. We've never done it. You know what we built such a strong foundation. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. And when we have the plague, we had the plague coming from China, and we had to close it up for a little while and we closed it up and then. But the foundation was so strong. And that's why I don't know if you saw auto production housing production. The numbers air through the roof. Many of the numbers are bigger and better. Did you know this Mike Kelly? The numbers are bigger and better than they were before the plague came in. Okay, It's pretty amazing, right? It's pretty amazing. That's because the foundation, if we didn't have if we didn't have the foundation, would be just the opposite. We would have been in big trouble and again faster than any other nation. While foreign nations are in a total freefall. We're creating the world's greatest economic powerhouse, and that's what we're doing. We're gonna have a greater year next year. I mean, unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes, we're gonna raise taxes. A recent Gallup poll this is amazing just came out found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were four years ago under Theo Obama, Biden administration and in all fairness, that's during a pandemic and we're rounding the corner of the planet. But that's during a pandemic. Think of that in Biden. Thank you too. Why don't he said Well, he's gonna have a They're back there that you can't even see. You can't even say no. You can't even see the end of people. A lot of people, a lot of people here. If Biden gets in, the economy will collapse. To save your steel jobs. I imposed historic tariffs on dumped steel. Remember? They were dumping. China was dumping steel all over the place. I said you're dumping Still. We didn't do it. Oh, it didn't know. I say that. Send it through other countries, right? We didn't do it. Let's say how did that country do it? They don't have a steel mill. They don't make the product. We didn't do it came through. We won't use the name came through Thailand. Oh, but they don't do this. They don't happen to do this. We save 1400 jobs at eight. K steel right here in Butler. Anyy working in a Oh, I know they're voting for us. All right. Way did a good job. That was not good. What? That's great. I love that Biden will remove all the tariffs, he said. I'm going to take the tariffs off. They pay us tens of billions of dollars a year. We never got 10 cents from China, China's Dunmore to hurt our economy for years and years. They take out hundreds of billions of dollars, not millions. Millions is a lot hundreds of billions of dollars that $507 billion came got out of our country. And then on top of it, we have the pandemic, which they could have stopped. They stopped it from going into the rest of China. We think we think, you know, they're very secretive. Have you ever heard that they're a little different than our country? They talk about deaths. Yes. One person passed away in China? No, they had They had a big They had a big problem too, but they could have stopped it. Instead, it went out to Europe, the U. S. And the rest of the world 188 countries. So it was really so Congratulations. Because Biden will close down a K steel. How do you feel about being closed down? They don't like that idea. He will, though that's what happens. Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of. Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs, that's for sure, and supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for ah, half a century. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, where they are considered at a level where they get all the advantages. We don't get the advantages. They're considered a developing nation. I said, No, no, you're not going to be a developing nation. We're a developing nation because if you're developing nation, you get all of the advantages and we were treated very badly and we said, Look, we're gonna have to talk about this, you know, we pulled out of the World Health Organization. You know why? No. So we have 325 million people. China has 1.5 billion people, right? We paid $500 million a year. They paid $39 million a year. In addition to that, they had guys. And for this I give them credit. But they had guys that practically ran the place. Right? So they're paying 39 we're paying 500 we have a smaller population. But we have a stronger economy, and we were beating them. You know, all of our for the last 10 years, anybody in business you heard 2019 China will surpass the United States into the economy that China was going to be, Ah, bigger economy than 2019 2019. And then I came along and we were skyrocketing way, way above. They would have never They would have never caught us. They would have never caught us. Then we got hit with the plague. But now we're we're bringing it back into You know, I talked about a V and the fake news said it won't happen. So Super v super vague. Thank thank you very much. Thank you very much. No, we have a super V. That's even better. They all said, Oh, it won't be a V. It'll be a K or it'll be a desk. They have no idea what the hell they're talking. They want to make it as bad as possible, but it's a super V. That's what's gonna happen. And, uh, big thing in the election. If we win, you're gonna see a stock market that roars. We have a headwind and the head winters, we're in an election. If Biden never got in, you'll go. E mean, can you imagine quadrupling everyone's taxes and all of the regulations put back on? And I'm a believer in regulation, but not where it takes you 20 years to build a highway. Not we're down to, by the way, we're down to two years. We're gonna get it down to one, and it may get rejected on if it does, that's fun for safety reasons for environmental reasons, something but you're gonna know in a year, and you're gonna be able to build your highway. And it's so much you have no idea we have done. You are so lucky. I'm your president. You are so lucky. You are so lucky that we've taken this journey together. We've taken this journey, this beautiful journey together. And it is. It's been an amazing journey. But we've accomplished so much at every turn. Biden twisted his knife into the backs of Pennsylvania workers. When sleepy Joe Biden was giving China your jobs, his family was raking in millions and millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist on whether you like it or not, Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and you see what's happened and they don't like that. See, what they'll do is they're gonna do because they don't want any of that to get out. Because we've learned a lot about the media. They don't let any of this get out. They don't want any of it to get out. Nobody knew this. We have learned MAWR in the last two weeks about the media and about the tech giant's big tech. We've learned a lot. We learned a lot, but you know what the word spreads. It's very hard for them to take a look at this. The word spread if Biden wins, China wins when we win America wins and we produced the greatest economy. Never in 2016 Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first you mind. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, is because I'm not a politician. This is one of the reasons I got elected like these guys, like my friend's a good politician. If I don't always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder for you than any president has ever. For that I can't. And I'm not just running against Joe Biden. I'm running against the left wing media, the big tech giants, the rhinos. You know, the rhino is a rhino is Republican in name only. We know too many of them, right? But there they're a dying breed there. They can't believe it. They used to make so much money, and now they're they're reduced to doing other things. They don't like us too much, but that's okay. That's the way it's supposed to be. And the Washington Swamp we're draining the swamp was very deep and very vicious. On Tuesday, November 3rd, you can send them a message that they will never forget. You don't have to take my word or in Biden's betrayals. So what I do for very special states like Pennsylvania? What I do is we produce a video. Go take a look. Is that expensive video? Take a look. There's a lot of truth of that, is there? This election is a choice between a Biden Depression, which is what will happen or a trump boom. There's gonna be a boom. It's a choice between a deadly biden locked down. And by the way, Governor, open up the state of Pennsylvania. Okay, open up those schools, open it up, or a safe vaccine that ends. The pandemic is ending anyway. But we have the greatest companies in the world and we're literally weeks away, and we're going to mass distribute the vaccine and just a little while we have our great military doing it and they are set to do this. They're going to do it so quickly will eradicate more quickly the virus wipe out the China plague once and for all. And It's back to work back to work, which is what we want, you know we want. We want normal. We want normal. We want normal. Let's go back, Go back seven months. Hello? How you doing? Biden will delay the vaccine and impose a crushing locked down in all American. Jimmy wants to lock it down. He has no idea what they'll tell them what to do. He'll do whatever they ask, even on the youngest Americans who were at the lowest risk like Baron Trump, 14 years old. Sir, your son just tested positive, I said, Positive for what Doc? He's had. He's got He didn't say that. China plague. He said He's got Yes, he said, He's got Cove in. So he's 14. He's very tall, you know? Baron, Right? He's very tall, but he's strong, and you got to have I asked, like 12 minutes later. House Baron doing, sir. He's fine. It's all God. I said that wasn't too long. Dr. You sure he had it? Yeah, he had it. That's why I say Get the kids back to school, get him back, get them back to school. But I had it. I'm sure you didn't hear that? Did you hear that, sir? Did you see the debate the other night? Yes. It was a big debate that a lot of people watching That was good. That was good. We did a a good job of exposed. That was like Perry Mason. You know, the whole thing about the oil. I said, Well, wait a minute. Let's talk about this. We're just about ready to go off the air. Even she she looked Crystal walker. She was fair. She wasn't supposed to be. She was fair. She looked at him when he made the statement about you were going to transition out of oil. We're gonna transition out of this out of the fracking. And she said, Why did you say that? Right. Even I said I felt like Perry Mason. You know, in the end, everything is going badly. And then I did it. I did it. It was It was him. I'm going to transition. He didn't have to answer. I said, You mean you're going to get out of oil? You know, I'm going to transition. No, that's okay. What did you say? And I just hope you people were listening, okay? Because That's where it's coming. The bite locked out will result in countless deaths from suicide drug overdose, deferred medical care, all sorts of abuse, all sorts of problems. The cure can never be worse. Remember, I've been saying it from the beginning. Then the problem itself can't do that. He will imprison you and your home, letting rioters room free. You know, we call this a protest because the only way you could meet is if you have a protest. They they weren't expecting this kind of a protest, right? You know, if you want to go to church, Sure. If you want to go to church, you can't. If you want to burn down the stores and run down Main Street and knock people over and do whatever you want to dio, that's okay because they want to make sure that they could protest. Not with me. Under Biden, there will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Eastern. No Christmas, no Fourth of July. No, nothing other than that. You're gonna have a wonderful life Now. We've got a great future. We have more potential in this country. He made a mistake that I watched him. You know, it's really boring. 10 people in Obama came brought another 10 with them. They have nobody. All you hear is like a couple of horns and most of the horns air like from our people, you know, there. Did you see? And he called him. What did he calm ugly people or something that was terrible? He shouldn't say it's not politically correct. He's been in this business a long time, 47 years. He shouldn't be saying that she had. But most of the noises are people. It's like, Ah, this is some, you know, in history, there's never been a movement like this that really hasn't There's never been anything like this. There's never been and we have the fake news. 96% of gun says think of it because you're smart, smartest people. You you get it. No, you have them against, uh, their heads are exploding. As a friend of ours would say, If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your great family and freedom to live your life, then I am asking you to vote for Republican vote for Trump. Let's keep it going. Yeah, keep it going, We'll keep it going. We have more potential. But, Biden said today, he said, There's never been a better time to run. There's never been a better time to run this country. This country is in great shape, and I'm saying, Wait a minute, It's not supposed to be saying that It was sort of a strange statement. I don't know if anybody picked it up. I'm sure if they did, they wouldn't mention it. Oh, if I did, It's a disaster. I have to watch every word, even pronunciation. If you pronounce the words slightly off, you know you're talking for five days. One word. It's like, Oh, these people are the worst. Joining us today are the opposite of the worst, their warriors And they've been with me from the beginning. 1 97 to nothing with the fake impeachment three impeachment over a phone call. Hello, Congratulations on winning right Ukraine. If you see any corruption, please reported to the attorney general of the United States because they have a lot of corruption in Ukraine, they say, let's impeach him for that. And what a disgrace. Honest. Wasn't that a disgrace? Think of it the time wasted the time wasted. But we have some people that fought with May and one other things, too. And we way haven't lost. We haven't lost yet. We'll start with a man who is great, respected by everybody in Washington and here and loved by this entire state. Congressman Mike Kelly. Real friends, great great guy and another warrior guy. Ration Thaler guy. Where's guy? What happened to your location, guy? What happened? That's you being very nice to a lot of people, guy. That's very good. Thank you. Great help. And another one. Congressman G T Thompson, GT. Great. Thank you. Great job. The Warriors, they really are incredible. And we want to get you a couple of GT co. We get you a couple of other warriors. You mind congressional candidates? Luke Negrin look, degrade. Full of love. I heard you're doing very well. Look, go and get. Get him and get these people out. Get the Nancy Pelosi crowd out. Crazy Nancy. Crazy dancing. They don't represent your values. They don't. Another one is going to be an absolute star running against a lamb, a little lamb running against a lamb. And this guy is He's fantastic. I'll tell you have to see his record. He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a star. I'm even tweeting them all the time. I say he's got, you know, they fixed around and played around with the district. Now they're having a problem with ballots. They sent, like, thousands of ballots out and they were wrong. So they said, Oh, don't worry about him. Just send them and they will. You know where they'll send them? Thio. The Elections Commission. So Shawn's got to be careful, but Shawn is the star. Sean, Sean Parnell. Sean just start and he's a tough cookie. Tough cookie may be tough enough. I don't know. This is interesting. Showing may be tough enough to have played football for the great Lou Holtz, who's a friend of mine. Where is Lou Holtz? Come here. Hello? Come on. So Liu has been. Lou is a great great coach and a great guy, and he's an inspiration to a lot of people. Hey, just lost his incredible life. How many years? 59. That's that's what I'll never be able to top you on Luke, but he had a great wife who was really brave and what you went through. And he's getting the presidential medal of freedom for just an outstanding I wouldn't say so. Say something. I am just so humbled to be here. This crowd, the enthusiast and the people were tremendous. Anything I want to say is ask yourself if you didn't show up, who had missed you and why Think what would happen if President Trump hadn't shown up in the year 2016 and what is done for this country and how great. Let yeah, just show up on November 30 before then to make sure that this country has a chance. Because this isn't about Republican Democrat is about right versus wrong. Good versus able freedom fighting thing. Wow. Hey, I'm glad I brought him up, huh? That's great. He's a great gentleman. Great man. We're also joined by many members of U A W local 33 03 Where are you been? Great. They have been great. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it very much. Great people. We have so many endorsements from so many, but we have almost every law enforcement group is endorsing us Almost everywhere we have a lot. So who's with law enforcement tonight. Law enforcement? Yep, Tremendous. The Sheriff's Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, New York's finest endorsed first time they've ever endorsed endorsed the presidential candidates. So it's been great. Chicago. Can you imagine? Chicago, The police, Police in Chicago. They having a hard time. They have people that won't let them do their job. They just won't let them do their job. But you see it. You know when you see the New York stats go way up, Chicago, go way up and then Portland, we wanna go into Portland so badly take out the anarchists will take us about 25 minutes. You saw what happened in mini Annapolis. You know, after a week and a half, they could have called. They could have called a little quicker, like about an hour. But remember the CNN? Look, the light. The light always goes off. Whenever I turn the light off, he's talking about us again. It's all right. The ratings aren't that good. So it's not like you're listening to remember that guy does the little shave job. I was thinking about doing it, but I wanted to remain your president. No shave had he goes Ali vulture, right? Ali Velshi. I don't even know who the hell is. I just have a good memory, Ali, Vulture. And you know this is a peaceful protest. You know he's being hit by rocks, and so there's a peaceful protest. It's wonderful to see such a peaceful protest, and then they have the camera on him and behind you have a city that's burning. It's blocks long. I've never seen fire like that. I always say it looked like Berlin in the worst day of the war, and he said, This is a peaceful protest. Well, this is a peaceful protest off for 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed, insulted, jailed in attack black Americans. He called them superpredators. He used the term superpredators, and he's not a good person. And I could tell you, you know, because some people do him in prime time, this is no longer prime time. Now. He shot some people, knew him in prime time. He's not, and frankly, if he were, I would never say the things I say about it. But he's not a good person. I signed landmark criminal justice reform on in the second term will continue fighting for African Americans like never before, and I appreciate the support that I'm getting in the election. It's very early, but I really appreciate it from African Americans and from Hispanic Americans. The support has been incredible in in Florida. You have to see what's going on. You're gonna go home. They're trying to figure out what is going on. I never say we won Florida. I've never said we want anything, you know. But I'll tell you, it's gonna be tough for them to catch us. Gonna be very tough. We've had tremendous support from the black community, from the from the Hispanic community. It's been incredible all over all over, and we appreciate it. But when he's calling and using terms like Super Predator, which is a term that you can't use, but he used it all over the place to protect our security, I suspended the entry of foreign refugees from terror afflicted nations. Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in refugees from the most violent terrorists hotspots anywhere on Earth. If you don't mind, I'll end that and that was the deal. The manifesto that he agreed to with Bernie Sanders and a O C plus three. Right. So you have Bernie Sanders. This just actually took them further left. Bernie wasn't even the 700% increase. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and hospitals and open the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. Call France. Asked him. How are they doing? How are they doing? You saw what's happened. What's happened is is a disgrace. I called the president macron. Good, good friend of mine, Great guy. And I just gave our condolences on behalf of our country. But what's going on over there is terrible. So if you don't mind, will take a pass. Is that okay? You know, I passed the bad right, the band and everybody said, Oh, what a terrible thing. A lot of them said, What a terrible thing. But let's not fight it. And we We wanted the Supreme Court a long time ago, and now we keep people out who can't love our country or people that want to hurt people. We want him out and we will keep him out. I am also keeping the terrorists and jihadists we and and again, you know. Some people say that's not politically acceptable, but whether it is or not. I have to do what's right for our country. We are keeping them the hell out of our project. We invested $2.5 trillion most ever in the United States military. We have totally rebuilt our military. Our military was depleted. Our military was totally depleted from years of endless wars that just kept going on and on. We were. We became the policeman of nations, and we invested 2.5. We have the finest equipment in the world. We are the envy of Russia and China and North Korea and anybody else. We have equipment, the rockets and missiles and tanks and submarines, submarines. Nobody does, like we have the submarines and all of the things that we've been doing and building. And our planes. You have 35 stealth. You can't see it. It's hard to shoot down because you can't see it. The enemy says, you know, we want to figure that one out, and in five years they will. The only thing they won't figure out is the wall in the wheel, right? The wall in the wheel way are doing great on that wall. It's almost complete. That's why you don't hear about it. Way saved a place called I'm sure you never heard of it. The Philadelphia shipyard. You know that? And Biden. We're shutting it down. They were shutting it down and we said, No, thank you will keep it open and it's doing a good job. We also passed VA Choice and VA accountability Are great vets on? We recently got a 91% approval rating from our vets. So now the vets could go online on if they have to wait. Ah, long time to see a doctor. We have great doctors in there, but I have to wait two weeks, three weeks, a long time. They go out, they get a doctor, local doctor. We take care of the bill and we take care of our great vets. We take care of our vets. They've been trying to get that for 44 years or something. And the accountability is where they don't treat her. We have people that work there that don't treat our vets with respect. They don't treat them good. They don't love our vets like we do. And we couldn't do anything about it because of unions and because of civil service and lots of other reasons. And they've been trying to get this for over 40 years. And now if we have somebody that doesn't treat our vets right, if they're sadistic, if they steal from them, if they do bad things to them, we say, Jim, sorry. You're fired. Get the hell out of here. And we got a Mac and we terminated about 8000 people. That should have never been there. We couldn't do anything about it. So our vets are leading a much better life. Really, It's a It's a tremendous thing. Not that I like firing people. I don't like firing people, but they're leading a much better life. They were terrorists, Um, terrible people in there. They couldn't do a thing about it. You couldn't do a thing about it last night. They never thought they'd get that one passed last night in my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage. Kidnapped overseas was 96 hours, 96 hours. Our incredible people from the U. S. Special Forces brilliantly executed a daring nighttime operation. They kidnapped an American in a far away land over the last four years, we've rescued over 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. And we don't pay way. Never pay. If you pay, you'll have thousands of people. All of a sudden you can't pay now this this taught him a lesson. We had no casualties. Nobody injured except the other side was badly injured. I'll tell you, you have no idea. I won't tell you how badly injured. But they kidnapped an American and they can't do that. And I just wanna thank Special Forces. These air really special forces. But they're really special. People on today's operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs to try to kidnap our people. No matter where it may be, you cannot escape the long reach of American justice. So they did a great job. And as you know, we wiped out 100% of the Isis Caliphate Syria, Iraq. On we killed the vicious, horrible founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi. They were looking for him for 18 years. One of the first things I said is find Al Baghdadi and they found him and they killed him. That was Conan right, Conan The dog Conan who was incredible. In fact, they gave Conan far more credit than the President. But that's okay. He deserved it. Actually, we took out the mass murder of U. S troops and many troops and many people. The worst terrorist of them all. Soleimani is dead. Sulaimania. I withdrew from last administrations. Disastrous Iran nuclear deal. 150 billion for nothing for nothing. 1.8 billion in cash we gave them. Can you believe it? What is 1.8 billion Mike in cash? How did you let that happen, Mike? Uh, it wasn't my fault. I recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been working on it for 52 years. We got it done in two hours. And instead of endless war, we're forging peace in the Middle East. You see what's happening? They're all coming together. No more blood in the sand. Bye to a plunge us into one ridiculous foreign war after another. He loves the war stuff. It's like, Hey, we want to have the greatest stuff for the world. We don't have to fight. But if we ever fight, we only fight to win. We only fight toe, not Let's do this old. Let's not do that now. If we fight, we fight to win. Thank you. Thank you very much. A vote for me and the Republican Party is a vote to save the American dream. Very simple. Okay. And just remember, the late, great Abraham Lincoln happen to be a Republican. Right?

We're going to go to another part of Pennsylvania, and then we're gonna have such a big day on Tuesday. I understand. Now the fake news Can't believe it. They said this guy has, you know, they follow me, all of them. They say this guy's got a lot of energy all time. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China. And we've already started that long ago. Actually, we will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults and law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Way will defend the right to life free speech.

To me. It's good to do that. And we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land and astronaut on Mars. Very exciting on. Don't forget, that's on top of space force with everything else. We did space for us. We created the first new branch 75 years. Air Force was the last one. Now we have Space force. And we never even used to talk about that at the rallies, Right? I've actually dunmore. I really believe that. I think I've dunmore than I promise I may be the only politician If you call me a politician, we've dunmore that I promised. I think that might be a first. We'll have to check that out.

Respect our great American flag way will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. You know what? Democrat National Convention, right? The Pledge of Allegiance They took the word got out and I watch it. And I said they must have made a typo. The problem was that I heard it a second time, and I said that was not a typo.

Never gonna happen with our guys, Right, fellas, for years you had a president to apologize for America.

MASON, ALWAYS THAT LAST QUESTION, RIGHT? I DIDN'T DO IT. YES, I DID IT. THAT WAS SLEEPY JOE. I SAID THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOMENT. AND EVEN THE ANCHOR, KRISTIN, SHE LOOKS UP AT THEM SHE GOES, WHY DID YOU SAY THAT? SHE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU SAID IT, BUT THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS NOT TOO SMART. BIDEN WAS A CHEERLEADER FOR NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US. ELIMINATING HALF OF YOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS, MANY OF THEM CAME FROM RIGHT HERE. AT EVERY TURN, BIDEN TWISTED HIS KNIFE INTO THE BACK OF PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS. DURING THAT DEBATE, THEY WOULD SAY, WHY DID YOU DO THIS? YOU JUST LEFT. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT? THAT WAS THE EASIEST DEBATE I'VE EVER HAD. WELL, BIDEN , WHILE BIDEN WAS GIVEN CHINA YOUR JOBS, HIS FAMILY WAS RAKING IN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN, OK? WHEN HIS SON CONSIDERED A BOARD $183,000A A MONTH. THINK OF THIS. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS. WHEN WE WIN, AMERICA WINS. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. I SPENT A LOT OF LOT OF MONEY AT THAT CRAZY BOARD UP THERE. THANK YOU. IN 2016 PENNSYLVANIA VOTED TO FIRE THIS CORRUPT POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS PRESIDENT WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. THAT'S OK, RIGHT? AND IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I GUESS THAT'S WHY I GOT ELECTED. IF I DO NOT ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF WASHINGTON AND THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, IT IS BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU, AND I FIGHT HARDER FOR YOU THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THIS ELECTION IS LAW IN AND YOU KNOW ABOUT IT WELL YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LARGE CITY. IT'S NOT GOOD. YOU HAVE GREAT POLICE BUT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOBS. THIS WEEK, VIOLENT MOBS OF BIDEN SUPPORTERS RANSACKED PHILADELPHIA. NOW FOUR MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL ARE PUSHING VERY HARD TO DEFUND THE PHILADELPHIA POLICE. THEY ARE DEFUNDING THE POLICE. THEY'RE PUSHING VERY HARD. AND IT COULD HAPPEN. IT COULD HAPPEN. WE ARE WATCHING. I DO NOT THINK WE WILL LET IT HAPPEN. AT SOME POINT, WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. IF BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE ELECTED, THEY WILL PASS LEGISLATION TO SLASH POLICE FUNDING. THEY ARE ALREADY TRYING TO DO IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. EXCEPT IN REPUBLICAN CITIES AND STATES WHICH ARE RUNNING BLUE TO FLEE WITHOUT CRIME. , ARE RUNNING BEAUTIFULLY WITHOUT CRIME. THE RIOTERS AND THE ANARCHISTS AND THE LOOTERS, "WE" STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE BEEN ENDORSED BY ALMOST EVERY MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP IN THE COUNTRY, FLORIDA, TEXAS, NEW YORK'S FINEST ENDORSED US. THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE CHICAGO POLICE. THAT IS NOT EASY TO DO. THEY ENDORSED. WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FROM EVERYBODY. DURING THE DEBATE, I SAID, JOE WHAT LAW GROUP, ANY POLICE GROUP, ANYBODY LOOKING FOR LAW AND ORDER, DID ANYBODY ENDORSING? HE COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION HE WAS BAILED OUT BY THE ANCHOR. I SAID JOE, SAY THE WORDS "LAW AND ORDER." HE WOULD NOT DO IT. HE WOULD DID NOT WANT TO LOSE THE RADICAL LEFT. I AM NOT JUST RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN, I AM RUNNING AGAINST THE LEFT, THE RHINOS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY. THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE LEFT. THEY ARE ON RESPIRATORS, ACTUALLY. IN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP WHICH IS MUCH DEEPER AND WATCH MORE VICIOUS THAN WE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER THREE, MAYBE YOU DO IT SOONER BUT I THINK THIS GROUP WANTS NOVEMBER THROUGH 3. OF COURSE, NOW THAT OUR UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS DELAYED EVERYTHING, IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY INTERESTING EVENING, AND I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS DURING THAT PERIOD OF DEALLAY, WITH THE BALLOTS. ARE THEY GOING TO MYSTERIOUSLY FIND MORE BALLOTS, MR. CONGRESSMAN? CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED, CAN YOU IMAGINE? JUST BE VERY CAREFUL, BE VIGILANT AND WATCH AND REPORT WHATEVER YOU SEE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS STATE WE LOVE IT. WENT TO SCHOOL HERE, RIGHT? WENT TO COLLEGE. WE LOVE IT. BUT STRANGE THINGS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN. ESPECIALLY IN PHILADELPHIA. SO, SEND THEM A MESSAGE THAT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A BIDEN DEPRESSION AND A TRUMP SUPER BOOM. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BOOM. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY EVERY. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A DEADLY BIDEN LOCKED OUT. AND BY THE WAY, TELL YOUR GOVERNOR TO OPEN UP YOUR STATE, PLEASE. [CHEERS] CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AND OPEN UP YOUR SCHOOLS AND GET IT GOING. IT'S TERRIBLE. THIS ONE, MICHIGAN. HOW ABOUT HER? THE ONLY ONE THAT IS ALLOWED TO ROAM FREE IN MICHIGAN IS HER HUSBAND HE CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS. NOBODY ELSE CAN. AND NORTH CAROLINA, GREAT STATE, GREAT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE IT LOCKED DOWN. IT IS JUST CRAZY. BY THE WAY, ON NOVEMBER 4, THEY'LL ANNOUNCED, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE DECIDEDD TO OPEN UP YOUR HE THINKS HE HURT US POLITICALLY AND THEN WE HAVE A NUMBER LIKE 33 PART ONE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 34 POINT ONE. I DO NOT THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE WHICH OF A DIFFERENT SPIRIT HE IS HURTING A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A DEADLY LOCKED DOWN IN A SAFE VACCINE THAT ENDS THE PANDEMIC WITH OR WITHOUT THE VACCINE, WE WILL HAVE THE VACCINE, THE ONE OF THE GREATEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, PFIZER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, MOWED DOWN, AND OTHERS, AND WE'RE WEEKS AWAY FROM A VACCINE. AND WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THE VACCINE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HER TRANSPORTED BUYER MILITARY ROLLOVER, LOGISTICS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. , ALL OVER. AND IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT. IT IS GOING TO BE GIVEN TO OUR SENIORS FIRST. I THINK THEY HAVE TO GET IT FIRST AND THEN OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS. FREE, FREE. YOU KNOW WHY IT IS FREE? BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULT. IT WAS CHINA'S FAULT. AND IT WILL QUICKLY ERADICATE THE CHINA VIRUS. AND, BUT WITH OR WITHOUT IT, IT IS GOING TO GO AND WE ARE ROUNDING , IT DRIVES THEM CRAZY, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, IT'S GOING AWAY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT EUROPE, YOU LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EUROPE, THEY USE THAT AS LOOK AT EUROPE. TAKE A LOOK AT EUROPE. THEY HAVE A BIG PROBLEM AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THANKS TO OUR GROUNDBREAKING THERAPIES, OUR EXCESS MORTALITY RATE IS 40% LOWER THAN EUROPE'S. RIGHT NOW CASES ARE SEARCHING IN EUROPE. DESPITE YOUR CRONY AND LOCKDOWNS. THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKING DOWN AND DID NOT HELP THEM MUCH. SPREADING MISERY AND SUFFERING AND DESTROYING THIS NATION SPIRIT FOR MONTHS, DEMOCRATS CELEBRATED AS LEFT-WING RIOTERS TOOK TO THE STREETS BY THE THOUSANDS. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO RIOT, THEY DO NOT ASK ABOUT MASKS. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO RIOT, LOOT AND BURN DOWN YOUR MAIN STREETS AND BURNED DOWN THE GREATEST, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SHOPPING STREETS. THEY CAN DO WHATEVER, THEY CAN WALK OUT AND TELEVISIONS. YOU SEE THE GUY WALKING OUT WITH DISHWASHERS. HE IS PUSHING IT ALONG THE PAVEMENT. AND THE POLICE ARE TOLD, DON'T DO ANYTHING. STAND BACK. STAND BACK. OUR OPPONENTS DO NOT BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. THEY WANT UNLIMITED POWER OVER YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. THEY GOT OPEN IT UP. THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS ADVISING JOE BIDEN TO CALL FOR SLOWING DOWN THE VACCINE, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? NOW, IF IT WERE NOT IN MY OPINION SO POLITICAL, THEY JUST DID NOT WANT TO HAVE IT COME OUT BEFORE THE ELECTION. BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S RIGHT THERE, AND WE'RE READY TO GO. THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM TAKING IT. SO BAD, AND SO STUPID AND SO DANGEROUS. AND THESE ARE THE GREATEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO ANYBODY BUT THEIR PEOPLE, AND WE DO, WE HAVE A GREAT , VERY SOON BE DISTRIBUTED, THIS GREAT VACCINE. BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO HURT OUR COUNTRY IN ORDER TO TRY TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR CREDIT. WE'RE LOOKING TO SAVE LIVES. WE ARE LOOKING TO HELP OUR COUNTRY. HELP YOUR STATE. HELP OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO. DENYING PRIORITY TO ELDERLY PATIENTS. IMPOSING CRIPPLING LOCKDOWNS THAT WILL CAUSE REALLY SERIOUS PAIN. HE SAID, ONE OF THE POLITICIAN SAID IT, REALLY SERIOUS PAIN, THE BIDEN LOCKED DOWN WILL IMPRISON YOU WITH YOUR HOME WHILE LOOTERS ROAM FREE. YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW. THEY DO NOT OPEN UP THE STATE COULD CONGRESSMAN, YOU GOT A GET GOING ON THIS, I'LL TELL YOU. WE HAVE A GREAT CONGRESSMAN HERE. WE HAVE TO GET GOING. UNDER BIDEN, THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL, NO GRADUATIONS, NO WEDDINGS, NO THANKSGIVINGS, NO EASTER, NO CHRISTMAS AND NO FOURTH OF JULY. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE. THIS GUY RUIN AMERICAN YOUTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT TELEHEALTH IS BEEN AMAZING WITH THE COMPUTERS ON THE LAPTOPS, HAS BEEN GREAT. UP 8000% TO THE TRUTH IS IT'S GREAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, CHILDREN, THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN BECAUSE WE HAD THE ULTIMATE TEST, CHILDREN HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY HAVE TO BE WITH OTHERS. KIDS HAVE TO BE WITH CLASSMATES. AND THEY DO NOT CATCH IT. BARRON TRUMP, MY VERY TALL SON, HE'S STRONG AND HE'S YOUNG. THE DOCTOR SAYD, YES, SIR. HE TESTED POSITIVE. TESTED POSITIVE FOR WHAT? HE SAID, THE COVID. HE USED THE COVID WORD. I SAID, OH, THAT'S TILL. , THAT'S OK 12 MINUTES LATER THE DOCTOR CALLED AND SAID BARRON'S OK. THEY HAVE GREAT IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT IS STRONGER THAN YOU OR YOU. THAT GUY. DEFINITELY STRONGER THAN HIM. THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL, OK? OPEN UP PENNSYLVANIA, GOVERNOR. IF YOU WANT A VACCINE TO KILL THE VIRUS. A JOBS TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY AND FREEDOM TO LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT TO LIVE YOUR LIVES. VOTE OFRFOR A PERSON NAMED PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM?

I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DOING VERY WELL. THEY ARE REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE FLORIDA , THROUGH THE ROOF. OHIO, THROUGH THE ROOF. GEORGE IS LOOKING PHENOMENAL. TEXAS, I TOLD YOU, FORGET IT, IT'S LIKE , TEXAS IS SO GOOD. THE IOWA IS LOOKING GREAT. THEY ARE ALL LOOKING GOOD. NORTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW WHAT'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD? PENNSYLVANIA. GET OUT AND VOTE! MAYBE I SHOULD SAY IS GOING TO BE , NO, IT'S VERY CLOSE. LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS BEHIND. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD. TO THINK YOU ARE APPOINT OR TWO BEHIND, THESE PROFESSIONALS. LET'S JUST SAY IT IS VERY CLOSE. GET OUT AND VOTE ON TUESDAY. GET OUT AND VOTE. BUT IT'S TRUE. YOU NEVER KNOW? I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT. I WANT YOU TO THINK IT IS GOING TO GET CLOSE. DARLING, WE DO NOT HAVE TO VOTE TODAY. IS LOOKING GREAT. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A DISASTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANIC AMERICANS. I AM FIGHTING FOR CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, AND CREED. WE RECEIVED RECORD LOW AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR EVERYBODY. WITH A DIPLOMA, WITHOUT A DIPLOMA, NUMBER ONE YOUR CLASS AT M.I.T., WOMEN, EVERYTHING. WE HAVE HISTORIC RATES. THEN WE HAD TO CLOSE IT UP. AND UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. THE VENTILATORS, ALL THE THINGS WE DID. THEN WE'RE OPENING IT UP NOW AND IT IS GOING TO BE A SUPER V. THEY ARE SAYING, IT WILL NOT BE A V. NOW 33.1, A SUPER V. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE BEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY NEXT YEAR. BIDEN WANTS TO DO A QUADRUPLING OF YOUR TAXES. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I SAW IGNED LANDMARK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND I ANNOUNCED A PLATINUM PLAN WHICH WILL CREATE 3 MILLION NEW JOBS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND ALSO DELIVER SCHOOL CHOICE TO ANY PARENT THAT WANTS IT. THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME. TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY, I SUSPENDED THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN A FEW REFUGEES FROM TERRORIST , IF THAT'S OK WITH YOU DON'T MIND. WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE FROM TERROR INFECTED. THINK OF THIS. BIDEN IN THE MANIFESTO, THAT IS THE AGREEMENT HE MADE WITH CRAZY BERNIE SANDERS. WE GET A LOT OF THE SANDERS PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, FOUR YEARS AGO WE GOT A BIG PERCENTAGE OF BERNIE SANDERS BECAUSE THEY AGREE WITH ME ON TRADE. THEY KNOW EVERYONE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES ON TRADE, AND WE ARE DOING GREATER ON TRADE RIGHT NOW. BIDEN WANTS A 700% INCREASE IN REFUGEES FROM THE MOST VIOLENT TERRORIST HOTSPOTS ON EARTH, INCLUDING SYRIA, SOMALIA, AND YEMEN. NO THANKS, JOE. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT, JOE. NO, THANK YOU. THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA ARE NOT THRILLED WITH THAT. WHO THE HELL IS GOING TO VOTE FOR THAT? PEOPLE SAY IS I DO NOT THINK IS IT IS CLOSE. IT WILL BE EXTREMELY CLOSE. TRUMP WINS BY 44 POINTS. NO, IT'S CLOSE. THINK OF IT. HE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR, THE HIGHEST. HE WANTS PEOPLE IN FROM , WE WANT TO HAVE SAFETY AND SECURITY, AND THAT IS WHAT, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SUBURBIA, THEY WERE SAYING, WOMEN OF SUBURBIA. GOOD, THAKNNK YOU. BECAUSE ALL DAY, THEY WANT SAFETY, THEY WANT SECURITY AND THEY WANT THE REGULATION, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO NOT WANT TO GO INTO IT, THE REGULATION IS A DISASTER FOR SUBURBIA. YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO HEAD UP THE REGULATION PROJECT IS CORY BOOKER OF ALL PEOPLE. CORY? YOU, TOO, CAN HAVE A DEVELOPMENT RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF YOUR WONDERFUL HOUSE. NOW, IT'S NO GOOD. GOING TO BRING A LOT OF PROBLEMS. IT IS ALREADY DONE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THINK OF WHERE IT DONE. AND I TERMINATED IT. THEY WANTED TO AMEND IT. BEN CARSON IS A WONDERFUL GUY. BEN, HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY. HE IS. HE RAN A GOOD RACE. HE IS A GREAT GUY AND HE HAS DONE A BEAUTIFUL JOB HERE HE CAME AND WE SAID THAT WE CAN AMEND IT AND MAKE IT TOUGHER. I SAID, NO, BEN, WE GOT A TERMINATE IT. THEN I HEAR THE WOMEN OF SUBURBIA DON'T LIKE ME. THINK THEY LOVE ME. I THINK THEY DO. AND, WHEN I SAID THAT THE OTHER DAY, WOMEN OF SUBURBIA, I HOPE YOU LOVE ME. "60 MINUTES" SHE SAID, YOU ARE BEGGING FOR THE LOVE OF WOMEN. NO, I WASN'T. WOMEN OF SUBURBIA YOU MUST LOVE ME AFTER WHAT I DID. I CUT THE REGULATION. YOU KNOW WHAT THE REGULATION WAS? THE BIDEN CLUB. THIS YEAR HA SO MANY GUYS TOGUY HAD SO MANY YEARS. YOU JUST LEFT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. THE BIDEN PLAN WILL OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, TAKE A LOOK. I CALLED PRESIDENT MACRON OF FRANCE. IT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT IS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THERE THE LAST WEEK. YOU'VE SEEN WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN OVER HERE. IS THAT OK? DO I HAVE EVERYBODY'S APPROVAL OF THAT, HUH? EVEN THESE TWO TWO VETERANS ARE SAYING, WE AGREE WITH THAT. TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, AND WHEN THEY COME BACK IN, WE'RE GETTING THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, OK? WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION WITH A T IN THE U.S. MILITARY WHEN I TOOK OVER, ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO OUR MILITARY WAS DEPLETED FROM ALL OF THESE WARS AND ALL OF THE STUFF AND PLACES SO SO FAR AWAY . WE WERE DEPLETED IN A VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED GENERAL, EXTRAORDINARY OVERRATED, HE CAME INTO OUR OFFICE AND HE SAID AT THE BEGINNING, SIR, WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION. I SAID, NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HAVE THAT SAID TO HIM AGAIN. AND WE BUILT A BRAND-NEW MILITARY WITH NEW PLANES , RIGHT? HY[ERPER SONIC. THAT IS SEVEN TIMES FASTER THAN OUR VERY FAST ONE. SO FAST YOU CANNOT SEE IT, CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT. IF IT IS AIMED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, YOU GOT PROBLEMS, I TELL YOU. AND SUBMARINES AND ALL OF THE THINGS, WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE ALREADY ENVY OF THE WORLD. RUSSIA, CHINA, NORTH KOREA. WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT ON THE WORLD. WE HAVE PLANES, FIRE JETS, THEY GO TO THE DOZENS WHERE WE HAVE THE PLANE GRAVEYARD AND THEY TAKE PARTS OF , THIS ONE, NOW WE HAVE BRAND-NEW GF-35'S. IT IS AMAZING. WE ARE OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE NEVER HAD EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS. THE BEST EQUIPMENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. AND WE SAVED A PLACE CALLED THE PHILADELPHIA SHIPYARD. I DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF THAT. AND BIDEN IF HE COMES IN WILL SHUT IT DOWN. HE WILL SHUT DOWN A LOT OF THE STUFF. WE ALSO PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S PRETTY GREAT. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT DONE FOR 40 SOME ODD YEARS. LAST NIGHT AT MY DIRECTION, THE UNITED STATES MILITARY CONDUCTED A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TO RESCUE AN AMERICAN HOSTAGE WHO WAS KIDNAPPED JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO. U.S. SPECIAL FORCES BRUTALLY EXECUTED A , BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED A DARING NIGHTTIME MOVEMENT. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I HAVE SEEN IT. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. AND WE HAD NO CASUALTIES, NO INJURIES. THAT'S GOOD. NO, WE HAD NO CASUALTIES, NO INJURIES. INCREDIBLE. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY BUT THEY WENT IN. THE OTHER SIDE DID HAVE A LOT OF CASUALTIES. AND WE GOT OUR CITIZEN, OUR AMERICAN CITIZEN OUT, AND ON OUR WAY HERE. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE OPERATION. PEOPLE SAID THAT CAN'T BE DONE. SIR, THIS IS EASY. IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON, RIGHT? DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON. WE OWE A LOT TO SPECIAL FORCES. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE RESCUED 55 DETAINEES. AND WE DON'T PAY. ONCE YOU PAY IT WILL GO UP ONE HUNDREDFOLD. YOU CANNOT PAY. YOU HAVE TO GO GET THEM. YESTERDAY'S OPERATION SHOULD SERVE AS A START WARNING TO TERRORISTS AND THUGS WHO TRY TO KIDNAP OUR CITIZENS. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE LONG REACH OF AMERICAN JUSTICE. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI. THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR, FOR 18 YEARS. WE TOOK OUT THE MASS MURDER OF U.S. TROOPS AND MANY TROOPS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, SALOME KNEE IS DEAD. NUMBER ONE TERRORISTS. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, $150 BILLION. NOTE WE GOT? NOTHING. . I RECOGNIZE THE CALIPH OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM, AND I ALSO RECOGNIZED ISRAEL A AUBURN TEA OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. 523 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING THAT. I DID IT IN TWO HOURS. EVERY PRESIDENT WANTED TO DO IT. EVERY PRESIDENT. JERUSALEM, THEY ALL WANTED TO DO IT. THEY ALSO THEY WANTED TO DO IT. THEY GOT INTO OFFICE, THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO PULL THE TRIGGER. I GOT THE BUILDING BUILT, TOO. FOR A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD COST. IT'S TOO COLD TO BE TALKING ABOUT. THE HECK WITH IT, RIGHT? AND, INSTEAD OF IN THIS WARS, WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE ALREADY THREE COUNTRIES AND MANY MORE LINED UP. NO MORE BLOOD IN THE SAND, NO MORE CRAZY , ALL OVER THE PLACE. NO, WE DID AT THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT JOHN KERRY AND HIS PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT SMART , IN FACT THEY WERE GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. I SAID, HOW DID KERRY DO IT? WHATEVER HE DID, DO THE OPPOSITE. AND IT WORKED. WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM ALL LINED UP. PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR NOTHING, AND NO BLOOD, NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. THERE IS BLOOD ALL OVER THE SAND. THERE IS NO BLOOD IN THE SAND. I WILL PERHAPS BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN DECADES WHO HAS STARTED NO NEW WARS, NO NEW WARS. BUT, IF WE DO EVER DO START A WAR, WE WILL FINISH IT AND WE WILL FINISH IT VICTORIOUSLY. A VOTE FOR ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A VOTE TO SAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN DREAM, AN AMERICAN DREAM. WE'VE LOST SIGHT OF THAT. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF YEARS. REMEMBER I CAME OUT AND CAMPAIGNED IN NEW YORK , YOU AWILL SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. THEY WERE SAYING, HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYBODY. THE SNOW AND THE RED AND THE WHITE, EVERYTHING PERFECT. NOW THEY ARE ALL SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. AND WE REMEMBER , THE LATE GREA T ABRAHAM LINCOLN, RIGHT? THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, IN CONCLUSION, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OVER THE WORLD AND WE WORK END OUR RELIANCE ON , WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA AND WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTY FOR ASSAULTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL DEFEND THE RIGHT TO LIFE, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE WILL END SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY, ALREADY SIGNED JANUARY 1, GOES INTO EFFECT, BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE OR YOU WATCH. LOWER DRUG PRICES EVEN MORE. FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE. WE PAID FOR YEARS AND YEARS THE MOST EXPENSIVE BY FAR IN THE WORLD. NOW WE WILL PAY THE SAME AS THE LOWEST. AND THE DRUG COMPANIES DO NOT LIKE ME TOO MUCH, I WILL TELL YOU. THEY ARE NOT A BIG FAN OF YOU, PRESIDENT. I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE I DID IT. FAVORED NATIONS. WE PAID THE LOWEST PRICE IN THE WORLD. PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS. IT'S PROTECTED. AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON TO LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS. AND NASA- IS NOW AGAIN THE TALK OF THE WORLD, SPACE CENTER. THE TALK OF THE WORLD. IT WAS BOARDED UP, SHUT UP. THE RUNWAYS, THEY HAD GRASS GROWING THROUGH THE CRACKS. IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE. AND YOU KNOW, WE , THEY LIKE SENDING UP ROCKETS. I SAID LET THEM SEND UP ALL THE ROCKETS THEY WANT. LET THEM PAY FOR IT. WE WILL LEAVE THEM THERE. AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN. THEY BECOME A LITTLE LESS WEALTHY AND THAT'S OK, THEY DON'T MIND BUT THEY LOVE SENDING UP ROCKETS, AND WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT NOBODY CAN EVEN BELIEVE AND WAS SPACE FORCE IT IS UNNECESSARY, SO WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IT. AND MIKE PENCE IS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB ON IT. REALLY DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY,, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO IN GOD WE TRUST. FOR YEARS YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF AND, YOU KNOW, IF WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, IT'S OVER, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? I'M FREEZING UP HERE. YOU HAD BETTER GET OUT. SIR, UYYOU LOST BY A FEW VOTES IN PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT THE HELL DID I MAKE THAT TRIP FOR? THEY SAID, WE CAN CANCEL. IT HAS BEEN A LONG DAY. I STARTED THIS DAY VERY EARLY. I SAID, NO, I DO NOT HAVE THE COURAGE , NOT ONLY DID WE NOT, WE ARE GIVING YOU THE FULL TREATMENT. I COULD DONE ON ONE OF THOSE, HEY, FOLKS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? EVERYBODY GOOD? SEE YA LATER. YOU GET OUT THERE AND VOTE, BECAUSE YOUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE. YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR VOTE TO SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR YOUR CHILDREN, FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3. WE MUST FINISH THE JOB AND DRAIN THE SWAMP. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON IT, BUT IT IS DEEPER AND MORE VICIOUS THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT. MORE VICIOUS. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THESE BIG TECH COMPANIES. NOBODY TOLD ME THIS. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE HAVE COME THROUGH SITUATIONS, IT'S AMAZING, GHETTO? , YOU KNOW? THEY CANNOT BELIEVE. ONE OF THE REASONS I ALSO CAME AS I WANTED THEM TO STAND THERE ALL NIGHT. THIS IS FREEZING. IN THIS FREEZING WIND. NO. BUT IT IS AN HONOR. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. I KNOW THIS PART OF THE STATE. AND YOU HAVE JUST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD'VE HAD THE COURAGE, LET'S NOT DO IT TODAY. LET'S DO IT SOME OTHER TO MY. WE DO NOT DO THAT STUFF. ESPECIALLY TO YOU. FOR GENERATIONS AMERICANS , WAS MADE AND FORGED AND WON IN PLACES LIKE JOHNSTOWN AND PITTSBURGH, ERIE AND ALTOONA, BETHLEHEM AND MONTOURSVILLE. A NICE NAME. OUR AMERICAN ANCESTORS GAVE THE IR BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FREEDOM. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN HEROES WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED THE CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, LAID DOWN THE RAILROADS, RAISED UP THOSE GREAT BEAUTIFUL SKYSCRAPERS, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND MADE AMERICA INTO THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT IS REALLY WINDY UP HERE. THANK GOODNESS YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOESN'T NEED TELEPROMPTERS BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE VIRTUALLY USELESS. THEY ARE BLOWING ALL OVER THE PLACE. THAT'S TRUE. THEY ARE BLOWING ALL OVER. WE STARTED OFF TODAY IN TWO GREAT PLACES. WE WENT TO IOWA. I TELL YOU WHAT, IN IOWA, WE HAD THE COLEUS, WINDIEST , BUT IT WAS WARM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WERE WARM AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN IOWA VERY BIG. VERY BIG. WE HAD A COUPLE OF COLD STOPS TODAY. ONE WAS SO COLD WE TALKED ABOUT REFUGEES. WE SET IF THEY COME IN, THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO GO BACK IMMEDIATELY. IF BIDEN AND HARRIS GET IN, THE ECONOMY WILL COLLAPSE AND OUR COUNTRY WILL GO INTO AT LEAST A FREEFALL, BUT PROBABLY A DEPRESSION. THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY WANT TO DO LOTS OF THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN STAND FOR. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN STAND FOR. FRACKING DOES NOT PERTAIN SO MUCH TO IT. IT DOES PERTAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO YOU THAN IT WOULD TO PENNSYLVANIA. THEY ARE TAKING AWAY YOUR FRACKING, BUT WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING IS YOUR ENERGY COSTS WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF. THAT WOULD BE VERY BAD FOR THIS INCREDIBLE STATE. THEY WANT TO MASSIVELY INCREASE REGULATIONS, SEND YOUR JOBS OVERSEAS, DESTROY THE SUBURBS. WELL, WE ARE KEEPING THE SUBURBS. I GOT RID OF THE REGULATION THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE SUBURBS. THEY WILL BRING THEM BACK WERE SLAIN NEVER BEFORE. TERMINATE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, OUTLAW PRIVATE HEALTH CARE, AND SHRED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS, AND INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN WITH ANTI-AMERICAN LIVES. [BOOING] BIDEN HAS VOWED TO ABOLISH U.S. OIL, U.S. FRACKING, NATIONAL GAS, INDUSTRY. LOOK WHAT HE HAS TALKED ABOUT DOING. BUT IT IS NOT HIM. HE'S SHOT. IT IS THE RADICAL LEFT. ENERGY PRICES WILL EXPLODE AND THAT WILL CRIPPLE OUR COUNTRY. WE RIGHT NOW ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WHAT WE HAVE GOING WE HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE. BIDEN'S ENERGY BAN WILL SEND EVERY STATE FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO MICHIGAN TO PENNSYLVANIA INTO A VERY, VERY SEVERE PROBLEM, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. WE WORKED TOO HARD. WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THEN THE PLAGUE CAME IN FROM CHINA. IT CAME IN FROM CHINA. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED IT. THEY STOPPED IT FROM GOING INTO CHINA, BUT IT CAME TO US AND EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO EVER FORGET. WE WILL NEVER FORGET. BUT NOW WE ARE BUILDING OUR ECONOMY BACKUP, AND IT IS GOING IN A V BUT REALLY IT IS A SUPER V. WE WILL REMAIN THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ON THE PLANET EARTH, AND WE WILL REMAIN ENERGY INDEPENDENT. OUR OPPONENT'S AGENDA IS A WAR ON WORKERS, A WAR ON FAITH, AND A WAR ON OUR GREAT POLICE. BIDEN SAYS HE IS RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD AMERICAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING "USA"] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BY THE WAY, I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS. WE HAD SOMETHING INCREDIBLE HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT AND THERE IS MORE ENERGY. THE CROWDS ARE BIGGER. EVERYTHING IS HOTTER. BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY , AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IT BECAUSE THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF TIME , NEVER THOUGHT, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION PERHAPS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. GET OUT AND VOTE. YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS A DIEHARD GLOBALIST WHO SPENDS 47 YEARS OUTSOURCING JOBS, OPENING YOUR BORDERS, AND SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN RIDICULOUS ENDLESS WARS, AND THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. NORTH CAROLINA LOST NEARLY HALF OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS THANKS TO NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER. AND WE GOT RID OF IT. NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. WE DID IT ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BIDEN AND HIS GROUP SHIPPED YOUR JOBS AND YOUR FACTORIES TO CHINA AND OTHER PLACES IN FARAWAY LANDS, RAKING IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIMSELF, IT TURNS OUT. WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. HIS SON WAS LIKE A HUMAN VACUUM CLEANER. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TODAY, DAD? I THINK I AM GOING TO UKRAINE. LET ME PICK UP A COUPLE OF BUCKS. HUNDRED $83,000 A MONTH , $183,000 A MONTH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TODAY, DAD? I AM GOING TO RUSSIA. GOOD. SO THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW'S WIFE GAVE HIM $3.5 MILLION, RIGHT? AND HERE IS THE SCARY PART. THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT RIGHT BACK THERE, THE FAKE NEWS, THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [BOOING] AND BIG TECH WILL REFUSE TO PUT IT ON AND THEY WILL TERMINATE THE NEW YORK POST. NEW YORK POST, I HAVE TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT. NUMBER ONE, THEY ENDORSED ME, WHICH IS NICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GOT ENDORSED TODAY BY THE PITTSBURGH GAZETTE, AND IT HAS NOT HAPPENED , THEY ENDORSED A REPUBLICAN TODAY. THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT IN DECADES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PITTSBURGH. WE GOT ENDORSED BY A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. WE GOT ENDORSED BY GREAT PEOPLE AND A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS ARE ENDORSING US BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS NOT UP TO THIS JOB. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WATCH HIM FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. HE IS NOT UP TO THIS JOB. ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU, PRESIDENT XI, PUTIN, KIM JONG-UN, THEY ARE VERY SHARP. THEY ARE ALL VERY SHARP, AND WE CANNOT HAVE A LEADER BUT IS NOT SHARP. JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN WHO IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HOW CAN YOU HAVE A GUY WHOSE SON WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION TO MANAGE? THAT MEANS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AGAIN. WHOSE SON ASKED FOR $10 MILLION A YEAR FOR INTRODUCTORY PURPOSES, RIGHT? $10 MILLION A YEAR. AND HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. CHINA WOULD JUST HOPE THAT I DON'T WIN BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR, FIRST TIME EVER WITH CHINA. SAVED OUR STEEL MILLS, SAVED OUR STEEL AND ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES. IN 2016 NORTH CAROLINA VOTED TO FIRE THIS CORRUPT POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND YOU ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT IS BECAUSE THANKFULLY I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. NEVER WILL BE. AND IF I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF WASHINGTON AND THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, IT IS BECAUSE I FIGHT FOR YOU AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYONE WHO HAS FOUGHT HARDER FOR YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE BEFORE DOING THIS. I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE. [CROWD SHOUTING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS SUCH A GREAT HONOR. I SAID, DID ANYBODY EVER HEAR THAT? RONALD REAGAN, WE LIKED OTHERS. NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD IT, AND I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. MY OPPONENT IS PROMISING A LONG, DARK WINTER. DID ANYBODY SEE THE DEBATE? I AM SURE NOBODY WATCHED IT. HE DID NOT DO TOO WELL. HE SAID, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A LONG, DARK WINTER. SO INSPIRING. HOW ABOUT SOMEBODY SAY, I REALLY LIKE , I DON'T THINK ANYBODY LIKES HIM. LET'S WATCH BIDEN TONIGHT ON TELEVISION. AND HE SAYS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LONG, DARK WINTER. HOW INSPIRING THAT IS, RIGHT? SO HE SAID THAT AND I AM SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER THE GREATEST AMERICAN COME BACK IN HISTORY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A BIDEN DEPRESSION AND A BOOM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A BIDEN LOCKDOWN , HE WANTS TO LOCK YOU DOWN. LET'S LOCK IT DOWN. LET'S LOCK IT DOWN. AND BY THE WAY, TELL YOUR GOVERNOR TO OPEN UP NORTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME. IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. HE WILL PROBABLY ANNOUNCE IT ON NOVEMBER 4, WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP NOW. THEY THOUGHT OUR NUMBERS WOULD NOT BE SO GOOD. THEY THOUGHT BY KEEPING THESE STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, MICHIGAN, HOW ABOUT HER? HER HUSBAND ROAMS FREE. HE IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE STATE. THEY THOUGHT THAT BY KEEPING HIM DOWN THE NUMBERS WOULD , AND YET, WE HAVE 33.1. THAT IS THE HIGHEST IN OUR COUNTRY, BY DOUBLE. YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO 1952, AND THAT WAS HALF OF WHAT WE DID. WE WILL HAVE VERY SHORTLY A SAFE VACCINE. WE ARE ROUNDING , THEY HATE WHEN I SAY IT, THE FAKE NEWS, BUT WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER. BUT ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE VACCINES COMING FROM PFIZER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, MODERNA, GREAT COMPANIES, AND THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. WE WILL HAVE THEM LAUNCHED AND OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO DO IT JUST A CLAY, AND WE ARE GOOD , LOGISTICALLY, AND WE ARE GOING TO START WITH OUR SENIORS. OUR SENIORS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR HEARTS, WITH DIABETES, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT THING. IT DOES WORK. HERE I AM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LIKE TO SAY THAT THE MEDICINE I TOOK, REGENERON, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT HAD NO IMPACT ON ME BECAUSE I AM A PERFECT PHYSICAL SPECIMEN AND I AM VERY YOUNG. BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE IT ANYWAY. IT IS AMAZING THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE PRODUCED NOW, WE HAVE BECOME A PRODUCTION. INCREDIBLE WHAT WE ARE SENDING TO THE WORLD. THE VENTILATORS, WHAT WE ARE SENDING TO THE WORLD. THE TREATMENTS THAT REDUCE THE FATALITY RATE 85%. THINK OF IT. BUT MY WIFE, OUR FIRST LADY, GOT IT AND OUR SON BARRON GOT IT. BARRON IS 14 AND HE IS VERY TALL AND STRONG AND HE HAD IT FOR A MATTER OF MINUTES. THAT IS WHY I SAY, GET THE KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. GET THEM BACK TO SCHOOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE DOCTOR CAME UP TO US AND SAID, I'M SORRY BUT BARRON HAS TESTED POSITIVE. AND I SAID, FOR WHAT? TESTED POSITIVE FOR WHAT? IT'S GOT ABOUT 30 DIFFERENT NAMES, BUT HE SAID, COVID. WE COULD CALL IT THE CHINA PLAGUE, THE CHINA VIRUS, BUT HE DIDN'T SAY IT. HE SAID COVID. I SAID, THAT'S TOO BAD. HE SAID, HE WILL BE FINE. ABOUT 14 MINUTES LATER, HE CAME BACK. I SAID, HOW IS BARRON DOING. HE SHOOK IT OFF, HE IS FINE. THE YOUNG HAVE STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEMS. GET THEM BACK TO SCHOOL, PLEASE. WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THIS HORRIBLE PLAGUE THAT WAS SENT TO US BY CHINA. OUR EXCESS MORTALITY RATE IN AMERICA IS 40% LOWER THAN EUROPE. YOU KEEP HEARING EUROPE IS DOING SO WELL. THEY ARE NOT DOING SO WELL. AND WE WANT THEM TO DO WELL, BY THE WAY, AND WE HELPED THEM. WE WANT THEM TO DO WELL. BUT THEY ARE HAVING A VERY HARD TIME. JILL BIDEN IS PROMISING TO DELAY THE VACCINE AND , JOE BIDEN IS PROMISING TO DELAY THE VACCINE AND TURN AMERICA INTO A PRISON STATE. THEY CLOSED YOUR CHURCHES, THEY CLOSED YOUR SCHOOLS, BUT IT YOU WANT TO RIOT AND BURN DOWN THE STORES AND HAVE THE AN HOUR GUEST OUT , THE ANARCHISTS OUT THERE, THAT'S OK. BUT YOU CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL, YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH. IT IS CRAZY. ALL DEMOCRAT RUN, BY THE WAY. ALL DEMOCRAT RUN. YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND. DEMOCRAT, SUPER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. WE COULD FIX THAT SITUATION. WE HAVE TO BE INVITED IN. WE FIXED SEATTLE BECAUSE WE SAID, THAT'S ENOUGH, WE ARE GOING IN. WE DON'T CARE, WE ARE GOING IN. SO WE WERE GOING IN THE NEXT MORNING. THAT NIGHT THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID, WE ARE LEAVING NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE DID A GREAT JOB IN MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, AFTER YOU WATCHED THAT PLACE BURNING DOWN. A WEEK AND A HALF LATER, THEY WENT IN AND SOLVED IT IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. IF WE LISTENED TO JOE BIDEN ON ALLOWING TRAVEL TO COME IN FROM CHINA AND EUROPE , REMEMBER HE SAID, HE IS XENOPHOBIC. NOW HE RUNS FOR PRESIDENT AND SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED SOONER. MUCH LATER, HE DID NOT THINK WE SHOULD DO IT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED. WE SAVED 2 MILLION PEOPLE OR MORE. DO YOU REMEMBER THE MODEL? IT SAID 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD DIE. WELL, WE SAVED 2 MILLION PEOPLE BY ACTING QUICKLY. NOW BIDEN WANTS A CRUEL AND VERY HEARTLESS NATIONWIDE SHUT DOWN. IT WON'T AFFECT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY SHUT DOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK , WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR STATE? ARE YOU READY TO OPEN UP? I THINK SO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE, AND THE PEOPLE ARE REVOLTING. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE. THEY CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. WE CAN'T HAVE THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. THAT WAS LIKE THE FIRST THING I SAID A LONG TIME AGO. THE BIDEN LOCKDOWN WILL RESULT IN COUNTLESS DEATHS AND WIPEOUT AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF DREAMS. AND WE HAVE LEARNED THAT CHILDREN WITH THE COMPUTERS DO NOT DO WELL COMPARED TO BEING IN CLASSES, OK? THEY DON'T DO WELL. IT IS NOT THE SAME. AND THE PARENTS HAVE TO GO TO WORK AND THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CAUSED WITH ALCOHOL, DRUG ABUSE, WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. YOU CAN'T LET IT GO ON. I HAVE A FEELING THAT PROBABLY HE WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, IT IS NOW NOVEMBER 4, THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION. WE WILL GO BACK. HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THAT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THAT. ACTUALLY, THE STATES THAT ARE DOING BEST, GET FLORIDA. LOOK AT ALL THESE STATES WHERE THEY HAD A SPIKE. AND THEY DIDN'T CLOSE DOWN. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. EUROPE IMPOSED TO CONEY AND LOCKDOWNS , DRACONOIAN LOCKDOWNS AND THEIR ECONOMIES ARE , LET'S FACE IT. THEY ARE IN RUINS. WE HAD THE SMALLEST DOWN AND THE LARGEST UP AND THE LARGEST FAST UP ON THE ECONOMY BY FAR. THE EUROPEAN LOCKDOWNS ARE LEADING TO MORE SUFFERING, DELAYED MEDICAL CARE, AND FINANCIAL DEVASTATION. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE FOR LOCKDOWNS, LAYOFFS, MISERY, AND GETTING RID OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY WANT TO HURT OUR POLICE, BUT THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. VERY INTERESTING, ISN'T IT? IF YOU WANT A VACCINE TO KILL THE VIRUS, A JOB TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY, AND FREEDOM TO LIVE YOUR LIFE, THEN GO CAST YOUR BALLOT, CAST YOUR VOTE FOR ME. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT BECAUSE IN CERTAIN STATES THAT I LIKE A LOT, WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR , LOOK AT THAT OVER THERE. LOOK AT THAT. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN. PLEASE ROLL THE VIDEO. ROLL IT. (music) MY PROBLEM IS I VOTED FOR NAFTA. I AM SUPPORTING NAFTA BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A POSITIVE THING TO DO, AND I DO NOT PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE MATTERS. TRADE AGREEMENTS LIKE NAFTA AND PERMANENT TRADE RELATIONS WOULD FORCE AMERICAN WORKERS TO COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE MAKING PENNIES AN HOUR AS A RESULT OF A LOSS OF 106 2000 JOBS. THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT THAT CHINA HAS BEEN CHEATING. CLINTON DIDN'T DO ENOUGH ABOUT IT, GEORGE W. BUSH DIDN'T DO ENOUGH ABOUT IT, BARACK OBAMA DIDN'T DO ENOUGH ABOUT IT. IT IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY FOR CHINA, BUT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. A RISING CHINA IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. IT IS IN OUR SELF-INTEREST THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO PROSPER. WE WANT TO SEE CHINA RISE. WE SHOULD HOPE FOR , CHINA IS A GREAT NATION AND WE SHOULD HOPE FOR THEIR CONTINUED EXPANSION. CHINA IS NOT OUR ENEMY. WE TALK ABOUT CHINA LIKE OUR COMPETITOR. WE SHOULD BE HELPING. IT IS BIZARRE. THEY ARE OUR COMPETITION. THEY ARE NOT BAD FOLKS, FOLKS. CHINA IS NOT A PROBLEM. ALLOWING CHINA INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HE SUPPORTED, EXTENDING THE MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS TO CHINA, WHICH HE SUPPORTED. THOSE STEPS ALLOWED CHINA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES BY USING OUR OWN OPEN TRADE DEALS AGAINST US. IT IS BETTER THAN NAFTA. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR THE SENATE. SO VOTE. VOTE. GOD BLESS CAN SOMEBODY TELL JOE, BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT A REAL WEBSITE? AND JOE, YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND NOT SENATOR? AND THAT SENATOR, THE MORMON GUY, IS MITT ROMNEY, NOT SOME MORMON GOVERNOR? SADLY WHAT WE SHOWED YOU IS JUST FROM A COUPLE HOURS TODAY. EVERY TIME JOE ACTUALLY LEAVES THE BASEMENT BUNKER AND STAYS OUT PAST 10:00 A.M., DISASTER ENSUES. HERE IS A QUICK REMINDER. TOMORROW IS SUPER THURSDAY , TUESDAY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. I AM RUSHING AHEAD, AREN'T I? WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. ALL MEN AND WOMEN CREATED , YOU KNOW THE THING. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? GO TO JOE 3030. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER FACT. PLAY THE RADIO. MAKE THE TELEVISION , EXCUSE ME, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RECORD PLAYER ON AT NIGHT. MAKE SURE THE KIDS HERE WORDS. , THE KIDS HEAR WORDS. DONALD TRUMP DOES POSE AN , IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS. THESE ARE WAY BEYOND AN OCCASIONAL CAMPAIGN GAFFE, AND I AM BEGINNING , WELL, I AM MORE THAN A LITTLE WORRIED THAT THIS MAN COULD REPRESENT A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO THIS COUNTRY. HE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CAPABLE OF LEADING. HE HAS BEEN HIDING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, AND THE CORRUPT MEDIA MOB IS COVERING FOR HIM. JOE WANTS TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT WOULD BE THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD, AND AT TIMES, JOE DOES NOT SEEM TO REMEMBER HE IS EVEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR WHAT STATE HE IS AND OR WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS. DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF ELECTED THAT JOE BIDEN WILL ACTUALLY BE IN CONTROL OF ANYTHING? WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO BE? FOUR MORE YEARS OF GEORGE , GEORGE , WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE IF TRUMP GETS ELECTED, WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD. BARACK AND I THINK IT IS A RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. FOLKS, WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET ME ELECTED. I NEED YOU ONCE I AM ELECTED. I WILL LEAD AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO MOBILIZE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT SAVES A LOT OF WORDS APPEAR ON THIS COLD, WINDY NIGHT. IT SAVES A LOT OF WORDS. BUT WE CANNOT DO THIS TO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL. WE CANNOT DO THIS. HE HAS FAILED FOR 47 YEARS. IN THE DEBATE, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SAY, JOE, WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT? JOE, YOU WERE THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU WERE IN THAT POSITION. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT, JOE? AND HE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER. NO LAW-ENFORCEMENT ENDORSEMENTS, NO NOTHING. JOINING US TONIGHT ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY HELPED ME A LOT IN WASHINGTON. A MAN WHO RIGHT NOW I HEAR IS DOING EXTREMELY WELL IN THE POLLS, SENATOR THOM TILLIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I JUST SAW A VERY GOOD POLE, AND WE HAD A VERY GOOD OLD TODAY T , I JUST SAW A VERY GOOD POLL AND WE HAD A VERY GOOD POLE POLL TODAY. ONE OF MY GENIUSES SAID, I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ONLY BEEN OUT HERE FOR TWO DAYS. I SAID, I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT ASKING THE QUESTION. WOULD NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE BEEN GREAT TO ME. THE VICTORIES WE HAVE HAD TOGETHER. AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR YOU AND WE HAVE YOU PROTECTED, INCLUDING THE TOBACCO ROSE. WE HAVE YOU OPEN BACK THERE. YOU ARE ALL PROTECTED. A REALLY WONDERFUL PERSON, A WONDERFUL WOMAN, AND SHE IS ALWAYS WITH ME. REPRESENTATIVE VIRGINIA FOXX. VIRGINIA, THANK YOU. GREAT JOB YOU DO. A MAN THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU. I THINK WE CAN GET A GUARANTEE TONIGHT. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DAN FOREST. COME ON, DAN. GOOD, DAN. THAT IS A NATURAL. YOU WILL OPEN IT UP RIGHT AWAY? OK. HE SHOULD WIN JUST ON THAT ONE. HE IS DOING WHAT THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING HIM TO DO. ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE JIM O'NEILL. HI, JIM. GREAT JOB, JIM. GOP CHAIRMAN MIKE WHATLEY. HOW WE DOING, MIKE? ARE WE WINNING? ARE WE LEADING THE POLLS? WE SHOULD BE UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE? CAN YOU IMAGINE? PASTOR AND A FRIEND OF MINE, AND HE LIVES RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD, PASTOR FRANKLIN GRAHAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SECOND TO PRAY FOR THIS MAN. OUR FATHER AND OUR GOD, WE PRAY FOR OUR PRESIDENT. PROTECT HIM AND HIS FAMILY, AND PROTECT OUR NATION. WE PRAY THIS IN JESUS' NAME, AMEN. THOSE ARE GOOD GENES RIGHT THERE. THAT'S GOOD GENES. BILLY GRAHAM, HOW GOOD WAS BILLY GRAHAM? NOBODY LIKE BILLY. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY. FOR 47 YEARS, THE DEMOCRATS VICIOUSLY AND BRUTALLY, REPEATEDLY ATTACKED , AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS LED BY A MAN NAMED JOE BIDEN. BLACK AMERICANS, THEY ATTACKED, DECIMATED THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS AND CALLED YOUNG BLACK MEN SUPER PREDATORS. TO EVERY BLACK AMERICAN, I AM ASKING YOU TO VOTE. YOU HAVE TO VOTE ON TUESDAY. YOU CAN SEND A MESSAGE ON TUESDAY TO THE CORRUPT DEMOCRAT ESTABLISHMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS. WE ARE DOING SO WELL. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED IS OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, OUR BLACK COMMUNITY VOTE, IS WAY UP. AND THEY ARE ALL SAYING WOW. THEY ARE ALL SAYING , EVERYBODY BACK THERE IS SAYING WOW, THAT'S AMAZING. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FLORIDA, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER. THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY CHANCE TO SHOW SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS DECISIONS TO ATTACK. I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE , CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, PRISON REFORM, OPPORTUNITY ZONES , HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, LONG-TERM FUNDING. THEY HAD NO FUNDING. EVERY YEAR THEY HAD TO COME BACK AND ASK FOR FUNDING. I SAID, WE HAVE TO GET YOU LONG-TERM FUNDING. WE GOT THEM MORE MONEY THAN THEY WANTED. THEY NEEDED IT. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE UNITED STATES BORDER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BIDEN WOULD MAKE EVERY CITY IN AMERICA A SANCTUARY CITY, WHICH IS NOT GOOD. AND IT IS NOT BIDEN, IT IS NOT BIDEN. IT IS HIS HANDLERS. I BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICAN CITIZENS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BIDEN-HARRIS PLAN WOULD ALSO INCREASE REFUGEES 700%, HOPING FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FRANCE. I AM KEEPING TERRORISTS, JIHADISTS, AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW, THOUGH I WAS ASKED ON THIS VERY WINDY NIGHT, SPEAKING OF THAT, TO DO A THING THAT WE USED TO DO DURING THE CAMPAIGN. HAS ANYONE HEARD OF THIS STAKE? SHOULD I DO IT? THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT, AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE DONE THIS ONE BUT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING. ARE YOU READY? THE SNAKE. ON HER WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR, HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HIS PRETTY COLOR SKIN HAD BEEN ALL FROSTED WITH THE DEW. POOR THING, SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN SAKE. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN , SIGHED THAT VICIOUS SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP ALL COZY IN A COMFORTER OF SILK AND SHE LAID HIM BY THE FIRE WITH SOME HONEY AND SOME MILK. SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT. AS SOON AS SHE ARRIVED SHE FOUND THAT PRETTY SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD BEEN REVIVED. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN SAKE. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED THAT VICIOUS SNAKE. SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO HER BOSOM. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, SHE CRIED. BUT I HADN'T WROUGHT YOU AND BY NOW, YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE DIED. SHE STROKED HIS PRETTY SKIN AGAIN AND KISSED AND HELD HIM TIGHT, BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU, THE SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME AND, OH TENDER WOMAN, TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED THAT VICIOUS SNAKE. I SAVED YOU CRIED THE WOMAN. YOU BIT ME, BUT WHY? YOU KNEW YOUR BITE WAS POISONOUS AND NOW I AM GOING TO DIE. SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN, SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIN. YOU KNEW DAMN WELL I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN. I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY SO MANY PEOPLE. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO THAT ONE BY SO MANY PEOPLE. BUT THAT PERTAINS A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT WE SEE GOING ON. YOU LOOK AT PARIS AND YOU LOOK AT THE ATTACKS OVER THE LAST WEEK AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG POLICY. WE PUT IN A BAN THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UPSET ABOUT, AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE BAN. WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. WE INVESTED 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE U.S. MILITARY. WE ALSO PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR GREAT VETS. WE HAVE A 91% APPROVAL RATING WITH OUR VETS, THE HIGHEST BY A LOT IN HISTORY. AT MY DIRECTION, THE UNITED STATES MILITARY CONDUCTED A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION TO RESCUE AN AMERICAN HOSTAGE LAST NIGHT, KIDNAPPED OVERSEAS JUST 96 HOURS EARLIER. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THE U.S. SPECIAL FORCES BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED A DARING NIGHTTIME OPERATION. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE RESCUED A RECORD 55 HOSTAGES AND CHENEY'S IN MORE THAN 24 COUNTRIES, AND WE PAY NOTHING. ONCE YOU PAY, THOSE NUMBERS GO VERY HIGH. BUT THIS OPERATION SHOULD SERVE AS A STARK WARNING TO TERRORISTS AND THUGS WHO TRY TO KIDNAP OUR PEOPLE. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE LONG REACH OF AMERICAN MILITARY AND AMERICAN JUSTICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THIS HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEM. I WAS AT FORT BRAGG. BY THE WAY, WE ARE LIVING THE NAME FORT BRAGG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET THAT WORD OUT. CANCEL CULTURE. LET'S CHANGE EVERYTHING. WE ARE LEAVING THE NAME FORT BRAGG. WE WON TWO WORLD WARS OUT OF FORT BRAGG AND OTHER GREAT PLACES. GEE, LET'S CHANGE THE NAME OF FORT BRAGG. WE OBLITERATED THE ISIS CALIPHATE AND WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ELSA' ISIS , THE LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI. SOLASOLEIMENI IS DEAD. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST OF MINISTRY'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. I ALSO RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS. , THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. WE DID IT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS AND WE ARE NOW FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THERE ARE ALREADY THREE COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE LINED UP. A VOTE FOR ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A VOTE TO SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND IN CONCLUSION, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL DEFEND THE RIGHT TO LIFE, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHICH SLEEP HE JOE WILL NOT BE DOING ANY OF THAT. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. AND WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD'S MILITARY. 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS, BUT WE HAVE THE FINEST SOULS AND ROCKETS AND TANKS AND JET. BUT WE HAVE SUBMARINES. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY AND OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL HAS BEEN UPDATED AND IS IN TIPPY TOP SHAPE, AND ONLY HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. WE WILL AND SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY. IT STARTS ON JANUARY 1. LOWER DRUG PRICES EVEN MORE. GOING TO BRING THEM DOWN TO THE LOWEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I HAVE EXERCISED A THING CALLED FAVORED NATIONS. IF DRUG COMPANIES , THE DRUG COMPANIES DO NOT LIKE ME TOO MUCH. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND THE UNITED STATES WILL BE THE FIRST NATION TO LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, "IN GOD WE TRUST." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR YEARS, YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TWO DAYS FROM NOW, AMERICA'S FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS. YOU MUST GET OUT AND VOTE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION POSSIBLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU MUST LET EVERYONE KNOW, GO GET THEM. GO GRAB YOUR FAMILY, GRAB YOUR BOSS, GRAB YOUR COWORKERS, GRAB THE MALL. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE. FROM ASHEVILLE TO CHARLOTTE, FROM WILLINGTON , WILMINGTON TO RALEIGH, AND RIGHT HERE IN HICKORY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GREATEST FURNITURE IN THE WORLD. I HAVE BOUGHT PLENTY OF IT. AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT THEY MAKE IN CHINA, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. I KNOW IT WELL. WE INHERIT THE LEGACY OF RED-BLOODED AMERICAN VENTURES WHO GAVE THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AND DEFEND OUR FREEDOM. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN HEROES, RIGHT? THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT HEROES WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED A CONTINENT, LAID DOWN THE RAILROADS, RAISED UP THE GREAT SKYSCRAPERS, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND MADE AMERICA INTO THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD OUR COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION, AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING. AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. VOTE FOR TOM. GET TOM IN THERE. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD.

[CHEERING] WE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WELL FOR NATIONS ARE IN A FREEFALL. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE ARE CREATING AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE UNRIVALED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE WENT DOWN LESS AND WE HAVE GONE UP MUCH MORE. NOBODY CLOSE. [CHEERING] A RECENT GALLUP POLL FOUND 67% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF BIDEN KAMALA, YOU KNOW KAMALA . [MOVING] , [BOOING] YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO FIRST, JOE. HARRISON THE RADICAL LEFT , HE IS RADICAL LEFT. YOU COULD SAY BERNIE IS A CONSERVATIVE BY COMPARISON, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] SHE IS THE MOST FAR-LEFT. THE RADICAL LEFT GAINED POWER AND THEY WILL COLLAPSE OUR ECONOMY IS IN PENNSYLVANIA INTO A STEEP DEPRESSION. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. WE HAVE SOME BIG SURPRISES. OOO, LOOK AT THE FAKE NEWS. [BOOING] TURN THE MIC UP. [CHANTING] BIDEN WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES $4 TRILLION, MASSIVELY INCREASING REGULATIONS. THEY ARE GOING TO INCREASE REGULATIONS. MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAX CUTS, WE GIVE THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY WE DID REGULATION CUTS WHICH WERE ALSO THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS, IT MAY BE MORE. SHUT DOWN YOUR ECONOMY, CLOSED-END MANUFACTURING, CENTER JOBS OVERSEAS, DESTROY OUR SUBURBS, HE WILL DESTROY OUR SUBURBS.

CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS. YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IN BIG TROUBLE. [BOOING] INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN WITH ANTI-AMERICAN LIES. I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS PRO-AMERICAN VALUES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BIDEN VOWED TO ABOLISH, EXTINGUISH, AND ERADICATE AMERICAN OIL. OIL FRACKING AND NATURAL GAS , WE GIVE IT EXTRA TIME. THIS IS PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS A WONDERFUL STATE. I WENT TO COLLEGE HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, AND I KNOW IT WELL, AND BIG PART OF YOUR LIVELIHOOD, YOUR MONEY, YOUR INCOME, YOUR LOW IN TAXES IS FRACKING. HE SPENT YEARS SAYING HE WILL NOT ALLOW FRACKING. THE FIRST TIME HE CAME TO PENNSYLVANIA AS THE NOMINEE, WHICH WAS A SHOCK TO EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY. ALL ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS WARREN HAD TO DO WAS LEAVE TODAY'S EARLY AND IT WOULD'VE BEEN CRAZY BERNIE INSTEAD OF SLEEPY JOE. I WOULD HAVE HAD A CRAZY GUY INSTEAD OF A SLEEPY GUY. [LAUGHTER] HE CAME IN AND AFTER GOING FOR ONE YEAR , SHE STILL CANNOT SAY IT. HE SAID, WE WILL BAN FRACKING. WE WILL BAN FRACKING. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID MANY TIMES. [BOOING] ONCE HE GOT THE NOMINATION HE CAME TO PENNSYLVANIA. THEY SAID YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MILLION JOBS AND IT IS A MASSIVE PART OF YOUR WEALTH. HE WALKED IN AND HE WENT FROM WE WILL BAN FRACKING TO, OF COURSE WE CAN HAVE FRACKING. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? REMEMBER THIS. THAT IS RIGHT. I MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT ONE VIDEO, BUT HE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED AS THE FAKE NEWS , WHERE IS HUNTER? [BOOING] WHERE IS HUNTER? HUNTER IS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY TAKING IN $25 MILLION TODAY. HE IS IN A COUNTRY THAT IS PICKING UP $25 MILLION. THAT IS TOTAL CORRUPTION. HE WENT OUT AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT FRACKING AND HE SAID, WE WILL ABSOLUTELY ALLOW YOU, BUT NOT ON GOVERNMENT LAND. THE PRESS NEVER HELD HIM ACCOUNTABLE. THEY NEVER HELD HIM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL THE CORRUPTION HE IS PART OF. BIDEN'S PLAN TO BAN FRACKING IS AN ECONOMIC DEATH SENTENCE FOR PENNSYLVANIA. BIDEN'S ENERGY SHUTDOWN WILL WIPE OUT YOUR JOBS, DECIMATE YOUR TOWNS, ELIMINATE YOUR FACTORIES, AND SEND YOUR STATE INTO A NIGHTMARE OF CRIPPLING POVERTY. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE. YOU HAVE THE BEST THREE YEARS YOU HAVE EVER BEEN UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE BEST THREE YEARS. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE BEST OF ALL. WATCH. YOU SEE IT HAPPENING. IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSING, AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING, YOU WILL HAVE THE BEST YEAR NEXT YEAR UNLESS SOMEBODY DECIDES TO COME ALONG AND QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES. THEN YOU ARE GOING DOWNHILL. THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE TO BAN FRACKING, OUTLAW MINING, EXPLODE ENERGY COSTS, AND TOTALLY DESTROY PENNSYLVANIA. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? IT WILL DESTROY PENNSYLVANIA. IT CAN HAPPEN VERY FAST. TAKE A LOOK AT VENEZUELA. SAME IDEOLOGY AND THIS WAS UNBELIEVABLY WEALTHY, RICH COUNTRY. ONE OF THE RICHEST COUNTRIES AND NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE WATER, THEY DO NOT HAVE FOOD, THEY DO NOT HAVE MEDICINE. IT IS A VERY SAD SITUATION. IT CAN HAPPEN HERE JUST MUCH BIGGER. IT CAN HAPPEN WITH THESE MANIACS. IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. JOE BIDEN IS A GLOBALIST WHO SPENT 47 YEARS OUTSOURCING YOUR JOBS, OPENING YOUR BORDERS, AND SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE ON RIDICULOUS, ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS MOST OF YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. HE SHUTTERED YOUR STEEL MILLS. I GOT THEM OPEN. [CHEERING] I TARIFFED , CHINA WAS DUMPING STEEL ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU ASK THE HEADS OF YOUR STEEL COMPANIES. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ANY STEEL COMPANIES RIGHT NOW. ANNIHILATED YOUR COLDCOAL JOBS FOR HALF A CENTURY. HE WAS A CHEERLEADER OF NAFTA WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS MADE. WITH A VERY GOOD ONE NOW, THANK YOU, AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD ORGANIZATION LIFTED CHINA INTO, A GREAT POWER A GREAT ECONOMIC POWER. EXCEPT THEY WERE GOING TO CATCH US. 10 YEARS CHINA WAS GOING TO CATCH US. GUESS WHAT? WE WERE GOING SO FAR AHEAD AND FRANKLY, IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SMART, REAL SMART INDISPOSITION, THEY WILL NEVER CATCH YOU. THEY WILL NEVER EVER CATCH YOU. IF YOU STUDY THE HISTORY, 10 YEARS AGO, 2019 THEY WOULD CATCH , AND THEY WOULD'VE CAUGHT YOU IF I HAD NOT COME ALONG. WE HAD THE PLAGUE. WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY AND THEN WE HAD THE PLAGUE FROM CHINA. WE CLOSED IT DOWN, WE SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES, WE SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES AND NOBODY GETS IT. THE PROJECTION WAS 2.2 MILLION MODELED OUT. WE SAVED 2 MILLION LIVES. WE UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE AND THAT WE OPENED IT UP. BY THE WAY, PENNSYLVANIA, GET YOUR STAY OPEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOUR GOVERNOR HAS TO OPEN YOUR STATE, PENNSYLVANIA. HAS TO OPEN YOUR STATE. [CHANTING] GET IT OPEN. GET IT OPEN, GOVERNOR. GET IT OPEN AND COUNT THE VOTES HONESTLY, GOVERNOR. COUNT THEM HONESTLY. [CHEERING] THERE WAS A VERY GOOD POST LAST NIGHT. HE HAD US WINNING EVERYTHING. HOW WAS HE GOING TO DO IT, PENNSYLVANIA? HE WAS ON SEAN HANNITY. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF IT? [CHEERING] THEY SAID HOW IS HE GOING TO DO IT? HE IS GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA EXCEPT THE CHEATING. WE HAVE TO LEAVE 5% FOR THE CHEATING. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THE CHEATING THAT TAKES PLACE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE GUY MEANT IT. HE PREDICTED WE WOULD WIN THE ELECTION. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA? YOU HAVE TO LEAVE 5% FOR THE CHEATING AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT GAVE YOU AN EXTENSION, THEY MADE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND I MEAN DANGEROUS PHYSICALLY. THEY MADE A VERY , THEY DID A VERY BAD THING FOR THE STATE. THEY DID A BAD THING FOR THIS NATION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DATE. YOU CANNOT EXTEND DATES. THE DANGER THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY THAT EXTENSION, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN PHILADELPHIA AND HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS, SO GOVERNOR, OPEN YOUR STATE AND PLEASE DO NOT CHEAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALL WATCHING. WE ARE WATCHING YOU, GOVERNOR. WE HAVE A LOT OF EYES ON THE GOVERNOR AND HIS FRIENDS. A COUPLE OF OTHER GOVERNORS OUT THERE. PENNSYLVANIA LOST HALF OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER , [CHANTING] THANK YOU. PENNSYLVANIA LOST HALF OF YOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS. THINK OF IT. JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN WHO SOLD OUT TO PENNSYLVANIA, TO CHINA, AND ALSO SOLD OUT FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND FAMILY GAIN AND WHERE'S HUNTER? IS HUNTER IN THE CROWD? WHERE IS HUNTER? 2016 PENNSYLVANIA VOTED TO FIRE THE CORRUPT POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS YOUR PRESIDENT WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF I DO NOT SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT IS BECAUSE I AM NOT A POLITICIAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. ] PROBABLY WHY I AM HERE. I DO NOT ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF WASHINGTON BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU. HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER FOUGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THINK OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH. LOOK, FROM BEFORE I CAN TO OFFICE , WE WILL DO THAT IN A SECOND. YOU ARE AN ENTHUSIASTIC BUNCH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE SOMETHING. FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE KNOWN AS A LATE VOTING STATE. THAT MEANS YOU ARE SMART. #HOW DO I CHANGE MY VOTE, DID YOU SEE THAT? THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE THING. DID EVERYBODY SEE THE DEBATE? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A LOT OF PEOPLE , IS THAT THEY CHANGE THE VOTE STATE? I DO NOT THINK YOUR GOVERNOR WOULD LET YOU DO THAT. WE HAVE SOME STATES THAT ARE CHANGING THE VOTES. IT STARTED WITH THE DEBATES AND THEN THEY SEE THE RALLIES. I WILL SAY THIS TO THE FAKE NEWS. [CHEERING] IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, THERE IS BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND THIS IS AT A PRETTY EARLY PART OF THE DAY. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN LAST NIGHT IN FLORIDA. IT WAS AMAZING. THINK OF THIS. BEFORE I EVEN RAN , MAYBE BEFORE I ANNOUNCED , THEY SAID LET US GO IN AND DO IT. WE WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THREE YEARS AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PHONY HOAX. IT WAS A PHONY IMPEACHMENT AND BASED ON THE LAPTOP FROM HELL THE IMPEACHMENT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. IN FACT, IT SHOULD'VE HAPPENED AGAINST THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE IT WAS THE OTHER SAID THAT SHE DID. THE OTHER SIDE DEALT WITH RUSSIA. THEN THEY SAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE DON'T KNOW IF WE LIKE HIS PERSONALITY. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TOO ROUGH, TO TOUGH. IF WE DID NOT HAVE A CERTAIN TYPE OF PERSONALITY, AND WE DID NOT FIGHT, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE CAUGHT THEM SPYING ON OUR CAMP TRYING TO KICK OUT A NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT LIKE , I FOUGHT LIKE HELL. THEY TURNED OUT TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE CORRUPT. NO COLLUSION. THEY SPENT $48 BILLION , $48 MILLION. THEY DID NOT FIND ANY COLLUSION. ANGRY PROSECUTORS. ONE OF THE SMARTEST, PROBABLY NOBODY THAT HE KNOWS. BOB MUELLER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. YOU HAD ALL OF THIS STUFF. COVID. WE WENT ALL THROUGH THAT FOR THREE YEARS, THEN THEY SAID, WE DON'T LIKE HOW HE ACTED. THEY COMMITTED TREASON. THEY TRIED TO TAKE DOWN A NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT AND WE CAUGHT THEM UP. AND THEN THEY SAY, I SEE IT TODAY. THEN THEY SAY, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE , [CROWD CHANTING "LOCK THEM UP"] I SEE THESE GUYS ON TELEVISION, AND PROBABLY ALL OF THE NEW TECH STUFF. THEY ARE THE NEW BOSS IN TOWN. AND YOU KNOW, WE GAVE THE POWER TO THE BIG TECH. NOW, THEY ARE SAYING, TOUGH ADMINISTRATION, CHAOS. THEY CREATED THE CHAOS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS FIGHT BACK. HE FOUGHT BACK WELL, WE CAUGHT THEM, NOW THEY ARE ALL CAUGHT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT IS TREASON. THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN. THAT IS A BIGGER EVENT. I WOULD RATE BIDEN SECOND. HIS FAMILY AND HIM TOOK MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HE DEALS WITH. HE BECAME VICE PRESIDENT, HIS SON DID NOT HAVE A JOB. HE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY. HE SIGNS WITH BURISMA FOR 183,000 DOLLARS PER MONTH. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ENERGY? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ENERGY. THAT'S OK. THEN HE GETS $3.5 MILLION FROM THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW'S WIFE. HUNTER, WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU GAVE HER SOME BIG ADVICE, RIGHT? THEY GO TO CHINA. THEN, THE BIG ONE, I GUESS HE HAD TO STOP THAT ONE BECAUSE THEY FOUND THE LAPTOP FROM HELL. THE BIG ONE WAS A REQUEST TO CHINA TO PAY THEM $10 MILLION PER YEAR FOR RECOMMENDATION SERVICES, SERVICES. IT IS A PAYOFF. THE BIG GUY GETS IN PERCENT. THE BIG GUY GETS 10%. HE IS NOT A BIG GUY. HE IS A LITTLE GUY. THE BIG GUY GETS 10%. THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE WHERE THE BIG GUY GETS 50%. HE WANTED $10 MILLION PER YEAR. THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY BIG MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE HAVE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. BUT WE DON'T, WE HAVE SUPPRESSION BY THE PRESS. IF ANYONE EVEN MENTIONS THAT STORY. THAT IS THE SECOND BIGGEST SCANDAL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FIRST IS THAT THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN. THAT IS THE BIGGEST SCANDAL. THEY HAVE GOT EVERYBODY SCARED. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS NOT SCARED. I SEE IT WITH TWITTER TRENDING. I KNOW WHAT TRENDING IS BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD. I HAVE BEEN TRENDING MY WHOLE LIFE. THEY TAKE A STORY, THEY MAKE IT WORSE. BORING STUFF. THEY WILL SAY, NUMBER ONE TRENDING. TRUMP IS NUMBER ONE TRENDING. WHAT TRENDS IS STUFF THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW. NOT HAVING TO DO WITH ME, EITHER, BY THE WAY. YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, EIGHT HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING. THE MEDIA IS FAKE AND CORRUPT. BIG TECH CONTROLS THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICIANS. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO SAY IT. IT IS A VERY BIG EVENT. I TELL YOU WHAT, I GIVE TUCKER CARLSEN AND I GIVE SEAN HANNITY, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE TUCKER REPORTS HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL. I GIVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT TREMENDOUS CREDIT. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. HE IS VICE PRESIDENT, HIS SON IS LIKE A HUMAN VACUUM CLEANER. HE FOLLOWS HIS FATHER, HE TAKES THE SCRAPS. BUT THE SCRAPS ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. WE ARE PUTTING A CORRUPT MAN UP FOR POSSIBLY BEING ELECTED. BUT HERE IS THE STORY. I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS DAY TOMORROW. WHEN HE ANNOUNCES A SPEECH IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, HE SAYS, I WAS BORN IN SCRANTON. HE DOESN'T SAY THAT HIS FATHER LEFT. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. YOU KNOW I WENT TO COLLEGE IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT I DON'T MAKE THE BIGGEST DEAL OF IT. HE IS, I AM A MAN FROM SCRANTON. HE LEFT AT NINE YEARS OLD. THAT IS OK. BUT THIS GUY IS A STONE COLD PHONY AND HONESTLY HE IS NOT EQUIPPED MENTALLY TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. I HAVE FOREIGN LEADERS CALLING, ONE OF THEM SAYS, I SEE THAT YOU ARE DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN APRIL I SAID, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS HAPPENS TO ME? , DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN A BOWL. , IN A POLL. HE SAYS, CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE OVER HERE TO THE PRESS. THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. AND IT IS WINDY YES H , WINDY AS HELL AND COLD, AND I DON'T CARE. LOOK AT THAT FLAG. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FLAG BLOW LIKE THAT. THAT MEANS IT IS WINDY AS HELL. LOOK AT THAT. THAT THING IS SIDEWAYS. BUT IT IS OUR AMERICAN FLAG AND WE LOVE IT, RIGHT? YESTERDAY, I WAS THRILLED TO BE ENDORSED BY THE PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE. IT IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER REALLY LIKED THAT PAPER. ONCE YOU GET RID OF THE FIRST ONE OR TWO PARAGRAPHS, IT WAS GREAT. THEY SAID, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE HIS TONE. I HAVE TO FIGHT TO PROTECT ME AND PROTECT YOU. ONCE I AM NOT HERE, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO PROTECT YOU. EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE. THEY GAVE A BEAUTIFUL EDITORIAL AND I APPRECIATE IT. [CROWD CHANTING "WE LOVE YOU " AN] YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME CRY WITH THAT, STOP. THE PRESIDENT BROKE DOWN IN TEARS AS THEY SCREAMED "WE LOVE YOU." I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OMA , PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA WANTS TO HEAR THAT. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE POST-GAZETTE, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU. I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR FIRST ONE OR TWO OR THREE PARAGRAPHS. THEY SAID, HOWEVER, HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. THEY SAID, BUT HIS PERSONALITY ASIDE. BUT I AM TELLING YOU, THE ASSAULT ON THIS OFFICE HAS CHANGED MY PERSONALITY. JOE BIDEN IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY BIG TECH, BIG MEDIA, AND POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS. THEY OWN HIM, CONTROL HIM, AND THEY KNOW HE WILL ALWAYS DO THEIR BIDDING. WHEN HE RAISES $300 MILLION LIKE LAST MONTH, I COULD RAISE MUCH MORE THAN HIM I AM PRESIDENT. I COULD CALL THE WALL STREET GUYS, THE OIL GUYS. I CAN BLOW HIS NUMBERS APART. GIVE ME TWO HOURS. HOW MANY COMMERCIALS CAN YOU BUY ? WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY. WE RAISED ENOUGH MONEY. CROOKED HILLARY LAST TIME OUT RAISED US 4-1. I GOT CRITICIZED. I SAID THE OTHER DAY, EVEN AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, HE DID NOT RAISE THAT MUCH MONEY. THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU WON OR NOT, THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CALLING FOR THE HEAD OF GOLDMAN SACHS. HELLO, IS EVERYTHING GOOD? I WOULD LIKE $25 MILLION WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES. DO YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO SAY NO? I WOULD BE THE GREATEST. I CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT. I CHOSE NOT TO DO IT. WHEN YOU SEE HE RAISED $300 MILLION, HIS PEOPLE ARE MAKING DEALS ALL OVER THE PLACE. EVERY CORRUPT FORCE IN AMERICAN LIFE THAT BETRAYED YOU AND HURT YOU, THEY ARE SUPPORTING SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. THE FAILED ESTABLISHMENT THAT SUPPORTED DISASTROUS FOREIGN WARS. THE CAREER POLITICIANS THAT ARE SHORT YOUR INDUSTRIES AND DECIMATED YOUR FACTORIES. YOU HAVE IT WORSE THAN ALMOST ANYONE ELSE. NEW ENGLAND WAS HIT HARD, TOO. THEY SUPPORT BIDEN. THE LOBBYISTS THAT KILLED OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. GAVE US ILLEGAL DRUGS. THE GANGS AND CRIME, THEY SUPPORT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. THE FAR-LEFT DEMOCRATS HAVE RUINED OUR SCHOOLS, DEPLETED OUR INNER CITIES, DEMEANED YOUR SACRED FAITH AND VALUES, THEY SUPPORT JOE BIDEN. THEY WANT TO DEFUND THE PHILADELPHIA POLICE. YOU HAVE GREAT POLICE. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT? [CROWD CHANTING] THEY WANT TO DEFUND YOUR POLICE. I DON'T THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE IT. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, RIGHT? EVERY PLACE WE HAVE GONE INTO, HALF AN HOUR, IT WAS OVER. BUT THEY HAVE TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE EMBARRASSED OR AFRAID OR THINK THEY WILL LOSE SUPPORT. WE WERE THE ONES THAT DID THE WHOLE THING IN SEATTLE. WE TOLD THEM WE ARE DOING IN THE FOLLOWING MORNING. THAT NIGHT, THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS, I THINK WE WILL LEAVE NOW. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN PHILADELPHIA. AND THEY CAN'T TELL THE POLICE TO STAND BACK. THEY STAND BACK AND WATCH PEOPLE WASH OUT , WATCH PEOPLE WALK OUT WITH WASHING MACHINES, PUSHING A WASHING MACHINE. IT IS A DISGRACE. THE WORLD WATCHES THAT. THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES AND STATES. NEW YORK, CHICAGO. UNFORTUNATELY, PENNSYLVANIA. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD HURT OUR NUMBERS BUT THEN THEY SAW 33.1. THE ANTI-AMERICAN RADICALS DEFAMING OUR NOBLE HISTORY, HERITAGE, AND HEROES, THEY SUPPORT JOE BIDEN. ANTIFA AND THE RIOTERS, LOOTERS, MARXISTS, THEY ALL SUPPORT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN HAS NO CLUE. HE IS NOT CALLING THE SHOW. THIS ELECTION COMES DOWN TO A SIMPLE CHOICE. DO YOU WANT TO BE RULED BY THE CORRUPT POLITICAL CLASS OR DO YOU WANT TO BE RULED AND GOVERNED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE TO GIVE CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT OVER THE TO THE GLOBALISTS, COMMUNISTS, SOCIALISTS, WANT TO CENSOR, CANCEL, AND PUNISH YOU. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SAFE, IF YOU WANT YOUR VALUES TO BE RESPECTED, IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED WITH HONOR, DIGNITY, AND RESPECT, THAN I AM ASKING YOU TO GO TOMORROW AND VOTE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT IS UP TO YOU, REALLY. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. PENNSYLVANIA, I HAVE DONE VERY WELL. YOU HAVE HAD YOUR BEST YEARS EVER. PENNSYLVANIA, IT WILL BE UP TO YOU. SUCH A BIG DEAL. BIG STATE. AND WE ARE DOING GREAT IN FLORIDA. YOU NOTICE THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT FLORIDA ANYMORE. FLORIDA HAS BEEN GREAT. WE ARE DOING GREAT IN FLORIDA. WE GET FLORIDA, WE GET PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE GOING TO GET NORTH CAROLINA. YOU SAW THE POLE COME OUT YESTERDAY IN IOWA. WAY AHEAD IN IOWA. WE ARE WAY AHEAD IN OHIO EXCEPT WE GET SOMETIMES A FAKE. WE WON OHIO BY EIGHT POINTS. THEY SAY WE ARE FURTHER UP THAN THAT NOW. BECAUSE EVERYTHING I HAVE TALKED ABOUT, WE HAVE DONE, AND MORE. I SAID FOUR YEARS AGO, I AM YOUR VOICE AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE DEPRAVED SWAMP HAS TRIED EVERYTHING TO STOP ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I DON'T ANSWER TO THEM, ANSWER TO YOU. THAT IS TRUE. THIS IS A MOVEMENT THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY, IN A WAY, THE WORLD, BUT THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN. YOU TAKE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER MANY, MANY YEARS. A POLITICIAN RUNS AND COMES IN SECOND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BECOMES FAMOUS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. WE WON EVERYTHING THIS TIME. WE WON 100% OF THE STATES IN THE PRIMARY. WE WON 34 STATES AGAINST A CROOKED PERSON. BY THE WAY, HOW CROOKED IS HILLARY? SHE DELETED 33,000 EMAILS. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT? WE WON LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER WON. THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. JUST TO GET OFF THAT SUBJECT FOR A SECOND, 2016, WE HAD A CAMPAIGN OF A NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THERE IS MUCH MORE ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS CAMPAIGN THAN THERE WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. FOUR YEARS AGO, I WAS A SUCCESSFUL GUIDE, I SAID WE WILL CUT YOUR TAXES, GET RID OF REGULATION, REBUILD YOUR MILITARY. I DID EVERYTHING AND MORE THAN EVERYTHING. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. WE JUST GOT A 91% APPROVAL RATING FROM THE VETS. WE DID EVERYTHING THAT WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO. BUT, THERE IS MUCH MORE. THAT WAS A RECORD. NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN A CAMPAIGN LIKE THAT. THAT AND BREXIT. LOOK AT HIM. I SPOTTED NIGEL. BUT I ACTUALLY DID SEE A LIST. THEY SAID THE VICTORY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NUMBER ONE. BREXIT WAS NUMBER TWO. BUT IT WAS A DISTANT NUMBER TWO. EVEN NIGEL AGREES WITH THAT. NIGEL HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU. THEY KNOW. MR. BREXIT. BUT, THE LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM. AND I THINK YOU WILL SEE A GREAT RED WAVE TOMORROW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BLOW THEM AWAY. WE GET FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE GOING TO GET NEW HAMPSHIRE. "GET NEW YORK." CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? THE DISADVANTAGE WE HAVE. I THINK IN CERTAIN WAYS, YOU CAMPAIGN DIFFERENTLY. THE DISADVANTAGE WE HAVE WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, YOU AUTOMATICALLY LOSE , I DON'T CARE IF YOU BRING BACK ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND GEORGE WASHINGTON AS HIS RUNNING MATE. YOU LOSE NEW YORK, ILLINOIS, AND CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE THREE OF THE BIGGEST, AND THE BIGGEST. THREE MONSTER STATES THAT IS AN AUTOMATIC LOSS. WE RAN FLORIDA, THEN GEORGIA. BY THE WAY, WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN GEORGIA. GEORGIA NORTH CAROLINA, WE GOT PENNSYLVANIA. WE GOT EVERYTHING. THEN WE GOT WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN. REMEMBER, THEY WOULD NOT GIVE YOU THE CREDIT? WE WERE AT 98% OF THE VOTE TABULATED AND IT STAYED THERE FOR HOURS. IF I LOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE. I SAID, WHY ARE THEY NOT CALLING PENNSYLVANIA? THEN THEY CALLED WISCONSIN, GREAT STATE, AND MICHIGAN, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN WON IN YEARS AND YEARS. WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE YOURSELF THE GLORY THIS TIME? AND MAKE SURE YOUR GOVERNOR DOES NOT CHEAT. BECAUSE THEY ARE KNOWN FOR VERY BAD THINGS HERE. CAN YOU IMAGINE A POSTER SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO ALLOW 5% IN SYLVANIA FOR CHEATING? THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY. OF COURSE, EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS TRUE. WE HAVE A LOT OF EYES WATCHING. THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT THE CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT AND DETHRONE THE FAILED POLITICAL CLASS, DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP MY WE WILL SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THIS ELECTION IS THE CHOICE BETWEEN A DEADLY BIDEN LOCKDOWN AND A SAFE VACCINE THAT ENDS THE PANDEMIC AND REBUILD THE GREATEST ECONOMIC COUNTRY WE HAVE EVER HAD. WE WILL MASS DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE. WE HAVE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB WITH THIS WHOLE THING. YOU LOOK AT EUROPE, THEY ARE SPIKING. LOOK AT THE WAY GERMANY, FRANCE, SPAIN ARE DOING. LOOK AT ITALY. THEY ARE ALL HAVING A A LOT OF PROBLEMS. WE HAVE BETTER NUMBERS THAN ALL OF THEM. YOU LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS. A LOT OF THE NUMBERS, YOU DON'T GET. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES THAT DON'T GIVE YOU AN HONEST KICK. THE VACCINE WILL QUICKLY ERADICATE THE VIRUS AND WAKE , AND WHY FOUND THE CHINA PLAGUE ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE HAVE THE VACCINES COMING VERY SHORTLY. THEY DID NOT WANT TO GIVE ME THE CREDIT. THEY FOUGHT ME LIKE CRAZY. THEY DID NOT WANT US TO HAVE IT BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE HAVE THE VACCINE, IT WILL BE DELIVERED BY OUR MILITARY. JOE BIDEN IS PROMISING TO DELAY THE VACCINE. JOE BIDEN IS LOCKING YOU IN YOUR HOMES. BUT YOU ARE ALREADY LOCKED IN YOUR HOMES. I HOPE THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY ANY OF YOUR INCENTIVE. YOU ARE ALREADY LOCKED IN YOUR HOMES WHILE LETTING FAR-LEFT WRITERS ROAM FREE. THAT IS SOMETHING. YOU CAN LET PEOPLE RIDE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL SHOPPING STREET, BURNING DOWN YOUR STORES UNTIL WE SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. THAT ENDED IN 31 MINUTES. I HOPE THEY WERE NOT AIMING. DID YOU SEE ALI CVELCHER, HE WENT DOWN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS. HE DOES A GOOD JOB SHAVING HIS HEAD. THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST AND BEHIND HIM, THE ENTIRE CITY IS BURNING. IT IS LIKE BERLIN ON HIS WORST DAY. I DON'T WATCH CNN, SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT I DID SEE , DIDN'T HE THEN GET HIT ON THE KNEE WITH TEAR GAS FROM OUR GREAT NATIONAL GUARD. HE WENT DOWN. I'M DOWN, I'M DOWN. WHAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. CNN. HOW DISHONEST IS CNN? I THINK NBC IS MORE DISHONEST THAN CNN. I THINK ABC IS TERRIBLE. ABC IS ABSOLUTE , HOW ABOUT WHEN THEY INTERVIEW ME AND EVERY QUESTION IS TO KILL. THEY ARE GOING FOR THE KILL. THEN THEY INTERVIEW SLEEPY JOE, THE MOST BORING INTERVIEW. THEY DON'T ASK HIM ANYTHING. THEY DON'T ASK HIM WHETHER OR NOT A YES CORRUPT. ARE YOU CORRUPT? I ASKED HIM THAT QUESTION AND CHRIS WALLACE OF FOX WOULD NOT ALLOW IT. WHY? I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE. CHRIS WALLACE, YOU WILL NEVER BE MIKE. HE DOES NOT HAVE THE TALENT. THE BIDEN LOCKDOWN WILL BE NO SCHOOL, NO GRADUATIONS, NO WEDDINGS, NO CHRISTMAS, NO FOURTH OF JULY, AND BASICALLY NO FUTURE FOR AMERICAN YOUTH. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS QUITE A WONDERFUL THING. A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS A VOTE FOR LOCKDOWNS AND MISERY. WHAT THE FAKE NEWS DOES NOT KNOW, THEY ARE GETTING THE HIGHEST RATINGS IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. WHEN TRUMP IS GONE, THEY ARE ALL GOING BANKRUPT. THEY ARE GOING TO BE CALLING, WE WANT TRUMP TO RUN AGAIN. WANT HIM TO RUN AGAIN. THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES, WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS. YET, FOUR MORE YEARS. CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE GETTING THE HIGHEST RATINGS ON TELEVISION, THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER FOR THE NFL. HOW ABOUT BASKETBALL? [CROWD BOOING] I FELT VERY BADLY FOR LEBRON. I DID NOT WATCH ONE SHOT. WHEN THEY DON'T RESPECT OUR COUNTRY, WHEN THEY DON'T RESPECT OUR FLAG, NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH. NOBODY. AND THE NFL IS WAY DOWN. YOU'VE GOT TO STAND FOR OUR FLAG. YOU'VE GOT TO BE GREAT TO OUR FLAG AND OUR ANTHEM. IF YOU DO NOT DO THAT, WE ARE NOT WATCHING. [CROWD CHANTING] I HAVE THREE MORE OF THESE TO DO. DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY WITH THESE ALL DAY? YESTERDAY, I DID FIVE. I ACTUALLY DID SIX BECAUSE I DID ONE EARLY FOR SOME PEOPLE. I GOT HOME AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING. 2:00 IN THE MORNING. WHAT TIME DO WE START TOMORROW? 8:00. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? I AM DOING A RUN, A GREAT MARATHON. SLEEPY JOE WILL GO OUT, HE WILL TALK FOR 10 MINUTES. HE IS VERY AGITATED. HE IS SO ANGRY. THE AVIATORS, ARE THEY CALLED AVIATORS? HE IS SO ANGRY, HE IS READING EVERY WORD. HE NEVER GOES OFF TELEPROMPTER. THE ANGER, BUT IT IS NOT REALLY ANGER, IT IS AGITATION. WHEN YOU LOSE IT , IT CAN HAPPEN TO ALL OF US SOMEDAY. BUT YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOUR PRESIDENT. I AM SORRY. HE WAS SO AGITATED THIS MORNING. THE GLASSES WERE POOR ENOUGH. THE MASK WAS , THERE IS NOBODY AROUND HIM. THE CLOSEST PERSON IS ABOUT 60 FEET AWAY. THE REPORTER CAN'T BELIEVE HE GOT THIS LOCATION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR VIPS. NOW HE HAS GOT LADY GAGA. [CROWD BOOING] I COULD TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT LADY GAGA. LADY GAGA. JON BON JOVI. EVERY TIME I SEE HIM, HE KISSES MY ASS. HE WILL GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY IS. BY THE WAY, WE DRAW MUCH BIGGER CROWDS THAN THESE PEOPLE. HE WILL SING A SONG OR TWO, THEN HE WILL LEAVE, THE CROWD WILL LEAVE. THEY GOT BEYONCE, JAY-Z. HE STARTED USING THE F-WORD. HE WAS USING THE F WORD, F WORD. HE LEFT, THE CROWD LEFT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE CROWDS WE ARE GETTING, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THIS IS YOUR ULTIMATE POLL. THIS IS NOT THE CROWD OF FINISH. YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE HERE, NIGEL, SINCE 24 HOURS, 48. WE HAD PEOPLE ONLINE FOR 3, 4 DAYS. AND THEN THE PRESS SAYS WILL THEY VOTE. THEY ARE WILLING TO WAIT FOR DAYS, THREE DAYS, ONE DAY ONLINE . WILL THEY STAND THERE FOR AN HOUR AND VOTE? WHO IS GOING TO VOTE? SERIOUSLY. IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR SLEEPY JOE? IS THERE ANYBODY HERE GOING TO HAVE THE COURAGE? BUT HE WAS BORN IN SCRANTON. WHAT A PHONY HE IS. I'M A SCRANTON BOY. DID YOU SEE? HE'S TIRED OF THE SMART PEOPLE. DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID? TIRED OF THE SMART PERSON. HE SAID IT. HE MADE A LOT OF BAD NEWS YESTERDAY. HE WAS HAVING A BAD DAY, YESTERDAY. HE'S TIRED OF SMART PEOPLE. CAN'T GET TOO TIRED OF IT. TO ME THAT'S THE JOB TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY, FREEDOM TO LIVE YOUR LIFE, CAST YOUR BALLOT. YOU CAST YOUR BALLOT. WE ARE CHANGING THINGS. CHANGING IT TO WHAT IT USED TO BE. IT WAS NEVER LIKE THIS. THINGS CHANGE WITH BIG TECH. JOE BIDEN PERSONALLY RAN THE SWINE FLUKE, RIGHT? H1N1, REMEMBER? CAN'T REMEMBER THAT. AND ONE H1? NO, NO. H COMES BEFORE N, REMEMBER IT THAT WAY. WHAT WAS IT CALLED? WHO WAS THAT GOVERNOR FROM, I THINK IT WAS UTAH? WHAT WAS HIS NAME? HIS NAME WAS ROMNEY. HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY. HE FAILED HORRIBLY AND HE WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF RUSSIAN , WASHINGTON. HE RAN THE SWINE FLU VIRUS AND. NOW ON SOMETHING MUCH MORE LETHAL THAT WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON EXCEPT WITH PUBLIC RELATIONS. I WOULD SAY IF I HAD NIGEL HANDLING MY PUBLIC RELATIONS, I WOULD BE MUCH BETTER. WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS . COMPARE US TO OTHER PLACES THAT YOU SEE. BRINGING BACK THE ECONOMY. OPENING IT UP. HIS OWN CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS HE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. HE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE TOLD US, RIGHT? I WAS XENOPHOBIC BECAUSE I CLOSED IT TO CHINA, HIGHLY AND HEAVILY INFECTED. THEN HE RUNS AND SAYS I SHOULD HAVE CLOSED IT EASIER. HOW DOES HE GET OUT OF THAT ONE? THE PRESS REFUSES TO REPORT IT. THE ONLY WAY I CAN DO THAT, LOOK, I'VE GOT ALL THE LIVE TELEVISION. ALL THE LIGHTS. I GET VERY BIG RATINGS. IF I DIDN'T GET BIG RATINGS, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING. THEY ARE GOING TO MISS THE RATINGS SOMEDAY. SOMEDAY. ROBERT GATES SAID THAT BIDEN HAS BEEN WRONG ON NEARLY EVERY SINGLE MAJOR FOREIGN-POLICY NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE IN THE PAST. HE WORKED WITH BIDEN. HE WORKED WITH THEM. SAID HE WAS LONG , WRONG ON LIKE EVERYTHING AND HE IS, HE IS . BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. I SPENT A FORTUNE ON BUILDING THESE. YOU HAVE GOT TWO OF THEM. WOW.

HE CALLED YOUNG BLACK MEN SUPER PREDATORS ALL THE TIME. TO EVERY BLACK AMERICAN, GO TOMORROW AND VOTE FOR TRUMP. THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY CHANCE TO SHOW SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS DECISION TO ATTACK YOU, JAIL YOU, BETRAY YOU, WHICH IS WHAT HE DID.

I SET ALL THE TIME, I SAY IT LIKE THIS, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME TO LEAVE THE WORD POSSIBLE OUT, THERE IS NO PRESIDENT THAT HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN DONALD TRUMP. IT'S TRUE. AND YOU ARE SEEING THAT, BY THE WAY. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN FLORIDA? THE NUMBERS ARE VERY HIGH, LIKE NO ONE HAS SEEN BEFORE, WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND THE HISPANIC AMERICAN COMMUNITY. OH, THE HISPANIC AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY ARE LIKING TRUMP. I LIKE THEM. THEY ARE LIKING ME AND I LIKE THEM. THEY ARE VOTING FOR US A VERY BIG, THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY WORRIED. THEY SAY WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT'S GOING ON? I'VE DONE A GOOD JOB, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

OTHER COUNTRIES ARE COMING IN STUDYING WHAT WE ARE DOING. ALL OVER THE PLACE, NOTHING, WHAT WE'VE DONE NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO. JOE BIDEN HAS PLEDGED OPEN BORDERS AND FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS. NO, NOT FOR YOU. I DELAYED THAT A LITTLE BIT. FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS. AND DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE BELIEVE OUR CITY SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW INVITING , LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. NOT CRIMINALS. THEIR PLAN WOULD INCREASE REFUGEES BY A STAGGERING 700%, FLOODING INTO YOUR TOWNS AND CITIES. IF IT'S OK WITH PENNSYLVANIA, I AM KEEPING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. IS THAT OK? YOU KNOW, I PASSED A BAN EARLY ON AND IT ULTIMATELY GOT APPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT BUT I PASSED A BAN BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT CAN LOVE US AND COME IN THROUGH MERIT AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE GOT TO CHOOSE , WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PACKING THE COURT, YOU KNOW? THIS GUY RUNNING NEVER GAVE AN ANSWER. MAYBE HE'S SMARTER THAN WE THINK. HE NEVER GAVE AN ANSWER. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO TELL US. WE ARE RUNNING. YOU CAN'T ELECT SOMEBODY THAT IS GOING TO PACK THE COURT AND HE'S GOING TO PACK THE COURT AND HE DIDN'T GIVE US A LIST OF THE RADICAL LEFT JUDGES HE WANTS. HE GOT AWAY WITH IT, HE GOT AWAY WITH IT. HE JUST DID. THE PRESS NEVER PRESSED HIM, RIGHT? HERE'S THE CASE, I COULD NEVER GET AWAY. THE FAKE NEWS WOULDN'T PRESS. HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT PACKING THE COURT. HE SHOULDN'T GET A VOTE UNLESS HE TELLS YOU BECAUSE HE WILL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S A BIG THING, PACKING THE COURT. CAN YOU IMAGINE? THEY NEVER PICKED IT UP. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILL , UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE WILL REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY, LOWERED DRUG PRICES.

THAT GOES ALONG WITH SPACE FORCE, DOESN'T IT? WE DID SPACE FORCE. WE NEVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT SPACE FORCE ON THE CAMPAIGN, BUT WE NEEDED IT. WHEN I SAW A RUSSIA, WHEN I SAW CHINA, WE GOT IT APPROVED. WE WILL RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. FOR YEARS YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA.

CSPANDT2112020109	Donald Trump	2020-11-02	President Trump Campaign Rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina	Thank you very much. Tomorrow we are going to win this state and we're going to win four more years and our great White House With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulation, support our great police support our fantastic military care for our veterans. Protect your Second Amendment. Defend religious liberty on endure More products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase made in the USA. A next year will be the greatest economic year in the history. of our country. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1% just announced last week. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. It's a number that we never even thought possible. Nobody did. Nobody thought it was possible. And we're gonna now even do better than that. It's going very rapidly. Well, foreign nations are in a free fall. You see what's going on with so many nations in Europe. Unfortunately, I say that with sadness, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago. Under Obama and Biden, You got to remember that you got to remember that kind of thing. They didn't do a good job. In fact, if they did, I wouldn't have run. If they did, I wouldn't be here right now. They did a bad job in Obama. Hey, went out yesterday with Biden. They got like 14 people. They didn't have too many. They didn't have too good a crowd on We have five of these today. Five way Have some big ones. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I love you, too. And I appreciate that. We appreciate it. I was I was thinking, coming in because I watched his fake Paul's everyone, no matter if it were up by 10. If we know we're gonna win easily, he's down by one point. He's down by one. I just watched this fake stuff in our center myself. You know, we've been under a phony fake hoax investigation for three years. Nothing but bad and really corrupt publicity from these people. And I say, I wonder what the difference would have been had it been legit, right? Had it been legit and it turned out to be just the opposite. They were the ones who committed the crimes, not us. But I wonder what it would have been. I probably would have been a little bit easier, but you know the good news. We're gonna win anyway. We're gonna shove it. E wonder what it would have been. I wonder what it would have been of all of the nonsense wasn't brought up. Thank you. Thank you, man. Looking tremendous in Florida. So of course they don't mention, you know, it's Florida way are looking good. We're really looking good all over in the rial polls, Not the fox polls. Those Fox polls. There's somebody in Fox doesn't like me very much. I can tell you they are the phoniest pulse. And there were There were almost a bad four years ago. Actually, they were worse. But you get some of these pollsters, they work magic. And the amazing thing is, and they hang on to their jobs, they do horribly Look at what they did list. I had nine states, and I had to win them all. And they said I was gonna lose all nine. This is four years ago. I was gonna lose all night is gonna be very short evening for Donald Trump. And the poll said decisively I was gonna lose all nine, and that was the day before. And I won all nine. I wouldn't know I want, or I wouldn't be here right now. Now I want all nine and said we're gonna lose all nine. And it was quite depressing as I turned on the television. Let's see how he did. He won Florida. He won South Carolina way. Well, thank you. And then they said they're getting rid of the guy like it. Fox. I heard that We're getting rid of that pollster. And they kept him. And they have others. They kept. And you wonder what kind of a business that issue? Wonder what? We have a case. Where? In Wisconsin. I have were one up, and I left there a couple of days ago. We had a rally. You wouldn't believe it packed. Just pack just like last night like here. But, like last night, this was a section, you know, I wanted to come. This is considered a small, beautiful, cute little wonderful section on. They asked me, and I said, I wanna be there now and every vote counts. It's very important. We had something last night in Miami. You would not have believed it. I don't know who saw it on television. I don't know, but you You look at some of these results in Wisconsin. So you know, whether I'm up one or down one. It's right in that thing. I think we're gonna win Wisconsin because we have a lot of people that say way, don't want to talk to you And then they go vote for Trump, right? You know, the hidden voter or whatever they call somebody said there the shy voters. My people are not shy. They want change. But in Wisconsin, so they said ABC News, which is, in my opinion, corrupt. But they're all corrupt. ABC News Washington Post, which is basically a, uh, lobbyists. As far as I'm concerned for Amazon, it's just a lobbyist. So they didn't say like he's two down, three down, four down, a fake poll. They said Trump is 17 points down in Wisconsin now. The real number. I mean, you know, I could lose it. I could win it. I think it's, you know, I don't know how I'm not. I did a lot of good things for Wisconsin, but, you know, let's say it's even, And I called up a great pollster, John E. SE John, Let me ask you a question. I think we're one up in Wisconsin, but ABC Washington Post they did the same thing four years ago. If you remember that very close to the election, they said. We're down 12 and then we one right, but we were down 12 and it's disheartening. It's called suppression. What it does is it suppresses people. They say, Well, listen, we love the president, but if you can't win so ABC. But they did it four years ago, and we complained bitterly with a very good lawyer. I had very good lawyers in those days. We complained very bitterly, and they changed it right before the election. I think it was one right. We're down one. They took it from 12 to 1, and it's like about 15 seconds, and I realized I said, This is a phony business But now they come down and it says 17 down in Wisconsin, 17. So I called John John McLaughlin. He's like the dean. He's a great guy and he's been very good with May. I mean, he said, we're gonna win Four years ago, he said, He said, We're gonna win easily. This one, he's probably the biggest and the best. I said, John, let me ask you a question. ABC Washington Post came out with a poll. It said I was 17 down. I'm not 17 down. I might be one down or I might be too up. But I'm not 17 down. What's going on? Why don't they make it? At least as they have to live After that? They have to do other events. Another. Why don't they make it three or four or two or five or something? Right? They said they can't do that because they want you to lose. And if you're two or three or four, everyone's gonna go vote. They want to make sure that your people don't vote, and when you're 17 down, people say, I just can't waste my time. I'm not going to stand on line And I said, Isn't that sick? And he said He knows some of the people and they're very smart. They're very brilliant. They're smart people, he said. But if they made it five down or four down or six down, even so, they make it something that's so bad. 17 down. I said, Isn't that a shame? I want to tell that story. Do you mind? You said I don't care. That's the way it is. So it's crooked stuff. The Fox polls air horrible. Every time I have a Fox poll, it's horrible. I mean, I like some of the things on Fox. Certainly, Sean and Laura Tucker has been great lately. On Fox and Friends in the morning is great way. Have we have some? I find Harris to be great Harris Faulkner to be really good. She has been very good over a period of time. The great Lou Dobbs. He's been fantastic, right? Janine? How do you like your name? Uh, and you know, look, we have some. We have some great people that support us. Jesse has been great. Hegg. Seth is, but and I don't wanna you know, there are a lot of people. Look, we have a lot, but it's 90% negative. Everything you know, everything. It's that. But so think of that. So I said 17 and he gave me an answer. I just thought it was so incredible. I said, I gotta tell that answer. So I hope I haven't bored you, but I thought it was interesting. Well, I thought it was just to me. It was interesting. And and, you know, I have, like, five of these to do today, So let's get going, E. I appreciate you being here. We had some. We had some monsters last night. We had some little rough weather. It wasn't like this way had in Michigan, we had slightly cold day with the wind blowing at 40 miles an hour in my face. And you're lucky you have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter. I was able Thio. I would have been in big trouble. There was no way you could hold paper. There was no way you could do where you were just and my guys set it up where the wind was right smack in my face and I was looking at that flag from the play and I said, Oh, no, Here we go again. But actually, the flag must be a very high quality silk because it's not that windy. But yesterday it was not. That was not an easy day. We had some very cold stops. And Biden and Harris. Kamala, Kamala, you want her? You want her is your first woman president? I don't think so. On the radical left gained power. They will collapse our economy and send our nation into a depression. Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion massively increase your regulations closed down your factories. Send your jobs overseas. That's what he's been doing all his life. Him and his group Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private health insurance. 180 million people, have great health insurance. Shred your Second Amendment, confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your Children with anti American lives. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and banned Fracking. He said it for a year and a half. He said it. Then all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania. No, I never said that. And the fake news doesn't do anything about it. Baden's energy band will send every state into crushing poverty from North Carolina to Michigan to Pennsylvania. As long as I'm president, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas. Um, girl, and we will remain energy independence. Sleepy Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, and they're all coming home. Don't worry about it. I said it. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. North Carolina lost 50% of all manufacturing jobs after those Biden betrayals, and now he says, Oh, I'm gonna teach trying to follow my policy He's trying to follow. My policy is not going to do my policy has been doing this for 47 years. Plus and for eight years as vice president, which was only 3.5 years ago. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who raked in millions from China while giving them your jobs. He's a corrupt. He's a corrupt politician. You see it now, they say the laptop shift watermelon head shift that locked up was produced by Russia. Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia. Here we go again. Can you imagine what they must take over? These people are crazy now. It was. It was produced by wears Hunter. That's right. It was produced by these guys. They're really think of it. The shift knows he's a psycho in many ways, but he knows it's a total con game. I had to put up with it for three years that it effects. You know, when you see nothing but negative television every night, every night, every night and then they find totally no collusion after wasting $48 million 18 people think of it and then it's no collusion, but then you have to run. But you've had three years of horrible publicity. And they did it. I mean, they did it. They were the criminals. Hillary was a criminal. She deleted her emails. People go to jail for that. These air criminals, these air criminals, and say it any way you want to, dio. But we took the brunt that we caught him spying in my campaign and trying toe overthrow a duly elected president. The United States. So I go. And that was before I even knew. I mean, that was while I was while I was running. I didn't even know I'd hear these things. Sir, this is before he got elected. Guys would come up to me every once in a while. Sir, do you have anything to do with Russia? I said no. What do you ask? I was just curious because it was like this thing floating around. Then they come up again, sir. Are you sure you don't have anything to do with Russia? I said I have nothing to do with Russia. What the hell are you doing? And you know you hear it four or five times. Then you get into office and they come up with this scheme. And this this'll plot was a plot to overthrow the government to the United States. And then we have people that just don't act fast. I mean, it's just unbelievable way have so much. We have so much information. We have so much, we have the whole thing and Obama was involved and Biden was involved. They were involved. But let's let's see what happens. People should move more quickly. In 2016 North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first on. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician is because I'm not a politician, E don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you. And I fight harder than any president has ever for his people. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote. That's all I ask. Just take a little time and vote. Wow, We got a win. This state. I think we win this state. We win Pennsylvania, We're going to win Florida. We win Pennsylvania. And you were gonna win the whole thing. Wait, hold on. We'll send them a signal like they've never seen before. This has not happened to them. Big tech is so powerful, you can't beat big tech. They're saying this on. I see it on Twitter trending trending trend, right? It's not trending. They put the most boring thing Onley It was anything bad about me. Number one in the world on trend, right? Boring stuff. I mean, like stuff as opposed to affairs scandals. That didn't even put that stuff up. It's always trump 2345 items. It's a fix. It's a fixed. This'd is a smart guy. We have his name, everybody knows who he is. And I'm not talking about the primary. I'm talking about people that work. They take stuff out of ahead. Let's see. This is bad about Trump. Let's make it worse. Okay? We'll make it worse. Okay. Number one trend in the whole world. No, that's not stuff that trends, but these air phony guys, they fixed the elections. And you know what? They should be subject to campaign violations, because there, uh, they're an arm of the Democrat National Committee, and they work together. They work on messaging together, the Democrats, the fake news media to the worst. The fact is, the fake people. And if I've done one thing, it's to expose the dishonesty in the media on not everybody but a big, vast majority of vast majority. Not everybody. Look at us. We catch Hunter and Joe cheating. We catch them stealing millions of dollars. They refused to write a story. Could you imagine if I got $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Could you imagine? Somebody gave me 3.5 million bucks. Somebody gave me $20. I got They impeached me because they made a perfect phone call to the head of Ukraine. I never met the gentleman. Congratulations on your win. If you see anything corrupt, please call the Attorney general of the United States on. We have a corruption agreement with them because it's been a very corrupt country. I actually have an obligation now. Of course, they impeached before they found out before I decided to release the phone call. Isn't it lucky that I had that call transcript? Can you imagine? Now? Can you imagine now? They couldn't do. They didn't know what to do. Crazy, Nancy said. This is an impeachable, she said. You're right. They said You're right But let's go through with it anyway. Maybe we'll get lucky. Didn't know this is because she didn't know about the call. When she read the call, she said he didn't do anything wrong. How did you get me into this, you shifty shift? How did you do it? Jerryler. I've been fighting this guy for 25 years on the East Side of Manhattan, the West Side of Manhattan. Jerry Nadler. He's a beauty, isn't he? How did you get me into this? Well, let's just keep going forward. It's a disgrace, and we want I will say this for the Republicans, 197 or 697 to nothing we want. And in the Senate, 52 a half to one half, we lost a half of us I wonder who that could have been, but sleepy Joe Biden is bought and paid for by China. He's got Hey, they gave the sun a billion and a half dollars to manage. That means gonna make millions of dollars a year that he doesn't know anything about Investment. Didn't know anything at all about energy. Got $183,000 a month on energy. Think of that. I think of the $183,000 I called a friend of mine on Wall Street. Is this a normal fee? He said no, maybe the most abnormal fee I've ever seen in my whole life. I've been doing this for 25 years. He's the biggest guy, but they're bought and paid for. They got the money, and then they were going for the big one. In China. They wrote a letter to very big, powerful man within the Communist Party. And where's Hunter? As for 10 million dollars a year, as he was going to recommend he was going to talk. You're going to see Here's the guy. Didn't have a job got thrown out of the Navy. You got thrown out of the Navy. He didn't have a job. Biden becomes vice president, and this kid is like a vacuum cleaner going all over the world, following his father, picking up the scraps. You know, he's following his dad picking up scraps, and then you find the note where the big man gets 10%. The big man's Joe Biden. The big man gets 10 that in one case they said 50% right. That's more likely because he wouldn't do it for 10 he'd want, because these people are all hangers on losers. But that's the story, and it's in a laptop. And now they say, the laptop was made by Russia. Therefore, it has no credit. Can, you know? Can you believe this? All right. And so the news. There's not outside of the New York Post, which, really, I hold in high esteem. They have done their like a hero paper, and they endorsed me. I got a nice endorsement from Did you say from Pennsylvania yesterday, Right? Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Gazette. That was nice. Once I got through that first paragraph, it was phenomenal. Actually, they said we don't love his personality. We don't love his tough doing it but I have to be tough. Look, I've been under investigation from before I ever became president. I have to be tough. If I was soft, I wouldn't be here right now and they don't want to say that. I was under a fake investigation by a lot of fake people. Bob Mueller and his crew. The whole thing was a fake scam that should have never been started. And they knew the answer on the first day. But it took him 2.5 years to put it down. No collusion. But they knew the answer the first day. So I was under investigation for the 1st 2.5 years, right? Think of that. And then they say he's tough, but I'll take it anyway. I'll take your endorsement anyway, because once you get over the first paragraph two, it says all of the things we've done which are incredible, which you're incredible and now we'll have a chance to do it without the cloud. Because I had a cloud hanging over my head whether we like it or not. And then they say he was tough. He fought too hard. He was somewhat crude. He was very, very nasty. His twitter. Now, you know what? If I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be here was the only way I could defend myself. So it's one of those things, But I just wonder I was thinking I asked the people in the way. We have great people, such loyal, great people, including a man that comes from an area not too far from here is a good friend of these women who've been here six this number 64 times for these incredible beautiful. I think rich women and their husbands air in here someplace. But they had their husbands. They were at the one last night. That was a big deal, wasn't it? But this is number 64 I would say Right. 65. 0, there's two more. They come from North Carolina, but we have Mark Meadows comes from North Carolina, then he has been fantastic. He's done a great job. He's done a great job. Where is he? He's probably working, you know, Bum bum bum with a phone. He's got two phones instead of one, and he's not gonna break it up with a hammer like Hillary did. He's gonna it's gonna throw it away. Who come down, what? He's done a fantastic job, and he is. And he loves his state. He loves North Carolina. Then I specifically said, I want somebody from North Carolina and give me Meadows now. I knew three years ago I said, We got to get meadows in here. Big tech, big media, big donors and powerful special interests are desperate for sleepy gel to win. They want him to win. I'll tell you, who wants him to win China. They will own our country because they own him. They control him and they know he will always be there to do their bidding. He'll always be there. It's a corrupt. He's a corrupt politician. I don't care. I'll say, And I say it. Everybody knows it's true. Can you imagine? Big Tech refuses to put anything in. They took the New York Post down for two weeks because they they won't let anyone right. If you put out a little tweet and say that Biden is corrupt, they will knock out your whole account. Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and you notice it is outside of what I say. It is indeed fading away because you can't have a scandal if nobody writes about it. So we have the fake news, not writing about it, and you have the big tech not writing. So So how can you have a scandal? Nobody's talking about? Nobody's allowed to talk. It's called suppression. We don't have freedom of the press. We don't have probably haven't had it for a long time. But we don't have. You know, they say freedom of the press the American way. We don't have. We have suppression by the press. That's what it is. What beautiful words. I should have done the speech this way. It would have been much more interesting. What? A No. But seriously, we have suppression by the press. This is not freedom. This is the the it really is. It's the exact opposite of freedom of the press. You know, if you think about it, every corrupt horse in American life that is responsible for cruel betrayals that hurt our family and all of the people that we love. They're supported by Biden and they donated, but, you know, I could have been a much bigger fundraiser than him, but I didn't want to call every head of a Wall Street firm every head of the oil companies that we've made Rich. Anyway, I did a great job. We're energy independent. That's that. So bad. First time the failed establishment that started the disasters. Foreign wars. They support sleepy Joe Biden because they get anything they want. And he took in $300 million last month. You think he made any deals? No, I don't think so. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories. They support Sleepy Joe, the open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crimes. The people that wanted to stop the world, even though it do it works almost finished by the way he finished. But the people that wanted to stop it even though they knew full well it worked. Remember? They said, No. No, we don't want a wall. Walls are obsolete. We want drones. Drones. Okay, good drones. Flying toe watch. The people pour into our country. They want drones. Let's have drones. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values. They support. Sleepy Joe Biden. You can't even go to your church is you can't even go to your church and your governor of North Carolina. You gotta open up your state. You gotta get your governor. I hope you're gonna vote for Dan. But But you gotta get your state open. Don't worry about it. On November 4th, they'll announce your state is opening on November 4th. North Carolina will be opened on November 4. The anti right after the election, the anti. And because they want us to look bad, they don't care about people. They want us to look bad. They want to try and steal an election. The anti American radicals defaming our noble history or heritage are heroes. They support sleepy Joe Antifa and the riders and looters and Marxists and left wing extremists. They all support Joe Biden. They always like to blame it on the right. You have an honest These were right wing. Yeah, it's very rare. You get bad on every side, but they always like to blame the right. It always starts off with the right. The right. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the arrogant, corrupt, ruthless and selfless political class. Or do you want to be governed by the American people themselves? You wanna be represented by a career politician who hates you or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before? I didn't need this job. I had a very nice life. But I love what we're doing for our country. Nobody has done so much Nobody, no administration. And, you know, I never even had a challenge on this from the fake news. You know, normally, if you say something slightly off, they make a big deal. No administration president has Dunmore in the 1st 3.5 years than we have our military. We rebuilt our tax, but our regulation Cox Space Force, just a thing like space was I never even talked about Space Force right during the campaign. I did mawr than I actually talked about during the campaign. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. E thought this was a small, little cute area. You know, this was a small, little cute area when I came in. I'm watching Fox and a gentleman and anchor said. They have a small crowd of about 22,500. Uh, I knew I knew, you know, it's It's an incredible thing. This is a lot more than that. There's a lot of people. There's a lot more than I wanted to be here because it's important. I mean, my granddaughter is named Carolina, you know, on. We'll give South Carolina some credit to, you know, they've been with us. Is that okay? I want to get your permission now. We'll give South Carolina. South Carolina is great. Great people, too. Ah, vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys to government over to people who despise you and who want to rob your Children of their American dream. That's what they're doing. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist communist Socialist, the wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence sensor, cancel and punish you. If you want your Children to be safe and remember this against this, I'll put it very simply against the Second Amendment, right. If you're pro life, you can forget about it. You know that, but tremendous support way have what we have. Did you see these people in California? They have lines of hundreds of miles of cars and tractors in Iowa on boats, five or 6000 votes in lakes and oceans with the flags. And if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor and dignity and respect than I am asking for you to go out tomorrow or sooner. But I don't know, you tend to like to vote on election day, right way and vote is gonna be the most important election. In my opinion, in the history of our country, I never thought I was going to say it. If you would have told me I was going to say that four years ago, I would have said You're crazy But it's the most important because I've always said we will never be a socialist nation that Z and I well remember what I said four years ago is that I am your voice and we will make America great again, and that's what we're doing. Uh, and if we didn't get hit by the China plague now we're building it up again and we're doing it at a record clip in record numbers and at a much faster pace than any other country in the world. But we got hit by the plague from China, and we will never forget it. With God is my witness, I will never let you down. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me. Because they know I don't answer to them. I answer to you. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class and we will drain the Washington Swamp Way will save the American dream Thistle ec Shin is also a choice between a deadly Biden locked down. He wants to have you locked down. Yeah, I don't even know if he knows. I mean to be, uh they asked him a question. I don't I don't think he has a clue. You could vote whoever you want, but I don't think he has a clue. You know it. The media knows that the media laughs behind his back. And then they say he did brilliantly today. No, he didn't do brilliantly. He can't do it. He didn't do brilliantly in his prime. And he's not in his prime anymore, or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic. And we're doing very well with the vaccine will be distributed very soon. We will mdistribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague. Once and for all, Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turned America into a prison state. Looking again, that's more Kamala Remember when they said, this is the Harris Biden administration? Right? I never did that with Mike, and you know what? Mike Pence never came to you, he said. Do you mind if I put my name first every once in a while? No. Because, by the way, he's been a great vice president. Some people say it was a perfect combination. That was. He's a great guy. He loves. He's gonna be in your state a little while locking you in your home while letting far left riders room free. The Biden locked down will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no eastern, no Christmas, no Fourth of July and no future for America's youth. Other than that is fine. I think it's just if you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom Thio live your life. Then you go and cast your ballot for President Trump. And if you remember the catastrophe Joe Biden, he's telling us how to run things right. This guy never ran a thing successfully. He was said horrible things about him. When he was in the administer, Obama didn't even want to endorse him. He wouldn't endorse him even after he won Obama's that. This is no way. How long did it take him after you want it took for every Obama couldn't believe it. I don't think Obama is much better. You want to know that Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right? The swine flu H one n one, which he could never remember. He never says a He says it. It goes in one h one. I said, Don't. He failed horribly, and he was a laughing stock all over Washington. They were laughing at him and his own chief of staff said he was absolutely terrible. They had a terrible they did a terrible job. Now he's telling us how to do it. I should have closed earlier. There's only one problem. He's on record all over the place, knocking May 2.5 months later for closing too soon and closing it all, he said. Don't close, he xenophobic. You know, a xenophobic I didn't like people from China is what he's saying. It's so wrong. E think they're incredible people. I do. I think they're incredible people. But he said xenophobic and then he runs for office. Is he should have closed earlier. And you know what the press never covers that they just you can't get. The only time I get it covered is if I happen to be on live television, I'll say it again and again, and when I do say it, they try and turn it off. Let's go to commercial break right now. I think I know what's coming. Thes air, really bad people. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that Biden has been wrong on every actually or nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He had no respect for him whatsoever. Puree endorsed him because he's probably looking for something like everybody else, but I don't think any of them are going to get anything is I think we're gonna have one of the greatest victories tomorrow. But you don't have to take my word for what a disaster Joe Biden is because it's the great state of North Carolina. I spent a fortune, see, does see the board. I spent a lot of money on the board, so let's just take a look at a little roll. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it to yourselves. Our country has such potential. You can't do that to our country. He's not mentally equipped, just doesn't to be your president. He's not equipped to be your president, and I say it. You know, I say it because he's not a nice person. Never was a nice person, but he was never a smart person. He was a touchy feely person, you know, Hale and hearty, but not nice. But this is not a man that 25 years ago is not equipped to be your president and Iran. Many times, numerous times we called him 1% Joe. Think of it. And now he's working on about 50% and he ends up winning the nomination because of Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren gave him that. All she had to do is drop out and he would have lost on super. Then we would add Crazy Bernie. So you know what? That but at least Bernie, you know, they had a great, energetic base. It's a small base, but energetic. But this is not a man that should be your president. We have tremendous potential. Our country has tremendous potential, and we can't blow it way can't blow it because there's no way to describe that. And that's, like, 1%. We could keep you out here all day. Much of it happened yesterday and the day before yesterday. Oh, he had some beauties yesterday, but we can't do this and you know what's gonna happen. Kamala will be put in that position very quickly. Me? All right on. She's more liberal than crazy Bernie. She's more liberal. In fact, she makes him look like a strict conservative. Joining us today are some incredible people, incredible friends and warriors. And I want to tell you, I just looked at a poll that he's up in the poll. Senator Thom Tillis. He's up, He's up. That's great. I'm good. I'm very happy with that. That's we gotta get him. And he's a good man, a good man. And your wife was great the other night. We had a good We had a great rally the other night and you were well represented. Let me tell you very well. Congratulations. Well, let's save that for tomorrow or the next day. Or, as the Supreme Court would say sometime into the future. What a ruling. What a ruling. How? The horrible thing that they've done Do you know that puts our country in danger? Do you know what can happen during that long period of time? Pennsylvania. The long period of time. Do you know what can happen? Number one cheating can happen like you've never seen. This is their dream. And they are They are known for it. You know, the Philadelphia area is known for it, but what can happen during that long period of time is just a disgrace. Get your ballots in and have them in long before the third and have them counted before the third and and having election where we can say to the world that we know who won and we know who lost. What are our Supreme Court? I'm just I'm just so tired of some of these horrible political decisions that are being made. It's a shame. It's a shame. And, you know I won't get into it too much. But I'm going to start getting into it because they're hurting our country very badly. Very bad. Representative Warrior David Rouser rouser. David David Rouser David. Thank you.

He should win. He's a great congressman. All of them. All three. Thank you very much, fellas. A man that hopefully you're going to recognize.

That's Hey, Dan, That's a very impressive applause. You gotta have to be on. Don't kid yourself. That is like a pole. You know, it's like a poll. Except instead of interviewing 73 people, they have thousands of people here much more than the 2000. He's got a nice 2000 people, and I don't think so. Well, last night in Miami, you want to see a crowd you couldn't even see the end of it. I've never seen anything like it. There's such spirit. I've never seen spirit like this on North Carolina. GOP chair. Somebody doing an incredible job if we went tomorrow. By the way, If we don't win tomorrow, they'll say, How's Michael Watley doing? I say not good at all. He didn't do a good job.

Thank you very much. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously repeatedly attacked black Americans. He decimated the black middle class and called Young Black Men Super predators to every black American vote for Trump. This'd is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden. What do you think of his decision to attack you? To insult you, to jail you and to betray you. I am fighting for you and got criminal justice reform, prison Reform Opportunity zones with Tim Scott and funding for historically black colleges and universities. I got it done. Nobody else got it. And with the exception of that, I use the word possibly possible exception. But I could use it. Or maybe I won't. I'll keep it a little bit less controversial. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, there's been no president. That's dunmore for the black community than Donald Trump? No, thank you. Very. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History. Joe Biden has pledged to open Borders. He's actually talking about taking down the walk. And you believe, Let's take down the wall, let everybody pour into our country. He wants to take down though He said it, I don't know, Maybe. But he did say, Let's take down the wall. One of the biggest projects that we've ever done. You know, it's a tremendous project. We're up to over 400 miles. We're gonna be finished very soon. Over 400. Exactly. Designed to the specifications of the Border Patrol who are great mass amnesty wants to give them free health care. This is for illegal aliens and wants to keep deadly sanctuary cities. Your state has a sanctuary city. You know that, right? You have a sanctuary city, right? A very big one, actually. That doesn't work very well. We believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. The Biden Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist nations by a staggering 700%. This has been agreed. Toe has been agreed. Thio? No, thank you, fellas. I'm not interested. I'm keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. If I have e have the approval of North Carolina will keep. We're going to keep him way invested. $2.5 trillion in the U. S. Military. We have the greatest equipment. Greatest people, 2.5 trillion. You think that was easy to get from the Democrats? Actually, the wall was even tougher. The wall was tougher. We got it. Do you notice? Once I got the wall started, got all the funding. One. All the court cases against the Democrats. The president talks about it anymore. They don't talk about it. We have the best statistics, the best. And can you imagine during the pandemic? Because, you know, Mexico's very heavily, unfortunately infected. And it was a good thing that we had it up. That's why the numbers are so good. We also pass for our great vets V A Choice and va accountability. Nobody thought that could happen. We obliterated 100% of the Isis Caliphate way killed the leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead. Last week I visited Fort Bragg, where I presented the presidential unit citation to the Special Forces team that achieved that historic victory. It was, and we are keeping the name Fort Bragg. You dio they want cancel culture. You know, we won two world wars out of Fort Bragg, and we have other forts, and we're keeping it way won two World wars at a Fort Bragg on. Now they say, Let's change the name. Let's change the name before it. Greg, we'll pick somebody else. Do you have any good suggestions now? No. No, we have to. We have to keep. We have to keep its our culture. It's our heritage. So many victories, so many victories At a Fort Bragg, we also eliminated the world's top terrorist. Solomon is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. E also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they tried together on instead of endless war in the Middle East were forging peace. Were lined up to come in. I said, How did Obama and all of those that came before him do it? They told me they all use the same method. I said, really, I'm going to go the opposite about that. And it worked very nicely. No, No blood in the sand. No cost three very powerful countries already signed. We have many others. They're standing online. What? Standing in? And we're bringing our troops back home. Our troops air coming back home. They're coming back in 19 years is enough. They serve as policemen. I said no. You have to get your own police department. I'm sorry. A vote for me and the Republican Party is a vote for the American dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. Way will end our reliance on China, which has already served. Can you imagine? Biden sang. We're not gonna We're not gonna end our reliance. I mean, can you imagine we are going to end our reliance on you. Hey. Hey. We gave you seven billion and a half. What the hell are you telling May? Okay. Well, I don't know, Senator. I think it would be tough for him, right? No, they wanted 10 million. They wanted 10 year for his services, right? And then you say, No, I'm not going to do with China anymore. Or I'm gonna be tough in China. You know, I've taken out many, many billions of dollars. We never did this in this country, not 10 cents. I gave $28 billion from China to our farmers because they targeted our farm 2028 billion. And we had plenty of money left over which went into the U. S. Treasury. Thank you. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary city. With God's help, we will defend the right to life religious liberty, free speech at the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might. And we will ensure peace through strength. You know, with the envy of every country in the world. Our military now has the greatest equipment all made in the USA. But we have the greatest equipment in the world. We will end surprise medical building require price transparency at lower drug prices. Even Mawr. We instituted a favorite nations laws we paid by far the most in the world. We're going to pay now the least in the world and nobody can believe I did it. And the Big Pharma does not like me too much. They're not so happy with me. And we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will add The first woman in the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars Way will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school way will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag way will live by the timeless words of our national motto.

CSPANDT5112020111	Donald Trump	2020-11-05	President Trump Remarks on Election Results	Good evening. I'd like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late - we're looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late. I've already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech. As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave. And it's been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn't do us any good. We kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really - much more competitive states, we've - we did a fantastic job with the Senate, and I think we're very proud of what's happened there. We had many more seats to defend. They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone - two races - and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents' major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn't believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way. This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That's a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters - the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history. Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that's what's happened. And we're also, I believe, the party of inclusion. As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls - I have to call them phony polls, fake polls - were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans' ability to raise funds. They were what's called "suppression polls." Everyone knows that now. And it's never been used to the extent that it's been used on this last election. The day before election, Quinnipiac - which was wrong on every occasion that I know of - had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So, they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio - the great state of Ohio - very easily. The Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They're not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression. There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run, in all cases, by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn't allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away - or outside the building to observe people inside the building. And we won a case - a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of - lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there's tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I've been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It's - it's really destroyed our system. It's a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren't by nature, but they become corrupt; it's too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them. And you see that on Election Night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot - tremendous number of votes. And we're still ahead by a lot, but not as many because they're finding ballots all of a sudden. "Oh, we have some mail-in ballots." It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided, too. I know that it's supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they're so one-sided. We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to - I think they said now we're up by 90,000 votes. And they'll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don't want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers. Likewise, in Geor- - and they're appealing. Actually, they're appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers, and they're actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they'd appeal - that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations. Likewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot - a lot - with a lead of over - getting close to 300,000 votes on Election Night in Georgia. And, by the way, got whittled down, and now it's getting to be to a point where I'll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats. We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan; won the state. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every - in every case, they got whittled down. Today, we're on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote - 55 percent margins. And that's a margin that we've significantly exceeded. So we'll see what happens with that, but we're on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We'll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can't allow silence -anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results. I've never had - I've been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I've never had anything that's been as inspirational by people - calling, talking, sending things to us. I've never seen such - such love and such affection and such spirit as I've seen for this. People know what's happening, and they see what's happening, and it's before their eyes. And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There's tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election, they're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia - known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily - cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race - a very important presidential race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers, and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they're - they're going forward. They don't want anybody in there. They don't want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can't imagine why. There's absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it's straight, they would be - they should be proud of it. Instead, they're trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There's no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away - very far away - so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there's been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can't see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent. The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day - that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren't. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn't do that. Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That's why they did the mail-in ballots, where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That's why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I've told everybody that these things would happen, because I've seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody - in many cases, totally unsolicited. This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they're eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they're just taking numbers. They're writing down things - the workers - and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you'll see that will shake even you people up, and you've seen it all. The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you've written about - and, for a long time, you've been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn't changed. It's a long time ago, and it hasn't changed. It's gotten worse. In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place - and I wouldn't say has the best reputation for election integrity. Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn't see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there. In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and - even though the polls closed at eight o'clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We've also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name "Biden" on them, or just about all - I think almost all. They all had the name "Biden" on them, which is a little strange. I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word "legal" - "legal votes." "We want every legal vote counted." And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency - no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don't want votes cast after Election Day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It's so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it's a very important job. So that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen by - like this. And I - I tell you, I would - I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I've said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous. This is a large-scale version, and it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories - absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins - Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen. So it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it'll probably go through a process - a legal process. And, as you know, I've claimed certain states and he's claiming states. So we can both claim the states, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans, and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477858-1/president-trump-remarks-election-results	President Trump made his first remarks at the White House two days after Election Day and without a declared winner in the presidential race. &ldquo;This is a case where they&rsquo;re trying to steal an election. They&rsquo;re trying to rig an election and we can&rsquo;t let that happen,&rdquo; said the president without providing evidence to back his assertions. President Trump claimed that mail-in ballots inherently led to &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; and election workers &ldquo;finding&rdquo; these ballots during the counting process amounted to election fraud. The president said his campaign would pursue legal action, including going to the Supreme Court.	477858-1	Speech
CSPANDT2122020112	Donald Trump	2020-12-02	President Trump Statement on 2020 Election Results	YOU ARE WATCHING C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT. CREATED BY AMERICA'S CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY AS A PUBLIC SERVICE AND BROUGHT TO YOU TODAY BY IN A VIDEO POSTED ON FACEBOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTION AND EXAMPLES OF WHAT HE VIEWS AS FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. HIS REMARKS, A DAY AFTER ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD NOT UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD THAT WOULD OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. THIS IS 45 MINUTES. KNOW WE HAVE ELECTION DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS AND LOTS OF BAD THINGS HAPPENED DURING THIS RIDICULOUS PERIOD OF TIME, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO PROVE ALMOST NOTHING TO EXERCISE OUR GREATEST PRIVILEGE, THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE NO HIGHER DUTY THAN TO DEFEND THE LOADS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY I AM DETERMINED TO PROTECT OUR ELECTION SYSTEM, WHICH IS NOW UNDER COORDINATED ASSAULT AND SIEGE. FOR MONTHS, LEADING UP TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WE WERE WARNED WE SHOULD NOT DECLARE A PREMATURE VICTORY. WE WERE TOLD REPEATEDLY IT WOULD TAKE WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS TO DETERMINE THE WINNER, TO COUNT THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND TO VERIFY THE RESULTS. MY OPPONENT WAS TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM THE ELECTION, DON'T CAMPAIGN. WE DON'T NEED YOU. WE HAVE GOT IT. THIS ELECTION IS DONE. THEY WERE ACTING LIKE THEY ALREADY KNEW WHAT THE OUTCOME WAS GOING TO BE. THEY HAD A COVER AND PERHAPS THEY DID, VERY SADLY FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT WAS ALL VERY, VERY STRANGE. WITHIN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, WE WITNESSED AN ORCHESTRATED EFFORT TO ANOINT A WINNER EVEN WHILE MANY KEY STATES WERE BEING COUNTED. THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND THE HONESTY OF THE VOTE BY ENSURING THAT EVERY LEGAL BALLOT IS COUNTED AND THAT NO ILLEGAL BALLOT IS COUNTED. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT HONORING THE VOTES OF 74 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED FOR ME. IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT AMERICANS CAN HAVE FAITH IN THIS ELECTION AND ALL FUTURE ELECTIONS. TODAY, I WILL DETAIL SOME OF THE SHOCKING IRREGULARITIES, ABUSES AND FRAUD THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED IN RECENT WEEKS. BEFORE LAYING OUT A SMALL PORTION OF THE EVIDENCE, AND WE HAVE SO MUCH EVIDENCE, I WANT TO EXPLAIN THE CORRUPT MARYLAND BALLOTING SCHEME DEMOCRATS PUT INTO PLACE THAT ALLOWED VOTING TO BE ALTERED, ESPECIALLY IN SWING STATES, WHICH THEY HAD TO WIN. THEY JUST DID NOT KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT TOUGH BECAUSE WE WERE LEADING IN EVERY SWING STATE BY SO MUCH. FAR GREATER THAN THEY EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. WHILE IT HAS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD THE DEMOCRAT POLITICAL MACHINE ENGAGES IN VOTER FRAUD FROM DETROIT TO PHILADELPHIA TO MILWAUKEE, ATLANTA, SO MANY OTHER PLACES, WHAT CHANGED THIS YEAR WAS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY'S RELENTLESS PUSH TO PRINT AND MAIL OUT TENS AND MILLIONS OF BALLOTS SENT TO UNKNOWN RECIPIENTS WITH VIRTUALLY NO SAFEGUARDS OF ANY KIND. THIS ALLOWED FRAUD AND ABUSE TO OCCUR ON A SCALE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. USING THE PANDEMIC AS A PRETEXT, DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS AND JUDGES DRASTICALLY CHANGED ELECTION PROCEDURES JUST MONTHS AND IN SOME CASES WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION ON THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER. VERY RARELY WERE LEGISLATURES INVOLVED IN CONSTITUTIONALLY, THEY HAD TO BE INVOLVED, BUT VERY RARELY AND YOU WILL SEE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO FILE OUR SUITS. IT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY, ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT WHAT TOOK PLACE, EVEN FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. MANY STATES SUCH AS NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA SENT MILLIONS OF LIVE BALLOTS TO EVERY PERSON ON VOTER ROLLS WHETHER THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD REQUESTED ALL ITS OR NOT, WHETHER THEY WERE , REQUESTED BALLOTS OR NOT, WHETHER THEY WERE DEAD OR ALIVE, THEY GOT BALLOTS. OTHER STATES INSTITUTED UNIVERSAL ABSENTEE BALLOTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION YEAR, SENDING ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST FORMS TO ALL VOTERS ON ALL ROLES . IT DID NOT MATTER WHO THEY WERE. THIS COLOSSAL EXPANSION OF MAIL-IN VOTING OPENED THE FLOODGATES TO MASSIVE FRAUD. IT WAS A WIDELY KNOWN FACT THE VOTING ROLLS WERE PACKED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE TO VOTE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE DECEASED, HAVE MOVED OUT OF THEIR STATE, AND EVEN ARNON CITIZENS , EVEN ARE NONCITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT DISPUTED. IT HAS NEVER BEEN DISPUTED. DOZENS OF COUNTIES IN THE KEY SWING STATES HAVE MORE REGISTERED VOTERS ON THE ROLES THEN THEYAN THEY HAVE VOTING AGE CITIZENS INCLUDING 67 COUNTIES IN MICHIGAN. IN WISCONSIN, THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS COULD NOT CONFIRM THE RESIDENCY OF MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE, BUT REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO REMOVE THOSE NAMES FROM VOTER ROLLS BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY KNEW WHY. NOBODY ELSE DID. I KNEW WHY. THEY WERE ILLEGAL VOTERS. IT IS A TRAVESTY THAT IN THE YEAR 2020, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MEANS OF VERIFYING THE ELIGIBILITY OF THOSE WHO CAST BALLOTS IN AN ELECTION AND SUCH AN IMPORTANT ELECTION IT IS, FOR DETERMINING WHO THEY ARE, WHETHER THEY LIVE IN THE STATE OR WHETHER THEY EVEN OUR AMERICAN CITIZENS. THAT EVEN OUR AMERICANARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. FAR MORE VOTES THAN WE NEED TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF A STATE. IN WISCONSIN AS AN EXAMPLE, WHERE WE WERE WAY UP ON ELECTION NIGHT, THEY ULTIMATELY HAD US MIRACULOUSLY LOSING BY 20,000 VOTES, AND I CAN SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE. WISCONSIN, WE ARE LEADING BY A LOT. AND THEN, AT 3:40 TWO IN THE MORNING, THERE WAS THIS. IT WAS A MASSIVE DUMP OF VOTES. MOSTLY BIDEN. ALMOST ALL BIDEN. TO THIS DAY, EVERYONE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE DID IT COME FROM. I WENT FROM LEADING BY A LOT TO LOSING BY A LITTLE HIT , BY A LITTLE. THAT IS IT 3:42 IN THE MORNING. A TERRIBLE THING. A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THING. WE WILL HAVE FAR MORE, MANY TIMES MORE THAN THE 20,000 VOTES NEEDED TO OVERTURN THE STATE. IF WE ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE FRAUD, JOE BIDEN CANNOT BE PRESIDENT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTES. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN CERTAIN STATES, WE WILL BE DOWN BY LET'S SAY 7000 VOTES. BUT WE WILL FIND LATER ON THE 20,000, 50,000, 200,000 DISCREPANCIES OR FRAUDULENT VOTES AND THAT INCLUDES VOTES THAT WENT THROUGH WHEN THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SEEN BY REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS BECAUSE THE POLL WATCHERS WERE LOCKED OUT OF THE BUILDING OR PEOPLE THAT NSA LIKE CAME TO VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3 , THAT INNOCENTLY CAME TO VOTE ON NOVEMBER 30 WHO WERE EXCITED ABOUT THEIR VOTE, THEY WERE HAPPY. THEY WERE PROUD TO BE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY WENT UP AND SAID I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT VOTE. I AM SORRY, THEY WERE TOLD. YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED BY MAIL-IN BALLOT. CONGRATULATIONS. WE RECEIVED A BALLOT SO YOU CAN NO LONGER VOTE. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEY HAD NO ONE TO COMPLAIN TO. MOST JUST LAUGHED AND SAID, THAT IS STRANGE. BUT MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINED AND COMPLAINED VEHEMENTLY. IN A LOT OF CASES, THEY FILLED OUT A PROVISIONAL BALLOT, WHICH WAS ALMOST NEVER USED, BUT IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CASE WAS A VOTE FOR TRUMP. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WENT IN TO VOTE AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY VOTED AND THEY DID NOT VOTE AND THEY LAUGHED AND THEY FELT HORROR AND THEY LOST RESPECT FOR OUR SYSTEM AND THIS HAPPENED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THAT IS HOW DESPERATE THE DEMOCRATS WERE. THEY WOULD FILL OUT BALLOTS OF PEOPLE NOT EVEN KNOWING IF THESE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SHOW UP. IF THEY DID SHOW UP, THEY SAID SORRY, YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED. ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, WE HAVE A COMPANY THAT IS VERY SUSPECT. IT'S NAME IS DOMINION. , ITS NAME IS DOMINION. WITH THE TURN OF THE DIAL OR THE CHANGE OF A CHIP, YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON FOR TRUMP AND IT GOES TO BIDEN. WE HAVE TO GO FOR PAPER. THE ONLY SECURITY SYSTEM IS PAPER. NOT THESE SYSTEMS THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS INCLUDING IN MANY CASES THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THEM ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THEM FAR TOO WELL. IN ONE MICHIGAN COUNTY, AS AN EXAMPLE THAT USED DOMINION SYSTEMS, THEY FOUND THAT NEARLY 6000 VOTES HAD BEEN WRONGLY SWITCHED FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THIS IS WHAT WE CAUGHT. HOW MANY DIDN'T WE CATCH? ARE THERE HUNDREDS OF OTHER EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? WE JUST GOT LUCKY. THEY CALLED IT A GLITCH. BUT WE FOUND NUMEROUS GLITCHES THAT EVENING. 96 OF THE COMPANY'S POLITICAL DONATIONS WENT TO DEMOCRATS, NOT SURPRISINGLY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO IS RUNNING THE COMPANY, WHO IS IN CHARGE, WHO OWNS IT, WHERE ARE THE VOTES COUNTED, WHICH WE THINK ARE COUNTED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, DOMINION IS A DISASTER. ELECTION AUTHORITIES IN TEXAS HAVE REPEATEDLY BLOCKED THE DEPLOYMENT OF DOMINION SYSTEMS DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ERRORS AND OUTRIGHT FRAUD. EVERY DISTRICT THAT USES DOMINION SYSTEMS MUST BE CAREFULLY MONITORED AND CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED BUT NOT ONLY FOR THE FUTURE. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PRESENT AND WHAT WENT ON WITH AN ELECTION THAT WE WON. THE REPUBLICANS WON ALMOST EVERY STATE HOUSE. WE WENT UP TO 16 SEATS IN THE HOUSE. THE NUMBERS ARE STILL BEING TABULATED BECAUSE THERE ARE NINE SEATS THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. THEY ARE STILL TWO WEEKS LATER UNDER CONSIDERATION. BECAUSE IT IS A MESS. REPUBLICANS WERE SUPPOSED TO LOSE MANY STATES AND INSTEAD , MANY SEATS AND INSTEAD THEY WON THOSE SEATS IN THE HOUSE. A VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION THAT IS COMING UP WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE HOLD THE SENATE. DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER ARE TWO TREMENDOUS PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN GEORGIA, THEY ARE USING THE SAME HORRIBLE DOMINION SYSTEM AND IT IS ALREADY BEEN OUT , IT HAS ALREADY BEEN OUT THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, THINK OF IT, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED. YOU CHECK IT OUT WHO IS REQUESTING THOSE BALLOTS. THE DIFFERENCE IS, IT IS ONE STATE AND WE WILL HAVE OUR EYES ON IT LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER WANTS ANYTHING BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WIN THOSE TWO SENATE SEATS. THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WE HAD IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WE HAVE HAD SO FAR IN THE SENATE , UNEXPECTED SUCCESS. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON. IT IS STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PERSON, ME, THAT LED THE CHARGE LOST. THE REAL POSTERS, NOT THE ONES THAT HAD US , POLLSTERS, NOT THE ONES THAT HAD US DOWN 17 POINT OR THE ONES THAT HAD US DOWN FOUR OR FIVE POINTS IN FLORIDA AND WE WON BY MANY POINTS OR HAD US DOWN IN TEXAS AND WE WON BY A LOT, NOT THOSE POLLSTERS, BUT REAL POLLSTERS. POLLSTERS THAT ARE FAIR AND HONEST SAID WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND A THING LIKE THIS. YOU LED THE COUNTRY TO VICTORY AND YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT LOST. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF A CERTAIN STATE SAID SIR, I EXPECTED TO LOSE MY SEAT AND INSTEAD BECAUSE OF YOU AND BECAUSE OF THAT INCREDIBLE CHARGE AND ALL OF THOSE RALLIES, WE HAD A TREMENDOUS VICTORY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. YOU WERE MUCH MORE POPULAR THAN ME, SIR EXCEPT I GOT MANY MORE VOTES VENUE DID AND IT IS , VOTES THAN YOU DID. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS WRONG. VOTER FRAUD. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE. AS 6:31 IN THE MORNING, A VOTE DUMP OF ONE HUNDRED 49,772 VOTES CAME IN UNEXPECTEDLY. WE WERE WINNING BY A LOT. THAT BADGE IS RECEIVED IN HORROR. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE IS YOUR LINE. THIS IS ONE OF MANY. HERE IS WHAT IS NORMAL. ALL OF A SUDDEN, LOOK AT THAT. LOOK, EVEN HERE. THEY ARE WRONG. I GO FROM WINNING BY A LOT TO LOSING A TIGHT RACE. IT IS CORRUPT. DETROIT IS CORRUPT. I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN DETROIT. THEY KNOW IT. BUT DETROIT IS TOTALLY CORRUPT. LOOK AT THIS. THAT IS A 6:31 IN THE MORNING. UNEXPECTEDLY CAME IN. IN THE RECENT RECOUNT IN GEORGIA, WHICH MEANS NOTHING BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO CHECK SIGNATURES, AND IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHECK SIGNATURES IN GEORGIA, IT DOES NOT WORK BUT WE HAVE A SECRETARY OF STATE AND A GOVERNOR WHO MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CHECK SIGNATURES. WHY? YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM. WITHOUT A SIGNATURE MATCH OR CHECK, IT DOES NOT MATTER. THEY FOUND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF VOTES THAT WERE OUT OF WHACK. ALL AGAINST ME. THIS WAS DURING A RECOUNT THAT I DID NOT THINK MATTERED. THEY FOUND MANY THOUSANDS OF VOTES. THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT IS SO CLOSE, THEY HAD TO GIVE ANOTHER RECOUNT. THE RECOUNT, HAS TO BE A RECOUNT WHERE THEY CHECK THE SIGNATURES. OTHERWISE, THEY ARE CHECKING THE SAME DISHONEST THING. IT WILL NOT MATTER. IN THIS CASE, THE SIGNATURES ON ENVELOPES ARE THE ONLY THING THAT IS RELEVANT. WE WILL COMPARE THE SIGNATURE ON THE ENVELOPE TO THE SIGNATURES FROM PAST ELECTIONS AND WE WILL FIND THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SIGNED THESE BALLOTS ILLEGALLY. THE DEMOCRATS HAD THIS ELECTION RIGGED FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY USED THE PANDEMIC, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE CHILD A VIRUS, AS AN EXCUSE TO MAIL OUT , THE CHINA VIRUS, WHICH LED TO A BIG PART OF THE FRAUD, A FRAUD THAT THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. THERE IS NO ONE HAPPIER RIGHT NOW THAN CHINA. MANY PEOPLE RECEIVED 2, 3, 4 BALLOTS. THEY WERE SENT TO DEAD PEOPLE BY THE THOUSANDS. ED PEOPLE , AND WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES , FILLED OUT BALLOTS, MADE APPLICATIONS AND THEN VOTED , WHICH IS EVEN WORSE. IN OTHER WORDS, DEAD PEOPLE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS. SOME HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 25 YEARS. MILLIONS OF VOTES WERE CAST ILLEGALLY IN THE SWING STATES ALONE. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THE RESULTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SWING STATES MUST BE OVERTURNED AND , OVERTURNED IMMEDIATELY. WE HAVE JUST ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHERE THE VOTES WERE FRAUDULENT. IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO TURN OVER THE ELECTION. EVERYBODY KNOWS WITHOUT GOING MUCH FURTHER AND THEY HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, WHAT A DISASTER THIS ELECTION WAS. A TOTAL CATASTROPHE. WE ARE GOING TO SHOW IT AND HOPEFULLY THE COURTS IN PARTICULAR, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL SEE IT AND RESPECTFULLY , HOPEFULLY THEY WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY CANNOT LIVE WITH THIS KIND OF AN ELECTION. WE CAN SAY LET'S GO ONTO THE NEXT ONE BUT NO, WE HAVE TO LOOK ALSO TO OUR PAST. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. MAYBE YOU WILL HAVE A REVOTE BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE. WHEN THOSE VOTES ARE CORRUPT, WHEN THEY GET CAUGHT, THEY ARE TERMINATED. I VERY EASILY WIN. IN ALL STATES, I EASILY WIN THE SWING STATES JUST LIKE I WON THEM AT 10:00 IN THE EVENING THE EVENING OF THE ELECTION. WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO SHOW YOU 25 FAULTY OR FRAUDULENT VOTES WHICH DON'T MEAN ANYTHING. OR 50 OR 100. WE ARE SHOWING YOU HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, FAR MORE THAN WE NEED , FAR MORE THAN THE MARGIN, FAR MORE THAN THE LAW REQUIRES. WE CAN SHOW MANY TIMES WHAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN THE STATE. THE MEDIA KNOWS THIS, BUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO REPORT IT. IN FACT, THEY OUTRIGHT REFUSED TO EVEN COVER IT. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE RESULT. EVEN WHAT IMC HEY NOW , WHAT I AM SAYING NOW WILL BE DEMEANED AND DISPARAGED BUT THAT IS OK. I JUST KEEP ON GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I AM REPRESENTING 74 MILLION PEOPLE AND IN FACT, I AM ALSO REPRESENTING ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT DID NOT VOTE FOR ME. THE MAIL-IN VOTING SCAM IS THE LAMEST PART OF THEIR FOUR YEAR EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE 2016 ELECTION AND IT HAS BEEN LIKE LIVING IN HELL. OUR OPPONENTS HAVE PROVEN MANY TIMES THAT THEY WILL SAY AND DO ANYTHING TO GET BACK INTO POWER. THE CORRUPT FORCES WHO ARE REGISTERING DEAD VOTERS AND STUFFING BALLOT BOXES ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE PERPETRATED ONE PHONY AND FRAUDULENT HOAX AFTER ANOTHER. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR FOUR YEARS. THESE ENTRENCHED INTERESTS OPPOSE OUR MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE PUT AMERICA FIRST. THEY DO NOT PUT AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY DID NOT WANT AMERICA FIRST. THEY ONLY WANT POWER FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ONLY WANT TO MAKE MONEY. I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FROM SOON AFTER I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WHEN I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO NUMBER ONE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY POLLS, THE INVESTIGATIONS NEVER STOPPED. THEY WENT ON FOR FOUR YEARS. AND I BEAT THEM ALL. RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX AND SO MUCH MORE. ROBERT MUELLER SPENT $48 MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY INVESTIGATING ME FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS. ISSUED OVER 2800 SUBPOENAS. EXECUTED NEARLY 500 SEARCH WARRANTS. ISSUED 230 ORDERS FOR COMMUNICATIONS RECORDS. AND CONDUCTED 500 WITNESS INTERVIEWS ALL LOOKING TO TAKE ME DOWN. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION IN THE END. NONE WHATSOEVER. CENTER MARCO RUBIO STATED , SENATOR MARCO RUBIO STATED THE COMMITTEE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. I THANK SENATOR RUBIO FOR THAT STATEMENT. NOW I HEAR THAT THESE SAME PEOPLE WHO FAILED TO GET ME IN WASHINGTON HAVE SENT EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION TO NEW YORK SO THEY CAN TRY TO GET ME THERE. IT HAS ALL BEEN GONE OVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FOR $40 MILLION, YOU GO THROUGH TAX RETURNS. YOU GO THROUGH EVERYTHING. THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO RECENTLY RAN FOR OFFICE CAMPAIGNED WITHOUT KNOWING ME STATING, WE WILL JOIN WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACROSS THIS NATION IN REMOVING THIS PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE. I NEVER MET HER. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS, SHE SAID, THAT THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP ARE COMING TO AN END. ALL IT HAS BEEN IS A BIG INVESTIGATION IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK AND ANYPLACE ELSE THAT CAN INVESTIGATE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THEY WANT TO TAKE NOT ME BUT US DOWN. AND WE CAN NEVER LET THEM DO THAT. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LOOKED AT. A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS VERY SMART SAID YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. YOU PROBABLY HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. FOR YOU TO COME OUT WITH A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH MAKES YOU PROBABLY THE CLEANEST PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. SOME PEOPLE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT FORTUNATELY NOT ALL HAVE BEEN BEATEN DOWN AND DISPARAGED. THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. WHY AREN'T THEY ACTIVE? WHY AREN'T THEY INVOLVED? THERE IS SO MUCH TO BE INVOLVED IN. THE CORRUPTION IS SO RAMPANT. THEY COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. THEY WERE THREATENED BY DEMOCRATS WITH IMPEACHMENT AND HORRIBLE THINGS WERE SAID ABOUT THEM AND THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THE HEAD OF THE GSA WAS HOUNDED AND HARASSED AS SHE REPORTED LIKE SHE HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE, WHAT CAN I SAY? WE CAUGHT, HE CALLED. WEEK , WE CAUGHT COMEY COLD. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR A REPORT FOR A MAN NAMED DURHAM WHO HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO AND I HAVE NEVER MET. THEY CAN GO AFTER ME BEFORE THE ELECTION AS LONG AS THEY WANT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, MR. DURHAM DID NOT WANT TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOING AFTER THEM BEFORE THE ELECTION. SO WHO KNOWS IF HE IS EVER GOING TO EVEN DO A REPORT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIES AND THE ILLEGAL ACTS OF BEHAVIOR DONE BY SO MANY PEOPLE AND THEIR DESIRE TO HURT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN. THE HARDEST THING I HAVE TO DO IS EXPLAIN WHY NOTHING IS HAPPENING WITH ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT GOT CAUGHT SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BEFORE , HAPPEN AGAIN TRY PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WATCH THE HEARINGS AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING. THE FRAUD THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED IN RECENT WEEKS IS OVERWHELMING. HAVING TO DO WITH OUR ELECTION. EVERYONE IS SAYING THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING WHEN THEY GET TO SEE IT. BUT REALLY, IT IS TOO LATE TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF AN ELECTION. IT IS TOO LATE TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME. THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF TIME TO CERTIFY THE CORRECT WINNER OF THE ELECTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING TO DO. BUT NO MATTER WHEN IT HAPPENS, WHEN THEY SEE FRAUD, WHEN THEY SEE FOUR VOTES AND WHEN THOSE VOTES NUMBER FAR MORE THAN IS NECESSARY, YOU CANNOT LET ANOTHER PERSON STEAL THAT ELECTION FROM YOU. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE TOGETHER IN HOLDING UP SIGNS, STOP THE STEEL. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE WILL CHALLENGE THIS FRAUD, IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE PROBLEMS WITH MAIL-IN BALLOT INC.. PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, NEVADA, GEORGIA, ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES ALLOWED ANYONE TO GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT AND CAST THEIR BALLOT WITHOUT SHOWING ANY ID. THE VOTING TOOK PLACE ENTIRELY ON THE HONOR SYSTEM. NO IDENTIFICATION WAS REQUIRED. MOST AMERICANS WOULD BE SHOCKED TO LEARN NO STATE IN THE COUNTRY VERIFIES CITIZENSHIP AS A CONDITION FOR VOTING IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS. THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. NO OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRY CONDUCTS ELECTIONS THIS WAY. MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE INSTITUTED MAJOR RESTRICTIONS ON MAIL-IN VOTING SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEARLY UNLIMITED POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD. OUT OF 42 EUROPEAN NATIONS, ALL BUT TWO PROHIBIT ABSENTEE BALLOTS ENTIRELY FOR PEOPLE WHO RESIDE INSIDE THE COUNTRY OR ELSE THEY REQUIRE THOSE WHO NEED ABSENTEE BALLOTS TO SHOW A POWERFUL ID. THROUGHOUT THE DEMOCRATIC EFFORT TO EXPAND MELVIN , EXPAND MELVIN VOTING, THEY WERE WORKING TO BLOCK MEASURES DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD. SUCH AS SIGNATURE VERIFICATION, RESIDENCY VERIFICATION OR VOTER ID. AND CITIZENSHIP CONFIRMATION WAS ALMOST UNTHOUGHT OF THAT WE SHOULD ASK FOR IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THESE ARE NOT THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT FAIR ELECTIONS. THESE ARE THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STEAL ELECTIONS, WHO ARE WILLING TO CREATE FRAUD. THE ONLY CONCEIVABLE REASON WHY YOU WOULD BLOCK COMMON SENSE MEASURES TO VERIFY LEGAL ELIGIBILITY FOR VOTING IS YOU ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE, ENABLE, SOLICIT OR CARRY OUT FRAUD. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND THESE DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES TO OUR ELECTION LAWS WERE NOT AND IT IS HARRY RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. THE PANDEMIC , THE PANDEMIC SIMPLY GAVE DEMOCRATS AN EXCUSE TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR MANY YEARS. THE FIRST BILL THAT HOUSE DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED WHEN NANCY PELOSI BECAME SPEAKER WAS AN ATTEMPT TO MANDATE UNIVERSAL MAIL-IN VOTING AND ELIMINATE MEASURES SUCH AS VOTER ID, WHICH IS SO NECESSARY. DRAMATICALLY E-VOTING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS WAS THE DEMOCRATS' NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR A SIMPLE REASON. THEY WANT TO DISTILL THE , THEY WANTED TO STEAL THE 2020 NOVEMBER ELECTION. IN PENNSYLVANIA, LARGE AMOUNTS OF MELON AND ABSENTEE BALLOTS WERE PROCESSED ILLEGALLY AND IN SECRET. IN PHILADELPHIA AND ALLEGHENY COUNTY'S WITHOUT OUR OBSERVERS PRESENT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT. THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED IN THE SAME ROOM. THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE BUILDING. THEY HAD NO WAY OF SEEING BECAUSE THERE WERE NO WINDOWS AND THE WINDOWS WERE BOARDED UP. DEMOCRATS WENT TO THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT'S A BLOCK OBSERVERS FROM RECEIVING ACCESS. WHAT OPPOSED TRANSPARENCY DURING THE VOTE COUNTY. , THE VOTE COUNTING. IT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY ARE HIDING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS IS AN EGREGIOUS AND IRREVERENT A HARM THAT STAINS THE ENTIRE US , THE ENTIRE ELECTION. YET THIS UNPRECEDENTED PRACTICE OF EXCLUDING OUR OBSERVERS, OUR VOTE WATCHERS AS SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM, OCCURRED IN DEMOCRAT RUN CITIES ACROSS THE NATION. HERE ARE SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL FACTS WE HAVE UNCOVERED. MANY VOTERS ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA RECEIVED TWO BALLOTS IN THE MAIL AND MANY OTHERS RECEIVED MAIL-IN BALLOTS FOR WHICH THEY NEVER REPLIED. SO MANY GOT BALLOTS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE FOR. SO MANY RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE BALLOT. IN SOME CASES, MORE THAN TWO BALLOTS. THEY HAPPENED TO BE FOR THE MOST PART DEMOCRATS. IN FAYETTE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, MULTIPLE VOTERS RECEIVED ISLETS THAT WERE ALREADY FILLED OUT. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, A POLL WATCHERS OVERHEARD UNREGISTERED VOTERS BEING TOLD TO RETURN LATER TO VOTE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTERS ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA WERE TREATED DIFFERENTLY BASED ON WHETHER THEY WERE REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. VOTERS IN SOME PRECINCTS WERE ASKED TO FIX THEIR ALLY 12 REPUBLICAN PRECINCTS AND IN PARTICULAR, REPUBLICAN VOTERS WERE NOT SO NOTIFIED, WHICH PLAINLY VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, WE ARE GOING TO FIX UP YOUR BALLOT AND MAKE SURE IT IS PERFECT. IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN, DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. IN MICHIGAN, A CITY EMPLOYEE WITNESSED WORKERS COACHING VOTERS TO VOTE STRAIGHT DEMOCRAT. VIOLATING THE LAW AND THE SANCTITY OF THE SECRET BALLOT. YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THE SAME WORKER SAYS SHE WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO ASK FOR ANY ID AND NOT TO ATTEMPT TO VALIDATE ANY SIGNATURES. SHE WAS ALSO TOLD TO EAT ILLEGALLY BACKDATE MANY BALLOTS RECEIVED AFTER THE DEADLINE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND SHE ESTIMATES THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS WERE IMPROPERLY BACKDATED BY HER AND MANY OTHERS. OTHER WITNESSES IN DETROIT ALSO SAW ELECTION OFFICIALS COUNTING BATCHES OF BALLOTS MANY TIMES AS WELL AS ILLEGALLY DUPLICATING BALLOTS. ONE OBSERVER TESTIFIED TO SEEING OX IS IN BOXES OF BALLOTS ALL BEARING THE SAME SIGNATURE. ANOTHER OBSERVER GAVE SWORN TESTIMONY THAT HE SAW COUNTLESS INVALID BALLOTS THAT DID NOT BELONG TO PROPERLY REGISTERED VOTERS AND THEN WITNESSED ELECTION WORKERS IN WAYNE COUNTY ENTERING FAKE BIRTHDATES INTO THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ILLEGALLY COUNT THEM. WITNESSES HAVE SWORN , HAVE SIGNED SWORN AFFIDAVITS , IN OTHER WORDS YOU GO TO JAIL IF YOU LIKE, TESTIFYING AFTER ELECTION OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE LAST ABSENTEE VOTES HAD BEEN RECEIVED, A BATCH OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS HAD ARRIVED, MANY WITHOUT ENVELOPES AND ALL VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS. IN WISCONSIN, A RECORD NUMBER OF VOTERS WERE CATEGORIZED AS INDEFINITELY CONFINED. ALSO FOR THE ELDERLY THAT ALLOW THEM TO VOTE WITHOUT SHOWING ID. LAST YEAR, APPROXIMATELY 70,000 PEOPLE CLAIMED THE STATUS STATEWIDE. THIS YEAR, THE NUMBER MIRACULOUSLY WAS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED 50,000 VOTERS. AFTER ELECTION OFFICIALS IN MILWAUKEE AND DANE COUNTIES URGED CITIZENS TO REGISTER UNDER THE STATUS. AND REGISTER THEY DID IN LEVELS THAT DON'T EXIST. IN WISCONSIN, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 70,000 ABSENTEE BALLOTS THAT DO NOT HAVE MATCHING APPLICATIONS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN GEORGIA, OBSERVERS HAVE TESTIFIED TO SEEING A REGULAR BALLOTS WITHOUT THE CREASES OR TYPICAL MARKINGS INDICATING THE BALLOTS DID NOT RESIST , DID NOT ARRIVE IN ENVELOPES. A POLL WORKER TESTIFIED 98% OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF USUALLY PRISTINE BALLOTS SHE WITNESSED WERE FOR BIDEN. HIGHLY UNUSUAL NUMBER. IN ADDITION, THOUSANDS OF UNCOUNTED BALLOTS WERE DISCOVERED IN FLOYD, FAYETTE AND WALTON COUNTIES WEEKS AFTER THE ELECTION AS THESE BALLOTS WERE MOSTLY FROM TRUMP VOTERS. THEY WERE NOT COUNTED. THEY WERE FROM TRUMP VOTERS. IN DETROIT, EVERYBODY SAW THE TREMENDOUS CONFLICT AND THE HORRIBLE WAY THE TWO REPUBLICAN CANVASSERS WERE TREATED SO HORRIBLY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT VOTE WHEN THEY SAW THAT 71% OF THE PRECINCTS DID NOT BALANCE. AND ALSO, THERE WERE MORE VOTES THEN THERE WERE VOTERS. THINK OF THAT. YOU HAD MORE VOTERS THAN YOU HAD VOTES. BALLOTS PRODUCED ERROR MESSAGES FROM TABULATING MACHINES. THEY WERE TOLD TO PRESS A BUTTON THAT RESULTED IN THEIR VOTES NOT BEING COUNTED. ALSO IN ARIZONA, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED MAIL-IN BALLOTS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MAILBOXES AND HIDDEN UNDER A ROCK. IN CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA, WHERE MOST , WERE INTENTIONALLY LOWERED TO ALLOW LARGE NUMBERS OF BALLOTS TO BE COUNTED THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PASSED MUSTER. THIS MACHINE WAS SET AT THE LOWEST LEVEL. ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, IN ORDER TO TEST THE PROCESS. NINE VOTERS IN CLARK COUNTY CAST BALLOTS WITH INTENTIONALLY INCORRECT SIGNATURES AND EIGHT OF THE NINE BALLOTS WERE EXCEPTED AND COUNTED. THEY SAID YOU COULD SIGN YOUR NAME AS SANTA CLAUS AND IT WOULD BE ACCEPTED. LAST WEEK, THE CLARK COUNTY COMMISSION THROUGHOUT THE RESULTS OF A LOCAL ELECTION AFTER THE REGISTRAR REPORTED FINDING QUOTE, DISCREPANCIES WE CANNOT EXPLAIN. ALSO IN NEVADA, SOME VOTERS WERE ENTERED INTO A RAFFLE FOR MORE THAN A DOZEN GIFT CARDS WORTH AS MUCH AS $250 IF THEY COULD VOTE , IF THEY COULD PROVE THEY HAD VOTED. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INDICATIONS OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD IS THE STORE NEARLY LOW REJECTION RATES FOR MAIL-IN BALLOTS IN MANY KEY STATES. THESE ARE THE STATES I HAD TO WIN. IN SWING STATE AFTER SWING STATE, A NUMBER OF BALLOTS REJECTED HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BASED ON PRIOR EXPERIENCE. IN GEORGIA, JUST .2%, THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN 1% OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS HAVE BEEN REJECTED. ALMOST NONE HAVE BEEN REJECTED. THEY TOOK EVERYTHING. NOTHING WAS REJECTED PRACTICALLY COMPARED TO 6.4% IN 2016 AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT 6.4 WAS A LOW NUMBER. ALMOST NONE WERE REJECTED AND THE PREVIOUS ELECTION, 6.4 PERCENT WERE REJECTED. WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR DECLINES IN PENNSYLVANIA, NEVADA AND MICHIGAN. BALLOTS WERE NOT REJECTED, ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAPPENED TO BE IN DEMOCRAT AREAS. THESE IRREGULARITIES ARE INEXPLICABLE UNLESS THERE IS A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO ACCEPT AN ELIGIBLE OR FRAUDULENT BALLOTS. IN PENNSYLVANIA, THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE STATE SUPREME COURT IN ESSENCE ABOLISHED SIGNATURE REVOCATION REQUIREMENTS WEEKS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. IT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. A JUDGE CANNOT DO IT. A STATE CANNOT DO IT, AN OFFICIAL CANNOT DO IT. THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO IT IS THE LEGISLATURE. THEY WERE NOT VERIFYING SIGNATURES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE BALLOTS HAVE NOT BEEN FILLED UP BY THE VOTERS IN WHOSE NAMES THEY WERE CAST. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE FILLED THEM OUT THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NAMES ON THE BALLOT. A SIMPLE RECOUNT OF THE BALLOTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE , CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY COMPOUNDS THE FRAUD. THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS AN HONEST VOTE IS TO CONDUCT A FULL REVIEW OF THE ENVELOPES IN THE RELEVANT STATES. FIND MANY , YOU WILL FIND MANY OF THEM HAVE FRAUDULENT SIGNATURES. A FULL FORENSIC AUDIT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE ONLY LEGAL BALLOTS FROM LAWFULLY REGISTERED VOTERS THAT WERE PROPERLY CAST ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL COUNT. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT GREAT VOTER FRAUD. FRAUD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN LIKE THIS BEFORE. IT IS ABOUT POLL WATCHERS WHO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH, SO ILLEGAL. IT WAS ABOUT BALLOTS THAT POURED IN AND NOBODY BUT A FEW KNEW WHERE THEY CAME FROM BUT THEY WERE COUNTED AND THEY WERE NOT FROM A. IT IS ABOUT BIG LEADS ON ELECTION NIGHT. TREMENDOUS LEADS. LEADS WHERE I WAS BEING CONGRATULATED FOR A DECISIVE, EASY VICTORY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BY MORNING OR A COUPLE DAYS LATER, THOSE LEADS RAPIDLY EVAPORATED. IT IS ABOUT NUMBERS OF BALLOTS THAT WERE SENT AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE THEY CAME FROM. IT WAS ABOUT MACHINERY THAT WAS DEFECTIVE. MACHINERY THAT WAS STOPPED DURING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE EVENING. MIRACULOUSLY TO OPEN WITH MORE VOTES. IT WAS ABOUT MANY OTHER THINGS. BUT ABOVE ALL, IT WAS ABOUT FRAUD. THIS ELECTION WAS RIGGED, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. I DO NOT MIND IF I LOSE AN ELECTION, BUT I WANT TO LOSE AN ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. WHAT I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A DEAL IS , BUT I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DO IS HAVE IT STOLEN FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE ALREADY HAVE THE PROOF. WE ALREADY HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND IT IS VERY CLEAR. MANY PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA AND EVEN JUDGES SO FAR HAVE REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT. THEY KNOW IT IS TRUE. HTHEY REFUSED TO SAY YOU'RE RIGHT. OUR COUNTRIEY NEED SOMEBODY TO SAY YOU ARE RIGHT. I AM PREPARED TO ACCEPT ANY ACCURATE ELECTION RESULT. WE ALREADY HAVE THE PROOF. WE ALREADY HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS MORE THAN WE NEED TO OVERTURN ALL OF THESE STATES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS AN ELECTION FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. EVERY REASONABLE AMERICAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY DOCUMENTED THAT WE NEED A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO REVIEW THE ENVELOPES. IT IS ABOUT THE SIGNATURE AND IF THEY ARE ON THE ENVELOPES, WE CAN ONLY REVIEW THE ENVELOPES AND THAT WILL TELLS EVERYTHING. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM WE SHOULD EXPECT. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHO IS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN AMERICAN ELECTIONS. THAT IS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE SACRED RIGHTS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE DIED TO SECURE. NOTHING IS MORE URGENT OR MORE IMPORTANT. THE ONLY BALLOTS THAT SHOULD ACCOUNT , THAT SHOULD COUNT IN THE SELECTION ARE THOSE CAST BY ELIGIBLE VOTERS WHO ARE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY AND WHO CAST THEIR BALLOTS IN A LAWFUL MANNER BEFORE THE LEGAL DEADLINE. WE MUST NEVER AGAIN HAVE AN ELECTION IN WHICH THERE IS NOT A RELIABLE AND TRANSPARENT SYSTEM TO VERIFY THE ELIGIBILITY, IDENTITY AND RESIDENCY OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO CASTS A BALLOT. A VERY, VERY CHERISHED BALLOT. MANY SMART PEOPLE HAVE CONGRATULATED ME ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY. WE TOOK CARE OF OUR VETS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. SPACE FORCE AND SO MUCH MORE. THEY WENT ON TO SAY, AS BIG AND IMPORTANT AS THESE EVENTS WERE, THE SINGLE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN YOUR PRESIDENCY WILL BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. VOTER INTEGRITY FOR OUR NATION. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED. IF WE DO NOT ROOT OUT THE FRAUD THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN OUR 2020 ELECTION, WE DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE. SO WITH THE RESOLVE AND SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE WILL RESTORE HONESTY AND INTEGRITY TO OUR ELECTIONS. WE WILL RESTORE TRUST IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?506975-1/president-trump-statement-2020-election-results	The White House posted remarks on Facebook from President Trump about his view of voting and election security in the 2020 election.

The president asserted his claims that he was the winner of the presidential election. &ldquo;If I lost, I&rsquo;d be a very gracious loser,&rdquo; said the president, later saying he would go to Florida &ldquo;and take it easy.&rdquo; Proclaiming they will win this election, President Trump - without making a commitment - said in &ldquo;2024, and hopefully I won&rsquo;t have to be a candidate, we&rsquo;re going to win back the White House again.&rdquo;	506972-1	Speech

Mr. Perdue did not attend the rally because he was quarantined after coming into contact with someone who tested for COVID-19 within the previous week. President Trump encouraged voters to vote for the two Republican candidates, noting that a win for their Democratic challengers would hand control of the Senate to Democrats. Most of the president&rsquo;s remarks concerned his displeasure with the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. He said his supporters in Congress would continue to support him as both legislative chambers were set to accept the Electoral College results in just two days. Senator Loeffler, Representative Majrorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and Ivanka Trump, the president&rsquo;s daughter, also spoke during the rally.	507634-1	Speech

We will never concede,&rdquo; he declared. President Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claims of fraud in both the November election and the Georgia U.S. Senate runoff election held the previous night. He railed against Republicans he deemed insufficiently supportive of his efforts to overturn the results and promised to &ldquo;primary the hell out of the ones that don&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo; The president also continued to publicly pressure his vice president, Mike Pence, to reject electoral votes in states that he lost. As the speech was concluding, Vice President Pence issued a statement saying he lacked the constitutional authority to dismiss the votes when Congress met later that day.  Note: Because of audio difficulties with the president&rsquo;s microphone, there was no audio during the first 38 seconds of his remarks.	507744-1	Speech
