CSPANJB18420190	Joe Biden	2019-04-18	Joe Biden with Stop and Shop Strikers in Massachusetts	FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SPOKE AT A WORKERS RALLY HELD IN SUPPORT OF STRIKING STOP AND SHOP WORKERS IN MASSACHUSETTS. HIS REMARKS ARE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. (music) HEY, FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU? GOD, I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING MARK. HE CALLED AND ASKED IF I WOULD SPEAK. I AM GETTING SO SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY EVERYBODY IS BEING TREATED, AMERICAN WORKERS, THAT I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE, LIKE A LOT OF YOU HADVE. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SHORT. THIS CROWD LOOKS LIKE MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD IN SCRANTON IN KLIMA. I REALLY MEAN , CLAYMONT. I REALLY MEAN IT. PEOPLE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, DECENCY, FAIRNESS. MY DAD USED TO SAY A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU ARE TREATED, DECENCY, HONOR. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL, THIS IS GOD'S TRUTH. MY DAD LEFT SCRANTON BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE WORK. EVERYBODY , EVERY TIME SOMEBODY LOST A JOB FROM WHERE WE LIVED, HE WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. WORKERS ARE NOT BEING TREATED ACROSS THE BOARD WITH DIGNITY. THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED LIKE A MATTER. WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOS DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BOTH AMERICA , BUILT AMERICA. ORDINARY, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE BUILT AMERICA. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S A FACT. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS PLACE. YOU KNOW WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNION'S. NOT A JOKE. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING HERE, GUYS. THE REASON NOT ONLY WHY YOU BUSTING YOUR NECK AND WENT ON PICKET LINES AND STRIKES OVER THE YEARS TO GET BETTER RESULTS FOR YOU, YOU GOT BETTER RESULTS FOR EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA. THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THERE'S A 40 HOUR WEEK, OVERTIME PAY, THAT THESE PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR ALL WORKERS AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU. FOR A WHILE, 11 OF , A LOT OF OTHER LABORERS NOT UNION FORGOTTEN. NOW THE WAY THEY ARE BEING TREATED BY CORPORATE AMERICA, THEY ARE GOING TO REMEMBER IT AGAIN. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU AND BOYCOTT THIS PLACE. THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY CHANGE. EVERYBODY WHO WORKS LIKE HELL IN THIS COUNTRY, THE WAY WE WERE ALL RAISED, YOU WORK, PLAY BY THE RULES, AND YOU GET A SHOT, AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT A NUMBER, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A VALUE SET. ITS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME AND NOT RUN IT, ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A DECENT PARK WHERE YOU KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME SAFELY. SENDING THEM TO A SCHOOL BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S BEING ABLE TO TAKE HOME YOUR GERIATRIC MOM WHEN YOUR DAD PASSES AWAY AND HOPE YOUR KIDS NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. THAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE DECENT HEALTH CARE, A FAIR WAGE, A RETIREMENT. WITHOUT THOSE THINGS, YOU CANNOT LIVE A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS OUTFIT, AND THEY ARE NOT UNIQUE HERE. IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER CORPORATE AMERICA. THESE GUYS MAKE $4 BILLION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THEY GET ALMOST $250 MILLION IN A TAX CUT WITH THAT SCAM THE PRESIDENT PUT THROUGH. WHAT DO THEY DO? THINK ABOUT THIS. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY BOUGHT BACK $3 BILLION OF THEIR OWN STOCK. YOU KNOW WHY? THAT INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE STOCK THEY HAVE LEFT. THAT MEANS THE CEO GETS PAID A LOT MORE, THE WEALTHY GET PAID A LOT MORE, AND THE STOCK CARRIERS GET PAID A LOT MORE. IT USED TO BE THAT THE ONLY STAKEHOLDER IN CORPORATIONS WERE NOT JUST SHAREHOLDERS. I GOT A CARTOON IN MY OFFICE THAT I THINK YOU SAW IT, MARTY. EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT CAME IN HE WOULD TURN IT AROUND. IT SAYS, THERE'S A PICTURE OF A NEW YORKER. IT'S A PICTURE OF A ROTUND GUY WITH A BLACK TURTLENECK, MASK, AND BERET. HE SITTING AT A TABLE BEING INTERROGATED. THERE IS A BIG BURLAP BACK ON THE TABLE WITH A MONEY SIGN ON IT. HE SAYS HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WAS A JOB CREATOR? THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE JOB CREATORS STOCKHOLDERS. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MY DAD DID NOT CREATE JOBS UP AND DOWN THE LINE? WE USED TO HAVE EVERYBODY WHO WAS IN ON THE DEAL. IT USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN THAT IF YOU CONTRIBUTED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE OUTFIT YOU WORK WITH, YOU GET TO SHARE IN THE BENEFITS. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WAGES HAVE GONE UP VERY LITTLE, PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY. WHERE ARE YOU SITTING? THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. I REALLY MEAN IT. WOULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS , WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. THIS BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WHAT THEY DO WITH THIS IS THEY GO BACK AND , HOW CAN THEY MAKE THAT MONEY, BUY BACK ALL THAT STOCK, AND TELL YOU THEY ARE GOING TO CUT YOUR WAGES? THEY ARE GOING TO CUT OVERTIME, YOUR MEDICAL CARE BENEFITS? I MEAN, HOW IN GOD'S NAME DOES THAT MUCH ANYTHING , MATCH ANYTHING? I'M A POLITICIAN, I GET IT. IT'S WAY BEYOND THAT, GUYS. THIS IS WAY BEYOND THAT. THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS MORE EARLY , MORALLY WRONG WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M SICK OF IT AND SO ARE YOU! [APPLAUSE] GUYS, LOOK, LOOK , [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE ARE IN A PLACE [AUDIO DROP] , WE GOT SOME PEOPLE WERE GOING TO PLAY JUST FAIR. THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO NOT TREAT HARD-WORKING AMERICAN, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE WITH ANY DIGNITY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. EVERY SINGLE PERSON DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. THINK OF WHAT WE DO. WHEN THE GUY, AND I WAS JUST WITH THE ELECTORAL WORKERS. YOU KNOW, IF IN FACT THEY ARE CLIMBING UP PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, , UP A PO LE IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, WHO SAYS THANK YOU TO THEM? IT'S ALL OF US, GUYS, TOO. WE HAVE TO START RECOGNIZING WHAT PEOPLE DO, BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO EVERYBODY. IN MATTERS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEEL RESPECTED. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY WE ARE NOT BEING TREATED. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU, A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY SUPPORTED YOU, BUT YOU HAVE TO ALSO SUPPORT THE REST OF THESE FOLKS DOING THE SAME THING. IF WE DO, WE WILL TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN IT. DON'T GIVE UP! KEEP IT GOING! WHEN JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH. THANK YOU.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?459920-1/joe-biden-stop-shop-strikers-massachusetts	Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a rally in support of striking Stop and Shop workers.	459920-1	Speech		
CSPANJB29420191	Joe Biden	2019-04-29	Joe Biden Campaign Rally in Pittsburgh	"FOLLOWING HIS ONLINE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK ENTERING THE 2020 RACE, OR VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HELD HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN EVENT AT A UNION HALL IN PITTSBURGH. HE RAISED $6.3 MILLION THE DAY AFTER HIS ANNOUNCED, AND HIS FIRST WEEK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WILL INCLUDE A TWO-DAY SWING THROUGH IOWA. GREAT TO SEE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN THE GREAT LABOR MOVEMENT AND , MOVEMENT IN PITTSBURGH AND BEYOND. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE IFF, THE PROUD GOLD AND BLACK. IT'S SO GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. AND IT'S ALSO SO MUCH OF A THRILL TO BE WITH THE HUNDREDS OF YOU IN THIS HALL. BUT THE OVERWHELMING CROWD THAT'S STILL OUTSIDE UNABLE TO GET IN, GOOD AFTERNOON TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW LET'S BE CLEAR WHY WE ARE HERE. AND IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. AND THAT'S TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THERE IS NO QUESTION, JOE IS THE ONE CANDIDATE IN 2020 WHO STANDS ABOVE THE REST WHEN IT COMES TO A CAREER STANDING UP TO PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR A LIVING AND HOLD A UNION CARD. HE UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF A HARD DAYS WORK AND THE DIGNITY OF GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY AND DOING A JOB YOU'RE PROUD OF. HE KNOWS LABOR AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEY BUILT THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [WHISTLING] AND ALL OF YOU ARE PART OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THIS GREAT COUNTRY. HE SPEAKS TO AND CONNECTS WITH THOSE WORKERS WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE THE LAST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HEARD THEM, CARED ABOUT THEM AND FELT THAT THEIR HISTORIC VOTES FOR A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WERE MAYBE JUST BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'M PRETTY STRAIGHT WHEN I SAY WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU, AND THAT IS THAT I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL STAND UP FOR ALL OF THE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WHO WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO EARN A DECENT WAGE, SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE, HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND ENJOY A DECENT AND SECURE RETIREMENT. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE IS A LOT LIKE OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND A LOT LIKE SO MANY OF YOU. HE'S A PROBLEM SOLVER. HE'S ONE WHO'S DEDICATED TO MAKING THIS COUNTRY BETTER. THIS MORNING I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF ANNOUNCING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS, THE IAFF, HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND LET ME TELL YOU, WE ENDORSED HIM BECAUSE WE KNOW HE'LL BE A CHAMPION FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN AMERICA, FIGHTING FOR POLICIES AND LEGISLATION THAT IMPROVES THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF NOT JUST FIREFIGHTERS, BUT ALL OF YOU WHO WORK HARD FOR A LIVING. AND AT NOON TODAY, WE CELEBRATED AND HONORED WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE DOING THEIR JOBS, AND OUR MEMBERS WHO LOSE THEIR LIFE SACRIFICING IN THE LINE OF DUTY TO SERVE OTHERS. JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THAT SACRIFICE. JOE BIDEN IS A COMPASSIONATE, PERSONAL, AND DECENT LEADER WHO WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH IS ALWAYS THERE WITH THOSE IN TIMES OF NEED. HE'S A GOOD MAN, CARES DEEPLY ABOUT HIS FELLOW AMERICANS AND OUR GREAT NATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND HE IS NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON MAKING A BETTER AMERICA FOR WORKING FAMILIES HIS , EXPERIENCE ON THE NATIONAL STAGE THROUGHOUT HIS PUBLIC CAREER, ESTABLISHING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE WILL RESTORE AMERICA AS THE BEACON OF HOPE AND DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD, WHERE WE ONCE WERE AND WHERE WE WILL BE AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND AT A TIME WHEN THE POLITICAL ARENA HAS BECOME SO DAMN NASTY, SO MUCH RANCOR AND PERSONAL ATTACKS, JOE WILL BRING CIVILITY AND DECENCY AND ENHANCE THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE HE'S JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU HERE, HE TRULY BELIEVES WE MUST BE UNIFIED AND STRAND TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. HIS YEARS IN THE U.S. SENATE AS , SENATE, AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BRINGS THE EXPERIENCE THAT IS NEEDED TO GET THINGS DONE. AND WHILE WE CAN DEBATE AND ARGUE OVER POLICY ISSUES, WE MUST PUT PERSONAL DIFFERENCES ASIDE TO SOLVE THE BIG PROBLEMS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND JOE BIDEN WILL HELP US DO JUST THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OK, AND DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RECOGNIZES A STRONG ECONOMY ISN'T JUST GDP, NOT JUST STOCK MARKET INDEX INCREASES, NOT JUST LINES ON A GRAPH, BUT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES A STRONG ECONOMY HAS TO WORK FOR A WORKING PEOPLE. IS THAT A PRESIDENT WE WANT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LISTEN, THOSE GREAT JOBLESS NUMBERS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT, TO MY BELIEF, IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING, PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE MADE UP BY HOW MANY OF YOU WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE BOTH PEOPLE AND THAT FAMILY WORKING. HOW MANY ARE WORKING PART TIME? HOW MANY ARE NOT GETTING PAID A DECENT, FAIR LIVING WAGE? HOW MANY ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET? WE NEED TO FIX THAT. SO DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIX THAT? THAT WAS A YES. DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET PAID A FAIR DAY'S WAGE FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK, TO HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO SAVE AFTER YOU PAY YOUR BILLS TO HELP ENSURE YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN YOU DID, MAN WE DID? LET ME HEAR YOU. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. LET THEM HEAR YOU OUTSIDE. FAR TOO MANY , LISTEN, THIS IS UNION TOWN. THIS IS UNION STATE. THIS IS UNION COUNTY. AND FAR TOO MANY POLITICIANS TODAY TREAT THE WORD UNION LIKE IT'S A DIRTY WORD. BUT I TRULY BELIEVE OUR NATION IS SEEING ONCE AGAIN THE REAL VALUE OF OUR UNIONS, THE REAL VALUE OF YOUR WORK, THE HISTORY OF HOW UNIONS BUILT AMERICA, THAT UNIONS DID BUILD A MIDDLE CLASS, THAT UNIONS ARE FIGHTING FOR A FAIR WORK FORCE, THAT UNIONS CAN PROVIDE A VOICE OF PROTECTION FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO BUSTS THEIR ASS EVERY DAY TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY STRONGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND JOE BIDEN ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY UNION. JOE BIDEN HAS STOOD WITH UNIONS , AND JOE BIDEN WILL SUPPORT OUR UNIONS BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE FOUNDATION OF OUR STRONG NATION. ARE YOU READY TO STAND WITH HIM? AND FINALLY, WITH A FIELD OF GOOD PEOPLE PUTTING THEMSELVES FORWARD IN THIS PRIMARY SEASON, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WE MUST DETERMINE IN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION PROCESS IS WHO CAN WIN. WHO HAS THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE TO WIN? WHO'S GOT THE METTLE TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION? AND LET ME SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU, AND THIS MAY NOT BE POPULAR IN PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A NOMINEE AND CAN'T HAVE A NOMINEE THAT IS TOO FAR LEFT. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. A CANDIDATE THAT HAS HIGH-MINDED IDEALS, MAYBE HONORABLE IDEALS , BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF WINNING. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN WIN, THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN AND WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED JOE. WE NEED JOE. SO THAT'S WHY THIS IAFF, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO COUNT ON EVERY ONE OF YOU TO WORK YOUR ASSES OFF TO ELECT OUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS ALL HARDWORKING UNION MEMBERS ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE TODAY IN PITTSBURGH! YOU KNOW, SOME WEEKS ARE JUST A BIT MORE EXCITING THAN OTHERS, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE WEEK FOR JOE AND ME. DR. BARTON:IDEN: AS YOU KNOW, LAST THURSDAY MY HUSBAND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WHAT DID I DO TO CELEBRATE? THE SAME THING THAT ALL OF YOU PROBABLY DID, I WENT TO WORK. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE, HEY, THOSE RESEARCH PAPERS , WEREN'T GOING TO GET COLLECTED BY THEMSELVES. SO TEACHING , THANK YOU. TEACHING IS MORE THAN JUST A JOB FOR ME. IT'S A CALLING. AND CAN I ASK HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY? [CHEERING] THANK YOU. I CAN SEE BY YOUR SHIRTS. NOW THAT I SEE YOU. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU TEACHERS FEEL THE SAME WAY. OUR STUDENTS GIVE US SO MUCH. THEY KEEP US GROUNDED AND INSPIRE US. MOST OF MY STUDENTS AT NORTHERN VIRGINIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE THE FIRST ONES IN THEIR FAMILY TO PURSUE AN EDUCATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY WORK FULL-TIME JOBS AND HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COUNTING ON THEM. THEY COME TO MY CLASS AFTER THEIR MILITARY SERVICE IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. THEY COME AS SINGLE PARENTS OR SOME ARE WOMEN RETURNING TO SCHOOL TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, THEY COME LOOKING FOR THE SAME SIMPLE THING, THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HARD AND BUILD A FUTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT, ISN'T IT? WHEN WE TURN ON THE NEWS TODAY, WE ARE TOLD THAT WE ARE A NATION THAT IS MORE DIVIDED THAN EVER. WE'RE TOLD THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE IRRECONCILABLE. THAT WE MUST CLOSE THE DOOR ON PEOPLE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN THEM AND US. BUT WHEN I TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY AND I MEET PEOPLE LIKE ALL OF YOU, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SEE. I SEE NEIGHBORS WHO PICK UP GROCERIES FOR THE MOM WHOSE HUSBAND IS DEPLOYED. I SEE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE GIVING RECORD-BREAKING AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS TO CAUSES THAT THEY CARE ABOUT. I SEE AMERICANS WHO DRIVE THEIR PICKUP TRUCKS INTO THE FLOODS OF A HURRICANE AND RUN TOWARDS FIRES TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHO WE ARE. THAT'S THE AMERICA I KNOW AND LOVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS NATION IS ABOUT. WORKING HARD AND BUILDING A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR KIDS. COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING WE COULD ACHIEVE ALONE. WE ARE A NATION OF FAITH. THE BELIEF THAT TOGETHER WE CAN RISE TO OUR GREATEST ASPIRATIONS AND THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE YET TO COME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT FAITH HAS SHAPED MY HUSBAND'S LIFE. IT HAS LED HIM THROUGH TRAGEDY AND TRIUMPH, THROUGH HIS TIME IN THE SENATE AND THROUGH EIGHT INCREDIBLE HOPEFUL YEARS AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S WHY I KNOW THAT WITH YOUR HELP, HE WILL BRING THAT HOPE, THAT VISION, THAT FAITH IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING AND RONISE SERMONS AND I LOVE TEACHING. SHE IS A MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH TEACHER WHO HAS SERVED IN SOME OF PITTSBURGH'S MOST CHALLENGING SCHOOLS. SHE IS A PROUD MEMBER OF THE PITTSBURGH FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE EXECUTIVE BOARD. SHE'S A MOM OF FIVE CHILDREN AND A SURROGATE MOM TO MANY OF HER STUDENTS AND HER COLLEAGUES ALIKE. SHE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS WELL LOVED AND A FIRECRACKER. SO YOU KNOW SHE AND JOE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. [LAUGHTER] HELLO, EVERYONE! I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR. BIDEN FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION AND FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO INDUCE , INTRODUCE, EXCUSE ME, OUR SPECIAL GUEST. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE OF MYSELF WITH YOU ALL. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN PITTSBURGH TO A YOUNG COUPLE WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM, TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILD THAN THEY HAD. MY MOTHER WAS A NURSE'S ASSISTANT FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND MY FATHER IS A RECENTLY RETIRED UNION PAINTER, OVER 49 YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [RONISE CHUCKLES] THE REASON I SPEAK OF THE WORK THEY DID IS BECAUSE THEY WERE HARD-WORKING, MIDDLE CLASS AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO GREW UP WITH LOW INCOME AND LITTLE MONEY. THEY BOTH SHOWED AND INSTILLED IN ME THAT HARD WORK PAYS OFF AND THAT KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I WAS RAISED ON THAT PROVERB, ""IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD,"" TO RESPECT MY ELDERS, TO BE HONORABLE, WORK HARD AND TAKE PRIDE IN EVERY JOB I HAD, BECOME A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN IN THE WORLD AND TO ALWAYS HONOR GOD. I WENT TO PITTSBURGH PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHERE I NOW TEACH TODAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW THAT MY TASK AS A TEACHER AND A MOTHER IS THAT I AM NOT RAISING CHILDREN BUT FUTURE ADULTS. TODAY I AM HONORED TO STAND BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WAS OFTEN TOLD WHAT I COULDN'T BE, I WAS LOOKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT AND EVEN THROWN AWAY BY MANY, BUT MY FAMILY AND THE TEACHERS WHO PUSHED ME WHEN I WANTED TO QUIT IS WHY I AM STANDING HERE TODAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I ENCOURAGE MY CHILDREN TO BE BETTER THAN ME AND SOAR HIGHER THAN ME. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT IN LIFE , IT'S NOT HOW YOU START BUT HOW YOU FINISH. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BRING BACK THE WORDS OF THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOT , NOT FOR ALL WHO ARE IN A CERTAIN CLASS OR RACE, BUT FOR ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF RACE, CLASS OR GENDER. WE MUST HAVE A LEADER THAT HAS A VISION, EXPERIENCE AND INTEGRITY. WE MUST HAVE A LEADER THAT IS HONORABLE AND WILL SPEAK TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG AND STAND FIRM ON THE TRUTH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LAYING ASIDE PRIDE, LAYING ASIDE PRIDE AND SELF-ELEVATION, BUT SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WILLING TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO REGAIN THE TRUST OF ALL AMERICANS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND BUILD EACH OTHER UP AND NOT TEAR EACH OTHER DOWN. NO LONGER CREATING DIVISION WITH HATRED AND FEAR. I BELIEVE THAT JOE BIDEN IS THAT PERSON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND COMES FROM A WORKING CLASS FAMILY. HE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE IS HISTORY. HE STILL HAS WORK TO DO AND BUILD ON THE WORK THAT HE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA BEGAN. IT IS MY HONOR AND PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S HOW I'M KNOWN BACK HOME. THAT'S HOW I'M KNOWN MOST PLACES. THANK YOU. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT, QUITE FRIENDLY, TO REFLECT ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED HERE IN THE STATE NOT LONG AGO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, VERY RECENTLY. REFLECT ON THE ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE THIS WEEKEND IN POWAY SYNAGOGUE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE DEAD, THREE INJURED. BUT, FOLKS, WE SAW HATE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WE SAW IT AGAIN IN PITTSBURGH AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN THE ATTACK OF THE DEADLIEST IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON A JEWISH COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE REMINDED AGAIN THAT WE ARE IN A BATTLE. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR AMERICA'S SOUL. SO, FOLKS, I WANT TO THANK RICH FITZGERALD, THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE, FOR BEING HERE AND MAYOR NEZBY, CITY OF DUCANE IS HERE AS WELL. YOU ARE HERE SOMEWHERE. [APPLAUSE] INTERNATIONAL FIREFIGHTERS GENERAL PRESIDENT AND MY FRIEND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE UNION, AS THEY SAY ALONG WITH THE TEACHERS, BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE WHEN I STARTED. THANK YOU, HAROLD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT. AND KEVIN SCHMITT, PRESIDENT OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL HERE. THANKS FOR THE USE OF THE HOUSE. I APPRECIATE IT, THE HELP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE FIREFIGHTERS, DAVE WHERE ARE YOU? THE PENNSYLVANIA FIREFIGHTERS. DAVE , THERE YOU ARE. PASSED RIGHT BY YOU. DAVE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ALSO, A REAL , A UNION THAT HELPED ME IN THE VERY, VERY BEGINNING OF MY CAREER AND I'VE HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR, THE UNITED STEEL WORKERS. BOBBY MACK. BOBBY MACK, PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BUILDING TRADES. FRANK. FRANK'S HERE, TOO. SO, LOOK , YOU GOT IT, PAL. LOOK, I , THE PENNSYLVANIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFGE. THE UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF THE CARPENTERS, SERVICE EMPLOYEES UNION, SEIU, UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. BY THE WAY, I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. I AM A UNION MAN. PERIOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHY , THANK YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHY I CHOSE PITTSBURGH TO BEGIN THIS EFFORT. I BELIEVE THAT PITTSBURGH AND MY NATIVE TOWN OF SCRANTON AND MY HOMETOWN OF WILMINGTON AND CLAYMONT REPRESENT THE CITIES AND TOWNS THAT MAKE UP HARDWORKING, MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THE BACKBONE OF THE NATION. I ALSO CAME HERE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, FOLKS, IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020, IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. WITH YOUR HELP, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE TABLE TO DO THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN PENNSYLVANIA. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA. PLACES WHERE A LITTLE LATELY WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, I THINK WE ARE COMING BACK. SO PLEASE, PLEASE GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM AND SIGN UP AND JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED YOUR HELP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE THREE BASIC REASONS I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FIRST IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THE SECOND IS TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. AND THE THIRD SO TO UNIFY THIS NATION. WE ALWAYS DO BETTER WHEN WE ACT AS ONE AMERICA. TODAY I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SECOND OF THESE THREE AND THAT'S REBUILDING THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THAT IS, WE HAVE TIME, ALL MY TIME IN PUBLIC LIFE I'VE GOTTEN INVOLVED, I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO AS MIDDLE CLASS JOE. IT'S NOT ALWAYS MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT'S USUALLY THAT I'M NOT SOPHISTICATED, THAT'S WHY I'M MIDDLE CLASS JOE. THE FACT IS I'M SOPHISTICATED ABOUT WHY, HOW, AND WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. LET ME SAY THIS SIMPLY AND CLEARLY, AND I MEAN THIS, THE COUNTRY WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS, C.E.O.'S AND HEDGE FUND MANAGERS. IT WAS BUILT BY YOU. IT WAS BUILT BY THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS IS BUILT BY UNIONS. BY YOU. LOOK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE STORY OF AMERICA. WHEN ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE YOURS AND MINE, WE GREW UP, GO OUT AND DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS. WHEN I LOOK OUT AT THIS CROWD, I SEE THE FOLKS FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN CLAYMONT AND WILMINGTON AND SCRANTON. AND I AM NOT BEING SOLICITOUS, I MEAN IT. I SEE PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL COURAGE AND BRAINS. I SEE PEOPLE WHO'VE BUSTED THEIR BACKS THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. I SEE PEOPLE LIKE THE MILLIONS ACROSS THIS NATION WHO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK LIKE A DEVIL TO RAISE THEIR FAMILY, PAY THEIR TAXES AND VOLUNTEER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WORK. I SEE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BEING MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT A NUMBER. IT'S A VALUE SET. IT'S BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KIDS TO A PARK WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'RE SAFE. BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME AND NOT JUST HAVE TO RENT IT. IT'S BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A GOOD SCHOOL AND IF THEY DO WELL THEY CAN GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. TO TRADE SCHOOL OR COLLEGE OR BEYOND. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR GERIATRIC MOM WHEN YOU'RE DAD PASSES, AND NOT WORRY THAT YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE FOR OF YOU AND PLAN FOR A SOLID RETIREMENT. THAT'S NOT ASKING A LOT. [CHANTING] EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. THE METACLASSES HURTING. IT'S HURTING NOW. PEOPLE IN AMERICA DON'T THINK THE CHILDREN IN AMERICA WILL HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING AS THEY HAD. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED IN A LONG, LONG, LONG TIME. THE STOCK MARKET IS ROARING. BUT YOU DON'T FEEL IT. THERE'S $2 TRILLION TAX CUT LAST YEAR. DID YOU FEEL IT? DID YOU GET ANYTHING FROM IT? [CROWD GRUMBLES] OF COURSE NOT. OF COURSE NOT. ALL IT WENT TO THE FOLKS AT THE TOP AND CORPORATIONS THAT PAY NO TAXES. THE NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS THAT PAY NO TAXES NOW HAS DOUBLED SINCE THAT. LOOK, GUYS, THIS IS NOT GOOD. WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE HAS HAPPENED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT FOR ME, ONE OF THEM STANDS OUT. THE BASIC BARGAIN USED TO EXIST. THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS USED TO AGREE TO HAS BEEN BROKEN. AND THAT IS YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF THE ENTERPRISE YOU WORK FOR, YOU GOT TO SHARE IN THE BENEFITS AND THE PROFITS. IF THE ENTERPRISE HITS HARD TIMES, EVERYBODY TOOK A HIT. UP AND DOWN THE LINE. FROM THE SECRETARY TO THE C.E.O. BUT THAT BARGAIN'S BEEN BROKEN. NOW THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT WHEN A COMPANY DOES WELL ARE THE C.E.O.'S AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. AND THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. NOW, PEOPLE GET HURT WHEN A COMPANY GETS HIT HARD TIMES. THERE ARE THE WORKERS. IT'S A ONE-WAY STREET THESE DAYS. JUST LOOK AROUND. G.M. I WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO SEE TO IT THAT G.M. STAYED ALIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. UNION WORKERS, THE U.A.W. TOOK INCREDIBLE CUTS IN THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR PENSIONS TO GET G.M. WORKING, TO KEEP IT ALIVE. THE TAXPAYERS BAILED THEM OUT. THEY PAID IT BACK AND PAID IT BACK WITH INTEREST. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? THE C.E.O.'S AND THE EXECUTIVES DID QUITE WELL. AND THE SECOND THEY HIT HARD TIMES, WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY CLOSED PLANTS. THEY ANNOUNCED THEY'RE GOING TO LAY OFF OR TRANSFER 14,000 WORKERS. THEY ALSO GOT THAT LAST YEAR, OVER IN TAX BREAKS. $192 MILLION THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERY ONE THEY LAID OFF SEVERANCE PAY IF THEY HAD TO. COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYONE. THEY DID NOTHING. THEY BOUGHT BACK THEIR STOCK. RAISED THEIR BENEFITS. RAISED THEIR SALARIES. ANNOUNCED THEY WERE GOING BUILD A NEW TRUCK IN MEXICO. [CROWD BOOING] JOE: FOLKS, FOLKS, NO. LOOK. I JUST DID A RALLY FOR WORKERS IN BOSTON. 31,000 WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE TO PROTECT THEIR WAGES, HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. WAS STOP N' SHOP IN TROUBLE? NO, THEIR PARENT COMPANY HAD MADE $2 BILLION THE YEAR BEFORE. $2 BILLION. IT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY WERE GOING TO DECIDE, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO BUY BACK THEIR STOCK AND TRY TO CUT WAGES OR FREEZE WAGES FOR THEIR PEOPLE. IT'S NOT RIGHT. NOW HERE, UPMC, UPMC, ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. [CROWD BOOING] NO. BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU UNDERSTAND IT. THE SCIU IS ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANIZING FIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, 200 YEARS AGO IN STEEL MILLS AND COAL MINES IS TRUE TODAY. , WHAT WAS TRUE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN STEEL MILLS AND COAL MINES IS TRUE TODAY. OUR BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING IN OUR BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A STRONG UNION TO GET JUSTICE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. STOP THE UNION BUSTING, STOP. [APPLAUSE] STOP TRYING TO KEEP YOUR WORKERS FROM ORGANIZING. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, UMPC WORKERS, I HAVE YOUR BACK, AND FIAMMA PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT LIKE THE DESK TOIL MAKE SURE YOU , FIGHT LIKE OF A DEVIL TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT BLOCKED, UNIONS ARE NOT BLOCKED UNFAIRLY BY THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S ECONOMICALLY WRONG. AND IT'S MORALLY WRONG. SO WHAT DO WE DO? FOLKS, I THINK WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE STOCK MARKET TO RISE. LET'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. , THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. WORKERS FEEL POWERLESS. TOO OFTEN HUMILIATED. I CALL IT AN ABUSE OF POWER. AND I CAN'T STAND IT. NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WORK, I THINK ABOUT DIGNITY. I THINK ABOUT A LOT ABOUT MY DAD. A PROUD GENTLEMAN. MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID, JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR KID AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT. BUT, FOLKS, TOO MANY PEOPLE, THEY CAN'T LOOK AT THEIR KIDS TODAY. AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO CHANGE. I THINK ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TODAY. WHO ARE JUST NOT GETTING RESPECT, NOT TREATED WITH RESPECT. HOW DO YOU GET TO A PLACE, HOW DID WE EVER GET HERE, WHERE PEOPLE WHO TEACH OUR KIDS, TAKE CARE OF OUR SICK, TRANSPORT OUR GOODS, BUILD OUR BRIDGES AND REPAIR OUR ROOFS, KEEP OUR WATER SYSTEMS SAFE? PEOPLE WHO RACE INTO BURNING BUILDINGS, PEOPLE WHO RACE INTO DANGER TO PROTECT US, PEOPLE WHO PICK UP OUR GARBAGE OFF OUR STREETS, IRON WORKERS, STEEL WORKERS, BOILERMAKERS, PLUMBERS, ELECTRICAL WORKERS, SALES PEOPLE, HOW DID WE GET TO THIS PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T THINK WE SEE THEM OR HEAR THEM OR KNOW THEM? AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, RESPECT THEM? RESPECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS , I THINK THE QUESTION TODAY IS, HOW DID WE GET HERE, HOW DID IT HAPPEN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? ALL ACROSS AMERICA, COMMUNITIES ARE HURTING. WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WE'RE TEARING AMERICA APART INSTEAD OF LIFTING IT UP. AND THE MAJOR, IN MY VIEW, THE MAJOR MORAL OBLIGATION OF OUR TIME IS TO RESTORE, REBUILD AND RESPECT THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THE MIDDLE CLASS. AS WE REBUILD IT, WE NEED THIS REBUILDING TO BE ALL INCLUSIVE. OPENING THE DOORS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS. NO MATTER THEIR RACE, THEIR GENDER, WHO THEY LOVE, NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE THEY'RE FROM. NO MATTER WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A DISABILITY. ALL AMERICA HAS TO BE INCLUDED AS WE REBUILD. ALL AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I GUARANTEE YOU, THIS IS, REMAINS AND WILL BE MY MEASURE OF A CONSTITUTE THE SECOND I'M IN SUCCESS. THE DIGNITY OF WORK IS MY MEASURE. WHICH IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND SHARE THE JOY WITH YOUR FAMILIES. HOW CAN A PERSON'S DIGNITY BE MAINTAINED IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO CARE FOR THEIR SICK CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER, BECAUSE OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION? OR BECAUSE THEY'VE REACHED A POINT WHERE THEIR HEALTH CARE HAS RUN OUT AND INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO MORE? JILL AND I, MY FAMILY, LIKE MANY OF YOU, WENT THROUGH A YEAR KNOWING OUR SON WAS TERMINALLY ILL. I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE WERE TOLD THAT HE'S RUN OUT OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN HIS INSURANCE POLICY AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT HIM OFF FROM THE PALLIATIVE CARE HE WAS GETTING. MY LORD. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY, THEIR DIGNITY, IF THEIR CHILD WANTS TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, TRADE SCHOOL, COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR COLLEGE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT? HOW DO YOU GET THEM THERE? FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THAT THAT CHILD IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW AND BE BETTER. BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY MY SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, GOING DOWN TO MY DAD'S OFFICE TO BORROW A CAR FOR THE PROM. DRIVING DOWN AN OLD CAR TO PICK UP A CAR FOR THE SENIOR PROM. I ASKED THE SECRETARY WHERE HE WAS. SHE SAID, HE IS OUT IN THE ALLEY BEHIND THE OFFICE. I WALKED OUT, MY DAD GENTLE, , A DECENT MAN, WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I WALKED IN, HE SAID, JOEY, I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. I THOUGHT, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO MOM OR MY BROTHERS OR SISTERS? BEFORE CELL PHONES. I SAID, WHAT'S THE MATTER, DAD? HE SAID, I WENT TO THE BANK TODAY TO TRY TO BORROW THE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET TO SCHOOL. BUT THEY WON'T LEND IT TO ME. I'M SO ASHAMED. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAY ARE IN THAT SITUATION? HARDWORKING, DECENT PEOPLE , BECAUSE THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS SKYROCKETTED SO BADLY AND ACCESS IS TO DIFFICULT? FOLKS COME DIGNITY. A MODEL CAN'T , IMMANUEL KANT, A PHILOSOPHER, SAID DIGNITY, THE DEFINITION OF DIGNITY IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE TREATED AS A MEANS TO AN END, BUT AN END IN THEMSELVES. THAT'S HOW TODAY'S CORPORATE CULTURE WORKS. C.E.O.'S AND THIS ADMINISTRATION SEE IT A DIFFERENT WAY. THEY SEE WORKERS AS A MEANS TO AN END. NOT THE END IN THEMSELVES. LOOK AT THE RECORD. THEY TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES IN A WAY THAT IT IS ONLY ABOUT HOW CAN THEY MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFIT? NOT HOW CAN THEY MAXIMIZE THE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO HELP THEM BUILD THE OPERATION. THEY'RE SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF A LABOR MARKET, YOU SEE HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU UNION FOLKS THAT. YOU SEE HOW COMPANIES HAVE BECOME SO ADEPT AT SQUEEZING EVERY LAST PENNY OUT OF THEIR PAYROLL. HOW GOOD THEY'VE BECOME AT TILTING THE SCALES IN THEIR FAVOR. BUT IT IS NOT ONLY MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS, THEY'RE DOING IT ACROSS THE BOARD. NOT ONLY STRIPPING AWAY UNIONS' RIGHTS TO NEGOTIATE, BUT YOUR PERSONAL DAY. JUST TAKE A LOOK. THEY'RE NOT ONLY GOING AFTER LABOR AND UNIONS TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY AND DIMINISH THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN, THEY'RE GOING AFTER INDIVIDUALS. ALL TO SUPPRESS THEIR WAKES. WHY ON EARTH WOULD AN HOURLY WORKER MAKING SANDWICHES HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE CLAUSE? PROMISE, I WILL NOT COMPETE WITH THIS , BECAUSE , AND I KNOW WE LAUGH ABOUT IT. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. THEY CAN'T GO ACROSS TOWN TO ANOTHER SANDWICH PLACE AND GET A 15-CENT RAISE IF THEY COULD. THEY CAN'T EVEN ADVERTISE THEMSELVES. THEY CAN'T MOVE, BECAUSE WHY? ALL TO SUPPRESS WAGES. ALL TO SUPPRESS WAGES. I'VE SEEN THESE AGREEMENTS AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE CAREER. 40% OF THEM. IT'S WRONG. IT'S IMMORAL. AND IT SHOULD BE MADE ILLEGAL IN THE STATES WHERE THEY TRY TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] BUT THEY DO THE SAME THING. WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WHO BRAIDS HAIR HAVE TO GET 600 HOURS OF TRAINING? IT MAKES NO SENSE. IT'S DESIGNED TO KEEP THE COMPETITION DOWN. LOOK, FOLKS. YOU CAN'T JUST TRANSFER YOUR LICENSES ACROSS ONE STATE TO ANOTHER. THEY'RE MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER. IN A WHOLE RANGE OF PROFESSIONS. ALL TO KEEP COMPETITION DOWN. WHY SHOULD WE GET RID OF THESE UNNECESSARY HOOPS OUT THERE? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE AMERICA'S ABILITY AND INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN DIGNITY. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD STOP COMPANIES FROM CLASSIFYING LOW-WAGE WORKERS AS MANAGERS. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME THE WE TRIED IT IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. WHY DO THEY DO THAT? SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME. IT COST MORE THAN FOUR MILLION WORKERS LAST YEAR $1.2 BILLION IN LOST OVERTIME PAY. RECLASSIFICATION. BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF OVERTIME, IT'S WELL PAST TIME THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE, NATIONALLY BE A MINIMUM OF $15. , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO START REWARDING WORK OVER WEALTH. THE FIRST STEP IS REVERSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX CUT FOR THE VERY WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THESE SPECIAL TAX BREAKS IN THE TAX CODE. THAT REWARD SPECIAL INTERESTS. LET'S GET RID OF CAPITAL GAIN LOOPHOLES FOR MULTIMILLIONAIRES. WARREN BUFFETT SAID IT BEST, HE SHOULDN'T PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY DOES. THAT'S BECAUSE OF CAPITAL GAINS. IT'S WRONG. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WRONG! AND I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT, SO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES DON'T PAY LOWER TAXES THAN FIREFIGHTERS, TEACHERS AND I GO ON AND ON. WE NEED TO REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT JUST WEALTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK! THERE IS MUCH MORE WE NEED! THERE'S MUCH MORE WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. IN THE COMING WEEKS, I AM GOING TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS. IT STARTS WITH ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. SO THAT EVERYONE CAN GET THE SKILLS THEY NEED. [APPLAUSE] 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS NOT ENOUGH. SIMPLE. THERE'S GOT TO BE AFFORDABLE. 65 OUT OF 100 JOBS TODAY REQUIRE TRAINING BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. 65 OUT OF EVERY 100. BUT, BOY, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT , MAKE A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION, MAKE TRAINING AFFORDABLE, MAKE SURE AN ECONOMY WORKS. NOT JUST FOR THE WEALTHY FOLKS, NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO GET FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREES, BUT THOSE WHO COMPETE FOR JOB TRAINING AND TRADES AND PROGRAMS. LOOK, GUYS. WE CAN DO ALL THIS. IT MEANS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A QUALITY HEALTH CARE. CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS. AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WAS A HUGE STEP FORWARD. THE A.C.A. IN OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE MADE HISTORIC PROGRESS. BY EXTENDING HEALTH CARE TO 22 MILLION PEOPLE. AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE NOW HAVE IT. 22 MILLION. WE HAVE TO STOP THIS ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO GUT IT FIRST, AND THEN COMMAND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON AND FINISH THE JOB, AND MAKE HEALTH CARE A RIGHT! HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT. NOT A PRIVILEGE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY THE PEACE OF MIND THEY DESERVE. WHEN YOU'RE COVERING IT THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR ON YOUR OWN OR NOT, YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO BUY INTO A PUBLIC OPTION PLAN FOR MEDICARE. YOUR CHOICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE. IT MEANS REBUILDING AMERICA'S CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. CLEANER TRANSPORTATION THAT WILL NOT ONLY MAKE US SAFER AND MAKE OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CHILDREN, BUT IT WILL PROVIDE MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING, MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. IT MEANS INVESTING MUCH MORE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH TO CONQUER DEVASTATING DISEASES LIKE CANCER AND ADDICTION AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. INVEST IN IT. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS. WE CAN DO ALL THIS WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY. YOU KNOW, WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, THERE WERE 800 BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXPENDITURES. MEANING TAX LOOPHOLES. KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? IT'S OVER $1,600,000,000,000. WE COULD SEND EVERY ONE IN AMERICA TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, SIX MILLION FOLKS. SIX MILLION FOLKS. BY DOING ONE THING. ELIMINATING ONE LOOPHOLE. THE $1.6 TRILLION. IT ROBS THE COUNTRY OF EVERY , IT ROBS THE COUNTRY OF $17 BILLION A YEAR. IF YOU GET A CAPITAL GAIN, YOU'RE ABOUT TO CASH IT IN. GOT FOR BIG YOU GET HIT A TRUCK, YOU LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILD THEY , PAY NO TAX. IT'S NOT INHITTERED TAX. IF YOU ELIMINATE THAT ONE, YOU CAN CUT EVERY COLLEGE CUT COST IN HALF AND YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE $11 BILLION LEFT TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT. [APPLAUSE] SO, FOLKS, QUITE FRANKLY, THE ONLY THING THAT STANDSES IN OUR WAY IS OUR BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. THAT IS THE LIBERTY BEING UNDERMINED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO BEST IS DELIBERATELY BEING , THAT'S DELIBERATELY BEING UNDERMINED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE TO ABUSE THE POWER OF THE OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT WHO HAS DECIDED NOT TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS BASE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS. AND WE CAN AFFORD THIS. WE CAN DO THIS. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE JOURNEY OF THIS COUNTRY. WHEN ORDINARY AMERICANS LIKE MY FAMILY ARE GIVEN AN EVEN CHANCE, JUST AN EVEN CHANCE, THEY COULD EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. , THEY DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. AND THE SECOND REASON I'M OPTIMISTIC IS THAT I KNOW WE ARE IN BETTER POSITION THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO ON THE BEST TO OWN , TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE WORKERS IN ASIA. NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY MAKES US INDEPENDENT. THE U.S. HAS MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES WHERE ALL THESE MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS COME FROM THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. NO OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD CAN MATCH US. WE CAN BRING IN BE A POSITIVE FORCE FOR EVERYONE. FOLKS, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. AND I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE AND HOPE THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE DEMOCRATS, WE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE THE SAME VIEW, HAVE TO CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. UNITY OR DIVISION. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, TRUTH OVER LIES. TRUTH OVER LIES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS. [CHANTING] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NOT A SINGLE THING. SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS! THANK YOU!

(music) I LOVE THIS CITY, MY FAMILY DOES, WE HAVE MADE SO, SO MANY GOOD, GOOD FRIENDS. PAM, WE TALKED EARLIER. YOU KNOW, HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE TO CANCER OR LOST A LOVED ONE TO A SERIOUS DISEASE? YOU GET IT. YOU GET IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT PAM AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. THERE'S SO MANY HEROES IN AMERICA AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. WHO SUFFERED A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN ME AND MY FAMILY HAVE SUFFERED. WHO , BUT DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE KIND OF HELP THAT I'VE HAD AND THE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND FROM FRIENDS. FRAND FAMILY. YET THEY GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY, THEY WALK OUT AND PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. THEY DO THEIR JOB. THEY CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY CARE FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM. AND I THINK THEY DESERVE AN INCREDIBLY BETTER CIRCUMSTANCE THAN MANY OF THEM FIND THEMSELVES IN. FOLKS, IN ONE OF THE , ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT, OR PRESIDENT OR BEING ABLE TO BE OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY IS IN THE PROCESS, YOU NOT ONLY MEET SUPPORTERS BUT A LOT OF YOUR SUPPORTERS BECOME GENUINELY YOUR CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIENDS. IT'S AN INORDINATE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND THERE'S NO CITY IN THE COUNTRY I'VE MET MORE DECENT, HONORABLE AND CARING PEOPLE AND I REALLY MEAN THAT DIDN'T PLAN ON GOING INTO THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT , ANYWAY. I JUST THINK THERE'S, YOU KNOW, MY , JILL, MY WIFE, ACTUALLY, I'M HER HUSBAND. [LAUGHTER] Y'ALL THINK I'M KIDDING, DON'T YOU? NO, NO, NO. I'M KNOWN AS JILL'S HUSBAND AND PROUD OF IT. I HAD TO WORK REAL HARD TO GET THAT TITLE. HAD TO ASK HER FIVE TIMES TO MARRY ME. FIVE. THAT'S GOD'S TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] SOME OF YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME I WAS AT ANDY YOUNG, WE WERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEE NELSON MANDELA WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS. I CAME BACK AFTER I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DAY, SIX, EIGHT, 10 DAYS AWAY, GOT OFF THE PLANE IN PHILADELPHIA, WENT BACK, STOPPED AT HER APARTMENT, KNOCKED ON THE DOOR I SAID JILLY , YOU GOT MY IRISH PRIDE UP NOW. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, IT'S OK IF YOU SAY NO BUT THIS IS THE LASTTIME I'M GOING TO ASK YOU. LAST TIME. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WHEN BUT IF, WILL YOU MARRY ME? SHE LOOKED AT ME AND WENT LIKE THIS. OK. MY SISTER, A LOT OF YOU KNOW VALLEY, LATER ASKED HER, WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? SHE SAID I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. BUT FOLKS LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU THIS. NO ONE IS GOING TO WORK HARDER TO WIN YOUR TRUST AND YOUR HELP. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. AND I WANT TO THANK DENISE DOLE FOR BEING HERE OUR COUNTY AUDITOR. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR AND THE REAL MAYOR DEB FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] Y'ALL THINK I'M KIDDING, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU ARE THE SPOUSE OF A MAYOR, A SPOUSE OF A GOVERNOR, YOU WORK FULL-TIME FOR NOTHING. ANYWAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND I ALSO , I ALSO WANT TO THANK KEN, FORMER DUBUQUE COUNTY SHERIFF WHO IS WITH US. HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO BE U.S. MARSHAL AND HE DID ONE HECK OF A JOB FOR US. [APPLAUSE] LINDSEY, CONGRATULATIONS, KID. CONGRATULATIONS. WONDERFUL. I REALLY MEAN IT. AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, RICK AND OUR FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND PRESIDENT OF DUBUQUE TISSUE GREATER DUBUQUE DEVELOPMENT, I GET THAT BACKWARDS. DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. ANYWAY DOING A HELL OF A JOB, PAL. [APPLAUSE] AND KATHY FLYNN, FORMER COUNTY TREASURER AND I TALK ABOUT YOU BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE. TO TERRY, JOHN, ELLEN GOODMAN AND THE WHOLE FAMILY, THEY'VE BEEN GREAT SUPPORTERS, GREAT FRIENDS, WE HAVE NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WE MET YEARS AGO. AND , [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE TO SUGGEST, I THINK WE ALL KNOW, WHETHER YOU'RE A 15-YEAR-OLD KID OR WHETHER YOU'RE MY AGE, ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SPECTRUM. YOU KNOW IN YOUR GUT THIS ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY WE'VE SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME. NOT A JOKE. NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND OURSELVES IN. THE CORE VALUES OF THIS NATION ARE STANDING IN THE WORLD WHICH I WILL BE GIVING A , I'LL TALK AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT OUR FOREIGN POLICY OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT'S MADE AMERICA, AMERICA, IS AT STAKE. WE ALL KNOW WHY. LIMIT IT TO FOUR YEARS, HISTORY WILL TREAT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S TIME AS AN ABERRATION IN TIME. BUT, IF THERE'S EIGHT YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, I THINK IT WILL , I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AND ALTER THE CHARACTER AND TRAJECTORY OF THIS NATION. FOLKS, BEYOND DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, AND BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, THIS IS A DIFFERENT BREED OF CAT NOW. THEY TALK ABOUT THERE'S DIVISION IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WE AGREE ON BASICALLY EVERYTHING, ALL OF US RUNNING, ALL 400 OF US. [LAUGHTER] BUT I KNOW TOO MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE'S GREAT DIVISIONS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT LOOK, FOLKS, WE CAN'T LET EIGHT YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. FOLKS, THE THREAT THAT IS POSED TO THIS NATION IS UNLIKE, AS I SAID, ANY I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFETIME. YOU KNOW, I SAW IT MOST VIVIDLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE DOWN IN VIRGINIA. YOU KNOW, THESE FOLKS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 1920'S WHEN THE KLAN MARCHED DOWN THE STREETS BY THE THOUSANDS ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, SOME GOVERNORS WERE MEMBERS OF THE KLAN, SINCE THEN I DON'T REMEMBER ANY TIME, AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME, THAT'S HISTORICAL CONTEXT I TALKED ABOUT WITH JON MEACHAM, WHO WROTE ""THE SOUL OF AMERICA,"" OUT IN THE OPEN, OUT IN THE FIELDS AT NIGHT, CARRYING TORCHES, CRAZED LOOKS ON THEIR FACES, CARRYING TORCHES AND SWASTIKAS. ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE 1930'S IN GERMANY AND YOU KNOW, AND THEN MANY IN THE ALT RIGHT AND THIS PRESIDENT, WHEN THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE, WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST THIS HATE AND VIOLENCE ENSUED, THE RESPONSE WHEN ASKED WHAT DID HE THINK, HE SAID, QUOTE, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY WHO I'VE KNOWN WAS RUNNING IN THE PAST EXCEPT MAYBE GEORGE WALLACE IN THE 1960'S, I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS, I'M BEING SERIOUS. HAS SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW, IN A FEW DAYS , YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS LATER, AFTER HE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHAT I SAID, HE DOUBLED DOWN. CONCOCTING A PHONY STORY ABOUT HOW THOSE VIOLENT THUGS ONLY WANTED TO PROTECT THE STATUE OF ROBERT E. LEE. GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN. GIVE ME A BREAK. FOLKS, IT'S NONSENSE THAT RALLY WAS ADVERTISED. IT WAS ADVERTISED. AS A WHITE SUPREMACY RALLY. THE ANTI-SEMITIC CHANTS ABOUT JEWS IN AMERICA COULD BE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. AROUND THE WORLD. HATRED WAS ON THE MARCH AND HE KNEW IT. I SAID AT THE TIME, I WROTE AT THE TIME, IN ""ATLANTIC"" MAGAZINE, THAT WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. AND WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT'S NOT WHO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. THAT'S WHY ABOVE ALL ELSE, WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] BUT , THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, QUITE FRANKLY, IS , THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH FOR THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. I CALL IT THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. MIDDLE CLASS, HARDWORKING AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE STAKES ARE MUCH TOO HIGH. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET. BANKERS. HEDGE FUND MANAGERS. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BAD, IT WASN'T BUILT BY THEM. IT WAS BUILT BY MY AND YOUR ANCESTORS, ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, NOT ONLY DEFENDING THE COUNTRY BUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY ACROSS THE BOARD. WASN'T BUILT BY THEM, IT WAS BUILT BY YOU, BY THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY , HE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE ORDINARY PEOPLE DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. GIVE THEM SOMETHING APPROXIMATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. FOLKS, WHAT HAPPENED? SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE IN YOUR STATE AND MINE AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE WORRIED, WORRIED THE AMERICAN DREAM IS SLIPPING FROM THEIR GRASP AND WON'T EVEN BE AVAILABLE TO THEIR CHILDREN, JUST LOOK AT THE DATA, LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ATTITUDES. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN POINT TO AS TO WHY IT HAPPEN. BUT WHAT STANDS OUT TO ME IS THAT IT USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN IN AMERICA. BUT TODAY THAT BARGAIN HAS , DROVE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GROWTH IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, THAT BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. THE BARGAIN WAS SIMPLE. IF YOU WORKED HARD, PART OF A SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE AND SUCCEEDED YOU GOT TO SHARE THE BENEFITS. BUT THAT'S CHANGED. THAT'S CHANGED. WHEN THEIR ENTERPRISE HIT HARD TIMES, WHAT HAPPENED? EVERYBODY TOOK A HIT FROM THE C.E.O. TO THE SECRETARIES. BUT THAT'S CHANGED. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO NOW BENEFIT WHEN THE COUNTRY DOES WELL ARE THE C.E.O.'S AND THE STOCKHOLDERS. FOLKS, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. I HAVE A CARTOON HANGING IN MY OFFICE, I HAD IT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. IT'S A CARTOON FROM ""THE NEW YORKER"" MAGAZINE AND HAS A PICTURE OF A BIG, STOUT GUY IN A BLACK TURTLENECK, BLACK BERET, BLACK MASK ON AND HE'S SITTING AT A TABLE BEING INTERROGATED AND THERE'S A BIG BAG, BURLAP BAG ON THE TABLE WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ON IT. HE'S LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING I'M SORRY. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WAS A JOB CREATOR? SINCE WHEN ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE THE JOB CREATORS CAN BENEFIT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STOCKHOLDERS AND C.E.O.'S? LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT OUR AUTOMOBILES ON THE ASSEMBLYLINE AND SELL THEM ARE THEY NO LONGER JOB CREATORS? THE PEOPLE WHO GROW OUR FOOD, TRANSPORT OUR FOOD, PROTECT US, ARE THEY NOT JOB CREATORS? I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT HOW FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S CHANGED. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO WONKY HERE BUT MILTON FRIEDMAN, A CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST IN THE LATE 1980'S SAID THERE'S ONLY ONE OBLIGATION A CORPORATION HAS AND THAT'S TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE EMPLOYEE, THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN, THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION BUT THEY WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AN AWFUL LOT OF CORPORATIONS KNOW IT. KNOW IT. FRANKLY, THEY'RE AFRAID IF THEY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY. SO FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THEY HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN A WAY SO WHEN FOLKS AS I SAID WHO GROW OUR FOOD PRORK SAYS OUR FOOD, PACKAGE, ETC., THEY SHOULD SUCCEED WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE SUCCEEDS IN THAT CORPORATION, WHEN THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE OTHER FOLKS SUCCEED. [APPLAUSE]MR. BIDEN: YOU KNOW, MY DADDY IS TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS BECAUSE HE DID SAY THIS ALL OF THE TIME. HE SAID JOE, A JOB IS MORE ABOUT A PAYCHECK, IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, ABOUT RESPECT, IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT YOUR STANDING, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT, KNOW IT. FOLKS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WORKING AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THEY CAN LOOK THEIR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK. IT IS GOING TO BE OK. BECAUSE FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO CHANGE. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD, WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYONE ALONG NO MATTER THEIR RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE ARE WHERE THEY LIVE. I REALLY MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, THAT WILL BE THE MEASURE I WILL CONSIDER ECONOMIC SUCCESS IF I'M ELECTED, NOT JUST THE GDP. IT IS WELL BEYOND THAT. THAT WILL AT ITS CORE, IT IS REALLY ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF WORK. KING ABLE TO PROVIDE AND BY THAT I MEAN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR FAMILY SECURITY, AND PEACE OF MIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT HAS BEEN STRIPPED FROM PEOPLE. HOW CAN A PERSON'S DIGNITY BE MAINTAINED IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF A SICK CHILD BECAUSE I HAVE A PREEXISTED , PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM? HOW IS APPARENT STING 80 MEANT TO BE MAINTAINED WHEN THEY HAVE A CHILD WHO HAS A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND NOW THEY WILL BE TOLD BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE, NO MORE CARE. I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WITH BEAU. WE KNEW IT WAS TERMINAL, WHAT HE HAD. HE FOUGHT LIKE THE DOUBLE BRAVELY, FOR A YEAR. THAT FOLKS, I CANNOT IMAGINE AN INSURANCE COMING ALONG AND TELLING ME ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO STOP. NO MORE COVERAGE. THINK OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO BEFORE WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WERE IN THAT POSITION. BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR DIGNITY. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN HIS OR HER DIGNITY IF THEIR CHILD WHO HAS THE CAPACITY AND DESIRE TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR EDUCATION? WHETHER IT IS TRADE SCHOOL, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHATEVER IT IS. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A SCHOOL THAT I CANNOT AFFORD TO GET TO. I WANTED TO GO. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN THE NIGHT OF MY SENIOR PROM TO CHANGE CARS WITH MY DAD, HE RAN A CAR DEALERSHIP AND I GOT , AND I ALWAYS GOT A NICE CAR TO PROM NIGHTS. DRIVING DOWN TO A BASEBALL GAME TO HIS BUSINESS, PARKING THE CAR, MY 51 PLYMOUTH WAS , WHICH WAS REALLY GREAT BY THE WAY, THAT WAS EVEN OLD FOR ME THEN. IRAN AND I ASKED, WHERE HIS DAD? SHE SAID HE IS OUT IN THE LANE WHERE THEY ARE FIXING THE CARS. I WALKED OUT, AND I CAN'T THINK HOW MANY PARENTS GO THROUGH THIS. I SAID WHAT IS A MATTER? HE SAID I'M SO SORRY, PAL. I'M SO SORRY. I LOOKED AT HIM AND , THIS BEFORE CELL PHONES, I FELT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, SISTER, MY MOM. I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS THAT I WENT TO THE BANK TODAY TO BORROW THE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET THERE, AND HE SAID THEY WILL NOT LEND ME THE MONEY. I'M SO ASHAMED. HE HAD NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT. BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THIS JUNE WHO ARE GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLE SAYING, WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GET HER BACK TO SCHOOL. WE WILL HAVE TO DO THE FOLLOWING. THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE MAKING THOSE JUDGMENTS. BECAUSE EDUCATION IS BEING PRICED OUT OF CONTROL. YOU KNOW, THE PHILOSOPHER KANT DEFINED DIGNITY THIS WAY, HE SAID DIGNITY IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE TREATED AS A MEANS TO AN END, THAT AS AN END IN THEMSELVES. THINK ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] END, THAT AS AN END IN THEMSELVES. THE NEW EMERGING CORPORATE CULTURE, THINK ABOUT THE TAX-CUT, YOU HAVE TWICE AS MANY CORPORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAYING NO TAXES AT ALL. IT IS NOT ABOUT , I KNOW YOU ARE SUPPORTING BY BILLING BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, IT IS NOT RIGHT. IT IS SIMPLY NOT RIGHT. AND FOLKS, LOOK, THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE DIGNITY DOES NOT COME INTO THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF SO MANY EMPLOYERS THESE DAYS. AND YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT ONLY MAKING IT HARDER TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS, WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE BY STRIPPING THEM OF THEIR DIGNITY, JUST TALK TO UNION MEMBERS. THERE HAS BEEN A WAR ON LABOR'S RIGHT TO BARGAIN FOR A LONG TIME BUT WE HAVE GONE BEYOND THAT. THINK OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS OR SO. THERE'S ALSO , 40% OF WORKERS HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE CLAUSE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER. NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS HAVE ONE PURPOSE, TO HOLD DOWN THE ABILITY TO BARGAIN FOR YOURSELF. I CAN UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU WORK FOR A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND YOU HAVE SERIOUS SECRETS OR WHATEVER. BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT FOR WORKERS. WHY IN GODS NAME TO DO SO MANY HAVE TO SIGN NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS? THERE IS NO OTHER RATIONALE THAN TO HOLD DOWN WAGES. FOLKS, LOOK, WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY AS WELL. DO COMPANIES CLASSIFIED LOW-WAGE WORKERS AS MANAGERS? WHY DO THEY DO THAT? THEY DO IT FOR A SIMPLE REASON. BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN MANAGEMENT, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO OVERTIME. JUST LAST YEAR ALONE, LAST YEAR ALONE, 4 MILLION HOURLY WORKERS WERE CHEATED OUT OF $1.2 BILLION IN LOST WAGES. WHERE DID IT GO? GET WENT IN THE CORPORATE CAUSES. THEY DID NOT EXPAND, THEY BOUGHT BACK THEIR OWN STOCK, RAISING THE STOCK PRICES FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS AND ENRICHING THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF PAY. , SPEAKING OF STOCK, OVERTIME, I THINK IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE PASS A NATIONAL $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. [APPLAUSE] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. LOOK, I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I AM GOING TO DO AS PRESIDENT, BUT I WILL NOT TAKE THE WHOLE TIME NOW. WE WILL LAY , YOU WILL HEAR IT WHEN I COME BACK IN SPECIFICS. HERE'S THE DEAL. THE FIRST STEP AS PRESIDENT, MY GOAL WILL BE TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WORK. [APPLAUSE] TRILLION IN LOOPHOLES. THEY CALL IT EXPENDITURES PER $1.6 TRILLION AND OUR TAX CODE THAT ARE CALLED TAX EXPENDITURES. YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY ANYWHERE NEAR ALL OF IT. AT A MINIMUM, $300 BILLION ARE TOTAL WASTE IN GIVEAWAYS TO THE SUPER WEALTHY. BY THE WAY, I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF EVEN THOSE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO GIVE IT UP. HERE'S THE DEAL, TO LOOK AT THEM AND SAY HERE IT IS, THEY SAY DON'T GIVE ME THAT TAX BREAK. WE HAVE TO STOP, WE HAVE TO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE TRUMP , WE HAVE TO CUT THE TOP TAX RATE FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. HE CUT THE TOP TAX FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. ALL OF THESE LOOPHOLES. HIS TAX BILLS SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS AND REWARDED IT. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? THEN THEY INCREASED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TAX-CUT $2 TRILLION INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL DEBT. TO TRILLION DOLLARS. I PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN , ANYWAYS, I GO BACK TO THE ROTH CAMP STUFF. I PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THE NEXT THING WOULD BE WE HAVE THIS TRIED TO , THIS GIGANTIC DEFICIT, WE CAN'T SUSTAIN IT SO WE HAVE TO FIND CUTS. WHERE DO THEY GO? THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, THEY GO WITH MEDICARE, MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY. MARK MY WORDS, IF HE IS REELECTED AND THE REPUBLICANS GAINED CONTROL, KEEP CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BATTLE OF OUR LIVES. IF I'M PRESIDENT, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE CAPITAL GAINS CUTS AND LOOPHOLES FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WARREN BUFFETT, A BILLIONAIRE SAID IT, HE POINTED OUT BECAUSE THEY CAPITAL GAINS TREATMENT I GET, I PAID A LOWER TAX RATE THAN MY SECRETARY. HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE JUSTIFIED? HOW CAN IT BE JUSTIFIED? FOLKS, LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE SHOULD BE REWARDING WORK NOT JUST WEALTH. WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. ON HEALTH CARE. WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA IT WAS A BIG DEAL, OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, I WANT TO STOP AND SAY SOMETHING THAT I DO NOT THINK IS SAID OFTEN ENOUGH. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER. REALLY, I MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] EXTRAORDINARY INTEGRITY, A MAN OF ABSOLUTE DECENCY. HE WAS PRESIDENT, OUR KIDS COULD , HAD SOMEONE TO LOOK UP TO. I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY AS I STOOD NEXT TO HIM AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT BUT NEVER MORE PROUD THAN THE DAY WE PASSED THAT LAW. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS A GIGANTIC STEP FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR OUR FUTURE. WE MADE HISTORIC PROGRESS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT EXTENDED TO 22 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT BEFORE. WE COVERED PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I COULD GO ON WITH A LIST. [APPLAUSE] BUT NOW, WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. WE HAVE TO MOVE FOR MAKING HEALTH CARE A PRIVILEGE TO A BRIGHT. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT. TO GIVE EVERYONE, EVERYONE THE PEACE OF MIND THEY MADE. HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT PEACE OF MIND. HOW MANY PEOPLE GO TO BED AT NIGHT STARING AT THE CEILING THINKING MY GOD, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME, YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. MY FAMILY WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. FOLKS, I BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR HEALTH CARE IS COVERED THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER, WHETHER IT IS COVERED ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL, EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE TO BUY INTO A PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH CARE PLAN LIKE MEDICARE. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE PLAN IF YOU WANT. BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO BE ABLE TO BUY AND. THIRDLY, I THINK WE HAVE TO INVEST MORE IN EDUCATION. EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THIS IN DETAIL BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT THE IOWA TEST. EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU HAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I KNOW YOU VALUE IT. LOOK AT WHAT YOUR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAS DONE TO IT AMONG OTHER THINGS. I'M SERIOUS. BUT FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE TRUMP EDUCATION , TRUMP-DEVOS EDUCATION AGENDA. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO START BY GIVING PEOPLE THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE 21ST CENTURY. AND THAT IS A FACT. THE FACTS ARE THAT 65 OUT OF EVERY 100 JOBS IN AMERICA TODAY REQUIRES SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, TODAY. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIGH PAID , DECENT PAYING JOBS IN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES THAT THEY CANNOT BE FILLED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT TRAINING THE PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THE COST , ANYBODY LATELY HAVE TO PAY COLLEGE TUITION? RAISE YOUR HAND. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT IS INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, BE CAREFUL IF YOU PICK A PRIVATE COLLEGE. OUR KIDS ARE GRADUATING IN INCREDIBLE DEBT. I WILL RELEASE A PLAN THAT I DO NOT WANT TO KEEP YOU STANDING LONGER, BUT IT MAKES SURE WE CAN CUT THEIR DEBT. REDUCE THEIR DEBT. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, I HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT I WILL NOT SAY IT BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY CAP DO STANDING TOO LONG. HERE'S THE DEAL. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE ECONOMY WORKS NOT ONLY FOR FOLKS WITH FOUR-YEAR DEGREES AND GRADUATE DEGREES BEYOND THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR THOSE WHO COMPLETE ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, TRADE PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BECAUSE THERE IS PLENTY TO DO OUT THERE. THERE IS A LOT MORE WE NEED TO DO TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE NEED TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN WE ARE NOW. TO DO THE THINGS WE HAD TALKED ABOUT DOING IN THE LAST , IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. I WAS INTERVIEWED BY ONE OF YOUR STATEWIDE RADIO FOLKS TODAY. THEY WERE QUOTING ME ABOUT EARLY ON IN MY TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CONTROL, CLIMATE CHANGE, THE NEED TO DEAL , IT WENT ON AND ON. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. AS WE REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO BUILD A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CAN DO THAT. CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO HERE AND THE JOBS CREATED BY WIND AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. CLEANER, SAFER, AND FASTER TRANSPORTATION. WE HAVE A PLAN THAT I WILL REINTRODUCE IT TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE, ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T STOP TO CHARGE. WE HAVE , WE SHOULD HAVE CHARGING STATIONS IN EVERY HIGHWAY IN THE COUNTRY. IF YOU CAN DO THAT WITH BICYCLES IN TOWN AND YOU CAN PUT A NICKEL , I'M SERIOUS. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THIS WILL NOT ONLY HELP THE EGGS IS A , THE EXISTENTIAL THREATS THAT EXISTS UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE NOW, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. [APPLAUSE] BUT THOSE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. YOU CAN RAISE A FAMILY ON. YOU CAN RAISE A FAMILY ON. FOLKS, THE IDEA THAT WE CAN DO THIS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. WE CAN DO THIS ALL WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY. BY ELIMINATING THE HUNDREDS OF BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY, AND IT WILL NOT PUNISH ANYBODY. WE CONSENT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON IN AMERICA QUALIFIED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FORPERSON IN AMERICA QUALIFIED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, IT COSTS $6 BILLION. WE CAN DO IT BY A LIMITING A 17 , A $17 BILLION TAX LOOPHOLE BY $1.6 TRILLION IN TAX LOOPHOLES. IT IS CALLED STEP UP ACES. IF GOD FOR BID YOU GET HIT BY A TRUCK AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO PAY YOUR TAX ON IT AND IT IS LEFT TO YOUR CHILD, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY TAXES AT IT WAS A TAX CODE 10 SECONDS EARLIER. WE COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT IS QUALIFIED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE, CUT IN HALF OF THE COST OF A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE BECAUSE YOUR STATE UNIVERSITY EXCEPT THE TRANSFERS OF THE CREDIT IN ALMOST EVERY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES AND A JOB. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, FOLKS. IT IS SIMPLE BASIC STUFF. SPEAKING OF ROCKET SCIENCE, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS, ENORMOUS POSSIBILITY. IF WE JUST INVEST. IN MY GENERAL WE CAN DO IF WE INVEST MORE MONEY LIKE WE DID WITH CANCER RESEARCH AS WE LEFT AS VICE PRESIDENT. HERE'S THE DEAL, WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERING DISEASES LIKE CANCER, ALZHEIMER'S, ADDICTION, SO MANY THINGS OUT THERE THAT WOULD NOT ONLY SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND EXTEND THEIR LIVES, BUT SAVE THE COUNTRY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BILLIONS. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THE GHET , LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH WHAT YOU'RE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS DID WITH PRIVATIZING MEDICAID. SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE NOT LOST LIKE OTHER STATES YOUR RURAL HOSPITALS. TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN PLACES LIKE , WHERE I CAMPAIGNED IN MONTANA AND NORTH DAKOTA, IN THE BIG STATES. WE ARE LITERALLY PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN JEOPARDY IS WHEN THOSE HOSPITALS CLOSE. GOD FOR BID YOU ARE IN AN ACCIDENT. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS BETTER IF YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO A HOSPITAL IN FIVE OR 10 MINUTES RATHER THAN AN HOUR. THERE IS SO MUCH HERE THAT IS WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO. I GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] LOOK, THE REASON I'M SO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE GET UP AND REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE, CHANGE THIS ADMINISTRATION. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. NOT A JOKE. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AT 29 AND WAS SAID TO , I WAS TO YOUNG TO BE SWORN IN, I WAS OPTIMISTIC. THIS GENERATION OF COLLEGE KIDS, THE MILLENNIALS, THEY ARE THE BEST EDUCATED GENERATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. [APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY, ENORMOUS CAPACITY. LOOK, I WILL END IT BY SAYING WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD, CAN'T WE LEAD NOT ONLY BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD, FOUR TIMES PRODUCTIVE WORKERS AS IN ASIA, THAT ISRAEL P FOUR TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE. NORTH AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENT, IF WE DO THE RIGHT THING, WE WILL BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND CLEANER WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. AS MY WIFE THE PROFESSOR WOULD SAY, IF YOU DOUBT ME, GOOGLE IT. NOT A JOKE. WE DO. THAT IS WHERE EVERY MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES HAS COME OUT OF. CORPORATIONS ARE NOT BAD FOLKS, THEY COME ALONG AND THEY MONETIZE IT, WHICH NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THE RESEARCH, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE BREAKTHROUGH, COMES OUT OF THOSE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. AND YOU OWN THEM. YOU OWN THEM. THERE ARE PLACES I CAN , I CAN GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE GREAT UNIVERSITIES RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF VIOLENT. I DO NOT KNOW WHY WE THINK WE WALK AROUND LIKE WOE IS ME, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE HAVE TO GET UP. TO GET UP, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN DO ANYTHING. NOT A JOKE. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MINDS TO. WHEN JOHN KENNEDY MADE THAT FAMOUS SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON, THERE IS ONE LINE EVERY KID IN GRADE SCHOOL KNOWS WHAT IT SAYS. ONE LINE THAT STEP , THAT STUCK WITH ME AND STILL SIX WITH ME, HE SAYS WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE ABILITY TO DO THESE THINGS. IT IS TIME FOR US TO DO THEM. IT IS WITHIN OUR WHEELHOUSE. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THEM. AND FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LEARN WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. [APPLAUSE] WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE TRUTHS OVERLIES , OVER LIES. AND WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. PICK UP YOUR HEADS, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, NOT A JOKE, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! LET'S GET UP AND MOVE! [APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK.

Good aftern oon every body and welcome to Ha mpton in what is sure t o be a hist oric 1st in the natio n primary I am thrill ed to have Vice Pres ident Biden here with us today. To Talk To Hampton voters and we're all interes te d in the vision that each cand idate has for this c ountry and we also must get a measure of their leadersh ip ability to achieve that vision for most o f my adult life I've known an administration that was thought ful and valued unity with t he Affordable C are Act President Obama and Vice Presiden t Biden instituted health care polici es that guaranteed coverag e for p reexisting conditions insured or limited lif etime caps on coverage am ong many many thing s you mi ght call it a bi g F. in deal. They got historic pus hback for the out from special interest to a politic al party did eve rything they could to undermine it thanks t o Vice President Biden the issue of gay marriage was of the forefront of politics and le d to a rapid evol ution o f acceptance and legaliz ation. And improve the li ves of tens of millio ns of Americans a re more in h indsight a vast maj ority of American s know these thing s were righ t in fact even the p arty that opp osed them with everythin g it could muster has begun to campai gn w ith promises to pr otect those po licies leadershi p is about doi ng what is right even when it isn't easy Vice President Biden is a leade r. Now watch Vice President Biden's roll out video and h e did something t hat I've been waiting f or he ta lked about American values idea ls and a spirations is a conversation we need to have in America at a time when it has become increasingly difficult to agree on anything never been more importan t to elect someone that unif ies us not divid es us that brings us brings out the ver y best in us with hope an d o ptimism not the worst in us by stokin g fear and anger someo ne that recogni zes we are stronger when o ur allies are behi nd us and ensur es that our adversari es woul d tremble in fear over it meddling in our democracy V ice President Biden is a leader wit h a visio n that brings us t ogether and while I always take care to a bide by proper formalit ies particularly with some one who's held one of the highest offi ces in t he land it's pr etty hard not to call him Joe. Mr Vice P resident thank you fo r choosing Hampton for to day's even t and now I would like to intro duce someone w ho I also admire a colleague of mine State Representative Mike Edgar. You r regular a nd Hampton with the state what. I r ead just because of forget the words because I'm so excited about thi s.

I have a lways been a nd st ill am a supporter of Joe Biden I've. Talk about it a lot som etimes when it 's a ppr opr iate and sometimes when it's not.

Journo's o ur c ountry the world and the wo rld leader s s o who would be bette r than Joe. W e need individua l we can t rust the ener gy will not be wasted t rying to figure out what his motives are with Jo e We know be for the good of the c itizens healt h care eco i tes fairness and the dist ri bution of compensation for w hen you work you a ctually get a good p ay for work and w hich is supposed to we ne ed to h ave an indivi dual we have confidence in to make the righ t deci sions for the good of the peo ple of this country in th e middle of night if the president must make a decision I want to be made by a person I trust that 's done their home work and can act in a rational thoug htfu l manner with the cou ntry and its pe ople in mind. We need an individ ual in the White Hous e that can attract and assemble a solid team to hel p run this country i n an effe ctive and product ive way for all c itizens I strongl y believe Joe is a pers on that mee ts these requirements and exceeds we need Joe the country needs Joe I hope all of you will join Tom and vigorously support Joe Biden. Thank you. Thank you and what I like to shi p set the ca use full speed ahe ad no. Pla ne T hank you. T hank you so to everyone I give you the forme r vice preside nt and th e future president of given a list of everybody i s he re Tom Sher man Tom here State Sen Shar ma Pat there's a whole lot of folks I 'm not sure where the recognition star ts but let me just start by thanking my 2 co lleagues for fo r w elcom e me here and kiddo your mommy o wes you a big favo r for taking you t his OK. Whatever yo u ne ed ice cream or whatever look folks. to ear n the respect and the suppo rt of the people of New Hamps h ire I am going to be here a lot bad news for years I'm comi ng back good news for m e is I'm coming back but I want to earn your su pport an d and folks the fact of the matter is th at we're in a s ituation right no w wh ere you all k now that that this election is bi gger than any huma n in Gage's and not beca use I'm running or anybody el se's running bec ause of occup ies the office t his is a this elect ion is quite frankl y bigger than politics i t's more importa nt the fac t of the ma tter is that I'm running f or 3 basic reasons a nd I'm g oing to be very clear about as I move along and going to great deta il as we get down t he road here because thi s is a maratho n and I don't w ant to ke ep you stand in a long long time even city a long time situation is that I'm running to restore the soul of thi s count ry and secondly th ank you really want to quite frankly rebuild the backbone of this cou ntry this time bringing ever ybody along the middle class th e middle class has bui lt this cou ntry and thirdly wh at I want to d o is I want t o talk about earl ier unite th e country folks I know I get criticize d for saying that I think we have to unite the country the truth of the matter is we can't ge t anything done in this country without a consensus is wh ere a const itution is written t his way it runs where in a situati on where you have to be able to get and generate a consensus to get anything done if you do n't do that you end up wher e we are now. Now you en d up with a presid ent who can divide a country ba sed on the ability to garner more power from self or herse lf the p rinter who it i s and be in a situation w here you you just can't c an't get anything do ne when things don't get done th at's when executives r each out and claim more power than they're entitled to and so folks the about a lot more than a paychec k it's about y our dignity it's a bout your place in the comm unity it's about your bein g able to turn and look at your kid s and say Honey it's going to be OK and me an it was so few people ca n do that tod ay so few people won der whether or not their children are ever going to be in a position they w ere to be able to l ead a good middle cla ss life and there's a l ot of there's a lo t of folks that are doing well and that's good I'm happy people are doing well but so many people are being left behind and we're the situation as well where in a my office and Barack us ed to always kid me by those from the New Y orker the last 2 years of the offi ce I had and I have it i n my office of the university I te ach at and it says i t shows a picture of a great big interrogation tabl e is out of the New York er magaz ine and he's wearing a black turt leneck sweat er or a black b ear or a black mask acro ss his face and is a big dollar there's a big burlap bag on the tab le with a doll ar sig n on it and sayi ng you know how wa s I supposed to know he was that job creator. Well think about or you are not a stockhold er you have no real e quity because you don't create n ew jobs only the job creators. The ones who get th e benefits of the change s take place corporate profits are u p gigantic ally Bu t what's happened people ar e being left behind becau se I don't kno w about you but my dad ran a large auto mobile agency didn't own it but ran it for years and years he cr eated a heck of a l ot of jobs for a lot of pe ople the people on the assembly line an d Dell are the Ge neral Motors plant that u sed to exi st they create a lot of jobs fo r people the pe ople are out in the fields y ou know to them they're going i n the soybeans or whatever they're growing they 're creating jobs for peopl e but we've lost our sense o f who we are it s eems to me and we h ave to reestablish it if the reestablish and the way to start is to get back less than a significan t number of loophol es and the so far exemptions in th e law yo u know when Reagan was president there were $8000 00000000.00 in that were collected because of irrationa l offer ed that it some how some good ratio nale for contributed ch arity you get a deduction you d on't pay at the same rate you don 't you kn ow so on but here's the deal in loopholes the la w at least 3 to 400 of those h ave no justifica tion ther e's no rationale except rewarding the v ery ver y wealthy and they're doin g just fine and by the way I believe. The vast majority of when you talk to them wou ld say I get it I give up this that or the other thing in order to make the country better as well it's creat ed a defi cit of 2 trillion do llars And w hen it passed I said at the time a nd I'm not always righ t obviously but I said at the time I don't want to sound like I told you so but I sa id at the time that what th ey're going to do i s say when it cre ates this 2 additiona l 2 trillio n dollar debt you know we can't afford to keep that security Medicare Medicai d and you thi nk I'm joking now this is not hype rbole before we to ok back the House of Represe ntatives the Republican head of the committee o n the budget ca ll for c utting Medicar e by over half a trillion dollars And now you hear the majority l eader of the Senate continue to say Israel stablish reestablish wha t Barack and I did in the Affordable Care Act when he when tha t act passed I said it was a big deal or something to that we got to do is b y restoring the r eef the Affordable Car e Act and not letting it continue to b e visible t his aerated you indicated what how about you know existing condition and or you know you'r e going to opt out I can't imagine talking to dignity speaking about dig nity I can't imagine how a parent can maintain their dig nity to l ook at their child w ho has a preexisting cond ition it's not a darn thing yo u can do Bob if you couldn't afford it or when the insurance co mpany comes along and s ay Now you have you have you have opted out you've s pent too much money I can't imagine what Joe and I would have done. insurance no more insuran ce company no more palliat ive care I can't im agin e it's about dignity how can a ma n or woman go to bed at night staring a t the ceiling knowing that there's no way if the y get sick they can take care o f their famil ies so folks it is about more tha n just more tha n just a job it's mo re than it's about your dignity the 2nd thing i s yo u think about educ ation look 65 and over 100 jobs today a skill or whethe r or not it's an associate 's degree or whether or not it's a commu nity college or b eyond $65.00 out of $100.00 and h ere's the deal folks is going to get tougher 12 years of education is not en ough any longer 12 ye ars is not enough to compete My wife has who's a colleg e professor a junior college professor said scuse me community us an d it's a basic simp le proposit ion for example give yo u one e xample we can afford t o do all the se things we can for do all these things if you take a look at the he alth care piece as I said I think eve ry single solitary pe rson America should be able at least restoring better tha n it was allow anybo dy to be a ble to buy into a Medi caid Med icare lik e plan we ca n assure the whol e countr y that way we can do it and allow it no matter what the circumstance they can bu y into a Medica re private p lan and look f olks the other thing is that w e talk about we're talki ng about education we're in a situation w here the cost has become so expensive t o send someone to even to this your stat e universities like university Hampshire U niversity Del aware. I want the cost has skyr ock eted to go those schools a nd for a whole lot of reasons in cluding state legislative bodies and usually of these loopholes that make no sens e thank you let me give you one e xample I don't want to be generic about I want to give a n e xample for example you could send everyone i n this state to a comm uni ty c ollege for free in t he entire Unite d States for free if they' re qual ified to cut in half t he cost of a community college I'm assuming a 4 that cos t the governme nt 17000000 000 dollars y ears not collected it's not an inherita nce tax of a tax to 5 seco nds before God forbid someth ing happened.

I just do it every day without th e kind of h elp where there are so me real heroes out ther e so I'm not saying MC Cooperman this i s look at me my gen eric point is that when bow k new he was dying and we didn' t know he was dying because n obody is just a matter of months with his diagnosis I promised him that I w ould not tell anybo dy how serious was h e was atto rney general of Delaware he insisted o n serving out his term he wanted to be able to do that even though you just ha d a face the difficult y calling for proper names et c But you g o to therapy early in t he morning in Ph iladel phia for a couple h ours then he come b ack to delegate work as Job an d it was insistent he said that anybody ask you how many look at message he's good he's good look at me I say he's good so I could tell anybody but the president. give n so much responsibili ty that were han ded to me. That and that any pre sident has to do if they' re sm art to get have someb ody they can because th ey're so much of land on his plate everything land at his des k but lo cust that 1st ye ar no I really mean it no pr esident shor t of a war is it a nyway and so I h ad to tell him and but he was the on ly one I t old so when I decided after wards that ther e wer e still people pushing me to go I told the preside nt was going to go I'm going to formally announce aft er bot h passed that I wasn't going t o run and and so he said Come in come in announc e with me at t he Rose Garden and one of th ings I said spont aneously it wasn't a ny notes I had I said I have o ne regret I want to g et I'm not going to get to be the president to preside over their cancer as we know it and that's when the president s et up the moon shot and a nd put me in charge of the moo n shot and I spent I went all around the world and spoke to almos t every major cance r cent er in the world I put we put to gether a significant group of people inclu ding $21.00 lead ing heads of the major c ancer hospitals an d 5 Nobel laureates on the boar d and so ma ny mo re things we did it we made some real progress I won't go into now the interest of time but folks we are there are so many thing s that are on the cusp we 're able t o do if we invest money in that is that of useles s things th ere are so many thing s we can do and there's so many other things we as we eliminate thes e the se some of t hese ridiculous tax cuts for on ly the super weal thy and these r idiculous some of the ridiculous about 3 0000000 0000 or more in terms of loop holes tha t make no sense. Yes thank you about your famil y and I really mean th at look f olks what I do know i s that there's 3 things we ha ve to do as a relation of research as relates to a number of these disea ses includ ing Also o n e is we have to. We have he minut e he wasn't he was serio us about it he had no army he had no means by which to share data there were no way to get data from hospital ho spi tal etc And the notion was are going to b e a Jonas Salk are go ing to walk into a laboratory come up with the answe r how to cure po lio l ike as a silver bull et back then we basically thou ght th ere was one cancer th at reside it different pa rts of the body we now there are no there's over 204 stra ins of cancer that require dif ferent different kinds of th erapies as many of these other disea ses do as well and so what happened was is not th ese folks are ba d I've met with I've traveled arou nd the world I've met with a wh ole lot of peo ple and met with litera lly thousands of researchers and they're really good folks single cancer specialis t in the world to any anyone who's had their cance r gene s equence and knowing exa ctly what it is and put all of on ce one place one reposito ry we can now do a 1000000000000000 I have or yo u have or you ha ve is a same str ain requ iring given the same the rapy that i s the only one a vailable or on e of several why it w orks on you not me and wo rks on him wha t's the reason fo r. And with its refusal to share the data We'd like you to continue the mo on s hot we want what you call the Biden cancer initiative I said why me I'm not a s cientist said you do 2 things very much more collaboration we can mov e much mo re quic kly to find an swers to these S econd ly there are some diseases like a s you dea l with with with opioids and other drugs there is not a willingness on the part of the drug seen if they find a cure there's not enough peopl e that they believe to justi fy their being able to m ake that much money off of it and so we should be providing incentives I won 't going to him now but how a year advertising on televisio n a nd half of it advertis ing not half liter ally. On adver tising opioids given doctors' you k now bonuses if they support you know that if they write pres criptions a s et or by the way I think w e should take away their deduct ion for ad vertisin g but anyway so we're going to thank what is require d and by the way as you know it's the same drug bu t there are a lot of drugs that are in experi mentation but the re's not a willingness to really spend the time and in because it costs a lot of money but thi s is a place whe re I think we can make gen eric signif icant progress going beyond the generic answer has been but I'm happy to tal k to some detail abo ut it after you give me your name and tele phone number I'll be happy to make sure I get back to y ou on OK. I try I was his hig h school graduation speak er is college graduat ion spe aker law school graduation spe aker etc and my s on Hunter is the bright est of all of our kids he never a sked me t o do anythin g. But he asked me he he had gone to Billy's to teac h English and n ot proselytizing but he r an a he was a em ergency service shelter an African -American comm unity alo ng I would in Portl and Oregon along the one mod era te riv er anyway an d and so h e he said dad bef ore we go out all t hose who joined the de volved to r ecord t heir having a retreat at Gadsden Hall whi ch is joy he went to G eorgetown and and so he asked whether I'd come a grea t priest who w as the head of the presi dent Georgetown the tim e said to me Joe what I'd like you to s peak on is how your faith is i nformed your politics and I thought my lord I've never gone out and talked ab out that in tribe s practice about the top don' t pro selytize about my f aith and so I spent more time on that speech whethe r it was a civil righ ts movement when I was a kid not out making myself out to be a grea t civil right s leader but I go t engaged becaus e my state was segregated by law we have a largest bla ck population in the country as a perce nt of population or whet her it was dealing with what was happening in terms of the w ay in which t he Vietnam war was going on or when I to Limon 8 the requireme nt that a woman a wife had to get t o sit sit the sig nature of her husband to go g et a bank loan I thought that was a n abuse That's been my focu s and I don 't it's probably like a lo t of you you get a rage and you see some of these thing s happen bu t I'm in a position as a United States sena tor I was and then as v ice presidents to he lp do somethin g about them bu t I guess what it is is it thing it g enerate s my passion whether it's yo u know I'v e never liked bullies. And and by the way I thank was a kid starter a nd I stuttered fairly ba dly and I know I wa s it. Taught you would you go the poop p roblem with me and you know if y ou saw The King's Speech you underst ood that it's one of the only things you can really make fun of th e still everybody l aughs about i f I said you I h ad a cleft pa late and I had it fixed and I you kn ow no no no the y were at a cl ub foot as a k i d but you kn ow and so I foun d myself. I was a road to I was th e run of the litter I was and I think ou t of m y fresh man year in high sch ool I was th ink 53 or 4 and 107 pounds some l ike that for real and but my generic point is that I never ever ever. I was taught b y my dad if you s ee something going wr ong in a read Getting ga uged and I my dad was a gentle man my da d never once rai se a cent any one of us the greatest thing my dad could say to you w as you dis appoint me he said it to me twice in my life and I mean no I really mean I remember it was lik e get hit in the bus back in the head b y a ba seball bat or so mething but it was always abo ut you know if y ou see it getting engaged that's why I started ask rock i f I can still bring the violence against women all of us inside the White Hous e into the vice presi dent's office and started t he program it's on us one o f the most deva stating things that happened I was so e xcited when he passed the la w things were really moving well I had a re ally br illiant staff of women w ho helped me write that a man a wo man named Cynthia Hogan work with me a nd Michelle in the White Hou se an d I used to ever go over and che ck the Burea u of Jus tice statistics as to what the progress ha s been on the reduction of vio lence a gainst women in the r eporting of c ases a nd rape and a lot of other things and she came b ack and s he said wo men over 40 it was si gnificant ly down and i t was a 38 percent reduction in one o n up but for women between the ages of $15 .25 had n't changed a bit n ot a single thing th at happene d not a single thin g that happened b ecause y ou know we we and so I st arted this moveme nt called it's on us I did a sur vey one of these v irtual town meetings and I don't k now how many people there wer e they told me ther e were thousands on it you co uldn't they couldn't respond to high scho ol or co llege stu dents to say this is what the numbe rs are what should I be d oing what do you thi nk you know I gave a website a nd so on and and I was e mbarrassed I sho uld have understood the single most impor tant thing th ey said to me s pontaneous ope n ended questi on those of you are pos ters of the press guys know this and women k now this it came b ac k and they said get m en involved in t he probl em. And so that's the way that is my dad's noshing it's on us it's on all of u s to sp eak up it's on us to engage us to and I don't exp ect like I go on the ca mpuses and I say the fresh man year you see you're in a fraternity you see a brother taken to a youn g woman who's a neig hbor ate it up the steps you have you if you don't go over say no no no not as how Samantha then you're damned coward I don't want to hear it and if the guy stood by the way you guys are 300 powerful because Guy Loo k here's the de al the only t hing if a woman no matte r what the circu mstanc e if she is an abl e to say yes it 's rape and able I don't care how deep I don 't care wha t it no man ha s a right to put h is hand on a woman without her knowing consent period that 's a beaut that's written even about anyway. You kno w he said that Mex ico Me xican pres ident. 1st of all I thi nk it is sham eful 3 fur that's your state or any state like t hat number one and th en you know what he did then instead of doing the on e thing that does make a differen ce and can h elp is maki ng sure Medicaid is availab le he want to cut it then he want to also make it work so that w e cut the health care bene fits across th e board. In the end lo ok folks there is a lot th at can be don e when I you know there's a whole lot of talk about you know you know Biden and the crim e bill Bi den wrote a cri me bill it 3 big things in it $11.00 3rd of it $100000000 00.00 was for preve ntion I don't k now that somebody old enou gh I got made fun of because they said Biden spend the m oney not fighting crime on prevention and they had thes e ads of people da ncing and to ch oose these bi g guys around that's all by midnight b asketball last 2nd piece of it was a significan t investment in dealing with ratio nal gun policy without viola ting th e 2nd and we elimin ated assau lt weapons we' re in a position wh ere we limit the numb er of. Bullets can be in a magaz ine background check s what had o ccurred bef ore etc And the 3rd thing wa s the Violence Against Women Act And but i n the pro cess of that we also set up drug cou rts so that we could divert people they should be in treatment not in jail treatment not in jail thank you very much thanks Secondly where we invest a grea t deal more n ot only in the rese arch to be able to get b ette r meds to deal w ith you and your whatever that problem is but we should be gauging in a way where we inves t the commun ity be they have the res our ces to provide for this treat ment and p rev ention physician s and I can lay out if you're in a mouse send yo u a lay out f or you exactly wh at all that means and how you do it programat ic like but I am so pr oud of you I don't even know you are so proud thank 2 things 1 . 111 p lace we still have a lot of work to do and I speak yo u know.

[CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY MISSED HIS LEADERSHIP, THEY MISSED HIS KINDNESS, THE WAY HE INSPIRES US TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT THE BEST THINGS ARE AHEAD OF US. [APPLAUSE] HIS ABILITY TO FACE TRAGEDY, AND NEVER GIVE IN OR UP. HIS CHARACTER, HIS LOVE OF OUR NATION. AGAIN AND AGAIN, PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME, JOE IS THE ONE WHO CAN MOVE US FORWARD. JOE IS THE ONE WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER. WE NEED HIM. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? I AGREE. I MISS THAT FEELING OF HOPE, AND OPTIMISM. YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY WE BEGIN TO RESTORE THAT FEELING. [APPLAUSE] THIS MOMENT DEFINES WHO WE ARE. IT IS A MOMENT THAT WE NEED TO HEAR YOUR VOICES, A MOMENT WHEN WE NEED LEADERS WITH VISION, AND CHARACTER. IT IS A MOMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A MOMENT FOR JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE STARTING AN ENORMOUS JOURNEY TODAY, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS READY. WE WILL DO THIS, AS WE ALWAYS HAVE, AS A FAMILY. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU ARE WITH US TOO. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW THAT EVERY PERSON WHO TOLD ME THAT THEY WANTED JOE TO RUN WILL DO THEIR PART. YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS, TEXT YOUR FRIENDS, KNOCK ON DOORS, GET THEM TO THE POLLS. WE NEED YOU. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP. TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD THIS MOVEMENT, AND TOGETHER WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE KNOWN HIM, JOE HAS NEVER GIVEN UP, NEVER FAILED TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY, AND NEVER HAD ANY DOUBTS ON WHO HE IS FIGHTING FOR. AS LONG AS HE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING THIS NATION, I KNOW, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY, SO LET US DO THIS. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME, MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING] (music) [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""JOE""] (music) THANK YOU. [CHEERING] EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JILL IS A PHILADELPHIA GIRL. SHE LOVES THE CITY, I DO TOO. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE WHEN I DIE, PHILADELPHIA WILL BE WRITTEN ON MY HEART. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I THINK SHE MADE A GREAT SECOND LADY AND SHE WILL MAKE ONE HECK OF A FIRST LADY. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA. TODAY, PHILADELPHIA. THIS IS JUST GETTING STARTED. NO ONE IS GOING TO WORK LONGER, CAMPAIGN HARDER TO WIN YOUR HEARTS, TRUST, AND SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] PICK UP YOUR PHONE, NOW. SEND A TEXT TO , WITH THE WORD UNITED TO THE NUMBER 30330. THAT IS UNITED TO 30330. EITHER WAY. YOU'VE GOT IT. LOOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHY WE BEGIN THIS JOURNEY IN THIS PLACE. LET IT GO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] I MADE A PLEDGE THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME SPEAK ILL OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE LITERAL SENSE, THIS WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT WAS HERE, THE FACT IS TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WERE WRITTEN HERE. 17 76, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. THAT , THESE WORDS ARE THE AMERICAN CREED. EQUITY, FAIRNESS, DECENTLY, AMERICA HELD UP THAT PROMISE FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME. WE WERE BORN OF THE IDEA THAT EVERY SINGLE, SOLITARY PERSON SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THEY CANNOT DO IF THEY WORK AT IT. [APPLAUSE] AN EIGHT , IN 1787, THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, WE THE PEOPLE. THIS WORD CHANGED EVERYTHING. CONGRESS REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE NOT THE GOVERNMENT. FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT, ALL PROTECTED. WE BECAME THE MODEL FOR THE WORLD. BOTH DOCUMENTS THERE IS A SINGULAR WORD. WE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE, THE PEOPLE. BOTH WERE STATEMENTS OF A COMMON PURPOSE. A PURPOSE OF ONE PEOPLE, ONE NATION. OUR CONSTITUTION DOESN'T BEGIN WITH THE PHRASE WE THE DEMOCRATS, WE THE REPUBLICANS. IT DOESN'T BEGIN WITH THE PHRASE WE, THE DONORS. IT BEGAN WITH THE PHRASE THAT STANDS FOR WALK , WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. REMEMBER THAT. I DO MORE THAN ANY TIME OF OUR CAREER. OUR POLITICS HAVE BECOME SO ANGRY. AND SO UNPRODUCTIVE, INSTEAD OF DEBATING WE DEMONIZE. INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING JUDGMENT WE QUESTION THEIR MOTIVES. INSTEAD OF LISTENING, WE SHOUT. WE LOOK TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. BUT, NO MORE. [APPLAUSE] THIS POLITICS IS PULLING US APART AND RIPPING THIS COUNTRY APART AT THE SEAMS. POLITICS IN TODAY TRAFFICS IN DIVISION AND OUR PRESIDENT IS THE DIVIDER IN CHIEF. HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE, FAR FROM IT. HE PRACTICES THE WORST POLITICS THAT SCAPEGOATS AND DEMONIZES. HE HOLDS OUT THE OTHERS AS A SOURCE OF ALL OUR PROBLEMS. THE IMMIGRANTS, MUSLIMS, ANYONE DIFFERENT IN CREED AND COLOR. THAT HAS BEEN A SCHEME USED BY POLITICIANS FOR DECADES. IT COMES AT A GIGANTIC COST. IT WEAKENS US, DISTRACTS US AND DIVIDES US. IT CAUSES US TO LOSE CREDIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. IT SOLVES NOTHING. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. I ABSOLUTELY REJECT IT. [APPLAUSE] IN THIS COUNTRY WE ARE ALL TOGETHER IN THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT FOR EQUALITY AND DECENCY. WE HAVE NOT LIVED UP TO IT, BUT WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON IT. EVERYONE , THAT IS WHY WE ARE A BEACON OF HOPE. THAT IS WHY THE WORLD HAS ALWAYS LOOKED AT US, UNLESS WE HAVE BURNED SOMETHING. AMERICA IS UNIQUE IN ALL OF THE WORLD. AMERICA IS AN IDEA, AN IDEA IS STRONGER THAN ANY ARMIES, BIGGER THAN ANY OCEAN, MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR IN CHINA. IT OFFERS HOPE TO THE DYING, THE POOR, THE HUNGRY MASSES. IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. WE SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT. AMERICA GUARANTEES EVERYONE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. AMERICA GIVES HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE, AND THAT IS WHO WE ARE. I BELIEVE AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SPECIAL. AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN BEST WHEN IT HAS ACTED AS ONE AMERICA. ONE AMERICA MIGHT BE A SIMPLE MOTION, DOES , IT DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY LESS PROFOUND. IT HAS TO COME TOGETHER. WE STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN, I SAID I WAS RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS. THE FIRST IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. THE THIRD, TO UNITE THIS NATION. ONE AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW SOME OF THE REALLY SMART FOLKS SAID THAT DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT UNITY. THE DEMOCRATS ARE SO ANGRY, THE ANGRIER THAT CANDIDATE COULD BE THE BETTER CHANCE TO WIN THE NOMINATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS WANT TO UNIFY THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , IF AMERICA WANTS TO ADD MORE DIVISIONS, TO DEMONIZE YOUR OPPONENT, THEY HAVE GOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT TAKING THE COUNTRY BACK TO A PAST THAT NEVER WAS, BUT A FUTURE THAT FILLED ITS FULL POTENTIAL. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT BIDEN DOES NOT GET IT, HE CANNOT WORK WITH REPUBLICANS ANYMORE, THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. I'M GOING TO SAY SOME THING OUTRAGEOUS. I KNOW HOW TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK. [APPLAUSE] NOT BECAUSE I AM TALKED OR TWEETED ABOUT IT, BUT BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT. I HELPED MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK. I CAN DO THAT AGAIN AND HERE IS HOW. COMPROMISE IT SELF IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. CONSENSUS IS NOT A WEAKENSS, IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT WAS DESIGNED IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES CONSENSUS. I DIDN'T WHEN I WAS A SENATOR. IT WAS WHAT I DID AS A VICE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST, CIVIL LIBERTIES, VOTING RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. A CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE THERE IS ONLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK WILL DO. WE HAVE TO ASK REPUBLICANS TO ASK , TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO PASS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. [APPLAUSE] WHICH REMINDS ME, WE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT OFTEN SAY ENOUGH AS A NATION. BARACK OBAMA WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. [APPLAUSE] HE IS A PRESIDENT THAT ARE CHILDREN DEAD AND , OUR C HILDREN DID AND SHOULD LOOK UP TO. [APPLAUSE] OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT, IT WAS DONE BY BARACK OBAMA WITHOUT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW HOW TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH THE GOP, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE, AND IT CANNOT BE ON EVERY SINGLE ISSUE. LOOK AT THE RECOVERY ACT. THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT IS A BIG REASON THAT WE HAVE 10 YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED ECONOMIC GROWTH. [APPLAUSE] WE NEEDED REPUBLICANS TO GET IT PASSED. IT WAS MY JOB TO FIND THEM, PERSUADE THEM. I DID, THEY DID, AND THE COUNTRY WAS BETTER THAN EVER. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN , THOSE ARE THE FACTS, NOT THE ALTERNATIVE FACTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HURTING THE ECONOMY, , INHERITED THE ECONOMY FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THE CREPERIE ACT , THE RECOVERY ACT SAVED THE STATES. WE HAVE TO GET THE WORK DONE, WE HAD TO BRING REPUBLICANS A WRONG , ALONG BECAUSE IF WE HAD NOT DONE IT WE WOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. SO, FOLKS WORKING TOGETHER MATTERS. IT MATTERS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT GOVERNMENT TO WORK. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT CANNOT BE DONE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THIS. THE COUNTRY IS SICK OF DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE SICK OF THE FIGHTING. THEY ARE SICK OF THE BEHAVIOR. ALL THEY WANT IS FOR THEIR PRESIDENT, SENATORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES TO DO THEIR JOBS. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, ABOVE ALL, TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO MEASURES HIS OR HER DAYS I THE PEOPLE HE BRINGS TOGETHER , BY THE PEOPLE HE BRINGS TOGETHER RATHER THAN THE DIVISION THAT HE SOWS. YOU KNOW THERE IS SERIOUS WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE, BUT IT IS NOT BEING DONE BY A PRESIDENT WHO WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WAKES THE WORLD LIKE THE GUY WITH THE WHISTLE BACK THERE. HIS CLINICAL OPPONENTS KNOW HIS PERSONAL GRIEVANCES. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT WAITING PERIOD CHINA IS BUILDING 5G, AND MASTERING AI. THEY ARE REWRITING THE RULES OF THE INTERNET. THEY ARE MOVING INTO AREAS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ABANDONED BY US. THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS NOT GIVEN UP ON THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORDS. THEY ARE PUSHING IT. [APPLAUSE] THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE FACE IN THE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, CLEAN ENERGY, A WARMING PLANET. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT BUILDING A WALL CAN ADDRESS IN ANY OF THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED THE 21ST STEP , CENTURY STRATEGY FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP USES IS OUT OF THE PAST. WE HAVE TO GET FOCUSED. FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL MAKE THAT IS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE EDUCATION THEY NEED IN THE 21ST CENTURY. ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY I WILL GIVE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. [APPLAUSE] THEY CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. SO I WILL TRY TO FIX IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""WE WANT JOE""] PARENTS WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE. NOW WE NEED TO GO TO THIS. WE SHOULD NOT TEAR IT DOWN. TO ME, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE BEST WAY TO GET HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD NOT ONLY GREENER ROADS AND HIGHWAYS, BUT TWEEDY'S , BUT TREATIES. WE CAN DO IT MORE RATIONALLY. WE CAN DO A LOT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO PROTECT THE NATION FROM CYBER ATTACKS. WE NEED SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY ACROSS THOSE SAME LINES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. LET US START , STOP FIGHTING AND START INKING. WE CAN ONLY DO IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NOT MUCH TIME LEFT, WE NEED A GREEN ENERGY REVOLUTION AND WE NEED IT NOW. WE NEED TO START NOW. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE SAY JOBS AND GREEN ENERGY DO NOT GO TOGETHER, BUT THEY DO. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET IT DONE. EVEN NOW, SOME OF THOSE SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE REALIZING, THE GAS, OIL INDUSTRY, THEY ARE SAYING MR. PRESIDENT , THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE UNDERWATER. NOT A JOKE. THE OIL INDUSTRY SAID , AGREED. THEY DID NOT EVEN , WHO IS HE TRYING TO PLEASE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS GOING TO LEAD. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FIRST AND MOST IN THIRD , IMPORTANT THING, BEAT FROM. , TRUMP./ [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING HOPE FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DIVIDED. THAT CAP , GAP IS GIVING RIDE TO THE WORST ELEMENTS ON EITHER SIDE. PEOPLE COME OUT FROM UNDER ROCKS AND SAY IT WOULD NOT BE AS BAD AS TWO YEARS AGO. OUR DEMOCRACY IS A MISTAKE. NO MORE. OUR DEMOCRACY IS REAL. I AM NOT JOKING. THERE ARE SO MANY DIVISIONS. THEY ARE UNDERCUTTING EVERYTHING THAT WAS DESIGNED. ALL OF THIS IN ORDER TO SOLIDIFY HIS BASE AND EXPAND HIS POWER. JUST THINK ABOUT IT. THE ATTACKS ON THE FREE PRESS, IT IS NOTHING THAT IS CENTS. THEY ARE TIRED , TYRANTS ARE USING THE SAME LANGUAGE, AND HE USED IT TO SOLIDIFY HIS OWN POWER. HE IS SAYING YOU CANNOT TRUST BECAUSE , I AM SAYING THAT CANNOT BE AMERICA. FOLKS, IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT, PLACING HIM A BUT OF THE LAW. BY THE WAY, WITHOUT A WHIMPER FROM THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER. [BOOING] [APPLAUSE] THEY UNDERMINED OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA. ARE WE A NATION THAT BELIEVES THERE IS A MORAL PRIVILEGE AND ENCOURAGE THOSE LIKE THE NAZIS. TRUMP DOES. ARE WE A NATION WHO BELIEVES WE SHOULD TEAR CHILDREN FROM THE ARMS OF PARENTS. WE DO NOT. BUT TRUMP DOES. EVERY DAY WE ARE REMINDED ABOUT WHAT THESE ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. EVERY DAY WE ARE REMINDED THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. WE HAVE TO EARN IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ONLY 140 MILES FROM GETTYSBURG. PERHAPS ONE OF THEM BOAST , IN THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS LINCOLN HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE LIVING. HE SAID THIS WILL BE DEDICATED TO THE GREAT MEN. BY THE GOVERNMENT OF, AND BY THE PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THIS HAS GONE DOWN TO EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS. IT IS THE BEST ABOVE ALL OTHERS, THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS , WE WILL NOT LET THE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE PERISH. WILL YOU LET THAT HAPPEN? I WILL NOT, YOU WILL NOT. [APPLAUSE] IT WILL NOT BE FINISHED ON MY WATCH, OR YOURS. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE FACING THE BIGGEST THREAT ANY OF US HAS FACED. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A FUTURE THAT IS MORE PROMISING. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN HE IS. WE NEED TO BE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. OTHER WORLD LEADERS KNOW IT. BUT NOT , BUT NOT US. OUR WORKFORCE IS THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESOURCES IN THIS STUDY, IN THIS STATE , THIS CITY AND THIS STATE THEY AND ALL OF THE WORLD COMBINED. [APPLAUSE] NO OTHER NATION CAN MATCH US. IF WE CAN LEAD BY OUR EXAMPLE, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. WE WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE WILL LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR. UNITY OVER DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.

CSPANJB11620197	Joe Biden	2019-06-11	Joe Biden Campaign Rally in Davenport, Iowa	"ANOTHER VALUABLE LESSON OF FREE TRADE. MY BACKGROUND IS, I HAVE THINGS IN ECONOMICS, I COULD MAKE THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE USING WINE AND LEMON. I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON WHEN I GOT TO CONGRESS. A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED ME. CLASSIC REPUBLICAN LIBERAL FREE TRADER. HE CALLED ME AND SAID I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM, HE SAID SELLING COTTON INTO PAKISTAN.'S ORDER BOOK WENT TO 0. HE CALLED THEM AND SAID WHY AREN'T YOU BUYING MY COTTON? HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT SELL IT TO THEM AT TWO DOLLARS PER POUND. I FORGET THE NUMBER BUT IT WAS LESS THAN THE RAW COST FOR COTTON IN THE U.S. THE RAW COST FOR COTTON IN THE U.S. HE SAID WELL THEY CAN DO THAT THEY CALLED THE UFT R WHICH IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT. THEY WERE DOING THIS WITH IN VIOLATION OF AGREEMENT. THEY CALLED THE 24 HOURS LATER AND SAID WE ARE SORRY WE CAN'T HELP YOU. THE GUY SAYS WHY NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO RUN DOWN A CHECKLIST IN THE FIRST CALL THEY MADE WAS THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS WE HAVE BIGGER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT. IS THAT FREE TRADE? IS THAT FAIR TRADE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS FREE TRADE IS YOU DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF I DON'T TOUCH YOUR STUFF LET'S GO. THERE'S NO SUBSIDIES, THERE'S NO TARIFFS, LET'S JUST DO THIS, OKAY? LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT ONLY EXISTS, TRULY IN ONE PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD, THAT'S WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE 50 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. JIM IS A GREAT-GREAT FRIEND, I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. AND FORMER MAYOR BILL, ARE YOU HERE BILL? ALL RIGHT MAYOR, OKAY. [ APPLAUSE ] AND ROXANNE. ROXANNE? I LOVE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THAT OLD EXPRESSION, GOD MADE MAN THEN HE MADE SOME FIREFIGHTERS. THING GOD. THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO WOULD RUN INTO FIRES. I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN WASHINGTON AND OTHER PLACES. THEY'VE ENDORSED ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM. FIREFIGHTERS, THEY HAVE NOT ONLY SAVED MY LIFE, THEY GAVE ME ABOUT A 30% CHANCE OF LIVING THEY GOT ME DOWN. THEY BROUGHT ME TO A NEUROSURGEON FOR A 13 HOUR OPERATION IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOWSTORM AND SAVED MY LIFE. SO MANY OF YOU WERE NICE TO ME AFTER I WAS ELECTED THE FIRST TIME. THE JAWS OF LIFE FREED MY TWO BOYS, MY WIFE WAS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER. THE JAWS OF LIFE GOT THEM TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME AND SAVED THEM. I WAS DOWN AND DEPRESSED ONE DAY, I WAS AT MY HOME. THEY WENT IN. IT WAS TERRIBLE. THEY GOT MY WIFE OUT. SHE SAID THEY SAVED OUR CAT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, IT REALLY IS. NOW WE ARE BOTH IN TOWN TODAY. OR AT LEAST IN THE STATE TODAY. IT WASN'T PLANNED THAT WAY BUT I HOPE THAT TRUMPS PRESIDENTS, THERE'S MAY BE A CLARIFYING MOMENT FOR US ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AMERICA'S FARMERS HAVE BEEN CRUSHED BY THE TARIFFS IN CHINA AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE IN IOWA. HE THINKS HE'S BEING TOUGH, HE'S BEING TOUGH. IF HE IS BEING TOUGH WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS FEELING THE PAIN, HOW MANY ACROSS THE NATION HAD THE PROSPECTS OF LOSING THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THESE TRUMP TARIFFS ? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE THEY GONE TO BED STANDING AT THE CEILING WONDERING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR IF THEY WOULD MAKE IT? HOW ABOUT MANUFACTURING? TRUMPS TARIFFS AND TRADE WARS, THAT'S HARD A LOT OF MANUFACTURERS. WITHIN THE MIDST OF THIS. ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS, YOU KNOW I WAS BLAMED FOR PUSHING THE BAILOUT OF GENERAL MOTORS. BUT THAT WAS ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE RESCUE OF THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] WE KNEW THAT IT MEANT MILLIONS OF JOBS IN THE AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES AND SUPPLY CHAINS, IT ALSO MEANT THE PRIDE OF THE NATION WAS AT STAKE AS WELL. NOW, WATCHING TRUMP DESTROY THE INDUSTRY THAT THE PRESIDENT HELPED SAVE HIS DISCOURAGING. I DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY GETS THE BASICS . HE THINKS THAT THESE TARIFFS ARE BEING PAID BY CHINA JUST LIKE HE THINKS MEXICO IS BUILDING THE WALL. [ APPLAUSE ] JOE, THE KIND. I KEEP THINKING OF MY MOTHER. ANYWAY. CHINA IS MAKING MASSIVE INVESTMENTS INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS WELL AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, FIVE AS WELL AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, 5G, WHILE HE IS TWEETING THEY AREN'T SITTING STILL, NO OTHER COUNTRY IS. THEY ARE MOVING. WHILE HE'S NAME-CALLING THEY ARE BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILS. TRUMP IS PURSUING DAMAGE AND THIS ERRATIC WAR ON TRADE WITHOUT A REAL STRATEGY. THAT IS THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST. CHINA'S POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO LEAD THE WORLD IN RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT IS JUST BIZARRE, WHILE CHINA IS PRESSING THEIR ADVANTAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE NEED THE REST OF THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH US DEALING WITH CHINA AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE WESTERN PART OF THEIR COUNTRY I MEAN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. BUT NOTHING IS SET. AND SO YOU BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT CHINA. KEEP FOLLOWING A PATH THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS US ON. IF WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE AT HOME, IF WE STAND UP FOR AMERICA'S INTEREST, IF WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, WITH OUR LIVES AND OUR VALUES, WITH THE WORK OF OUR PARTNERS, WE COULD OUTCOMPETE ANYONE IN THE WORLD. NOBODY ELSE COULD COMPETE WITH US. THEY CAN'T. THAT'S NOT THE PROGRAM. THEY REALLY CAN'T. I HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN WORKERS. WE ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE, OUR INGENUITY AND OUR RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITIES. WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES. HERE WE ARE, EVERY MAJOR NEW INITIATIVE. WE OWN THEM, WE HAVE THESE GREAT LABS. THEY ARE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. WE SHOULD ON THE 21st CENTURY, LET'S INVEST IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHY , [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHY PROPOSE TO RESTORE INITIATIVES IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CUTTING- EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, A WORKFORCE THAT WILL HELP US WORK AND COMPETE. WE MAKE THIS INVESTMENT AND WE COULD CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, IT'S NOT INCONSISTENT WITH WHO WE ARE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO. LET'S BUILD THE UNITED FRONT OF OUR EYE LIES WHO CHALLENGE THEIR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. TRUMP IS ATTACKING THE VERY PARTNERS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH CHINA. WE NEED TO RALLY HALF OF THE WORLD ECONOMY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CHEATING. SPEAKING OUT ON THEIR REPRESSION. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING? WE ARE ALIENATING THOSE ALLIES. WHAT ARE WE DOING? IT MAKES NO SENSE. AND LOOK, LET'S TIGHTEN UP OUR DEFENSES SO THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GETTING AND GIVING AWAY TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA. AND HAVING IT STOLEN. THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. DURING THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WE GOT THEM TO CUT CYBER CUTS BUT NOW IT'S GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS REAL SIMPLE. WHEN THEY SAID THERE WAS AN ERROR IDENTIFICATION ZONE AND NO ONE COULD FLY TO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA I SAID WE AREN'T GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THESE. WE ARE GOING TO FLY THROUGH IT. WE FLEW B-52S THROUGH IT. THAT'S IT. YOU WANT TO STEAL OUR PROPERTY? YOU SAY YOU HAVE HALF OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS TO OUR PROPERTY? GUESS WHAT, YOU CAN'T TRADE HERE UNLESS YOU DO THE SAME INSTEAD OF PUT TARIFFS ON WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THESE BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO COOPERATE WHERE WE HAVE A COMMON INTEREST. THE CHINESE AGREED TO IT THE FIRST TIME TO LIMIT THEIR CARBON POLLUTION. WE HAVE TO REJOIN THE PARIS PEACE ACCORD. THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, WHAT DID WE DO? WE STEPPED AWAY. MY LORD, YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, THERE'S A LOT MORE WE COULD DO ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND NUCLEAR WEAPON INITIATIVES WHERE THERE IS A COMMON INTEREST BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, IT ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, TRUMP MAKES THE WRONG CHOICES. HE'S MOTIVATED BY THE WRONG THINGS.'S DENIAL OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS IGNORANCE OF THE DEVASTATING LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF TARIFFS AND WE ARE GOING TO BANKRUPT THE FARM BELT. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE SEEING DEVASTATING FLOODS, I NEED NOT TELL YOU, BEING IN FARMS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE HEARTLAND RIGHT HERE IN DAVENPORT, I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. I CANCELED BECAUSE YOU HAD THIS GOD-AWFUL FLOODING EVENT. THERE WERE FLOODED STREETS, IT DISRUPTED LIVES AND BUSINESSES. RECORD FLOOD LEVELS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE AS WELL AS CLEANUP. DEVASTATION IN THE HEARTLAND, IT WOULD BE RECORD-BREAKING EVEN WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING SUPPORT FOR FARMERS AND FARMERS WHO AREN'T ALONE. THE ECONOMY OF OUR CITIES AND SMALL TOWN RELIES ON BEING ABLE TO SELL THE CROPS AROUND THE WORLD. LOOK FOLKS, STILL, WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE DENIES CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT DID HE TELL PIERS MORGAN IN AN INTERVIEW RECENTLY? HE SAID WELL, WHETHER GOES BOTH WAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES BUT WHETHER GOES BOTH WAYS . THIS REMINDS ME WHEN HE TWEETED IN THE WINTER. TWEET IN THE WINTER IT SAID, IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, BLESS ME FATHER FOR I HAVE SINNED. HOW ABOUT WHEN HE SAID, NO GET THIS ONE. I WENT OUT AND HE SAID DEVASTATING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA, COUNTIES ALL ACROSS THE WEST, DEVASTATED, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PUT IN HARM'S WAY. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID THOSE CALIFORNIA FIRES, THEY JUST NEED TO RAKE THEIR LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT JOKING OR MAKING THIS UP. HE COULD BE A STAND UP COMIC IF THIS WEREN'T SO TRUE. LOOK, IF THIS WASN'T SO SERIOUS IT WOULD BE ANOTHER RICH GUY PLAYING APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN TWEETING ABOUT SCIENTISTS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, IT WOULDN'T MATTER, BUT HE IS THE PRESIDENT. [ APPLAUSE ] LOOK , WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO CONFRONT THIS CLIMATE CHANGE, I BLEED OUT THE DETAIL PLAN I LAID OUT A DETAILED PLAN. INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT WHO GIVES THIS AWAY, GIVES $2.6 MILLION WORTH OF WAIVERS TO LET EXXON AND CHEVRON REFINERIES GET OUT OF USING RENEWABLE FUEL, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PARTNER WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS, EXPANDING THE MARKET FOR ETHANOL AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUEL. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION, WE NEED TO BUILD CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA AND IN THE 21st CENTURY RAILROAD SYSTEM. WHAT ARE WE DOING? THINK ABOUT IT. I MEAN IT'S LIKE, PUTTING AMERICA ON THE COURSE OF BEING CLEAN AIR EFFICIENT. INSTEAD HE PULLED AMERICA OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE, HE JUST TRIED TO MUSCLE THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO PREVENT HIM FROM DISCUSSING CLIMATE SCIENCE. BEFORE THE CONGRESS. HE THINKS THAT WINDMILLS CAUSE CANCER. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. I KNOW. ON APRIL 2 HE SAID, ""IF YOU'RE IN A WINDMILL, CONGRATULATION, YOUR HOUSE WENT DOWN 75% IN VALUE, AND THEY SAY THE NOISE CAUSES CANCER."" LOOK, WE KNOW ABOUT CANCER, A LOT OF US. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE? WHAT DO YOU DO? AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS JOINED TOGETHER, ALIENS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH IN DEALING WITH CANCER ITSELF. THE FIRST THING WE DID. THE FIRST BUDGET HE PROPOSED, IT WAS TO CUT $10 MILLION. FOLKS, IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE INVESTED HALF OF THAT TAX CUT HE GAVE. EVEN A 10th OF IT, USING IT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CANCER AND TO END IT AS WE KNOW IT, ALZHEIMER'S, DEALING WITH OBESITY, DEALING WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING. GOD ALMIGHTY, THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR POWER. REMEMBER WHEN THE JUSTICE WAS ACHING SPEAKING ABOUT HEALTH AND TRYING TO DECIDE THAT THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT WAS IN ITS ENTIRETY, UNZIPPED CONSTITUTIONAL UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I CAMPAIGNED FOR OVER 16 DEMOCRATS. RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, THE STATE LEGISLATIVE BODIES, GUESS WHAT? I DID NOT HEAR ANY OF THEM TALKING ABOUT BEING AGAINST REPUBLICANS OR HEALTHCARE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAD ANOTHER CALL. THEY SAW THE LORD. HE APPEARED BEFORE THEM. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL THE SUDDEN EVERYBODY WAS FOR IT. NOW HE BARELY MENTIONS THE FACT THAT HE WANTS TO GUT IT OR GET RID OF IT. HE DOESN'T EVEN TWEET ABOUT IT ANYMORE. HERE KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL GIVE HIM THE SAME THRASHING THEY GAVE THE REPUBLICAN 2018 TRYING TO GET RID OF THE HEALTHCARE ACT. GUESS WHAT? I'VE BECOME THIS PARTY NOMINEE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET. DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR POTENTIAL FOR THESE CONDITIONS. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEIR KID GETS TO STAY ON THE PARENTS PLAN UNTIL THEY ARE AGE 26. I WILL NOT LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET IT IS BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE GAINED HEALTHCARE. MORE THAN ONE THING. ONE MORE THING, WHAT AMAZES ME, THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. THEY DIDN'T. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING, NOT A JOKE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE HAVE NEVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. NOT ONCE. ALL THEY ASK FOR IS A SHOT. JUST A SHOT. I'M ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT MIDDLE CLASS AND I TELL YOU WHAT, I KNOW WHO BUILT THE COUNTRY AND I KNOW ONE MORE THING, THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS WITH ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY. WHENEVER THE COUNTRY GOES THROUGH A CRISIS IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT WE HAVE, THINGS BEGAN TO PRAY. THE FIRST TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA IT'S SHRINKING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE NOW, MANY OF YOU KNOW THEM AND THEY MIGHT BE SOME OF YOU, YOU GOT A BILL FOR $400, YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW TO PAY IT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOEY REMEMBER WHEN WE MOVED, YOU'D THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE WITH A WOOD BUCKET ON MY HEAD BUT WE MOVED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WORK AND BY THE WAY HE SAID BY THE WAY HE ABANDONED YOU. I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. I LEFT WITH MY DAD. I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T STAY. BUT I WENT HOME EVERY SUMMER. I WENT BACK FOR CHRISTMAS AND EASTER. I TRIED. YELLOW YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T GET STARTED. LOOK, THE TAX CUT HE PASSED. FOR MULTIMILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. GUESS WHAT? WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THAT'S GONE. IT'S GONE. LOOK, YOU REALIZE WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT THERE WERE ABOUT $800 BILLION IN CAST TAX EXPENDITURES, THINGS WE DON'T COLLECT TAXES ON. LOOPHOLES. GUESS WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? $1 TRILLION, $400 BILLION, YOU CAN'T FIND ME AN ECONOMIST ANYWHERE IN THE STATE THAT WILL SAY THERE'S JUSTIFICATION SOCIAL POLITICALLY OR IN ANY ECONOMIC REGION FOR AT LEAST 500 ALIEN DOLLARS OF THAT MONEY. IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO. WE DON'T HAVE TO HURT ANYBODY, WE DON'T HAVE TO PUNISH ANYBODY INCLUDING THE RICH. BUT EVERYONE SHOULD START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHOULD I BECOME PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF $100 BILLION IN TAX REFORM. THERE'S NO RATIONALE. I WILL BUILD THE ECONOMY THAT DOESN'T JUST REWARD WEALTH BUT I'M BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK. WORK. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK, I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST THE WEALTHY BUT THEY KNOW THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER TAX BREAK. THEY KNOW WHAT. I'M LOOKING TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, AN ECONOMY THAT RESTORES THE DIGNITY OF WORK, HOW COULD YOU AS A PERSON BUSTING YOUR NECK OUT THERE IN YOUR JOBS, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DIGNITY IF YOU CAN'T PROVIDE FOR THE BASICS FOR YOUR FAMILY? FOR HEALTHCARE? FOR EDUCATION? FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. MY DAD USED TO SAY, MIDDLE- CLASS, IT'S NOT BEING ABLE , THICK DID WELL ENOUGH THEY COULD GO TO SCHOOL AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. WHETHER IT WAS TRADE SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHETHER IT WAS FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, 65, 100 JOBS TODAY REQUIRES SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. THE FACT IS, I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, WE COULD OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENCY, I THINK WE COULD OVERCOME IT. A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FOREVER CHANGE AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION. I REALLY MEAN THAT. THIS IS BEYOND THE ISSUES. I BELIEVE THAT TRUMP CLOSES THE FUNDAMENTAL THREAT FOR AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] THE CORE VALUES, WHAT WE STAND FOR, WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE BELIEVE, LET'S START WITH CHARLOTTESVILLE. I WOULD NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THAT COMING AS A KID OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, I DID NOT THINK I WOULD SEE THAT URIC NEO-NAZIS LIGHTING TORCHES. HE SAW IT, THEIR CONTORTED FACES, FILLED WITH HATE. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC THREATS. THAT'S OKAY. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP RALLY. AND THESE FOLKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AS WELL AS BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. DECENT PEOPLE HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST HATE, WHAT HAPPENED? HE ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT HE THOUGHT. HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. NO JOKE. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LOOK, LATER WHEN HE REALIZED WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS GETTING SOME HEAT. HE SAID THOSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO MARCH TO PROTECT A STATUTE A CONFEDERATE STATUE. HE'S YET TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT HE SAID. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. VIOLENCES COMPLICITY, LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING, LOOK AT WHERE WE SEE, LOOKING AT THESE POLICIES TAKING KIDS FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS PUTTING THEM LITERALLY, IN CAGES, THOUSANDS OF THEM. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO THE WORLD? WHO WE ARE, FOLKS LOOK, THE PHRASE WE HOLD THESE WHO ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL. IT'S THE AMERICAN CREED, IT'S WHO WE ARE, IT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN. WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS LIVED UP TO IT THAT WE NEVER FULLY ABANDONED IT. WE NEVER STOP TRYING TO CREATE A MORE PERFECT UNION. IT IS THE AMERICAN CREED BUT TRUMP DOES NOT SEE IT THAT WAY. HE SAYS WHEN WE TALK THAT WAY IT MAKES US WEAK THAT HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT MAKES A STRONG. WHAT MAKES US STRONG AS A NATION IS OUR HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING ONE WITH DIGNITY. I REALLY MEAN THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] DEMONIZING NO ONE. LET THE POOR, NOT THE MUSLIM, NOT THEM POWERLESS, NOT THE IMMIGRANTS, WE GIVE HATE NO SAFE HARBOR BUT NOW, IT'S BEEN GIVEN CREDIBILITY. PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS AND SAYING AND DOING THINGS THAT NEVER WOULD BE ACCEPTED BEFORE. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BUT IT IS REAL. AND AGAIN, NOT A JOKE, OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. LOOK, UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. WE ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE'VE ALWAYS KNOW THAT. DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT? OKAY? LOOK EVERYWHERE WE TURN, IT'S CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SHREDDING WHAT WE MOST BELIEVE. WE BELIEVE, I HAVE THE BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO RESTORE THE BASIC VALUES WE STAND FOR. WE ARE NOT LED BY JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD COMES TO US THAT'S WHY MANY PEOPLE FLOCK HERE. THAT IS WHY AMERICA IS AN IDEA. IT'S NOT A JOKE. IT'S THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA IN ALL OF HISTORY. AND IT IS BEING DAMAGED AROUND THE WORLD. TRUMP ATTENDED THE 75th ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT SYMBOL IN THE WORLD OF THE IMPORTANCE OF AMERICAN ALLIANCES, IT WAS AFTER THAT WAR THAT MANY OF YOUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND OTHERS AND GRANDPARENTS GAVE THEIR LIVES. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER? WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE NO LONGER GOING TO ALLOW FOR THE ABUSE OF POWER FOR ANYONE NATION. SO THAT'S WHEN WE FORMED NATO SO THAT NO ONE NATION COULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND ABUSE POWER LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE THROUGHOUT HISTORY IN EUROPE AT LEAST TWICE IN THAT CENTURY. MAN, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS DONALD TRUMP DONE? DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID A FEW WORDS ABOUT NATO THIS TIME. THEY ARE COMPLETELY AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID AND DONE INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW HE MADE WITH FOX NEWS BEFORE HIS INJURES BEFORE HIS SPEECH. TO THREATEN TO LEAVE NATO. HE TALKED ABOUT THE OBSOLESCENCE OF IT, HE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE SAME REASON, THE WHOLE RATIONALE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION. WAS FOR ONE NATION TO DOMINATE THAT REGION. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THEY ARE THE ENEMY. THEY ARE THE ENEMY. DID HE DO ANYTHING THAT HE'S PREPARED TO SIGNAL HER WALK AWAY FROM THE THUGS AND DICTATORS THAT HE HAS EMBRACED ON THE WORLD STAGE? STANDING BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND TURNING TO A DICTATOR LIKE PUTIN AND SAYING I BELIEVE HIM RATHER THAN ALL OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES? NOT ONLY IS THIS UNBELIEVABLE BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES TO OUR ALLIES WHO, IN FACT, SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES? IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS I DON'T BELIEVE THEM, MUELLER, IT JEOPARDIZES OUR SECURITY, IT'S NOT A JOKE. HE EMBRACES THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER WHO IS A THUG AND A MURDERER. HE HAD HIS UNCLES BRAINS BLOWN OUT. I'M NOT JOKING. AND BY THE WAY, I WAS PLEASED TO KNOW THAT HIS ALLIANCE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, THEY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT. BY THE WAY, HE QUOTED IT. HE QUOTED HIM WHILE HE WAS THERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HE DID NOT DO ANY OF THE RIGHT THINGS INSTEAD OF THAT HE GOES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE HE'S AT NORMANDY, HE TWEETS AN ATTACK ON THAT MIDLER? THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WHO'S THERE WITH HIM AND NORMANDY? A STUNNING DISPLAY OF CHILDISHNESS THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHED. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AGAIN, IT WASN'T JUST WORLD LEADERS WHO ARE WATCHING, IT WAS ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD, LISTENING TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING. LOOK, THE BEHAVIOR, THE CHARACTER OF A PRESIDENT MATTERS A LOT. IT MATTERS WHAT PRESIDENTS SAY. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T SAY OFTEN ENOUGH, BARACK OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT OF EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER AND DECENCY. [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OUR CHILDREN COULD AND DID LOOK UP TO. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR TELEVISION OFF SOMETIMES WHEN HE SPEAKS? I'M NOT JOKING. I KNOW THAT I MISSED THE DINNER THAT WAS HERE WHERE THE NOT LONG AGO I GUESS IT WAS LAST SUNDAY, BECAUSE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. HER BEST FRIEND IS SASHA OBAMA. THEY'VE BEEN TO SCHOOL TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME. SO BARACK AND I AND THE WHOLE FAMILY, WE GOT TOGETHER AFTERWARD TO HAVE A LIGHT LUNCH OR DINNER FOR THE FAMILY. I WATCH HOW THEY LOOK, THEY KNOW WHO THIS MAN WAS. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM. I WAS PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DID TOGETHER, A RECOVERY ACT THAT KEPT US FROM GOING INTO A DEPRESSION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. HEALTHCARE. I'M MOST PROUD OF THE MAN THAT HE WAS AND IS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ APPLAUSE ] HE WAS THINKING , HE WAS SPEAKING, I WAS IN CALIFORNIA SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME. WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE WERE BOTH ASKED COINCIDENTALLY, WHAT WE WERE MOST PROUD OF IN THE ADMINISTRATION. IT TURNS OUT WE SAID THE SAME THING BUT A DIFFERENT WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS MOST PROUD OF? EIGHT YEARS, THERE WASN'T ONE SINGLE HINT OF A SCANDAL. NOT ONE. AND IF YOU DID INSTINCTIVELY MISSED HIM HE REMINDED WHY WE NEED HIM BACK. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP, A THREAT TO UNITED STATES. ATTACKING PRIVATE CITIZENS USING LANGUAGE LIKE TOTAL LOSER. BARACK OBAMA WOULD NOT DO THAT. NO PRESIDENT WOULD DO THAT. MOST TEENAGERS WOULDN'T DO THAT. HE SETTING A STANDARD. THE STANDARD OF CRUDE LANGUAGE AND EMBARRASSING BEHAVIOR THAT IS BURROWING INTO OUR CULTURE, FOR REAL. IT'S IN OUR CULTURE. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET RID OF IT BUT WE MUST. WE MUST. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, FRANKLY, OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK. I DID NOT THINK I WOULD USE THOSE WORDS IN MY LIFETIME BUT IT IS TRUE. EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, TRUMP IS TEARING DOWN THE GUARD RAILS OF DEMOCRACY. TEARING DOWN THE THINGS THAT PREVENT THE ABUSE OF POWER WHETHER IT IS A MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO STRIKE A WOMAN OR CHILD OR EMPLOYER THREATENING WORKERS OR TREATING THEM LIKE DIRT OR AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO RESPECT FOR A RULE OF LAW. FAKE NEWS. ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THESE AREN'T WORDS TO BE LAUGHED AT OR DISMISSED. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD. THINK OF THE DICTATORS USING THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT TRUMP USES TO JUSTIFY THEIR ABUSES OF POWER IN THEIR COUNTRIES. IT'S NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. TRUMP'S GOAL IS SIMPLE. DISCREDIT THE NEWS, DISCREDIT THE FREE PRESS, AND RUN OVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR SAFEGUARDS AND ROUGH SHOTS HIS TACK IS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURTS. WHEN HE SAID A JUDGE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR HEARING WHEN HE DISAGREED WITH THEM. HE'S LOOKING BAD BECAUSE WHERE HE'S LOOKING TO TEAR DOWN THE CONSTRAINTS THE COURTS OF PUT ON HIM. FROM THE FAI TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THINK ABOUT IT. I PRESIDED OVER BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND IS DOING MAJOR INTELLIGENCE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE ABSOLUTELY ABUSES THEM. THEY MAKE MISTAKE, BUT HE MAKES MISTAKES BUT MY LORD, TREATING LIKE THEY ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE DEEP STATE. THE DEEP STATE. IT'S LIKE OUT OF A SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL. AS WELL AS BY THE WAY ATTACKING CONGRESS WHETHER IT'S DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN. HE DOESN'T CARE. IT'S ABOUT BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT CONSTRAIN HIS POWER. HE'S COMPLETELY IGNORING THE LEGITIMACY OF CONGRESS. AND HE'S DOING IT WITH FULL COMPLICITY OF THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS THAT HE KNEW BETTER. THEY KNOW BETTER. THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG. LOOK, IN 2020, WE NOT ONLY HAVE TO REPAIR HIS POLICIES AND VALUES, WE HAVE TO CLEARLY AND FULLY PROJECT OUR OWN SAFETY SAKE, HIS VIEW OF THE PRESIDENCY. , ""I HAVE COMPLETE POWER,"" NO YOU DON'T, DONALD TRUMP. , ""I HAVE ABSOLUTE POWER PEER"" NO YOU DON'T, DONALD TRUMP HERE COULD OR, ""ONLY I CAN FIX IT PURE"" FIX YOURSELF FIRST, DONALD TRUMP. ONE HAS THE PRESIDENT EVER USED THOSE PHRASES? IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR NO PRESIDENT HAS USED THOSE PHRASES. IN A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED TO RESET THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS IN THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT WITHOUT LIMITS. THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK, BUILT BY OUR FOUNDERS IT'S ALLOWING US TO HAVE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND WE ARE GOING TO RUE THE DAY IF WE DECIDE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE DEMOCRACY. I'M OPTIMISTIC. IF I GET ELECTED, WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE I WAS NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I DON'T COME FROM ANY MATERIAL BACKGROUND. RICHARD NIXON WAS RUNNING IN DELAWARE, DELAWARE GOT 64% OF THE VOTE I WON BY A LANDSLIDE OF 3100 VOTES. MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FOLKS, I WAS THE YOUNG OPTIMIST AND IDEALIST. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S POSSIBILITIES TODAY THAN I WAS THEN. BUT NONE OF IT CAN HAVE BEEN IF HE'S STILL THERE. THINK ABOUT THIS, IF WE COULD THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT PRESIDENCY. NOT EVEN ME JUST DIFFERENT PRESIDENT. WHO BETTER TO LEAD THE WORLD IN THE 21st CENTURY. THE U.S. HAD THE BEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN ALL THE WORLD THE MOST INNOVATIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. NO OTHER NATION COULD MATCH US.. THIS IDEA IS SO BIG. IT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANT. WERE BIGGER THAN ANYTHING ONLY WE CAN UNDO OURSELVES. SO LOOK, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THEY HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHO HE IS OR HIS CHARACTER. THEY MAY CHOOSE HIM BECAUSE HE'S BENEFITING THEM IN WAYS THAT IN FACT ARE, CONTRARY TO THE BASIC NORMS. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO LEARN WHO WE DEMOCRATS ARE. WHAT WE STAND FOR. TRUTH OVERLIES, AND FACTOR FICTION. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS OUT, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO DO. TOGETHER, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU-THANK YOU-THANK YOU.

I NEVER LIKE TO CUT OFF CHEERS BUT MY TIME IS RUNNING HERE. WELCOME, SOUTH CAROLINA, TO , WE'RE HAPPY ALL TO BE HERE. THIS ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE YOU HAVE EVER BEEN ENGAGED IN. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PROMOTED HATE AND DIVISION AND ENCOURAGED WHITE SUPREMACY AND EMBRACES DICTATORSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD,. LOOK, OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING, THEY ARE WATCHING. IT MATTERS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAY AND DO. BARACK OBAMA THEY WATCHED AND THE EMULATED, THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM. FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ULTIMATELY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE OVERWHELMING IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO FOLKS, WE CAN BEGIN TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BUILT. AMERICA. ERRORS PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA , AVERAGE PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA. NOW THE BOTTOM IS FALLING OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. INCOME INEQUITY IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. TRUMP TAX CUTS AND ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. IT'S TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WE NEED TO BIG , BOLD. THE TAX LOOPHOLES BUILT IN THAT HAVE NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE. AND PUT THAT MONEY TO GOOD USE. HEALTH CARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED TO SAVE AND BUILD UPON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT SAID IT, JETTISON IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE COVERED THAT WERE NOT BEFORE. 140 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I AM , I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY TO SERVE WITH BARACK OBAMA BUT LET ME TELL YOU, NEVER PROUDER THAN HE GOT DONE WHAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO DO. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS. UNDER MY PLAN, WHETHER YOU'RE COVERED BY EMPLOYER ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FLY INTO A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE OPTION LIKE MEDICARE. AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THAT. WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE POOR , ARE IN FACT COVERED BECAUSE THEY CAN BE, AND IT IS WITHIN OUR INTEREST IN IT WILL SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EDUCATION. 12 YEARS ARE NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR THE 12 FOR CENTURY OF EDUCATION. FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WANTED TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. AND, BY THE WAY, WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS. $15 TO $45 BILLION, WE NEED UNIVERSAL PRE-K WE NEED TO RAISE TEACHERS PAY AND WE NEED TO FULLY FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION"" NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND NURSES BECAUSE TEACHERS CANNOT DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN. AND, OLKFOLKS, WE CAN EASILY AFFORD FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF FOUR YEAR COLLEGES FOR EVERYONE QUALIFIED TO GET IN AND, WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE STUDENT DEBT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO INTO NOW BUT WE WILL. CHAPTER. I, CHILDCARE. I KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT. I WAS ONE FOR FIVE YEARS. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE HELP THAT I HAD. I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE AN $8,000 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS A CHILD THAT NEEDS CHILDCARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE WHAT BARACK OBAMA AND I DID IN TERMS OF FUEL ECONOMY AND DOUBLING THE FUEL ECONOMY AS WELL AS COAL FIRED PLANTS. WE CAN DOUBLE OUR SHORES , WIND ENERGY BY 2030 PROVIDING $400 BILLION IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS WE SPENT GOING TO THE MOON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. YOU SAW THE HEADLINES TODAY'S PAPER. IT SAID, SOUTH CAROLINA $2 BILLION PIPES LIKE TISSUE PAPER THREATENING PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS ON EXCEPT , UNACCEPTABLE THAT THAT OCCURRED. IT IS NOT JUST IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS AROUND AMERICA. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THERE IT TOO MEET PEOPLE IN PRISON AND TOO MANY BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN IN PRISON. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND REFORM PRISONS BY 38,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT. WE PASSED THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INITIATIVES TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE BUT WE NEED TO PASS BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA'S SAFE JUSTICE ACT. I GOT TO ADD A FEW THINGS. NO MORE MANDATORY MINIMUMS. PERIOD. AND PRIVATE PRISONS WHICH WE DID IN OUR BILL. PERIOD. FUND MY DRUG COURTS, TO ABOUT $1 BILLION THE YEAR. NO ONE SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED. THEY SHOULD BE GOING INTO REHABILITATION, NOT TO JAIL. BAIL REFORM. IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD LANGUISH IN JAIL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO TUNABLES , NO JUVENILE AS AN ADULT PRISON AND MANDATORY TREATMENT IN JAIL FOR PEOPLE WHO ALSO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE RECORDS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. AND, BY THE WAY, INSTEAD OF KICKING PEOPLE , WE SHOULD BE EDUCATING PEOPLE IN PRISON. IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO DO SO. AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS, MEANING NOT ONLY YOU CAN VOTE BUT YOU QUALIFY FOR EVERY PROGRAM INCLUDING PELL GRANTS TO GET YOUR EDUCATION. IT MAKES NO SENSE. LOOK, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS THIS. WE ARE IN A COUPLE OF MAJOR CHANGES AND CANCER, DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE CAN DO THIS BY DOUBLING NIH'S BUDGET AND SET UP A NEW PROJECT THAT , LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE WHOLE INTERNET, PROVIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BASIC RESEARCH. HEALTHCARE, FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND TAKE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT IS WITHIN OUR REACH LIKE THAT CANCER INITIATIVE AND THE MOONSHOT. LOOK, I GBBEAT THE NRA BEFORE. WE OUGHT TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND MAGAZINES, AND, BY THE WAY, NEW TECHNOLOGY, YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE A GUN UNLESS YO UHAVE BIOMETRIC PRINT ON IT. NO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF SECOND AMENDMENT AND YOU HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH I PUT INTO LAW AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BRADY AMENDMENT. EVERYBODY, FOLKS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE OUR LIVES. I'M NEVER MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. I REMEMBER THE PHRASE FROM JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, BECAUSE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE. I'M NOT WILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NATION. IT IS TOTALLY IN OUR POWER TO CHANGE IT. GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

CSPANJB286201910	Joe Biden	2019-06-28	Joe Biden at Rainbow PUSH Coalition Convention	"THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE AS I HELPED TO MC AND HOST THE LABOR , EMCEE AND HOST THE LABOR CONFERENCE FOR RAINBOW PUSH. I DO THE EVENING NEWS, 5:00 NEWS, 10:00 NEWS,, ANYTHING ELSE? THIS GENERAL MANAGER WANTS ME TO DO IT, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME HERE TODAY. IT IS DEFINITELY MY HONOR ON THIS FIRST DAY OF THE FIVE-DAY CONVENTION. WE ARE KICKING IT OFF IN GRAND STYLE, DON'T YOU THINK? WE HAVE FABULOUS GUESTS. IT WILL BE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT. WE APPLAUD THE WORK RAINBOW PUSH HAS BEEN DOING THESE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. THE CONSTANT FIGHT FOR EQUALITY AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IS NOW HOPING TO EASE THE PAIN AT THE BORDER, HOLDING CENTERS AMONG MANY OF HIS OTHER CONSTANT BATTLES. WE WRECK , WE COMMEND HIM FOR THAT. WE ARE IN INTERESTING TIMES RIGHT NOW BUT WE APPLAUD AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE RAINBOW PUSH, ALWAYS FOCUSING ON THOSE IN NEED. RIGHT NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR. HE HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO LABOR UNIONS THROUGH HIS WORK AS A LABOR ATTORNEY, ORGANIZER, NEGOTIATOR, AND LOBBYIST. MR. ROBERT RYDER. [APPLAUSE] WHILE THAT IS SO COOL BEING INTRODUCED BY HER. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR. WE REPRESENT 300 UNIONS THAT REPRESENT WORKING WHEN AND MEN IN CHICAGO AND TOOK COUNTY. I AM EXCITED TO BE HERE. WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT HERE IN THE HALL AND THAT IS AWESOME. [APPLAUSE] I WOULD REMOVE , BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THIS THIS HOUSE THAT CAROLYN BUILT. LAST TIME I WAS AT THIS MICROPHONE, THERE WERE CAMERAS HERE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A CHARTER SCHOOL STRIKE THAT I PROMISE NOT TO USE TODAY, REVEREND JACKSON. I WANT TO GET UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE LABOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE HAD STRONG CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LABOR AND COMMUNITY. THE LABOR UNIONS WERE SOME OF THE FIRST COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ORGANIZED WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL BLOCK IN THE CITY WAS A GATHERING PLACE AND THEY CAME FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THEY HAD HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND THE GROCERY STORE AND THE EMPLOYER SOMETIMES WITHIN THAT ONE SQUARE BLOCK AREA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO US TO RENEW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT. WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. LABOR CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND COMMUNITY CAN'T DO IT ALONE. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CONNECTION WE HAVE HAD IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO OVER THE COURSE OF SO MANY YEARS IS THAT WITH REVEREND JESSE LEWIS JACKSON. MARVIN JACKSON HAS BEEN A PART OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT SINCE HE STOOD WITH DR. KING IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AND SUPPORTED SANITATION WORKERS ON STRIKE. WHEN DR. KING WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED, NOT JUST FOR ONE UNION BUT FOR ALL UNIONS, HE STOOD WITH THE SANITATION WORKERS. REVEREND JACKSON STOOD WITH HOSPITAL WORKERS ORGANIZING HERE IN CHICAGO IN THE 1970'S AND FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN RELATION TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO. RAVEN JACKSON HAS STOOD WITH LABOR, BOTH WORKING WITH US LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. LABOR MOVEMENT IN CHICAGO IS STRONG. WE ARE VIBRANT. AND WE FIGHT LIKE HELL. WE HAVE A STORY OF JOB ACTIONS BUT WE HAVE ESCALATED THINGS IN THE WAKE OF THE CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION STRIKE IN 2012. IN MY TIME AT THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR, WE HAVE SEEN AUTO MECHANICS GO ON STRIKE FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON STRIKE FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. WE SAW HOTEL WORKERS TAKE TO THE STREETS FOR ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC STRIKES IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY AS WELL. REVEREND JACKSON HAS STOOD WITH US THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I CAN'T THINK OF ONE PERSON IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO HAS DONE MORE TO WORK WITH US IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT TO LIFT UP PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN A-WAGE JOBS THAN REVEREND JACKSON. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME SUGGEST TO YOU THIS , IF ANYONE OF YOU WANT TO QUESTION WHETHER REVEREND JACKSON HAS SOME GAS IN THE TANK LEFT, LET'S GO FIND A BUILDING TO STAND OUTSIDE OF. HE WILL CLIMB UP ON THAT BENCH AND PUT HIS FISTS IN THE AIR AND FIGHT FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS CITY AND COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK YOU, REVEREND NOXON, AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR HAVING HERE TODAY. , REVEREND JACKSON, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY GOOD FRIEND, DEBORAH LANE ARIAN [APPLAUSE] GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I AM FROM A AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION 3:08, FIRST ORGANIZER OF OUR UNION AND FINANCIAL SECRETARY. I AM SO GLAD AND HONORED THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE THIS GATHERING WITH LABOR UNIONS. WE WILL CHICAGO. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. WE ARE OVER THE OPERATORS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND WE GOT OUR MOVEMENT MENTORING RIGHT HERE IN THIS HOUSE THAT KAREN LEWIS BUILT. REVEREND JACKSON, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU HELPED TO GET WHAT WAS RIGHT TO US. WE ARE NEW TO THE LABOR UNION GAME BUT WE ARE HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND PROUD AND FIGHT FOR WHAT IS EQUALLY HOURS. AS LOCAL 308, WE ARE TO STAND AND WE THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING US IN. [APPLAUSE] SO I AM BACK. WE HAVE A LOT OF HISTORIC TIMES HERE IN THE CITY. WE RECENTLY ELECTED A NEW GOVERNOR AFTER HAVING FOUR YEARS OF A GOVERNOR WHO WAS TRYING TO DESTROY THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. BILLS ARE BEING SIGNED REGARDING CAPITAL AND OTHER INITIATIVES TO HELP LIFT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS UP. WE HAD AN ELECTION IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. AFTER WHAT WE SEE AS A TIME WHERE WE HAVE LOOKED AT DECADES OF THIS INVESTMENT FROM NEIGHBORHOODS HERE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, FROM DECADES OF PEOPLE OF MANUFACTURING AND OTHER RESOURCES BEING ROBBED FROM OUR COMMUNITIES IN ORDER FOR FOLKS TO EARN A DECENT WAGE. WE HAVE FACED THIS ELECTION WHERE WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE RUNNING TO BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I ONLY TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE. ONE SIDE OF THE CITY IS BRIGHT AND SHINY, AND THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER PART THAT CRIES FOR HELP. , HOPE. WE FACED A RUNOFF ELECTION BETWEEN TWO WOMEN WHO I BELIEVE HAD THE HEART OF THE CITY IN THEIR HEART. EITHER WAY THAT ELECTION COMES OUT WAS GOING TO BE HISTORIC BECAUSE THE CITY ELECTED ITS FIRST BLACK FEMALE MAYOR. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS AMAZING AND THAT IS WITH THE CITY NEEDED. LET ME TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR NEW AIR. LORI LIGHTFOOT , NEW MAYOR. LORI LIGHTFOOT WAS ELECTED AS MAYOR. I SERVED ON HER TRANSMISSION COMMITTEE. NOT BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM BLABER SIT AT THE TABLE, BUT BECAUSE , SOMEONE FROM LABOR SIT AT THE TABLE, BUT BECAUSE THEY WANTED OUR THOUGHTS AT THE FOREFRONT. I WORKED WITH MAYOR LIGHTFOOT THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. IT IS NOT OUR DISAGREEMENTS OR OUR AGREEMENTS THAT WILL IDENTIFY, BUT HOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE ISSUES. FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAT DOWN WITH LORI LIGHTFOOT A YEAR AGO, I LOOKED IN THIS WOMAN'S EYES AND KNEW SHE WAS A FIGHTER AND KNEW THAT SHE WOULD FIGHT NOT ONLY TO BECOME THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO BUT TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHO PUT THEIR SHOES ON EVERYDAY AND GO TO WORK. WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES IN THE CITY. IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THEM, WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER, LABOR, COMMUNITY, AND GOVERNMENT. I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER PARTNER TO HAVE IN THAT VENTURE RIGHT NOW THAN LORI LIGHTFOOT. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE NEW MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO, LORI LIGHTFOOT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THIS PODIUM. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROUS INTRODUCTION. I AM HONORED TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE IN THE HOUSE THAT KAREN LEWIS BUILT AND THE PART THAT JESSE AND CTU ARE CARRYING ON A TRADITION OF FIGHTING FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND BEING ON THE SIDE OF WORKING PEOPLE IN THE CITY. I AM A PRODUCT , [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: I AM A PRODUCT OF A WORKING FAMILY. I CANNOT BE HERE WITHOUT WORKING ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES MY FATHER WORKED IN THE FACTORY AND TWO AND THREE JOBS. I AM HERE BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICES HE AND MY MOTHER MADE EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR ME AND MY SIBLINGS TO PROVIDE US WITH OPPORTUNITY. I AM HERE TO BRING YOU GREETINGS FROM THE GREAT CITY OF CHICAGO, THE CITY THAT ORGANIZED LABOR BUILT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: AS THIS YEAR'S THEME FOR THE CONVENTION OUTLINES, IT HAS BEEN 400 YEARS SINCE THE FIRST AFRICAN REACHED OUR NATIONS SHORES IN CHAINS. IT IS A LEGACY OLDER THAN THE NATION ITSELF. THE ARK OF WHICH HAS BEEN MORE SLAVES AND FREE WHERE THE FULL RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP HAS BEEN ENJOYED ONLY FOR THE LAST 50 OF THOSE YEARS, AND REFRACTION OF THAT TIME. THE 400 YEARS HAVE COME TO DEFINE THE FIBER OF OUR NATION, TOUCHING EVERY ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY, OUR CULTURE, AND OUR SOCIETY. WHAT DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. CHICAGO SELF EMBODIES THAT LEGACY IN ALL OF ITS FORMS, GOOD AND BAD. IN OUR CAPACITY TO OVERCOME AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE, FUNDAMENTAL INEQUITY AND INJUSTICE. THE QUESTION FOR US RESTS IN WHAT THIS WEEKEND'S THEME EXPLORES , HOW DO WE REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE? IT IS THE SAME QUESTION POSED WHEN WE EXPLORE CHICAGO'S OWN CHALLENGES OF INCOME AND HOUSING SEGREGATION, THE CONCENTRATED VIOLENCE, PRECARIOUS FINANCES FOR WORKING FAMILIES, LACK OF GOOD PAYING JOBS INTO MANY NEIGHBORHOODS, THE DISINVESTMENT WE SEE IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE AUSTIN, COMPARED TO THE SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS FLOW OF CAPITAL IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE LAKEVIEW AND THE GOLD COAST. A RECENT STUDY BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE FOUND THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE, PRIVATE RESOURCES INVESTED AN AVERAGE OF $22,476 PER HOUSEHOLD EVERY YEAR AND THE MAJORITY WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. MEANWHILE, IN MAJORITY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS, IT SHRUNK TO UNDER $5,000. THAT IS OVER 15,000 DIFFERENTIAL. THESE QUESTIONS OF HOW WE REPAIR THE DIFFERENT MAY TAKE SOME DIFFERENT FORMS BUT WERE DRAWN FROM THE SAME SOURCES. AS DR. KING SAID, ""THE TENSIONS ARE NOT BETWEEN RACE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS."" IT IS IN URBAN CENTERS ALL CROSS OUR NATION. THE ONLY QUESTION IS TRULY ADDRESSED IN ONE WAY, AND THAT IS HAD ON. I AM MINDFUL OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IN OUR PRESENCE AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU AND ANYONE WHO ASPIRES TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , WE MUST HAVE A FULL-SCALE, URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH THE ISSUES OF POVERTY AND INJUSTICE IN OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THERE IS THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT, COMPREHENSIVE, COORDINATED ECONOMIC LANDING, AND TRUE ACCESS TO THE BASIC COMMUNITY BUILDING BLOCKS. AS THE CENTURY OLD HYMN GOES, PAST ME NOT A GENTLE SAVIOR, HEAR MY HUMBLE CRY, WHILE ANOTHER IS CALLING, DO NOT PASS ME BY. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THIS IS A HIM THAT I HEARD ON , HYMN THAT I HEARD IN COUNTLESS CHURCHES GROWING UP AND WHY HEARD IS WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. IN CHICAGO, IF WE WANT TO BE A TRULY GLOBAL CITY, WE NEED TO LOOK SOUTH OF ROOSEVELT ROAD AND WEST OF ASHLAND. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THIS IS OUR CHALLENGE BUT OUR OPPORTUNITY. IT IS A SHARED MISSION AND SHARED MANDATE THAT WE HAVE TO CHARGE DIRECTLY INTO. THE EXCUSES, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, WE HAVE TO PUT THEM ASIDE AND FACE A MOMENT OF RECKONING, AND THAT TIME IS NOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND ENCOURAGING THE VIGOROUS DEBATE AND DISCUSSION WE MUST HAVE BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THE HEART AND SOUL OF WHO WE ARE GOING TO BE, NOT JUST AS A CITY OR A STATE, BUT AS A NATION. IT IS TIME. WE MUST FORGE AHEAD AND GRAPPLE IN THIS MOMENT AND WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER, NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] NOW TO THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL. HE FOUGHT INJUSTICE IN THE SOUTH LONG BEFORE HE MET DR. KING. IT WAS HIS WORK AND STRUGGLES THAT CAUGHT DR. KING'S EYES. HE CAME TO CHICAGO, STARTED OPERATION BREADBASKET AND THEN OPERATION PUSH, AND NO RAINBOW PUSH. 55 YEARS OF WORKING TOWARDS INEQUALITY. [APPLAUSE] WORKING FOR JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT JUST CIVIL. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE MAN WHO IS HERE. HE WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO ANOTHER SPECIAL PERSON YOU WILL TALK TO TONIGHT, BUT HE STARTED IT ALL AND IS WHY WE ARE HERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, REVEREND JESSE LEWIS JACKSON. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: I AM ANXIOUS TO BRING ON THE VICE PRESIDENT FROM DELAWARE. I WANT TO MAKE ONE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN WAS TO HAVE A PANEL OF WORKERS. THE LAST DRIVE WAS FOR THE CAMPAIGN. HE ORGANIZED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. WHEN IT WAS ORGANIZED, THEY WAGED BENEFITS. I WANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION WHO IS HERE AS A SPECIAL GUEST , WHERE IS HE? A BIG HAND. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER LIKE YOU REALLY MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: FOUR , OVER 50 YEARS AGO, A MAN SAID SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN MEMPHIS. I THINK SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. I AM JUST HUMBLED, REVEREND JACKSON, THAT I HAVE BEEN INVITED HERE. THE CHICAGO LABOR FEDERATION, MY DISTRICT COUNCIL 14. MY BUSINESS MANAGER AND EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE. IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO BE HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND TRADE. IT KNOWS ONE THING FOR SURE , THAT THING FOR SURE IS THAT WE KNOW AS A BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADE UNION THAT WE CANNOT DO IT BY OURSELVES. I STAND BEFORE YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ALLIED TRADES AND AS A PERSON WHO LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF IN THIS ROOM. I CAN TELL YOU, I AM THE FIRST PERSON THAT THE GENERAL PRESIDENT OF A BUILDING TRADES UNION THAT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THIS VERY ROOM. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: I SAY THAT NOT AS I SAY THAT NOT AS AN EGO. I PRETTY MUCH A HUMBLE PERSON AND DO NOT THINK OF MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A WHOLE LOT TO SAY, OTHER THAN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO MY UNION. BUT I REALIZED BECAUSE I AM THE SON OF A BUILDING TRADESMEN. I AM THE SON OF A MAN WHO CAME FROM THE CIVIC THEATER AFTER WORLD WAR II AND WANTED TO BECOME A CARPENTER. THAT WAS IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA , THAT GREAT, PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE WENT TO A UNION HALL AND THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO GET A JOB BEFORE YOU JOINED THE UNION. HE WENT TO SOME CONTRACTORS AND THEY SAID HAVE TO JOIN A JOB. I THINK YOU ALL HEAR ME. [LAUGHTER] AFTER DOING THAT AND GOING AROUND THE MERRY-GO-ROUND, HE MET A CONTRACTOR WHO SAID I WILL HIRE YOU. HE WENT TO THE UNION HALL IN CALIFORNIA IN 1947. WE DON'T ALLOW COLORED FOLKS IN THIS UNION. HE WENT BACK TO THE CONTRACTOR AND THE CONTRACTOR SAID YOU GO TO THE BUILDING IN VALDES STREET AND YOU TELL THE BUSINESS MANAGER THAT IF HE DOESN'T BRING YOU INTO THE UNION, HE WILL HAVE AN INJUNCTION ON HIS BLEEP. HE SAID I AM NOW GOING TO GO TO THE UNION MEETING. HE WENT TO THE UNION MEETING. HE SAT ON THE ROW. NOBODY SAT IN THE ROPE BEHIND HIM OR IN FRONT OF HIM, AND THEY STARTED WITH THE JOKES. BUT ONE THING I LEARNED FROM MY FATHER , PERSEVERANCE. THAT WORD PERSEVERANCE. HE HUNG IN THERE. HE BECAME A MEMBER OF HIS UNION AND BECAME A JOURNEYMAN AND BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF HIS LOCAL UNION. HE PROCEEDED TO WORK HIS WAY TO BECOME A BUSINESSMAN TO WORK AND BECOME A SUPERINTENDENT, TO WORK AND MOVE HIS FAMILY FORWARD ALONG WITH HIS COMMUNITY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT FUELED ME. BUT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FOLKS TELL THEIR STORY , THE STORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS THEIR STORY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND HOW THEY PERSEVERED TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE, IT IS NOT TO CRITIQUE ANYBODY, BUT IT IS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT FOLKS WEAR AND FACE CHALLENGES. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. MY UNION NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE BUILDING TRADES NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. ORGANIZED LABOR NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THESE DAYS, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS A TRUE AND HONEST CONVERSATION. IF YOU DON'T, YOU ARE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT. AS A LEADER OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ALLIED TRADES, WE WANT VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE. WE HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKER COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A WOMAN'S COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A LATINO COMMITTEE. SOME OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS SAY , WHY IS NOT FAIR FOR A WHITE COMMITTEE? OUR UNION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 130 YEARS, I THINK THE FIRST 125 , IT WAS , A WHITE COMMITTEE. I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT. I AM NOT SAYING TO CRITIQUE YOU. THE CLOCK IS WINDING OFF AND I HAVE TO GET OFF OF THE STAGE REAL QUICK. I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A UNION THAT WORKS FOR CONSTITUENCIES AND FOR COMMUNITIES AND WE WORK FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP. OUR JOB IS TO BE AN ASSET TO ORGANIZED LABOR AND TO BE AN ASSET IN CHICAGO, AND TO BE AN ASSET IN THE UNITED STATES, CALIFORNIA, IN ORDER TO ADVANCE. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT AND I WON'T STAND FOR ANYTHING LESS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN. [LAUGHTER] REV. JACKSON: FIRST, I WANT THE VICE PRESIDENT'S GRANDDAUGHTER , COME ON UP HERE, GRANDDAUGHTER. MAYOR LIGHTFOOT, MAYOR, JUDGE GREG MATHIS. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: WE LOVE THAT MAN. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: ACROSS THESE YEARS, WE HAVE WORKED HAND IN HAND ON CRITICAL PROJECTS WITH JOE BIDEN, OVER THE TRENCHERS, TRYING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, AGREE TO AGREE, AGREE TO DISAGREE IN A CIVIL WAY. SOME OF MY BEST MENTORING MINISTERS IN THE WORLD, FROM DELAWARE, MEETING JOE BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S, THE DAUGHTER OF MY CLASSMATE IS NOW THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM DELAWARE. WE USUALLY WORK TOGETHER. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS IN A PARTICULAR WAY. WHEN THE GREAT BARACK OBAMA BECAME OUR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, DOUBTS, FEARS, EVERYWHERE. TWO SETS OF RULES. HE WAS THE SOUTH AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO COVER THE WATERFRONT, IN DEPTH AND BREADTH, TRUSTWORTHY, WITH HIS RUNNING MATE, TWICE TAKING OUR NATION TO THE HIGHEST HEIGHTS. BARACK OBAMA CHOSE A RUNNING MATE, JOE BIDEN. JOE, IN THE CHALLENGE LABOR MEETING, OUR FOCUS IS TEMPORARY WORK IS A WORKING SCAM. THE WORKERS' RIGHT TO VOTE IS UNDER ATTACK. BY THE WRITTEN LAWS IN THE SOUTH OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY CANNOT AFFORD GOOD HEALTH CARE. YOU HAVE THE STUFF THAT IT TAKES TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, SO JOE BIDEN, PLEASE STAND AND COME FORWARD. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, REVEREND. WELL, I AM HERE TO INTRODUCE, ANOTHER BIDEN WHO IS GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN BIDEN. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, I LOST A DAUGHTER, I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER THAT SURVIVED, AND I HAVE FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS, AND LET ME TELL YOU, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD A DAUGHTER AS WELL? HERE IS THE DEAL , DAUGHTERS ALWAYS ARE WONDERFUL. WE HAVE AN EXPRESSION, A SON IS A SIGN YOU GET TO WIFE, A DAUGHTER IS A DAUGHTER YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER IS 12 AND A HALF YEARS OLD, YOU PUT A BUTTERFLY, YOU KISS HER MIDNIGHT, WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THERE IS A SNAKE IN HER BED. ""DADDY, DADDY,"" AND THEY ALL COME BACK BETWEEN 19 AND 21, AND THE CONGRESSWOMAN SAID YOU'RE NOT HYDRATING ENOUGH. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD. BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. GRANDDAUGHTERS NOT ALWAYS ONLY ALWAYS LOVE YOU, BUT THEY ALWAYS LIKE YOU. AND BY THE WAY, SHE IS IN COLLEGE, WALKING DOWN TO CAMPUS, SHE SAID ""CAN WE HOLD HANDS, POP?"" CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR DAUGHTERS SAYING THAT. ? I LOVE YOU, GET. BY THE WAY, HER MOM IS FROM THE SOUTH SIDE. HER OTHER GRANDPARENTS LIVE IN CHICAGO, AND SHE IS A CHICAGO GIRL. ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR A MUCH FOR INDULGING ME, REVEREND. AND I ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING MY SON COME, BEAU. HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY, MAYOR, THE PASSPORT TO TOWN, I APPRECIATE THAT. CONGRESSWOMAN KELLY, A GREAT CONGRESS WOMAN, AND EVERYONE HERE. THERE IS A SAYING IN SOUTH PHILLY, ""Y'ALL ARE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE,"" THE LABORERS, AND THAT IS NOT JOKING. HJESSE SAYS I GOT RAISED IN THE BLACK CHURCH, HE KNOWS I AM NOT KIDDING. WE WOULD SIT THERE BEFORE HE GOES OUT AND TRY TO CHANGE THINGS WHEN I WAS A KID IN COLLEGE AND A VICE. LOOK, BEFORE I START MY WHAT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEBATE WE HAD LAST NIGHT, AND I HEARD AND I LISTENED TO, AND I RESPECT SENATOR HARRIS. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT 30 SECONDS TO 60 SECONDS ON A CAMPAIGN DEBATE CANNOT DO JUSTICE TO A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO CIVIL RIGHTS. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT MY RECORD AND POSITION ON RACIAL JUSTICE, INCLUDING BUSSING. I NEVER, NEVER OPPOSE VOLUNTARY BUSING, AND AS A PROGRAM THAT SENATOR HARRIS PARTICIPATED IN AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HER LIFE I DID SUPPORT FEDERAL OPTION TO ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF SEGREGATION OF HOURS WAS A COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING TAKING ON THE BANKS AND REDLINING AND TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAYS IN WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS WERE SEGREGATED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF USING FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER STATE SEGREGATION. I CAST A VOTE IN 1974 AGAINST THE AMENDMENT ALL CALLS OF THE GURNEY AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FEDERAL COURTS FROM USING BUSING AS A REMEDY. IT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THE MOST POPULAR VOTE IN THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME. REVEREND JACKSON, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS, A LOT OF ISSUES THAT MATTER. I KNOW AND YOU KNOW THAT I THOUGHT MY HEART TO ENSURE CIVIL RIGHTS ARE ON FORCE EVERYWHERE. THESE RIGHTS ARE NOT UP TO THE STATE TO DECIDE, THEY ARE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TO DECIDE. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION TO PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY POSITION, AND SO THAT IS WHY I RAN FOR FEDERAL OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS REVEREND JACKSON MAY BE ONE OF THE FIRST EVIL THAN THOSE, MY CITY WAS THE ONLY CITY AFTER DR. KING WAS ASSASSINATED THAT WAS ALMOST BURNED TO THE GROUND, 20% OF IT. 19TH CENTURY CONSTRUCTION WAS OCCUPIED FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS DRAWING BAYONETS ON ALMOST EVERY CORNER FOR 10 MONTHS. I CAN HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL THAT YEAR, AND I HAD TWO POLITICAL HEROES , DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY, AND THEY WERE BOTH ASSASSINATED THE YEAR I GRADUATED. I CAME HOME AND HAD A JOB AT A PRECISION FIRM, AND AFTER FIVE MONTHS, I DECIDED I COULD NOT DO IT DURING WHEN I WAS ELECTED, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TO GO ON A COMMITTEE TO START TO STRENGTHEN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT YOUR ANKLES ON CERTAIN THE ACT. I WROTE THE LAW, THE PROVISION IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PURSUE CASES INVOLVING ""A PATTERN OR PRACTICE OF CONDUCT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL RIGHTS."" I WROTE THAT LAW, AND I USED TO THAT POWER DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING FERGUSON. BY THE WAY, WE WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW LEASE APARTMENTS , POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO BUY MILITARY ITEMS LIKE HUMVEES, YOU DO NOT GO INTO NEIGHBORHOODS IN A HUMVEE OR PERSONNEL CARRIER. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BY 38,000 PEOPLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE DID MORE IN THE PRESIDENCY THAN THE 13 PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WITH ALL THE RESPECT, I THINK CHICAGOANS AND EVERYONE, MY PRESIDENCY GIVES FAR TOO LITTLE CREDIT FOR ALL THAT HE DID YOUR HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND I AM TIRED OF HEARING WHAT HE DID NOT DO! [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] THIS MAN HAD A BACK BONE LIKE A RAMROD. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT A PERSON IS MADE OF? WATCH THEM UNDER POLITICAL PRESSURE. HE WAS ELECTED, HE FELL OFF A CLIFF. WE HAD TO PASS AN ACT, THE RECOVERY ACT, THAT WAS $800 BILLION. AND GUESS WHAT? REMEMBER, HE LOVED DURING THE STATE OF THE UNIT TO TURN AND SURPRISE ME, HE DID NOT TELL ME, ""SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO ENFORCE THE ACT."" THANKS A LOT, MR. PRESIDENT. $800 BILLION. WE GET IT WITH LESS THAN 2% OF WASTE, FRAUD, OR USE IN THAT ACT. BUT HERE IS WHAT YOU GET, EVERYTHING THAT LANDED ON HIS DESK, I WATCHED HIM. I WATCHED HIM, I SAT WITH HIM EVERY SINGLE MORNING, AND I WATCHED HIM. HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN THE SO-CALLED , THE SITUATION, NOT WHERE BLITZER LIVED, THE REAL SITUATION ROOM. CHICAGO, YOU HAD A GREAT, GREAT MAN OUT HERE, AND HE IS STILL IS A GREAT MAN, AND HE'S ILL HAS A LOT TO OFFER. WE WERE IN OFFICE, WE STARTED AN INITIATIVE TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. FOLKS, THE DISCUSSION IN THIS RACE TODAY SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT THE PAST AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER, HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, HOW WE CAN GIVE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SUCCESS STORIES. THESE ARE NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILDREN. THESE ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN. NOT A JOKE. THEY ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS A LOT OF. WE HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA HAS ENORMOUS ATTENTION OF EVERY SINGLE CHILD HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL. BUT IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD. NO CHILD'S FUTURE SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THEIR ZIP CODE. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE INCREASING TITLE I FUNDING. WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE TEACHERS PAY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PRE-K A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE BOARD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE SCHOOLTEACHERS WORK EVERY YEAR, LIKE MY WIFE, SHE WORKS AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE, SHE HAS NEVER STOPPED TEACHING, BY THE WAY, THE ONLY SECONDLY I KNOW WHO HAD A FULL-TIME JOB, TEACHING 15 CREDITS A SEMESTER. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, I AM KNOWN AS JOEILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, BUT I EARNED IT. I ASKED HER FIVE TIMES TO MARRY ME BEFORE SHE WOULD DO IT. LOOK, THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TEACHERS IN HERE, YOU ARE ASKED EXPECTED TO TEACH THE CHILDREN TO READ, WRITE, ADD, AND SUBTRACT, BUT KIDS COME TO SCHOOL WITH BURDENS AND PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TOO FEW SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, TOO FEW SOCIAL WORKERS, TOO FEW PEOPLE IN THERE WORKING TO GIVE KIDS A CHANCE, AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT UNDER MY PROPOSAL. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO DESEGREGATE OUR SCHOOLS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A NATIONAL INTEREST IN CREATING DIVERSE SCHOOL BODIES. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING CLOSER TO AN IDEA OF AMERICA'S FOUNDING. YOU KNOW, WE ALL LEARNED IN SCHOOL ""WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,"" ""WE THE PEOPLE."" WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT, AND THIS IS THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN BEING BROUGHT TO THE SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES IN SLAVES. THAT IS THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THIS NATION, BUT WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT, EITHER WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THE EXPECTATION. ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AND THERE IS ONE PRESIDENT I KNOW WHO HAS ACTUALLY DELIBERATELY WALKED AWAY FROM IT, AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT THIS. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU, JESS, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT AFTER ALL THE REST THAT HAD BEEN MADE, I WOULD SEE PEOPLE MARCHING OUT OF FIELDS, CARRYING TORCHES, CONTORTED FACES, ANGER AND HATE, ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THE KU KLUX KLAN, MET BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE WHO SAID ""WE DON'T HATE YOU,"" AND WHAT HAPPENS? A CLASH ENSUES, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED, AND WHAT DID HE SAY? WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT, HE SAID, QUOTE, NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID THIS, ""THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS."" HE HAS YET TO APOLOGIZE OR CRITICIZE , CRITICIZE THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WAS PREMISES. LOOK , WHITE SUPREMACISTS. LOOK, WE HAVE A RESIDENT WHO HAS ENCOURAGED THE POISON OF WHITE SUPREMACY. OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. WHEN BARACK WAS PRESIDENT, OUR KIDS NOT ONLY COULD THEY DID LOOK UP TO HIM. LOOK, WHAT PRESIDENTS SAY MATTERS. IN MATTERS. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN WE STAY SILENT, OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY OR THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. YOUR SILENCE IS COMPLICIT. YOU KNOW, I PROMISE YOU, IF I GET ELECTED RESIDENT, I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHOSE HANDS AGAINST RACISM, WHO FORCES INCLUSION AND INTOLERANT EVERYWHERE NOW SOCIETY, AND OUR INSTITUTIONS, VOTING BOOTHS, AND IN OUR HEARTS. IT MATTERS, WHAT WE SAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO STAND BY AND START BY RECOGNIZING BLACK, HISPANIC, ASIAN AMERICAN WORKERS, NATIVE AMERICAN WORKERS, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALL ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE LABOR MOVEMENT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AS YOU MENTIONED, MR. PRESIDENT, A MOMENT AGO. FROM THE WASHINGTON WOMAN STRIKE IN 1880 TWO THE STRIKE AND BOYCOTT IN THE 1960'S, TO CHICAGO'S OWN ABBY WHITE AND JACQUELINE VON, BLACK AND BROWN POWER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THE RIGHT FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, EQUAL POWER, AS MY DAD WOULD SAY, SOME DIGNITY, TAKING ON THE FIGHT OF ALL WORKERS, FROM FARMWORKERS WORKERS TO DOMESTIC WORKERS, TO TEARING DOWN SYSTEMIC RACISM AROUND THE WAY. WE KNOW THEM, WE OWE YOU. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW LABOR WILL HAVE AN ABSOLUTE, WILL PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I THINK LABOR KNOWS THAT. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, A LOT HAS CHANGED VERY BADLY, AND THIS PRESIDENT, AND SOME MEMBERS OF THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY BELIEVE THAT , I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR , WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. STOCKBROKERS AND HEDGE FUND MANAGERS DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. YOU BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS, THE UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT IS WHY IT EXISTS. WE NEED TO REBUILD IT! BUT THIS TIME, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, NO MATTER THEIR RACE OR GENDER, ETHNICITY, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE, WHERE THEY LIVE, OR WHETHER THEY HAD A DISABILITY. MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION, JOE, YOU TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT A PAYCHECK, AND HE MEANT IT. HE SAID, JOE, IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IS ABOUT RESPECT IN THE COMMUNITY, IT IS ABOUT LOOKING YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT IS TO BE OK, AND HE OR TOO FEW PEOPLE, AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED TODAY, THINK THEY CAN SAY THAT TODAY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE ARE SHRINKING. THEY NO LONGER BELIEVE THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOUR DAD PERSISTED AND CHANGED THINGS. AND IN TODAY'S CORPORATE CULTURE, IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. THEY CARE ABOUT BREAKING THE BACK OF WORKERS AND RECORD PROFITS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES, CORPORATE PROFITS ARE GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND BLOCKBUSTER EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THEY ARE SWEEPING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS TODAY. AND BY THE WAY, MAKING IT HARD TO MEET BASIC NEEDS. THERE HAS LONG BEEN A WAR ON LABOR UNIONS. AS WHEN IT OUT TODAY, MR. CHAIRMAN, Y'ALL ARE COMING BACK, BUT HERE IS THE DEAL, THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER WAR GOING ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN NOTICED VERY MUCH, ON THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO BARGAIN FOR THEIR SELF-WORTH. 40% OF WORKERS TODAY HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT. IT IS ONE THING TO HAVE ACCESS SECRETS OF A GREAT, TECHNICAL ORGANIZATION TO SIGN, I WON'T COMPLAIN. ETE. BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HOURLY WORKERS. UP UNTIL I STARTED HOLLERING ABOUT THIS, IF YOU WORKED FOR JIMMY JOHN'S, YOU HAD TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT IS THAT YOU WOULD NOT WHILE CROSS TOWN AND TRY TO GET $.10 MORE FROM MCDONALD'S. WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? IT IS ONLY ONE PURPOSE, TO HOLD DOWN THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS EVEN TO BARGAIN FOR THEIR OWN SELF WORTH. IT IS TO KEEP WAGES LOW, AND IT IS WRONG. TOO MANY COMPANIES TODAY CLASSIFY THEIR WORKERS AS MANAGERS, WHEN LABOR FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE AN HOURLY WORKER, YOU HAD TO BE PAID OVERTIME. WHAT DID THEY DO? THE PERSON STACKING SPAGHETTI CANS ON TOP OF A SHELF IN A SUPERMARKET, BUT YOU CONTROL THE PERSON WHO WANTS A FORKLIFT, TO BRING IT OUT, THEY SAY YOU ARE NOW A MANAGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT CAUGHT MORE THAN 400 MILLION WORKERS $1.2 BILLION LAST YEAR. WHERE DID IT GO? IT WENT BACK INTO THE POCKET OF AMERICA, BACK INTO THE SO-CALLED JOB HATERS. SINCE WHEN , JOB CREATORS. SINCE WHEN? SINCE WHEN WERE THEY JOB CREATORS? TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ONLY ONES I THINK OUR JOB CREATORS ARE STOCKBROKERS. IT IS RIDICULOUS. IT IS LONG PAST TIME WE HAVE A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] LONG PAST TIME. IT REALLY IS. AND WE ARE GETTING IT DONE AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE NEED TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WAGES, NOT JUST WELL. =, WEALTH. WAGES HAVE TO BE REWARDED. DO YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MULTIMILLIONAIRES AND PAY CAPITAL GAINS GET A LOWER TAX RATE THAN ANY OF YOU ALL DO? LOOK, IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL IMMEDIATELY REPEAL THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE HAVE $1.6 TRILLION IN LOOP HOLES THAT EXIST IN THE LOGOUT. $1.6 TRILLION. YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT. AND SO, FOLKS, LOOK, WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS USE THE MONEY TO INVEST IN AMERICA'S FUTURE. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY LONG LIST OF POLICIES THAT I DO NOT HAVE TIME NOR DO YOU HAVE AN INCLINATION FOR ME TO GO THROUGH. BUT WE NEED AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY, FOR BETTER ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES, TO REDUCING THE DECLINE IN BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP AMONG TO MAKING SURE HOMES IN BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE VALUED FAIRLY. DO YOU REALIZE A HOME , I KNOW YOU DO , A SAME HOME IN A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD AND ONE IN A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, IT IS VALUED AT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS, LIMITING YOUR ABILITY TO BORROW AGAINST IT, TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT, AND GUESS WHAT? YOU PAY A HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR IT, TO. O. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE BLACK MOTHERS REAL CONFIDENT WHEN THEY SENT THEIR SON OUT ON THE STREET THAT THEY WILL BE SAFE. WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT KID WEARING A HOODIE MAY VERY WELL BE THE NEXT POET LAUREATE AND NOT A GANG BANGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE ARE TOO MANY BLACK MEN, AND I MIGHT ADD WOMEN, IN PROSISON. I JUST MET WITH BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA. THE SAVE JUSTICE ACT. IT NEEDS TO BE PASSED. WE NEED TO DO MORE. NO MORE MINIMUM MANDATORY PRISON SENTENCES, PERIOD. THE END OF PRIVATE PRISONS, AS BARACK AND I TALKED ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] FINDING. DRUG COURTS. AT LEAST $400 MILLION A YEAR. THEY'LL REFORM. NO ONE SHOULD BE IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THEIR BAIL. NO JUVENILES IN PRISON. MANDATORY TREATMENT, NOT JAIL, FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY AND STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL. PUT THEM IN TREATMENT AND KEEP THEM THERE WHILE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH TREATMENT. DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA. AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, END THE CRACK COCAINE DISPARITY SO IT IS 1-1, NO DIFFERENCE. TOO MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN PUT IN JAIL FOR IT. LOOK, WHAT I DO NOT GET, AND WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE, IF YOU MAKE IT FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE, THEY FIGURE IT OUT. IN PRISON, YOU SHOULD RECEIVE AN EDUCATION, NOT HOW TO BE A BETTER CRIMINAL, BUT YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO READ AND WRITE. THERE SHOULD BE JOB PROGRAMS IN THERE. WE SHOULD BE TRAINING PEOPLE. WE SHOULD BE TRAINING THEM. WE SHOULD HAVE AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS ONCE THEIR SENTENCE AND HERBS, INCLUDING ALL RIGHTS TO GO TO SCHOOL, HELP RISK, NOT ONLY THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE, BUT THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES AND EVERY CITIZEN, BLACK OR WHITE OR HIS, THAT YOU REEDUCATE PEOPLE, GIVE THEM A CHANCE. POST MALONE, WE CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS, AND SO MUCH MORE. I KNOW WE GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY, BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I REFUSE TO CONTINUE THE STATUS QUO. IT GUARANTEES IT WILL CONTINUE. WE CANNOT DO IT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW HOW THE LABOR LEADERS MOVEMENT HAS MOVED FOR DECADES. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN IN 2020, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN TOGETHER WHEN WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, REV, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE, AND I MEAN IT. I MEAN IT. YOU KNOW THERE IS, EXCUSE ME FOR QUOTING AND I WAS ON, A GUY NAMED SHAMUSSEAMUS HANEY RAUNER: ABOUT THE SUPPRESSION OF CATHOLICS IN IRELAND, AND HE WROTE ""WE ARE TAUGHT NEVER TO HOPE ON THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LONG TIME, THAT LONG TITLE WAVE OF US THIS RISES UP AND HOPE THAT HISTORY WINS. FOLKS, WE ARE IN A POSITION NOW WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS THE THE VERY DARK SIDE OF AMERICA. EVERY GENERATION IS SAYING ""ENOUGH."" WE HAVE A CHANCE, A REAL CHANCE, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IF WE ARE UNITED IN IT. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE LINES EVERYBODY REMEMBERS FROM JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECHES FROM GOING TO THE MOON? HE SAID ""THIS IS A CHALLENGE WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT,"" WITH THE LOVE LINE I LOVE MOST, HE SAID, ""WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE."" ""WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE."" I AM UNWILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE, SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, PICK OUR HEADS UP, AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS OUR. TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT DONE YET AND HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HUNGRY?

He talked about overcoming racial inequality and the need to strengthen the country&rsquo;s labor unions and middle class. Mr. Biden also discussed the previous night&rsquo;s Democratic presidential debate in which Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), also a presidential candidate, questioned his early political decisions as a young senator regarding civil rights.	462126-1	Speech		
CSPANJB47201912	Joe Biden	2019-07-04	Joe Biden Fourth of July Campaign Rally in Marshalltown, Iowa	THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT DISCLOSED WHETHER THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS. AS FAR AS THOSE WHO WILL BE JOINING HIM AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A VIP AREA FOR WHITE HOUSE GUEST. THAT WILL BE GOVERNMENT , OFFICIALS, FAMILY MEMBERS, CABINET AND FAMILY. NOTE TO MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA. DR. JILL BIDEN IS SPEAKING NOW. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THE BIDENS ARE A MILITARY FAMILY. MY FATHER WAS IN WORLD WAR II. OUR SON SERVED IN IRAQ AS A MEMBER OF THE DELAWARE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD. I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF NATIONAL GUARD FAMILIES HERE. HOW MANY NATIONAL GUARD ARE IN HERE? HOW MANY MILITARY ARE IN HERE TODAY? [APPLAUSE] TODAY WHEN WE CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DEFEND OUR LIBERTY WITH THEIR LIVES. IT IS NOT JUST THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES. IT IS THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T WEAR A UNIFORM, THEY ALSO SERVE. TODAY, I JUST GOT TO TOUR THE IOWA VETERANS,. [APPLAUSE] THE COMMANDANT AND HIS TEAM ARE REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB CREATING A COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THE PERSONAL SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH VETERAN IN THE VETERANS HOME. I WAS GRATEFUL TO , I ALSO MET MARK SMITH WHO JOINED ME , IS HE IN THE BACK? [APPLAUSE] THE COMMANDANT CALLED THE VETERANS HOME THE JEWEL OF IOWA. I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY A NICE WAY TO PHRASE IT. I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN MY SPEECH. I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE. JOE SAYS WE ONLY HAVE ONE SACRED OBLIGATION AND THAT IS TO BE FAMILIES WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY. HERE IN MARSHALLTOWN, YOU ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE THAT WE SHOULD MODEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE IOWA VETERANS HOME. AFTER THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SO MANY PEOPLE KEPT COMING UP TO ME AT A, IN THE GROCERY STORE, AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING. WE MISS JOE. TELL HIM TO RUN. [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE SAID THEY MISSED HIS DEEP EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY MISS THE KIND OF LEADER THAT HE IS. THEY MISS HIS DECISIVE CHARACTER. HIS KINDNESS. HIS EXPERIENCE AND ABILITY TO UNITE US. THE WAY HE INSPIRES US TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, NOT BEHIND US. AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE, THERE WAS A NEW URGENCY TO THE WORDS I KEPT HEARING. WE NEED HIM, JOE HAS TO RUN. WHEN WE HEAR ON THE NEWS TODAY, WE ARE TOLD THAT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN SUBDIVIDED. WE ARE TOLD THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE IRRECONCILABLE AND THAT THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN THEM AND US. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN HOW HATRED AND BIGOTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS, TORCHES IN HAND, CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER. OUR PROGRESS IS SLIPPING AWAY. WOMEN'S RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR ENVIRONMENT. SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. AND YET, I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE VISION ARE WRONG. WHEN I TRAVEL ACROSS THIS NATION, I SEE HOPE. I SEE PEOPLE WHO CARE, LIKE ALL OF YOU. I SEE PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES WHO COME TOGETHER TO STAND BESIDE EACH OTHER TO LIFT UP ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT JOE BIDEN IS FIGHTING FOR. [APPLAUSE] JUST BY YOUR BEING HERE, I KNOW THAT THAT IS HOW YOU CARE ABOUT AMERICA ALSO. IN JUST A FEW YEARS, SO MANY OF US HAVE LOST THE FAITH AND OUR INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR POLITICIANS. TODAY, WE MUST CHOOSE A PATH FORWARD. ONE OF DIVISION OR ONE OF DECENCY. ONE OF OPTIMISM OR ONE OF FEAR. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHOICES ARE ENORMOUS. THEY COULD CHANGE THE PATH WE CHOOSE FOR YEARS TO COME. AND YET, IT IS THE LITTLE MIRACLES THAT RESTORE MY FAITH. LAST WEEKEND, I MET COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS WHO DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVING IN A BETTER TOMORROW WHO MOVED TO IOWA TO WORK ON THE CAUCUSES. TEACHERS, AND I'M A TEACHER , [APPLAUSE] GIVING FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. VOLUNTEERS GIVING THEIR PRECIOUS TIME TO ORGANIZE THEIR PRECINCTS AREA PEOPLE WHO OUTRIGHT REJECT THE CYNICISM AND COMPLACENCY THAT IS SO TEMPTING AT TIMES. PEOPLE LIKE MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. JOE'S FAITH IN GOD, AND OUR COMMUNITIES, IN THE BOUNDLESS POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN IDEAL IS UNSHAKABLE. HIS FAITH IS THAT WE WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TO BE GREATER. THAT OUR COURAGE AND CONVICTIONS WILL LIVE OUT IN THE END IF WE ARE ALL UNIFIED. JOE BELIEVES THAT TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CAN'T DO. THAT IS WHY WE MUST ELECT JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO END TODAY BY SAYING THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP ON YOUR HOLIDAY. THANK YOU FOR CARING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FAITH IN BELIEVING IN THIS IDEA THAT IS BIGGER THAN ALL OF US. THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER NATION TOGETHER. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE ON OUR FOURTH OF JULY AND I HOPE JOE AND I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. NOW, IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT GUEST TO THE STAGE. HE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB LEADING THE TOWN AS LEADER OF MARSHALLTOWN. I HAVE ALSO HEARD HE HAS BEEN BUSY OUTSIDE OF WORK AS WELL. SINCE NOT ONE BUT TWO OF HIS DAUGHTERS ARE GETTING MARRIED THIS SUMMER AND FALL. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE HELP ME TO CONGRATULATE AND WELCOME MAYOR JOE GREER. MAYOR GREER: I AM ACCUSTOMED TO DOING THIS WITH A LEGAL PAD. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AND THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR A TRIAL LAWYER TO DO. [LAUGHTER] THERE IS SOME INTERESTING BACKGROUND SIMILAR BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND MAY. WE BOTH GREW UP IN AND I , IRISH CATHOLIC FAMILY. WE BOTH HAD ASTHMA AS CHILDREN AREA WE BOTH PLAYED FOOTBALL, WIDE RECEIVER AND HAVE ASKED. , HALF BACK. WE BOTH REGULATED WITH A MEDICAL SCIENCE DEGREE. WE BOTH WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. WE BOTH WORKED ON THE CITY COUNCIL. HIS FAMILY AND HOURS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY CANCER. I HAVE DONE THIS A LOT. I CRY ABOUT HALF THE TIME AND INTERVIEWS AND AS CONFERENCES. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. [APPLAUSE] IT STARTED WITH THE TORNADO AND IT HASN'T STOPPED. WE BELIEVE INTO THINGS. ONE IS TO HAVE A BALANCED JUDICIARY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT BALANCES OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR GREER: FINALLY, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I WENT TO WASHINGTON 15 YEARS IN A ROW TO LOBBY WITH THE CANCER SOCIETY TO GET MORE FUNDING. JOE BIDEN AND BARACK OBAMA, WE GOT THAT DONE. OUR FAMILY HAS PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE INSURANCE IF WE DID NOT HAVE THAT. BLESS THEM FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR GREER: I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR PAST VICE PRESIDENT AND MAYBE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER OR ARE FIGHTING IT NOW? THAT IS WHY YOU ALL KNOW, IT NEVER FUNDAMENTALLY GOES AWAY. THAT IS WHY I THINK FOR JILL AND ME, AND FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF, WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU RELIVE IT IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE MAKING ENORMOUS PROGRESS. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SEE TO IT THAT WE AND CANCER AS WE KNOW IT AND WE CAN DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON AND OUR BACKGROUNDS EXCEPT I ONLY HAD ONE DAUGHTER THAT MARRIED AT ONE TIME AREA. YOU HAVE TO. WHAT WILL WHILE. YOU THINK I'M KIDDING BUT , THE COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHAIR SAID INSIDE THAT IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THANKLESS JOB IN AMERICAN POLITICS BUT THANK YOU FOR DOING IT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK JIM, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UAW. WE HAVE AN EXPRESSION IN DELAWARE THAT IS THE UAW IS THE ONE THAT PROBABLY TO THE DANCE. IN THE EARLY DAYS, WE HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UAW WORKERS OF ANY STATE INCLUDING MICHIGAN. IT IS SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR WORKERS IN SUCH A SMALL STATE. WHERE THE LARGEST GM PLANT OUTSIDE OF DETROIT AND THE SECOND , A ARE ALL GONE NOW. THEY ARE THE FIRST OUTFIT TO ENDORSE THIS 29-YEAR-OLD KID WHEN I RAN. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE UFC W. ROGER IS THE PRESIDENT AND THEY DID A COUPLE GREAT MONTHS LATELY. PARTICULARLY IN MASSACHUSETTS. STICK WITH THEM, WE ARE COMING BACK. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES, I MAY UNION GUY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IS THAT WHAT AMERICA WORKERS ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IS THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A 40 HOUR WEEK, SO WE OWE YOU. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CANNOT IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN IOWA CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE DAY. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE PROMISE FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE. IT WAS OVER 200 YEARS AGO GUYS PLEDGED THEIR LIVES AND HONOR , FORTUNES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE LEARN ALL THAT IN SCHOOL. EVER SINCE THEN, PRESIDENTS AND PATRIOTS HAVE GATHERED TO REFLECT ON WHAT THE GREATER MEETING OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT IS. JUST AFTER THE REVOLUTION JOHN QUINCY ADAMS CLAIMED AMERICA'S GLORY IS NOT DOMINION, BUT LIBERTY. IN 1861, ABRAHAM LINCOLN VOTED TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THE CIVIL WAR, REMINDING CONGRESS THERE WILL BE STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN THE WARRIOR , THE WORLD WHOSE MEANING IS TO ELEVATE THE CONDITION OF ALL MEN. I KNOW IT IS HIGH SOUNDING WORDS HE LEARNED IN SCHOOL, BUT IT IS HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE. 1962, I WAS GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND JOHN QUINCY THE CLARITY THIS NATION CONCEIVED BY LIBERTY AND MATURING INDEPENDENCE AS NO INTENTION OF ADVOCATING ITS LEADERSHIP TO ANY SOCIETY COMMITTED TO SYSTEMATIC HUMAN OPPRESSION. WE ARE UNITED IN THE FACE AND THE POWER OF THIS IDEA, CONSTANT DEDICATION TO PURSUE HUMANKIND'S HIGHEST A DEAL WHICH IS LIBERTY. I WONDERED, WHAT WOULD DONALD TRUMP SAY THIS EVENING? WHEN HE SPEAKS TO THE NATION IN AN EVENT DESIGNED TO STROKE HIS EGO MORE THAN AMERICA'S IDEALS. WILL HE OFFER DEMOCRATIC VALUES TO STRENGTHEN THE TIMES IN CRISIS? HE IS INCAPABLE OF CELEBRATING WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE GETS IT. [APPLAUSE] HE HAS TROUBLE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN OUR ENEMIES AND OUR ALLIES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERGIRD , HE DOESN'T GRASP GREATER UNDERSTANDING, THE PURSUIT OF FULFILLMENT. IF DONALD TRUMP HAS EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE NATION. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] WHETHER OR NOT I'M NO NOMINEE , I'M GOING TO WORK TO SEE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN RECALL SOMEONE WHO EMBRACES DICTATORS AND OBJECTS TO EVERYTHING OUR FOUNDERS WROTE ABOUT. KIM JONG-UN, FOOD AND, MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN , PUTIN COME UP MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN , KIM JONG-UN, PUTIN, MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN. [NO AUDIO] LAST WEEK, AND HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE SAID THE WESTERN IDEAL HAS BECOME OBSOLETE, BUT HERE IS TRUMP'S RESPONSE. DONALD TRUMP THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT A JOKE. OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES IN A POLITICAL CONTEXT. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THE LIBERAL IDEA IS AN AMERICAN IDEAL. WE HAVE PATRIOTS COMMITTED TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. THE LIBERAL IDEA IS WHAT DRIVES ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION. IT INSPIRES ART, EXPLORATION, HUMAN CURIOSITY. THAT IS WHAT WE MEAN AND CRITICALLY, IT IS WHAT BUILT THE FREE WORLD. IT IS AN AMERICAN DESIGN TO HOLD IN CHECK ABUSES OF POWER BY ANYONE NATION, A FIRM A COLLECTIVE DEFENSE, OPEN ECONOMIES, HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT IS WHY THERE IS NATO MUST SO NO SINGLE NATION COULD STEP OUT AND ABUSE POWER. THE FREE WORLD DROVE THE MARK , MARCH OF DEMOCRACY. IT ALLOWED UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH THE WORLD HAD NEVER SEEN. BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT IS WHY PUTIN WANTS TO DESTROY IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AMERICA IS THE HEART OF THE FREE WORLD. THAT IS NOT A HYPERBOLE. WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT HEART BEATING STRONGLY AND DEFEND IT. THAT IS HOW THE FOURTH OF JULY IS BEST HONORED, REMEMBERING OUR DECLARATION IS THE CALL TO ARMS IN THE DEFENSE AGREEMENT. JFK PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID OURS IS NOT AN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY OF ONE, IT IS INDIVISIBLE LIBERTY OF ALL. I HONESTLY GOD DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP GET EITHER ONE OF THOSE CONCEPTS. MY LIBERTY DEPENDS ON YOURS. OUR LIBERTY RESTS ON OUR ABILITY TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN, BUT ALL CHILDREN. WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN ALL OF HER CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS. WE HAVE TO TAKE ON THE EQUITIES OF OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE CAUSING TOO MANY TODAY TO QUESTION THEIR FAITH AND THEIR DEMOCRACY TO DELIVER FOR THEM. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE AGAINST THE WAY DONALD TRUMP CONDUCTS SELF. AND/OR KNOWS WHO HE IS. THE WAY HE INSULTS WOMEN, POOR PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO BE AGAINST HIS POLICIES THAT ARE CREATING DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] QUITE FRANKLY, THOSE POLICIES ARE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AGAINST THE LOWER CLASS AND WORKING CLASS. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA NO LONGER BELIEVE THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE LIFE THAT THEY HAD , A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY HAD. THAT TOO IS AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY WHEN THAT HAPPENS. I KNOW THEY CALL ME LOW CLASS JOE, BUT I KNOW WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. IT WAS THE NO CLASS. THAT IS THE MESSAGE I HAVE BEEN CARRYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE AND IT IS CLEAR TODAY ON A DAY WE CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE. OUR COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET CEOS, HEDGE FUND MANAGERS, IT WAS BUILT BY ALL OF YOU. GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE, THINK ABOUT THIS. AMERICA HAS GIVEN HALF A CHANCE HAVE NEVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN, NOT ONE TIME IN HISTORY IN WAR OR PEACE. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF AMERICA, GIVING REAL PEOPLE REALTY IS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE WAS A WHITE-COLLAR WORKER AND EVERY TIME WE MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE, HE SAID JOEY, THE JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOCATE YOUR CHILD AND SAY IT WILL BE OK AND MEAN IT. TODAY, SOME PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT . THAT IS MY NORTH STAR. I THINK WE HAVE TO BOOT , REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS AND BRING EVERYBODY ALONE THE MATTER THEIR RACE, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE. ME, IT IS ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF WORK, PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND JOY FOR THEIR FAMILIES. HOW CAN A PERSON MAINTAIN DIGNITY IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO CARE FOR THEIR SICK CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER? THINK ABOUT IT. HOW CAN YOU SUSTAIN YOUR DIGNITY IF YOUR CHILD HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION? HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN YOUR DIGNITY WHEN YOUR CHILD IS SUFFERING FROM AN INTERNAL DISEASE? I CAN'T IMAGINE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF TERMINAL CANCER. I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT OUR WIFE AND TWO GRANDKIDS IF THEY HAD SAID TIME'S UP, THE LAST FOUR MONTHS YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. THINK ABOUT IT. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEIR CHILD HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THEM THERE. MY DAD HAD A GOOD JOB. A HOUSE, FOR KIDS AND MY MOM AND DAD. IT WAS A HAPPY PLACE. I LOOK BACK AND EITHER UNDERSTAND WHY MOM WOULD MOVE , WOULD NEVER MOVE IT TO ME , MOVED IN WITH ME AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY ALL STOP I REMEMBER WHEN MY MY FATHER FELT WHEN I COULD GET IN THE COLLEGE AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. HE SAID I'M SO ASHAMED. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK IN HIS FACE. LOOK IT FOR PEOPLE TODAY. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HAVING A DISCUSSION TODAY WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN CHINA. HOW MANY ARE YOU GOING TO SAY YOU CAN'T GO BACK NEXT SEMESTER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. THEY DON'T CARE ON THE , ABOUT THE DIGNITY. THEY ARE SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS AND MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER. 40% OF WORKERS HAVE TO DO IS , HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT. THEY HAVE ONE PURPOSE. TO HOLD DOWN WAGES. JIMMY JOHN'S, YOU HAVE TO SIGN YOU CAN'T COMPETE. YOU COULD NOT GO ACROSS TOWN TO GET $.20 MORE WORKING AT MCDONALD'S OR ANY WORLD. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUPPRESSING WAGES AND INCREASING PROFITS FOR CORPORATIONS? FOR SIMPLE REASON. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME. IT COST MORE THAN 4 MILLION HOURLY WORKERS $1.2 BILLION. 4 MILLION WORKERS WHO ARE RECLASSIFIED OR HAD TO SIGN NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS. $1.2 BILLION LAST GOING TO THEM. HIGHEST PROFIT RATES THEY EVER HAD. USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN. TO HOW THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. SPEAKING OF OVERTIME, IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO BE A $15 FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. FOLKS, IT IS TIME WE START TO AWARD WORK OVER WEALTH IN THE COUNTRY. THE STOCK MARKET IS ROARING. HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOUR LIVES? HAS , IS IT REALLY MOVING? HOW ABOUT THE TRUMP TAX CUT? DO YOU FEEL IT? YOU WILL FILL IT . IT COSTS ALMOST $2 TRILLION. WE WILL HAVE TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID, NOT A JOKE. FOLKS, IT IS A SHAM. THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID IT. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN, SO WE NEED THE REVENUE THAT TRUMP HAS PUT IN THE WRONG HANDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T NEED THE HELP. AS I SAY TO WEALTHY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, THE LAST PEOPLE WHO NEED A TAX CUT ARE PEOPLE MAKING $10 MILLION OR MORE PER YEAR. [APPLAUSE] SECONDLY, WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE CAPITAL GAINS LOOPHOLES. AN ECONOMY THAT ADVANCES THE ECONOMY IS NOT , MAKING LESS THAN A FIREFIGHTER OR TEACHER. YOU COULD BE MAKING $200 MILLION AND PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE TEACHING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. ALSO, AN IMPORTANT LESSON WE LEARNED. BEN FRANKLIN SUPPOSEDLY SAID THIS. HE SAID WE MUST ALL HANG TOGETHER FOR MOST ASSUREDLY WE WILL ALL HANG SEPARATELY. THAT IS MY MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CHANGE. WE NEED TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY AND OVERCOME THE STATUS QUO. [APPLAUSE] WE REALLY HAVE TO. I KNOW SOME DEMOCRATS SAY NO COMPROMISE WILL STOP WE CAN COMPROMISE WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR PRINCIPLES. THE WADE WHICH HE DEALT WITH THIS, YOU CAME TOGETHER AND MUCH MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE, BUT WORKING TOGETHER, YOU ARE WELL ON YOUR WAY, BUT THIS IS THE PLACE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO BE MORE DEEPLY ENGAGED. WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH FOLKS, ALL THAT MATTERED IS GETTING MARSHALLTOWN BACK ON ITS FEET. IT GOES TO SLOW AND ALL THAT STANDS IN THE WAY IS A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. FOR ALL OUR PROBLEMS, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY THEN WHEN I RAN AND GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE. THEY REAPPORTIONED MY DISTRICT TO ABOUT 70% AND SO I DECIDED TO GET IN OR GET OUT. HERE'S WHY I THINK I'M ALL , SO OPTIMISTIC. I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE POSITION TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. FOLKS, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY, NO ONE IS CLOSE. OUR MILITARY IS BIGGER THAN THE NEXT SEVEN. PEOPLE LOOK TO AMERICA BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. WE ARE AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES HERE IN IOWA AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED AND EVERY MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL BREAKER HAS COME OUT OF THOSE UNIVERSITIES MONETIZED BY BUSINESSES. NO OTHER NATION CAN MATCH IF WE REMEMBER WHO WE ARE AND INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE. THE ONLY THING BACK IN TERROR AMERICA APART IS CIRCUIT ITSELF AND THAT IS WHAT IS TRYING TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW TO MAINTAIN POWER, SEPARATE US BASED ON RACE, NATURAL ORIGIN, BASED ON RELIGION. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THE LIBERAL IDEA OBSOLETE BUSINESS IF WE WALK AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A NATION THAT WILLED OURSELVES IN EXISTENCE WITH NOTHING BUT THE POWER OF AN IDEA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY THING WE CAN'T DO. NOTHING, NOT A JOKE. THERE'S NOTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO AS A NATION THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. I REMEMBER FROM THE TIME THAT I WAS A KID TO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO TODAY, THE ONE THAT GOT ME THE MOST WAS THE PHRASE HE USED, HE WAS ASKED WHY DO YOU DO THIS AND HE SAID I REFUSE TO POSTPONE, LEADING THE TREE , LEADING THE COUNTRY TO MOVE. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO THIS. I PROMISE YOU. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] I WAS DOWN IN MIAMI AND ASKING WHEN IS JOE TAPING? YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE BROOM SMASHING GLASS? I GAVE THAT TO YOU AND I WAS CITY. YOU SMASH ON THE GROUND AND THEN WE PRAY TO LINCOLN TO HEAL IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SMASHED THE GLASS THE GLASS. MY NAME IS SARAH, AND I KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I AM A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND I WAS AT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARING AND TO SEE SOMEONE SO UNFIT IN THIS UP IN COURT IS DEVASTATING, AND I AM CONCERNED, WITH EVERYTHING TALKED ABOUT TODAY, IMMIGRATION, EVERYTHING , WELL, THANK YOU. I MEAN, I THINK I AM, IT'S JUST, IT DOES BRING IT BACK, AND I AM VERY CONCERNED, NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP BUT A DECADE-LONG STRATEGY ON THE PART OF THE GOP TO APPOINT PEOPLE LIKE CAVANAUGH , KAVANAUGH. AGAIN, GUESS WHAT? WE HAD A BIPARTISAN BILL PASSED WITH $740 MILLION TO CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES, TO CUT IT OUT. IT MAKES NO SENSE NOT TO. YOU CAN'T TURN ON A LIGHT SWITCH, WHEN THERE'S NO LIGHT. WE CAN CHANGE THIS. JOE. JOE.

CSPANJB117201913	Joe Biden	2019-07-11	Former Vice President Joe Biden Speech on Foreign Policy	THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PAROL IN PLACE AGREEMENT TO NOT DEPORT THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON DEPLOYMENT. CAN YOU , HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE THE PRESIDENT ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF TAKING THIS WHERE THE DHS IS SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO RESUME DEPORTATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF DEPLOYED SERVICE MEMBERS? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM FACING THIS ISSUE AT HOME, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE DOWN-RANGE? I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'VE READ A HEADLINE ON IT THE OTHER DAY. I WOULD NEED TO DIG INTO EXACTLY WHAT DHS IS SAYING AND WHAT THEY PLAN ON DOING. OUR SOLDIERS ARE DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY, AND THEIR FAMILIES DESERVE THE PROTECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. SENATOR REID. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR JOINING US AND CONGRATULATIONS ON WHAT I THINK WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL NEW JOB SOON. THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE OF TWO IMPORTANT THINGS SUCH AS CHINA AND RUSSIA DEVELOPING NEW WEAPONS SYSTEMS. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NUCLEAR TRIED A AND THE IMPORTANCE. I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ONE OF THE THREE LEGS OF THE TRIAD WITH YOU IF I COULD. THE GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC DETERRENCE HAS BEEN THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL, I GUESS OF THE THREE. ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY. THERE'S BEEN SOME ABOUT ITS FUTURE. OF COURSE, THREE MISSILES THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD REPLACE ARE THOUGHT TO BE PROBABLY TIMING OUT SOMETIME IN THE 2030 RANGE. SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY THAT I REFER TO HAS TO DO WITH SOME THINKING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE GBSD, RECONSIDER, RE-EVALUATE THE DECISION BY THE AIR FORCE HAS BEEN TO MOVE FORWARD. A GOOD DECISION, I BELIEVE. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STICKING TO THAT TIME FRAME OF GETTING OUT THE RFP, MOVING FORWARD WITH THE 600 OR SO NEW MISSILES UNDER , IN THE GBSD AND WHY STICKING WITH THAT TIMEFRAME IS IMPORTANT. WELL, THE TIMEFRAME, I THINK , IT HAS TO DO WITH THE AGING FLEET, IF YOU WILL. NOT ONLY OF THE MISSILES BUT THE BOMBERS AND THE SUBS AS WELL. SO ALL PIECES OF THE NUCLEAR TRIAD DO NEED TO BE MODERNIZED AND OVERHAULED AND UPDATED. THEY'RE REACHING THE END OF THEIR SERVICE LIFE. AND ONE THING THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE, SAFERNUCLEAR STRATEGIC RESPONSE OPTION FOR LEADERS TO CONSIDER. I THINK THE GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC, THE MISSILES, I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO THAT. AND WE NEED TO DO IT AND DO IT IN THE TIME THE AIR FORCE HAS RECOMMENDED. APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO , THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE TO SPACE. I THINK IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A SPACE DOMAIN IN RESPONSE TO THAT, THE ADMINISTRATION AS YOU KNOW HAS PROPOSED A SPACE FORCE THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT PASSED BY BOTH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE INCLUDING THE POSTURE OF A STANDING UP A SPACE FORCE. A COUPLE OUTF THE AREAS I WORKED HARD ON REGARDING THE LEADERSHIP, I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR COMMENTS. I'M SPEAKING TO AFTER ONE YEAR OF THE SPACE FORCE BEING ESTABLISHED, WE HAVE THAT THE COMMANDER WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A DUAL STATUS COMMANDER. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WOULD BE A SPECIFIC FORCE JUST FOR THE SPACE FORCE. THAT WAS PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED. A LITTLE MORE CONTROVERSIAL, AGAIN. THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOUR COMMENTS ON, WOULD BE WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT AFTER A YEAR, AGAIN, THAT THE COMMANDER WOULD ANSWER DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE RATHER THAN TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND THEN ALSO AFTER A YEAR THAT THE , THAT YOU'D HAVE A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF RATHER THAN A SITUATIONAL MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. TRYING TO MODEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE MARINE/NAVY RELATIONSHIP. AND WE DID IT IN A WAY TO HAVE SOME INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT, SOME TRANSITION TO AVOID A MAJOR BUREAUCRACY. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE JOB YOU'RE SEEKING WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND JUST BE INTERESTED IN YOUR OPINIONS. WELL, I WOULD OFFER YOU THIS. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE STEPS ARE APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT. AND I THINK THE DUAL HATTING OF GENERAL RAYMOND FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS APPROPRIATE. AND THEN AS WE GO DOWN AND LEARN OUR LESSONS, ET CETERA, AND DEVELOP THAT AND PROTOTYPE IT AND THEN WE CAN SPLIT IT OFF INTO A SPACE FORCE AND SPACE COMMAND. I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND I THINK HAVING HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS I THINK IS ALSO APPROPRIATE. IN ANSWERING TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE IS APPROPRIATE. THE BROADER , WE'LL WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS BUT THE BROADER ISSUE IS THE RECOGNITION AND I THINK THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I APPLAUD THE AIR FORCE FOR DOING IT AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE SUSTAIN IT. THE RECOGNITION OF SPACE AS A DOMAIN OF MILITARY OPERATIONS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WISHED IT WOULDN'T BE SO. BUT IT IS. AND , MR. PRESIDENT, CHANCELLOR, THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US AND FOR WELCOMING GENERATIONS, LITERALLY GENERATIONS OF NEW AMERICANS TO A WIDER AND BIGGER AND MORE OPTIMISTIC FUTURE. YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE FOR SO LONG, AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL INCLUDING YOU PROPROVOST. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHO DOES A LOT OF THE WORK HERE, BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO USE THAT FORA. POLITICAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT AMERICANS, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOESN'T VOTE ON FOREIGN POLICY. BUT I THINK THAT'S AN OLD WAY OF THINKING. IN 2019 FOREIGN POLICY IS DOMESTIC POLICY IN MY VIEW. AND DOMESTIC POLICY IS FOREIGN POLICY. THEY'RE DEEPLY CONNECTED. A DEEPLY CONNECTED SET OF CHOICES WE MAKE ABOUT HOW TO ADVANCE THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE AND OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE. LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ELECTION, THE THREAT THAT I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP POSES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY IS EXTREME. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE IT. HIS ERRATIC POLICIES AND FAILURES TO UPHOLD BASIC DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES HAVE MUDDLED OUR REPULATION AND OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD, AND I QUITE FRANKLY BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD. SO LET ME START TODAY BY REMINDING EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE , WHAT HAS BEEN LOST WITH THE CHEST THUMPING AND SELF-INFLECTED SETBACKS AND THE MANUFACTURED CRISES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. FOLKS, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, I THINK, HAS TO BE PURPOSEFUL AND INSPIRING. BASED ON CLEAR GOALS, DRIVEN BY SOUND STRATEGIES. NOT BY TWITTER TANTRUMS. AND THE OVERARCHING PURPOSE OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY, I BELIEVE, MUST BE TO DEFEND AND ADVANCE OUR SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES THAT THE UNITED STATES STANDS FOR. EVERY PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, IN MODERN HISTORY PRIOR TO DONALD TRUMP HAS UNDERSTOOD AND CARRIED OUT THIS BASIC DIRECTIVE. OFTEN IMPERFECTLY, BUT HAVE , WE'VE NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY ABANDONEDABANDONED. I KNEW WHEN I SAW DONALD TRUMP RESPOND TO THE EVENTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, SIGNING A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO PROMOTED HATE AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT, THAT THE THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY WAS UNLIKE ANY TIME AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER TRUMP AGAIN STOOD BEFORE THE PRESS. THIS TIME ON FOREIGN SOIL IN HELSINKI. AND REPEATEDLY DEFERRED TO VLADIMIR PUTIN OVER AMERICAN INTEREST, THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, AND I WOULD ARGUE OVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S INTEREST. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL PERFORMANCES BY A U.S. PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY. AND ONE OF , ONE WHERE WE SAW REPEATED AGAIN THAT LAST MONTH AT THE G-20 SUMMIT WHERE TRUMP SMIRKED ALONG WITH PUTIN MAKING A JOKE OUT OF RUSSIA'S VERY REAL AND VERY DANGEROUS ASSAULT ON OUR ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS. TRUMP'S VIEW AND MY VIEW, THE BASES ARE CHERISH DEMOCRATIC VALUES. AT THE VERY TIME A SIN CO-FANT TO A STRONG MAN HE REFUSES THAT ROLE. REFUSES TO CONDEMN SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE GRUESOME MURDER OF A JOURNALIST AND AMERICAN RESIDENT, AND WHEN HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A MURDEROUS DICTATOR IN NORTH KOREA. I KNOW IT'S NOT LITERAL, BUT THINK WHAT MESSAGE IT SOUNDS AROUND , SENDS AROUND THE WORLD. HE UNDERMINES OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCES WHILE EMBRACING DICTATORS WHO APPEAL TO HIS VANITY. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE WORLD SEES TRUMP FOR WHAT HE IS. INSINCERE, ILL INFORMED AND IMPULSIVE AND AT TIMES CORRUPT. IT'S WHY WE'VE SEEN SUCH A DROP IN HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD VIEWS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ONE RECENT POLL FOUND AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IS NOW LESS RESPECTED THAN CHINA'S AND ON PAR WITH RUSSIA'S. AND IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, WE'LL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY OF EVER BEING ABLE TO RECOVER AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE WORLD IN OUR CAPACITY TO BRING NATIONS TOGETHER. IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED. I THINK IT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND TO OUR FUTURE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD REMIND THE WORLD THAT WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND WE DO NOT CODDLE DICTATORS. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA GIVES HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. THERE WILL BE NO MORE CHARLOTTESVILLES. NO MORE HELSINKIS. THE CHALLENGE OF FOLLOWING THIS DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY WILL NOT BE JUST TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF OUR CREDIBILITY. IT WILL BE TO ENACT A FORWARD-LOOKING FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE WORLD AS WE FIND IT TODAY. AND AS WE ANTICIPATE IT WILL BE TOMORROW AND YEARS TO COME. MUCH HAS SHIFTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE IS MORE CROWDED, COMPETITIVE, AND COMPLICATED. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY TWO KEY POINTS JUMP OUT TO ME. ONE IS THAT THE SPEED AND INTENSITY OF THE GRAVEST DANGERS MEANS THAT THE FATES OF NATIONS ARE MORE INTERTWINED THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN. CLIMATE CHANGE. NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM. FIBER WAR , CYBER WARFARE. MASS MIGRATION. WE'RE MOVING LIKE MOORE'S LAW IS MOVING. NONE OF THEM CAN BE RESOLVED BY THE UNITED STATES ALONE OR ANY NATION ACTING ALONE. AMERICAN SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND OUR WAY OF LIFE REQUIRES THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE NETWORK OF PARTNERS AND ALLIANCES WORKING ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER. DONALD TRUMP'S BRAND OF AMERICA FIRST HAS TOO OFTEN LED TO AMERICA ALONE. MAKING IT MUCH HARDER TO MOBILIZE OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE THREATS TO OUR COMMON WELL BEING. THE SECOND CONCERN IS THE RAPID ADVANCE OF AUTHORITARIANISM, NATIONALISM AND ILL LIBERAL TEN TEN DIS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT JUST IN RUSSIA AND CHINA BUT ALSO FROM OUR ALLIES. PLACES LIKE TURKEY, THE PHILIPPINES, HUNGARY, AND EVERY PART OF THE WORLD TECHNOLOGY AND INSTANT INFORMATION ARE DRIVING CHANGE AT UNPRECEDENTED SPEED AND SCOPE, CAUSING MANY PEOPLE HOME AND ABROAD TO FEEL CONFUSED AND VERY VULNERABLE. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS PARALYZED BY HYPER PARTISANSHIP. HOBBLED BY CONSTRUCTION ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME DELIVERING TO THEIR PEOPLE. TRUST AND INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD IS DOWN AND FEAR OF THE OTHER IS WAY UP. TOGETHER IN MY VIEW THESE FORCES HAVE DRIVEN DANGEROUS RESURGENCE OF EXTREME NATIONALISM AND LIBERALISM, OF PROTECTIONISM AND XENOPHOBIA. AND DONALD TRUMP AND THE DEMAGOGUES AROUND THE WORLD ARE LEANING INTO THESE FORCES FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN. BUT IN MY VIEW, IF WE FOCUS, THIS IS NOT A MOMENT TO FEAR. IT'S A TIME FOR US TO TAP INTO THE STRENGTH AND AUDACITY THAT TOOK US TO VICTORY IN TWO WORLD WARS AND BROUGHT DOWN THE IRON CURTAIN. THAT TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY AND LIBERALISM OVER FASCISM AND AWE TO BE AUTOCRACY IS WHAT CREATED THE FREE WORLD. IT WILL DEFINE OUR FUTURE. TODAY DEMOCRACY IS UNDER DEPENDENCE PRESSURE MORE THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE 30s. FREEDOM HOUSE REPORTED THAT OF THE 41 COUNTRIES CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS FREE FROM 1985 TO 2005, 22 HAVE REGISTERED NET DECLINES IN FREEDOM IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. YET WHILE THE WORLD'S DEMOCRACIES LOOK TO AMERICA TO STAND FOR THE VALUES THAT UNITE US AND TRULY LEAD THE FREE WORLD, DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ON THE OTHER TEAM. WHILE THOSE LIVING UNDER OPPRESSION, YEARNING FOR FREEDOM LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES FOR HOPE, TRUMP HAS NOTHING REALLY TO OFFER. WE CAN'T FORGET THE DEMOCRACY IS THE ROAD OUR SOCIETY, THE ROOT AND WELLSPRING OF OUR POWER, AND THE SOURCE OF OUR RENEWAL. IT STRENGTHENS AND AMPLIFIES OUR LEADERSHIP TO KEEP US SAFE IN THE WORLD AND IT'S THE ENGINE OF OUR INJI KNEWTY THAT HAS DRIVEN ALL OUR ECONOMIC PROCESS AND PROGRESS. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. AND HOW WE SEE THE WORLD, BUT MAYBE EQUALLY IMPORTANT, HOW THE WORLD SEES US. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ENSURE THE DEMOCRACY IS ONCE AGAIN THE WATCH WORD OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. NOT TO LAUNCH SOME MORAL CRUSADE BUT BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST. WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR ABILITY TO RALLY THE FREE WORLD SO WE CAN ONCE MORE MAKE A STAND UPON NEW FIELDS OF ACTION TOGETHER TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES. WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY TO RESET THIS DEMOCRACY AFTER TRUMP. AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN PRACTICE? FIRST, IT MEANS REPAIRING AND REINVIGORATING OUR OWN DEMOCRACY. EVEN AS WE STRENGTHEN COALITIONS TO DEMOCRACIES THAT STAND WITH US ON OTHER CONTINENT. I'LL START BY PUTTING OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. REMAKING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO THE CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY LIFE ISN'T DETERMINED BY THEIR ZIP CODE OR THEIR RACE. REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ELIMINATES DISCREPANCIES IN THE SYSTEM AND PUTTING TEETH BACK INTO OUR VOTING RIGHTS ACT. I WILL SEEK GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEMS. WE NEED TO GET BIG MONEY OUT ALTOGETHER AND ENSURE THAT FOREIGN DARK MONEY DOESN'T CONTINUE TO POLLUTE OUR POLITICS. WE NEED IN MY VIEW TO DEDICATE GREATER RESOURCES INCLUDING CYBER RESOURCES TO DEFENDING OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM WHICH IS STILL UNDER SIEGE. I SERVED AS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMISSION ON ELECTION INTEGRITY TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST RUSSIA'S ATTACKS ON WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. WE ASKED CANDIDATES ACROSS EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA TO SIGN A PLEDGE COMMITTING TO TRANSPARENCY IN CAMPAIGN FINANCES AND TO REJECT THE USE OF FABRICATED AND HACKED MATERIAL. NOW THAT I'M A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE, I'VE SIGNED THAT PLEDGE MYSELF. AND I URGE EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SIGN THAT SAME PLEDGE. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A NATION, WE HAVE TO PROVE TO THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARED TO LEAD, NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. TO THAT END, AS PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TO RENEW OUR AMERICAN VALUES BY RETURNING TRANSPARENCY TO OUR GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THOOS THAT'S WHY I'LL END THE MUSLIM BAN. WE BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH. THAT'S WHY I WILL END THE GAG RULE, THE GLOBAL GAG RULE THAT PREVENTS MONEY FROM GETTING NGOs WHO'VEN TALK ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING. WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF FREE PRESS. THAT'S WHY I'LL RETURN IMMEDIATELY TODAYLY PRESS BRIEFINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THOSE WORDS, THOSE LITERAL WORDS, NATION OF IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE STATEMENT, THE MISSION STATEMENT OF OUR CITIZEN AND IMMIGRATIONS SERVICES. I'LL RESTORE THE WORDS. IT MATTERS. OUR STATUE OF LIBERTY SAYS INVITES US AND WELCOME THE TIRED, THE POOR, THE HUDDLED MASSES, YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. I'LL REVERSE TRUMP'S DETRIMENT TALL ASYLUM POLICIES, RAISE OUR TARGET FOR REFUGEES TO A LEVEL COMMENSURATE WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND THE UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL NEED THAT EXISTS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD IMMEDIATELY END THE HORRIFIC PRACTICE OF SEPARATING FAMILIES AT OUR BORDERS, HOLDING CHILDREN FOR PROFIT DETENTIONS. THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO DO THAT AND STILL PROTECT OUR BORDERS. I'D ORDER A REVIEW OF THE TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO CANNOT FULLY BELIEVE AND FIND THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. RIPPED APART BY VIOLENCE AND DISASTERS INCLUDING VENEZUELANS AND HAITIANS. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION THAT CHOOSES SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND FROM CLIMATE CHANGE TO STANDARDS TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS TO GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY, WE'RE GOING TO RETURN FACTS TO OUR POLICY MAKING. I'LL RENEW A GOVERNMENT WIDE FOCUS ON UPLIFTING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS AT HOME AND ABROAD AND REVIETTALIZE OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE CHANGES AND MANY MORE WHICH I RELEASED ON OUR WEBSITE ARE JUST THE START, A DAY ONE DOWN PAYMENT ON OUR COMMITMENT TO LIVING OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AT HOME. AND THEN I WILL INVITE FELLOW DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND I MEAN THIS. INVITE FELLOW DEMOCRATIC LEADERS TO PUT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY BACK IN THE GLOBAL STAGE. I WILL ORGANIZE AND HOST IN THE UNITED STATES DURING MY FIRST YEAR IN ADMINISTRATION WERE I TO BE ELECTED A GLOBAL SUMMIT FOR DEMOCRACY. RENEWAL OF THE SPIRIT AND SHARED PURPOSE OF THE NATION'S OF THE FREE WORLD. BUILDING OFF THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL WE INSTITUTED DURING THE OBAMA/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WITH THE NUCLEAR SAFETY SUMMIT. LEADERS WHO ATTEND MUST COME PREPARED TO COOPERATE AND MAKE CONCRETE COMMITMENTS TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION AND ADVANCE HUMAN RIGHTS IN THEIR OWN NATIONS. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT , EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT OUR FRIENDS THAT ARE FALLING SHORT AND FORGE A COMMON AGENDA TO ADDRESS THE GREATEST THREATS TO OUR SHARED VALUES. WE'LL INCLUDE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT STAND ON THE FRONT LINES IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY IN THEIR COUNTRIES. WE'LL CHALLENGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR INCLUDING THE TECH COMPANIES AND SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN COMMITMENTS. AMERICA'S OPENNESS FUEL THEIR SUCCESS. I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A DUTY TO MAKE SURE THEIR ALGORITHM AND PLATFORMS ARE NOT MISUSED TO SEW DIVISION HERE AT HOME OR EMPOWER THEIR SURVEILLANCE STATES TO BE ABLE TO FACILITY THEIR OPPRESSION AND SENSORSHIP IN CHINA OR ELSEWHERE. TO SPREAD HATE OR TO SPUR PEOPLE TO VIOLENCE. SECONDLY, I WILL EQUIP OUR PEOPLE TO SUCCEED IN THE NEW GLOBAL ECONOMY WITH A FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. TO TWIN THE COMPETITION OF THE FUTURE, WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON SHARPENING OUR INNOVATIVE EDGE, UNITING ECONOMIC MIGHT OF OUR FRIENDS AND OTHER ABUSIVE PRACTICES TO TAKE THEM ON. WE KNOW THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE HURTING BECAUSE WE'VE NEGLECTED THE BASICS. OUR TRADE POLICY HAS A START AT HOME BY STRENGTHENING BY STRENGTHENING OUR GREATEST ASSET, THE MIDDLE CLASS. FOR WHEN IT DOES WELL, EVERYONE DOES WELL. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BY GIVING EVERY STUDENT THE SKILL AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO COMPETE IN THE 21st CENTURY FOR THE JOBS OF THE 21st CENTURY. AMERICA HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INVIGORATE THAT CLASS. INVESTING AND REBUILDING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BRIDGES, ROADS, MODERNIZING AIRPORTS, HIGH SPEED RAIL, MAKING SURE AMERICANS HAVE ACCESS TO BROAD BAND NETWORKS. REFORMING OUR TAXES TO REWARD WORK NOT JUST WEALTH. LISTENING AND LEADING ON A CLEAN ECONOMY REVOLUTION TO CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PAY WELL ALLOWING US EVENTUALLY TO EXPORT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES OVERSEAS. I'LL INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THE CORNER STONE OF MY PRESIDENCY WILL BE JUST THAT SO THE UNITED STATES IS THE LEADING , LEADING THE CHARGE FOR INNOVATION AROUND THE WORLD. THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULD BE FAILING OR FALLING BEHIND ANYONE. CHINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE, WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY, QUANTUM COMPUTING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, 5G, HIGH SPEED RAIL. FOLKS, WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH FACILITIES. MORE THAN ANYWHERE IN THE REST OF THE WORD COMBINED. WE CANNOT ENSURE OUR PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THIS TRANSITION? THAT IT WILL ACCOMPANY ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY, IT WOULD BE A DISASTER. WE NEED THE MOST AGILE SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THESE CHANGES. FOLKS, WE'RE VIRTUALLY ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE A STRONG TRADITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. I SEE JACK. THAT'S WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD INVESTS HERE, JACK, AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO. THEY KNOW THEY'RE SAFE. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY POPULATION OF WORKERS AND INNOVATORS WHO HAVE NEVER LET OUR COUNTRY DOWN WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. A FOREIGN POLICY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL ALSO WORK TO MAKE SURE THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY ARE NOT RIGGED AGAINST US. BECAUSE WHEN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPETE ON A FAIR PLAYING FIELD, WE WIN. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY THINK HIS BEING TOUGH ON CHINA ALL THAT HE HAS DELIVERED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS AMERICAN FARMERS, MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS LOSING AND PAYING MORE. HIS ECONOMIC DECISION MAKING IS SO SHORTSIGHTED AND AS SHORTSIGHTED AS THE REST OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY. CHINA IS PLAYING THE LONG-GAME, EXTENDING ITS GLOBAL REACH, INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE. WHEN TRUMP IS DEZING NATING OUR OLD , DEZINGSIGNATEING OUR OLDEST ALLIES AS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS IN ORDER TO IMPOSE DAMAGING AND POINTLESS TARIFFS. BY CUTTING US OFF FROM THE ECONOMIC CLOUT OF OUR PARTNERS HE KNEECAPS OUR CAPACITY TO TAKE ON REAL ECONOMIC THREATS. WE NEED TO GET TOUGH WITH CHINA. IF CHINA HAS ITS WAY, IT'S GOING TO KEEP MOVING AND ROBBING U.S. FIRMS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND FORCING COMPANIES TO GIVE IT AWAY TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY WE NEED TO CHANGE IS TO BUILD A UNITED FRONT OF FRIENDS AND PARTNERS TO CHALLENGE CHINA'S ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. EVEN AS WE SEEK TO DEEPEN COOPERATION ON ISSUES WHERE OUR INTERESTS ARE CONVERGED LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND PREVENTING A NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL ON TRADE WITH ME. WE NEED NEW RULES. WE NEED NEW PROCESSES. THAT HAS THE VOICES OF ALL THE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE TABLE INCLUDING LEADERS REPRESENTING LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE MUST NEGOTIATE FROM THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE POSITION. ON OUR OWN, WE REPRESENT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S GDP. BUT WHEN WE'RE JOINED BY FELLOW DEMOCRACIES, THAT NUMBER DOUBLES. CHINA CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE HALF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IF WE'RE UNITED. THAT GIVES US SUBSTANTIAL LEVERAGE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE RULES OF THE ROAD ON EVERYTHING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT TO LABOR TO TRADE TO TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSPARENCY. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE DEMOCRATIC INTEREST AND VALUES. AMERICA'S INTEREST AND VALUES. NOT CHINA. NOT RUSSIA'S. THE WORLD IS NOT ORGANIZED ITSELF. AND IF WE DO NOT SHAPE THE NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AMONG NATIONS, REST ASSURED THAT SOME NATION WILL STEP INTO THE VACUUM, OR NO ONE WILL, AND CHAOS WILL PREVAIL. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT. THE BIDEN FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA WILL PLACE AMERICA BACK AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES AND OUR PARTNERS TO MOBILIZE GLOBAL ACTION ON GLOBAL THREATS, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNIQUE TO OUR COUNTRY. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS NOT INFALLIBLE. WE'VE MADE MISSTEPS AND MISTAKES TO INSTEAD OF DRAWING ON THE FULL ARRAY OF OUR STRENGTHS. LET ME BE CLEAR. I WILL NEVER HESITATE TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INCLUDING WHEN NECESSARY BY THE USE OF FORCE. AS VICE PRESIDENT I WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO CRAFT THE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN THAT ULTIMATELY DEFEATED ISIS. IN FACT, IT TURNED OUT TRUMP'S SECRET WEAPON TO DESTROY THE SO-CALLED CALIPHATE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE PLAN WE PUT IN PLACE WITH PERSONNEL THAT WE HAD PUT IN PLACE. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. AND I WOULD ARGUE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BUT AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ENSURE IT STAYS THAT WAY. I WILL MAKE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO EQUIP OUR TROOPS FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THIS CENTURY, NOT THE LAST CENTURY, THIS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE. BUT THE USE OF FORCE SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST. USED ONLY TO DEFEND OUR VITAL INTEREST WHEN THE OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE AND WITH THE INFORMED, I EMPHASIZE THE INFORMED CONSENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S LONG PAST TIME WE END THE FOREVER WARS WHICH HAVE COST US UNTOLD BLOOD AND TREASURE. I HAVE LONG-ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD BRING HOME THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS FROM THE WARS IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND NARROWLY FOCUS ON OUR MISSION TO DEAL WITH AL-QAEDA AND ISIS IN THE REGION. AND WE SHOULD END OUR SUPPORT FOR THE SAUDI-LED WAR IN YEMEN. IT'S HURTING US. STAYING ENTRENCHED IN UNWINNABLE CONFLICTS DRAINS OUR CAPACITY TO LEAD IN OTHER ISSUES THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION. IT PREVENTS US FROM REBUILDING THE OTHER INSTANCES OF AMERICAN POWER. I'LL MAKE IT MY MISSION TO RESTORE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, E ELEVATE DIPLOMACY AS A PRINCIPLE TOOL OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY. I WILL REINVEST IN A DIPLOMATIC CORE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HALLOWED OUT AND PUT OUR DIPLOMACY BACK IN THE HANDS OF GENUINE PROFESSIONALS. SO YOU DON'T HEAR AN ECHO ON THE 7th FLOOR OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT ANY LONGER. ABOVE ALL, I SEE SOME DIPLOMATS HERE WHEN OUR ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS, ABOVE ALL DIPLOMACY REQUIRES CREDIBILITY AND DONALD TRUMP HAS CORRODED OUR COUNTRY'S CREDIBILITY. YOU KNOW, IN THE CONDUCT OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND ESPECIALLY TIMES OF CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WORD, HIS OR HER WORD IS THE SINGLE MOST VALUABLE ASSET THE COUNTRY HAS. BY PULLING OUT OF TREATY AFTER TREATY, RENIGING ON POLICY AFTER POLICY, WALKING AWAY FROM AMERICA'S RESPONSIBILITIES, AND LYING ABOUT MATTERS BIG AND SMALL, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BANKRUPTED AMERICA'S WORD IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT. HE HAS , I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT. HE'S ALIENATED US FROM THE VERY DEMOCRATIC ALLIES WE NEED MOST. TRUMP HAS TAKEN A BATTERING RAM TO THE NATO ALLIANCE. HE TREATS IT LIKE IT'S AN AMERICAN-RUN PROTECTION RACKET. HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. I REALLY DON'T THINK HE GETS IT. NATO IS AT ITS HEART, THE VERY HEART OF NATO. AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY MORE THAN THAT, IT IS A , AN ALLIANCE OF VALUES. IT'S AN ALLIANCE OF VALUES. IT MAKES IT FAR MORE DURABLE, RELIABLE, AND POWERFUL THAN PARTNERSHIPS BUILT ON COERCION AND ON CASH. THE SAME IS TRUE OF OUR CORE ALLIANCES IN ASIA. LET ME BE CLEAR. WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH OTHER NATIONS TO SHARE OUR VALUES AND GOALS DOESN'T MAKE AMERICA AS IT SEEMS TO IMPLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, SUCKERS. IT MAKES US MORE SECURE. ENABLES US TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. WE AMPLIFY OUR OWN STRENGTHS, EXTEND OUR PRESENCE AROUND THE GLOBE, MAGNIFY OUR IMPACT WHILE SHARING THE BURDEN OF LEADERSHIP WITH OUR PARTNERS. NO COUNTRY, EVEN ONE AS POWERFUL AS OURS, CAN GO ALONE IN THE CHALLENGE OF THE 21st CENTURY. I RESPECT NO BORDERS AND CANNOT BE CONTAINED BY ANY WALLS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL DO MORE THAN JUST RESTORE THE HISTORIC PARTNERSHIPS. I'LL LEAD AN EFFORT TO REIMAGINE THEM, TO BETTER MEET THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH TODAY IN THE NEXT 20 OR 30 YEARS TO KEEP NATO MILITARY CAPABILITY SHARP WHILE ALSO EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY TO TAKE ON NONTRADITIONAL THREATS LIKE WEAPONIZED CORRUPTION, CYBER THEFT, NEW CHALLENGES IN SPACE AND ON THE HIGH SEAS. AND BY THE WAY, THE INCREASE IN NATO DEFENSE SPENDING I WOULD POINT OUT STARTED UNDER THE OBAMA/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRENGTH AND DOMESTIC COOPERATION WITH FRIENDS BEYOND NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. REACHING TO OUR PARTNERS IN ASIA INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, AUSTRALIA, INDIA, TO FORTIFY OUR COLLECTIVE CAPABILITIES. SUSTAINING, SUSTAINING OUR IRONCLAD COMMITMENTS TO ISRAEL SECURITY REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THIS PRESENT LEADER, IT IS ESSENTIAL. INTEGRATEING OUR FRIENDS IN LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA AND SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE BROADER NETWORK OF DEMOCRACIES, IN ORDER TO GAIN AND REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WORLD, WE NEED , WE HAVE TO PROVE AGAIN THAT AMERICA SAYS WHAT IT MEANS AND MEANS WHAT IT SAYS. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL DEFINE OUR TIME. RENEWAL THREAT, RENEWED THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR. MASS MIGRATION. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES. CLIMATE CHANGE. WE CANNOT BE A CREDIBLE VOICE ON THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR SECURITY, ON PROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR SECURITY WHILE WE'RE ABANDONING THE VERY DEALS THAT WE HAD NEGOTIATED. FROM NORTH KOREA TO IRAN, RUSSIA TO SAUDI ARABIA, TRUMP HAS MADE THE PROSPECT OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION A NEW NUCLEAR ARMS RACE, AND EVEN THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MORE LIKELY, NOT LESS. I'VE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES MY ENTIRE CAREER. I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE, AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES FAILING TO ACT. THAT'S WHY AS PRESIDENT, I'D RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO ARMS CONTROL FOR A NEW ERA. THE HISTORIC IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WE NEGOTIATED BLOCKED IRAN FROM GAINING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS CONFIRMING THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS BEING KEPT. YOU HAVE TRUMP CASTED ASIDE, PROMPTING IRAN TO RESTART ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND BECOME MORE PROVOCATIVE AND RAISING THE RISK OF ANOTHER DISASTROUS WAR IN THE REGION. IF TEHRAN RETURNS TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEAL, I WOULD REJOIN THE AGREEMENT AND WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO STRENGTHEN AND EXTEND IT WHILE MORE EFFECTIVELY PUSHING BACK AGAINST IRAN TO DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES WHICH WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO AND WE HAD PARTNERS TO DO WITH US. NORTH KOREA, I WILL EMPOWER OUR NEGOTIATORS TO JUMP START A SUSTAINED COORDINATED CAMPAIGN WITH OUR ALLIES AND OTHERS INCLUDING CHINA TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED OBJECTIVE. IT IS A SHARED OBJECTIVE. A DENUCLEARIZED NORTH KOREA. I'LL PURSUE AN EXTENSION OF THE NEW STAR TREATY, AN ANCHOR OF STRATEGIC STABILITY BEFORE THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA AND USE IT AS A FOUNDATION FOR NEW ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. I WOULD TAKE OTHER STEPS AS WELL TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AS I SAID IN 2017, I BELIEVE THE SOLE PURPOSE OF U.S. NUCLEAR ARSENAL SHOULD BE DETERRING AND IF NECESSARY, RETALIATE AGAINST A NUCLEAR ATTACK. AS PRESIDENT, I'LL WORK TO PUT THAT BELIEF INTO PRACTICE AFTER CONSULTATION WITH OUR ALLIES AND OUR MILITARY. BY THE SAME MEASURE, WE CANNOT PUSH NATIONS TO MEET THEIR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST REFUGEE MIGRATION CRISIS SINCE WORLD WAR II IF WE'RE UNWILLING TO LIVE UP TO OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND FIRMLY REJECT TRUMP'S NATIVIST RHETORIC. IT STANDS OUT THAT WE, IT STANDS, OUR NATION, ON OUR FATHERS, WHEN YOU SAW A FATHER AND A DAUGHTER'S BODY ON A SHORE DEAD, WHEN CHILDREN ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS, STUCK IN OVERCROWDED DETENTION FACILITIES, DENIED THE MOST BASIC NECESSITIES. WHEN FAMILIES ARE RIPPED APART, ABANDONING OUR DEEPESTLY HELD VALUES, IT DOES NOTHING. IT DOES NOTHING TO INCREASE OUR SECURITY AT THE BORDER AND EVERYTHING TO DIMINISH OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD AND THE ABILITY TO LEAD BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE NEED SENSIBLE POLICIES TO IMPROVE SCREENING PRIORITIES AT THE LEGAL POINTS OF ENTRY TO MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS IN BORDER TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO WORK AGAIN WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AS NEIGHBORS, NOT AS ADVERSARIES AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE ROOT CAUSES DRIVING MIGRANTS TO OUR BORDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS VICE PRESIDENT, I SECURED COMMITMENTS FROM LEADERS OF GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS AFTER MULTIPLE MEETINGS TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE, AND THE ENDEMIC POVERTY IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THE DRIVING FORCE OF SENDING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AND TO OUR BORDERS. AND THEN I WORKED WITH CONGRESS IN A BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO GET AID PACKAGES TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE REFORMS. AND GUESS WHAT. IT WAS WORKING. SECURITY IMPROVED. MIGRANT FLOWS BEGAN TO DECREASE IN COUNTRIES LIKE EL SALVADOR. BUT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE END OF OUR AID TO CENTRAL AMERICA VIA A TWEET WITH NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSEQUENCES. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL RELAUNCH THAT INITIATIVE WITH THE TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF OUR FUNDING TO THE REGION, DETERMINE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO DRIVE REFORMS THAT DELIVER RESULTS, AND THEY WILL DELIVER RESULTS. WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FUTURE, LIKE 5G, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OTHER NATIONS ARE DEVOTING NATIONAL RESOURCES AND DOMINATING THEIR DEVELOPMENT. DETERMINING HOW THEY WILL BE USED. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED TO PROMOTE GREATER DEMOCRACY, SHARED PROSPERITY, NOT TO CURB FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY NOT AT HOME OR ABROAD. AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES SHAPE OUR ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES, WE HAVE ENSURE THAT THESE ENGINES OF PROGRESS ARE BOUND BY LAWS AND ETHICS. WE HAVE DONE IT AT EVERY TECHNOLOGICAL TURNING POINT IN OUR HISTORY. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD JOIN TOGETHER WITH OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLIES TO DEVELOP SECURE PRIVATE SECTOR LED 5G NETWORKS LEAVING NO COMMUNITY, RURAL OR LOW INCOME BEHIND. AND THE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL END WITH TODAY IS HOW THE UNITED STATES MUST LEAD THE WORLD TO TAKE ON THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT WE ALL FACE. CLIMATE CHANGE. IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT, NOT MUCH ELSE WILL MATTER. I'LL PUT US ON A TRACK TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES MAKES UP ONLY 15% OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS. I'LL LEVERAGE OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY TO PUT THE WORLD ON A MORE URGENT COURSE BY REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND CONVENE A SUMMON OF THE WORLD , THAT ACCORD IS NEGOTIATED SAID WE HAVE TO UP THE ANTE, CONVENING THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTERS RELYING ON NATIONS TO RAISE THEIR AMBITIONS AND PUSH PROGRESS FURTHER AND FASTER. WE'LL LOOK FOR ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENTS THAT WILL PRODUCE EMISSIONS, REDUCE EMISSIONS, AND GLOBAL SHIPPING AND AVIATION. WE'LL PURSUE STRONG MEASURES TO MAKE SURE OTHER NATIONS CAN'T UNDERCUT US ECONOMICALLY AS WE MEET OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT INCLUDES ASSISTING THE CHINA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST EMITTER OF CARBON STOPS SUBSIDIZING COAL EXPORTS, OUTSOURCING POLLUTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES BY EXPORTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DIRTY COAL , THESE ARE AMBITION GOALS, I ACKNOWLEDGE. AND I WON'T ACCOMPLISH ANY OF THEM WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES FLANKED BY OUR FELLOW DEMOCRACIES LEADING THE WAY. WE'RE FACING ENEMIES BOTH WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN. HOPING TO EXPLOIT THE FISSURES IN OUR SOCIETY, UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY, BREAK UP OUR ALLIANCES, RETURN US TO AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM THAT MIGHT. THE ANSWER TO THIS THREAT IS MORE OPENNESS. NOT LESS. MORE FRIENDSHIPS, MORE COOPERATIONS, MORE ALLIANCES, MORE DEMOCRACIES. VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS TO TELL HIMSELF AND ANYONE WHO HE CAN DUPE INTO BELIEVING THAT THE LIBERAL IDEA, THAT LIBERAL IDEA IS OBSOLETE BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS ITS POWER. NO ARMY ON EARTH CAN MATCH THE ELECTRIC IDEA OF LIBERTY. PASSING FREELY FROM PERSON TO PERSON, IT JUMPS BORDERS. IT TRANSCENDS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES. AND IT CAN SUPERCHARGE COMMUNITIES OF ORDINARY CITIZENS INTO ACTIVISTS AND ORGANIZE FOR CHANGE AGENTS. WE MUST ONCE MORE HARNESS THAT POWER AND RALLY THE FREE WORLD TO MEET THE CHALLENGES FACING US TODAY. AND IT FALLS TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO LEAD THE WAY. NO OTHER NATION HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO IT. NO OTHER NATION WAS BUILT ON THAT IDEAL, THAT PROMISE ALONE. AND IT'S OVERWHELMING IN OUR SELF-INTEREST. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CHAMPION LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO REMAIN OUR CREDIBILITY AND LOOK WITH UNRELENTING OPTIMISM AND THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE CAN DO THIS. LET'S REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. NOT HAVE , THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO A VERY THOROUGH SPEECH. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

THIS IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MOLLY. THANK YOU. IN THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE YOUNG DEMOCRATS. MY NAME IS DANNY. I'M A YOUNG DEMOCRAT, THEY WERE PRESENTED OF FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY, AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [CHANTING ""GO JOE""] I KNOW YOU'RE ALL HERE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. I'LL WRAP IT UP IN 60 SECONDS. IT'S A COMMON THEME TONIGHT, BUT I GREW UP IN A BLUE-COLLAR FAMILY. MY MOM WORKED MULTIPLE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET, PARTICULARLY AFTER MY DAD DIED. AND NOW I STAND BEFORE YOU AS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S YOUNGEST STATE LAWMAKER. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S NOT JUST MY STORY. IT'S VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S STORY. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ALSO GREW UP AS A SCRAPPY KID WITH HUMBLE BEGINNINGS. HE KNOWS THE STRUGGLE FAMILIES FACE BECAUSE HE'S LIVED THEM. HE'S NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM AND HE SPENT HIS CAREER FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAS THE CONVICTION, COURAGE, AND MORAL CLARITY TO TAKE ON PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THE VISION, EMPATHY, AND DETERMINATION TO LEAD US INTO TOMORROW. HE'S ALREADY HERE BUT , [LAUGHTER] PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT I GOT TO TALK TO SOME OF THE FOLKS INSIDE , LUCAS, AS WELL AS EMELIA AND MOLLY AND DANNY, WHO'S JUST TOO YOUNG. WHEN I RAN, I GOT ELECTED AT AGE 27. I DIDN'T PLAN ON GETTING INVOLVED IN RUNNING FOR POLITICS. MY STATE WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE A BORDER STATE. WE HAD THE EIGHTH LARGEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND THE PROBLEM AT THE TIME WAS WE HAD A VERY , WE HAD A SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. AND WHEN DR. KING WAS KILLED MY SENIOR YEAR, WHEN I GRADUATED, WE WERE OCCUPIED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE BETTER PART OF NINE MONTHS, DRAWING BAYONETS IN EVERY CORNER. THE ONLY CITY IN AMERICA OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR. AND I GOT ENGAGED WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG DEMOCRATS TO CHANGE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN DELAWARE FROM A SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO A MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAS ASKED AND KEPT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE AS MAINSTREAM AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. AND IT WAS ALREADY DUE. FINALLY , IT WAS HARD TO DO. FINALLY, THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU RUN FOR THE COUNTY COUNCIL? IT'S A DISTRICT THREE TIMES LARGER THAN STATE SENATOR AND SEVEN TIMES AS LARGE AS A STATEHOUSE MEMBER, BECAUSE ONE COUNTY OF OURS, LIKE ILLINOIS, HAS 60% OF THE POPULATION. THE END RESULT WAS IRAN AFTER HOURS, ASSURED THAT I COULDN'T WIN BECAUSE IT WAS A REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. AND I RAN AND I WON BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE. I WAS TALKING TO SOME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL YOUNG DEMOCRATS IN THERE AND I TOLD THEM SOMETHING MY SISTER KNEW BEFORE I DID, MY YOUNGER SISTER, WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND AND MANAGED MY CAMPAIGNS. SHE WAS A TEACHER AT ONE OF MY SCHOOLS. WE ORGANIZED YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL , NOT EVEN COLLEGE, IN HIGH SCHOOL , TO GET ENGAGED IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE STARTED , THEY STARTED CALLING THEM KITTY CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE FUN OF IT. WELL, WE WON. NEXT THING I KNOW, REPUBLICANS DECIDED THEY WOULD REPORT SHOULD ME BECAUSE THE CENSUS WAS 70I IN A DISTRICT THAT WENT FROM SIX TO PRESENT REPUBLICAN TO 72% , 60% REPUBLICAN TO 72%. THEY SAID I HAD TO RUN AGAIN IN TWO YEAR. AS THEY SAY IN POLITICS, UP OR OUT. THEY COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO RUN FOR UNITED STATES SENATE AT THE TIME. I WENT TO MY DECEASED WIFE, WHO WAS MY BEST BUDDY, AND SHE SAID EITHER GET IN OR GET OUT. I RAN THINKING I COULD HELP THE PARTY. WE PUT TOGETHER HIGH SCHOOL DEMOCRATS, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND WE HAD A VOLUNTEER FORCE IN A SMALL STATE, NOT A JOKE. TOP THE COURSE AT HARVARD FOR MANY YEARS. WE PUT TOGETHER 20,000 VOLUNTEERS, MOSTLY HASKELL STUDENTS. AND THE , HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND THE END RESULT, I LEARNED SOMETHING EARLY ON. I'LL REPEAT IT TO ALL OF YOU. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU HAVE MORE INFLUENCE ON HOW YOUR PARENTS VOTE THEN THEY HAVE ON YOU. NOT A JOKE. YOU MAY SIT AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE HAVING DINNER WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD AND SAY I MET HER AND I REALLY LIKE HER. OR I MET HIM AND I REALLY LIKE HIM. YOUR PARENTS WILL PRETEND IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH. BUT THEY WILL GO UP, NOT A JOKE, THEY SAID MY KID LIKE THAT PERSON THAT MUCH THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THERE. AND I WON. I WON BY 3100 VOTES IN A YEAR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT BEAT THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BY 68 TO 32 POINTS. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] SO WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE HERE IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY CAMPAIGNING. LAST TIME, IN THE 2018 ELECTION, I WENT TO TO FOR STATES IN 59 CANDIDATES. WE WON BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THAT'S WHERE I GOT CRITICIZED THAT WE WON OVER 40% OF THE HOUSE. NOT WE, THEY. TWO THINGS OCCURRED. AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WERE AWAKENED, JUST LIKE MY GENERATION WAS, THIS TIME AWAKENED BY TRUMP. WE ARE AWAKENED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A PRESIDENT THAT WAS KILLING AN AWFUL LOT OF MY GENERATION. THE WOMAN'S MOVEMENT WAS JUST BEGINNING AND NO ONE PAID MUCH ATTENTION. THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS IN DISARRAY AND WE HAD TO FINISH IT. WE'VE BEEN AWAKENED BY DONALD TRUMP. I SAW DONALD TRUMP SAID EVERYONE IS GOING TO SUPPORT HIM AFTER HE WENT AFTER ME AND SENATOR WARREN AND OTHERS, HE SAID, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO REGRET. THEY ARE GOING TO REALIZE THEY GOT A HANDSOME , HOW DID HE SAY IT? THEY GOT A HANDSOME, VERY STABLE GENIUS IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT GENIUS FOR A SECOND. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD FOURTH OF JULY. DID YOU SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL? LOOK, I GRADUATED AND IT'S A REAL EDUCATION. I GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN HISTORY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE. I THINK I KNOW MY HISTORY PRETTY WELL. I ALWAYS CONSIDER MYSELF A STUDENT OF AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT I GUESS I MISSED THAT WHOLE CHAPTER ON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR. YOU KNOW THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN TRUMP DESCRIBED THE AMERICAN ARMY ""MANNED THE AIR,"" ""RAN THE RAMPARTS, AND TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS."" I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS IN 1770. WHOA. I MISSED THAT. I GUESS THE WRIGHT BROTHERS GOT CONFUSED, TOO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WOW. [LAUGHTER] OH, GOD. A STABLE GENIUS. AS MY BROTHER WOULD SAY, GIVE ME A BREAK. FOLKS, LOOK. THAT'S WHAT OUR PRESIDENT DOES. HE TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. AND THE THINGS HE SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP DON'T BEAR ANY RESEMBLANCE SOMETIME TO WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. I THINK WE ALL KNOW IN OUR GUT THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. NO MATTER HOW YOUNG OR OLD YOU ARE. NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING. NOT BECAUSE GOOD PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE BUTTIGIEG IS RUNNING, A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION, ANYONE HAS FACED, WHETHER A YOUNG DEMOCRAT IN COLLEGE OR OVER THE AGE OF 60. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU KNOW WHY. WE WILL OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. IT WILL GO DOWN AS AN ABERRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT WILL TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF WORK TO PUT TOGETHER FOREIGN POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE. IT WILL TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF WORK TO REESTABLISH WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. BUT EIGHT YEARS, LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, EIGHT YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE NATION OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP VICIOUSNESS, BULLYING, UTTER DISREGARD FOR PEOPLE AND PERSONAL LIVES, IS TEARING THE SOUL OUT OF THIS NATION. YOU SAW IT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS WITH LIGHTED TORCHES, VEINS BULGING, PREACHING, AND SHOUTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC VIA , BILE THAT OCCURRED IN GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND KU KLUX KLAN, LED BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE WHO SAID NOT IN MY CITY. AND HE SAID, WHEN THEY ASKED, THEY WERE FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT. WE SAW IT IN HELSINKI WHEN HE COUTO EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH PUTIN, TAKING PUTIN'S WORD ABOUT INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS, WHICH IS GOING ON TODAY. AND THEN AT THE G20, WHEN THEY MET AGAIN, HE MADE A JOKE. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS,? ARE YOU? OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. HE EXCHANGED LOVE LETTERS WITH A MURDEROUS THUG IN KIM JONG-UN. WE SEE IT EVERY DAY AT THE BORDER, CHILDREN RIPPED FROM THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS, PUT IN CAGES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. WE SHOULDN'T BE SEPARATING FAMILIES. AND BY THE WAY, LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. THIS NATION IS BIG ENOUGH THAT WE COULD'VE ABSORBED EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT IN ANY WAY BE NEGATIVELY EFFECTED, BUT POSITIVELY AFFECTED. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A LINE. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE IDEA THAT HE LITERALLY TOOK THE WORDS ""A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS"" OUT OF THE MONSTER THAT IS IN THE DEFINITION OF WHAT OUR SERVICE IS ABOUT. HE LITERALLY TOOK THE WORDS OUT. NO LONGER ARE THEY PART OF THE DESCRIPTION. THIS ISN'T WHO WE ARE. WE ALL KNOW WE GIVE THIS GUY FOR MORE YEARS, HE'S GOING TO FOREVER CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. NOT A JOKE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM. AND THE BALANCE , FAILURE ISN'T AN OPTION. THAT'S WHY I PROMISE YOU, WHETHER I'M THE NOMINEE OR NOT, I'M GOING TO BREAK MY NECK TO MAKE SURE THEY GET ELECTED PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] I KNOW IT'S, ANCIENT HISTORY BUT GO CHECK POLITICAL FACT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST GLOBAL WARNING IN THE 1980'S THAT HAD CONSEQUENCE THAT THEY LABELED AS A GAME CHANGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO EVERYTHING WE DO IS CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. WE KNOW THE CLOCK IS TICKING. WHETHER YOU LOOK AT OUR OWN EPA, WHICH HE HAS EMASCULATED, CUT DOWN, AND ESSENTIALLY LEFT FOR DEAD. LOOK AT THE U.N. RIGHT NOW, THEY SAY 11 YEARS. 11 YEARS LEFT TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS THAN THAT IF WE WIN BACK THE PRESIDENCY, FEWER YEARS THAN THAT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO UNTIL JANUARY, 2021. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT. I BELIEVE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PLAN PUT FORWARD IN THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT ON MY WEBSITE. I HOPE YOU READ IT. BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, I WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS. WHAT SETS MY PLAN APART FROM OTHERS , AND THERE ARE GOOD PLANS PUT FORWARD , I FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2045 OR 2050. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 15% OF THE POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR, 15%. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 85%. THAT'S WHY I SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT WHY I WOULD IMMEDIATELY JOIN WHAT BARACK AND I PUT TOGETHER, THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] NUMBER TWO, WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ABOUT THAT ACCORD, WRITTEN INTO THE ACCORD, WE WROTE IN EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS YOU HAVE TO UP THE ANY. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. NOBODY IN THE WORLD BUT THE UNITED STATES HAS THE ABILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD, TO PULL IT TOGETHER, TO UP THE ANTE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 85% OF THE POLLUTION COMES FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. WELL, BACK WHEN I WAS FIGHTING LIKE THE DEVIL IN THE 1980'S TO STOP 300 FOOT SMOKESTACKS GOING UP IN THE MIDWEST, INDIANA, AND ILLINOIS, WHAT WERE THEY DOING? DROPPING ON YOUR LIKES, POLLUTANTS , LAKES, POLLUTANTS, KILLING YOUR FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE STOPPED AT. IMAGINE , STOPPED IT. IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WILL HAVE GLACIERS MELTING, SEA LEVELS RISING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND I MEAN IT. THERE'S A NUMBER IN THEIR. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH, LET ME KNOW. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE AND MANY OTHERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M TOLD THAT IS OLD-FASHIONED. NOTHING OLD-FASHIONED ABOUT THAT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO WHAT NEVER WAS. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE IT HAS TO BE. WE'RE CRITICIZING TRUMP WITH GOOD REASON FOR ABUSING EXECUTIVE POWER. HOW MANY TIMES YOUR CANDIDATE ON THE STAGE ON THE 400 OF US RUNNING , HOW MANY THEM SAYING, IF I'M ELECTED, I WILL BY EXECUTIVE ORDER DO THE FOLLOWING? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THERE'S A CONSTITUTION. IT SEPARATES POWER. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S TO LIMIT THE ABUSE OF POWER. SO FOLKS, THERE'S TWO THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. ONE, WE HAVE TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS WHERE WE CAN. AND WHERE WE CAN'T, GO OUT AND DEFEAT THEM, TAKE IT TO THEM. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERS. BUT IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY WHAT ENERGIZED A LOT OF YOU IS DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE IS DOING. WELL GUESS WHAT, HE'S ENERGIZED THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. THE LAST INTO ANY 18, LIKE I SAID, WE WENT IN AND WON. WHAT DID WE RUN ON? WE RAN ON HEALTH CARE. I WENT INTO EVERY STATE FROM ALABAMA TO THE RED STATES, 40% OF THE VOTE LIKE MONTANA AND NORTH DAKOTA, AS WELL AS PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH WE CANNOT WHEN A PRESIDENCY WITHOUT WINNING PENNSYLVANIA. THERE'S NO MATHEMATICAL WAY TO GET THERE. ALL THESE STATES, AND WE TOOK IT TO THE REPUBLICANS. BECAUSE FOLKS FINALLY FIGURED OUT, FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD DONE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. DID YOU HAVE ANY REPUBLICANS YOU KNOW RUNNING AROUND SAYING I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BEING COVERED? I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE FACT WE'RE CUTTING OF HEALTH CARE A CERTAIN POINT? I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE FACT AND ON AND ON AND ON. LADIES AND GENERAL MEN, PART OF TEST GENTLEMEN, PART , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PART OF LEADING IS EDUCATING. EVERYTHING BUT LOCUSTS DROPPED ON BARACK'S LATE WHEN HE GOT , PLATE WHEN HE GOT ELECTED. THE GREATEST ABILITY GOD GAVE MANKIND WAS THE ABILITY TO FORGET. IF THEY DIDN'T, WOMEN WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK ABOUT IT, GUYS. WE FORGET JUST WHAT HE FACED AND WHAT HE DID. IT WAS THE GREATEST RECESSION SHORT OF THE DEPRESSION IN THE HISTORY OF THE NIGHT STATES OF AMERICA. AND IT WAS ALL BRAND-NEW. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A FINANCIAL RECESSION LIKE THIS BEFORE, AND REQUIRED ENTIRELY NEW THINKING AND CHANCES BEING TAKEN. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WENT OUT AND GOT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND A FEW OTHER THINGS ON HIS PLATE. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE DEAL. A COUPLE FOLKS HERE WERE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION BACK THEN. I USED TO SAY MR. PRESIDENT, WE GOT TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAYS. HE SAYS I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A VICTORY LAP. THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THE PLATE. ONCE THE ATTACK HAPPENED, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WOKE UP. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD THESE BENEFITS WHEN THEY STARTED TO BE TAKEN AWAY. FOLKS, WE HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH YOU. AND I AM SO OPTIMISTIC , I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS I'M TOO OPTIMISTIC. LOOK, I'M NOT TOO OPTIMISTIC. I KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE JOURNEY OF THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, IF WE GO AND SHOW OUR CHARACTER AS A PEOPLE AGAIN, AS A PARTY, IF WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTORING THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY BY GIVING THEM BACK THEIR DIGNITY, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID A JOB WILL BY A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, YOU WOULD THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE WITH A LUNCH BUCKET IN MY HAND. I DIDN'T. MY DAD WAS A WHITE EDUCATED GUY. THERE WAS NO WORK, THOUGH. WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. EVERY TIME THERE WAS A RECESSION, SOMEONE IN OUR FAMILY, SOME NEIGHBOR WE KNEW, GOT LAID OFF OR LOST THEIR JOB. MY DAD USED TO USE THIS EXPRESSION. JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR JIG NITTY. , DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMITTEE. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HON HE, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. AND LADIES IN GERMAN , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE DENIED PEOPLE ARE RIGHT TO THAT DIGNITY. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT MAKING SURE YOU LOOK AT YOUR CHILD AND BE ABLE TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. I HEARD PEOPLE SAY HOW THEY LOST PEOPLE TO CANCER. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER THAT THEY LOVE? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. CAN YOU IMAGINE , IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY DIGNITY AS A FATHER, A BROTHER, A SON, A HUSBAND, A WIFE , IN MY CASE, MY SON CAME HOME AFTER A YEAR IN IRAQ, A DECORATED SOLDIER, WITH A TERMINAL DISEASE, BRAIN CANCER, GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY GAVE HIM ONLY MONTHS TO LIVE. I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE. AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN I HAVE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HELP I HAVE. I COULDN'T FATHOM WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE IF, WITH FOUR MONTHS LEFT TO GO, LYING IN PAIN IN A HOSPITAL, THEY SAID TIMES UP. YOU USED UP YOUR BENEFITS. REST IN PEACE. FOLKS, YOUR PARENTS, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE TODAY, MOM AND DAD ARE SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE TOMORROW MORNING SAYING WHO'S GOING TO TELL HIM OR HER WE CAN'T SEND HIM BACK TO SCHOOL? WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE WE DOING TO PEOPLE? FOLKS, WE CAN PRAISE THIS ASH CHANGE THIS TAX STRUCTURE OVERNIGHT TO FIX THIS , CHANGE THIS TAX STRUCTURE OVERNIGHT TO FIX THIS. [APPLAUSE] THERE'S MORE TO SAY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOU I HOPE ARE GOING TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU YOUNG DEMOCRATS. I REALLY MEAN IT. BUT HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS THE SECOND YOUNGEST SENATOR IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE POPULARLY ELECTED , NO, IT'S NOT , I HAD A LOT OF HELP. WHEN I GOT ELECTED, PEOPLE USED TO COME UP TO ME AND SAY WHAT YOUR SECRET, SENATOR? THERE HAD TO BE A SECRET BECAUSE HOW COULD I HAVE WON ON MY OWN? HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. I TELL EVERY YOUNG PERSON , AND I WILL SAY IT TO YOU YOUNG DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO RUN. FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WORTH LOSING OVER BEFORE YOU RUN. IF YOU CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE OVER AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, DO NOT RUN FOR OFFICE. DO NOT RUN FOR OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER. YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER DOING SOMETHING ELSE. BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE OVER, IT CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO PEOPLE THAT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY. YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN. AND EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE, THEY WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT AND REWARD YOU FOR IT. AND WHEN YOU GET ELECTED, I'LL NEED YOUR HELP, WHETHER I'M PRESIDENT OR NOT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO END ANY PRIVATE FUNDING OF ELECTIONS. THERE SHOULD BE PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTIONS. NOBODY INVOLVED. NOBODY. WE CAN CHANGE IT OVERNIGHT. [APPLAUSE] SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING , I MEAN THIS NOW. THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING AMERICANS FAILED TO DO WHEN WE'VE ACTED TOGETHER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO. SO GET OUT AND GO DO IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BY THE WAY, WHEN I WAS A YOUNG SENATOR, I WAS MAKING A SPEECH. SOMEONE SAID KEEP GOING, JOE. IT'S STILL RAINING OUTSIDE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE RAIN. I CAN'T CONTROL THAT VERY MUCH. THE REALLY, THANK YOU , BUT REALLY, THANK YOU FOR BEING ENGAGED. EVERY TIME I WALKED OUT OF MY GRANDPA'S HOUSE, KEEP THE FAITH. JOEY, GO SPREAD IT. GO SPREAD THE FAITH. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

CSPANJB78201916	Joe Biden	2019-08-07	Former Vice President Joe Biden Remarks on Mass Shootings	"GUEST:F.VP BIDEN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TO GIVE ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. I SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT THE SPEECH I PLAN TO GIVE TODAY, I PLAN ON COMING WHEN WE SET THIS UP A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. TO TALK ABOUT AGRICULTURAL POLICY, UNIONS, RURAL POLICIES. BUT TOO MUCH AS HAPPENED IN THE RECENT PAST. I HAVE PREPARED FOR ME A SPEECH THAT I HOPE WOULD SET A MARKER FOR WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. THEY CAN MOVE MARKETS. THEY CAN SEND OUR BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR. THEY CAN BRING PEACE. THEY CAN CALM A NATION IN TURMOIL. THEY CAN CONSOLE, THEY CAN CONFRONT AND COMFORT THOSE WHO HAVE FACED TRAGEDY. THEY CAN INSPIRE US TO LITERALLY REACH FOR THE MOON. THEY CAN ENCOURAGE US TO APPEAL TO OUR BETTER ANGELS, OUR BETTER NATURE. THEY CAN ALSO UNLEASH THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES IN THE NATION. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP HAS CHOSEN TO DO. WHAT HE SAID AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE, THERE WERE, AND I QUOTE, ""VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, I SAID THEN THAT IT GAVE LICENSE IN SAFE HARBOR TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND NEO-NAZIS, TO THE KU KLUX KLAN. THESE WORDS NOT ONLY STUNNED AMERICA, BUT THEY STUNNED THE WORLD. AND IN DOING SO HE HAS SIGNED A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THOSE SPEWING HATRED AND THOSE WITH THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST IT. I SAID AT THE TIME THAT WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. I SAID IT AGAIN WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY. AND I SAY IT HERE TODAY. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. THAT'S WHY, PRIMARILY, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] CHARLOTTESVILLE WAS NO ISOLATED INCIDENT. WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE CALLED MEXICANS RAPISTS. DAYS BEFORE THE MIDTERM HE FOMENTED FEARS OF A CARAVAN HEADED TO THE UNITED STATES AND CREATED HYSTERIA WHEN HE SAID , LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT'S MARCHING UP , THIS IS AN INVASION, AND INVASION. , AN INVASION. HE ASSERTED THAT IMMIGRANTS WOULD CARVE YOU UP WITH A KNIFE. MORE RECENTLY HE CALLED A MAJOR AMERICAN CENTER CITY A DISGUSTING WRATH INFECTED RODENT MASS. NO HUMAN BEING, HE SAID, WOULD CHOOSE TO LIVE , AS THOUGH THE VIBRANT AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY AROUND BALTIMORE WAS SOMEHOW LESS THAN HUMAN. AT A RALLY IN FLORIDA WHEN HE ASKED THE CROWD , HOW DO WE STOP THESE PEOPLE , MEANING IMMIGRANTS, SOMEONE YELLED BACK , SHOOT THEM. AND HE SMILED. NORTH CAROLINA, HE BASKS IN THE CHANCTS OF CENTER BACK ECHOING ACROSS THE STADIUM. HOW FAR FROM TRUMP SAYING THAT THIS IS AN INVASION TO THE SHOOTER IN EL PASO DECLARING , HOW FAR APART OF THOSE COMMENTS. HOW HARD IS IT FOR WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND NEO-NAZIS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, TRUMP US VERY FINE PEOPLE CHANTING , TRUMP'S VERY FINE PEOPLE CHANTING TO THE SHOOTER IN PITTSBURGH WHO SAID THAT THE JEWS ARE COMMITTING GENOCIDE ON HIS PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT FAR AT ALL. IT'S BOTH. CLEAR LANGUAGE AND A CODE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE NATION. HIS LOW ENERGY NAKED EYED MOUTHING OF THE WORDS WRITTEN FOR HIM CONDEMNING WHITE SUPREMACY THIS WEEK I DON'T BELIEVE FOOLED ANYONE AT HOME OR ABROAD. HIS ENERGETIC EMBRACE , THE ENERGETIC AND FACE , EMBRACE OF THIS PRESIDENT IVY DARKEST HOUR TO AND MOST HATE FILLED MINES IN THIS COUNTRY SAY IT ALL. WHEN THE WHITE NATIONALISTS RICHARD SPENCER CELEBRATED TRUMPS ELECTION BY DECLARING HAIL TRUMP AT AN ALL RIGHT CONFERENCE WHERE THE NAZI SALUTE WAS BEING USED. IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER LEADER OF THE KKK SAID , THIS IS WHY WE VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE SAID HE'S GOING TO TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY. AFTER TRUMP TWEETED HIS GO BACK SCREEN, A LEADING NEO-NAZI WEBSITE SAID THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF NATIONALISM WE ELECTED HIM FOR. HE KNOWS IT, HE SAW IT. ON 8CHAN, A HAVEN FOR RADICALISM ON THE INTERNET, WHERE THE DECLARATION OF HATE FROM THE EL PASO SHOOTER WAS POSTED, ONE COMMENTATOR WROTE A TRUMP IS HELPING TO NORMALIZE THE MOST EXTREME RADICAL SENTIMENTS BECAUSE OF HIS PERCEIVED AUTHORITY CARRYING SO MUCH WEIGHT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS RISING TIDE OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN AMERICA. AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ENCOURAGES AND EMBOLDENS IT. THE STATISTICS ARE CLEAR. EXTREMISM IS ON THE RISE IN AMERICA. THE SOUTHERN POVERTY CENTER FINDS THAT OF THE 1020 HATE GROUPS OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2018, THAT IS HOW MANY THERE ARE, THEY POINTED OUT THAT WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS HAVE SURGED BY OVER 50%. IN 2017, AND ACTIVE SHOOTER WITH TIES TO WHITE EXTREMISM CLAIMED 135 VICTIMS AND 70 KILLED. ACCORDING TO THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE, ALL BUT ONE OF THE 50 EXTREMIST LINKED MURDERS COUNTED IN 2018 HAD DIRECT LINKS TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HIS OWN FBI DIRECTOR RECENTLY TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS THAT EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, WHITE NATIONALISTS, POSED THE GREATEST THREAT TO RACIALLY MOTIVATED DOMESTIC TERRORISM. WHAT HAS TRUMP DONE? HE HAS POURED FUEL ON THE FIRE. REACH WEEDING POSTINGS FROM EXTREMISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS , REACH WEEDING , RE-TWEETING POSTINGS FROM EXTREMISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS. COUNTERING POLICIES THAT BARACK AND I PUT IN PLACE TO FIGHT TERRORISM HERE AT HOME. CAN BARELY BRING HIMSELF TO USE THE WORD WHITE SUPREMACY. AND EVEN WHEN HE SAYS IT, HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BELIEVE IT. HE SEEMS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THEIR VOTES THAN BEATING BACK THIS HATEFUL IDEOLOGY. HE SAYS THAT GUNS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM IN MASS SHOOTINGS. THE ISSUE IS MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S A DODGE. HATRED ISN'T A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. I CAN TELL YOU, AS THE GUY ALONG WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AND THE HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES BANNED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 10 YEARS, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] 100 ROUNDS IN DAYTON. 30 ROUND CLIPS IN EL PASO. THEY WILL BE BANNED. AND WHEN WE DO IT, WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A BUYBACK PROGRAM TO GET AS MANY AS WE NEED MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREET. AND WE NEED , WE NEEDED DOMESTIC TERRORISM LAW. WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT INFRINGING ON ANYONE'S FREE SPEECH. IN TAMPERING WITH ANYBODY'S LIBERTIES. QUITE SIMPLY, WE HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT AS A NATION TO ROOT OUT DOMESTIC TERRORISM AS WE HAVE A NATIONAL TERRORISM. I WISH I COULD SAY THIS ALL BEGAN WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WILL END WITH HIM. BUT IT DIDN'T AND I WON'T. AMERICAN HISTORY IS NOT A FAIRYTALE. THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PUSH AND PULL FOR 243 YEARS BETWEEN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT SAYS WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL AND THE HARSH REALITY OF RACISM THAT HAS LONG TOLD US APART. , TORN US APART. THE SAME DOCUMENT THAT PROMISED TO SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY ALSO A LOVE FOR SLAVERY AND THE SO-CALLED 3/5 COMPROMISE THE DISCOUNTED THE VERY HUMANITY OF BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA AT THE TIME. AND NOW THE TRUTH IS, BOTH ELEMENTS ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. AT OUR BEST, THE AMERICAN IDEAL WINS OUT. BUT IT'S NEVER A ROUTE, IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT AND IT'S A BATTLE THAT IS NEVER FULLY FINISHED. GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING. THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE WHAT MANY BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT, CIVIL DOCUMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY. HE WAS A SLAVE HOLDER. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO OUR AMERICAN IDEALS. JEFFERSON HIMSELF DIDN'T. BUT WHAT HE WROTE HAS PULLED US TOWARDS JUSTICE FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AND STILL DOES. REMAINING THIS NATION'S NORTHSTAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUE CLUCKS CLAN. AFTER THE WAR, WE SAW A RISE IN THE PLAN. IT WAS BEATEN DOWN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN IN THE 20'S. IN AUGUST OF 1925, 30,000 FULLY CLAD KLANSMAN IN THEIR ROBES AND POINTED HATS MARCHED DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON. IMAGINE. IMAGINE THAT TODAY. AND THEN THEY WERE ONCE AGAIN BECOME BACK AS THEY WERE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. HOW QUESTION MARK THE COURTS, THE PRESS, AND YES, PRESIDENTS STOOD AGAINST THEM. AND THAT IS THE POINT. OUR INSTITUTIONS OFTEN IMPERFECTLY STOOD AGAINST HATE AT MOMENTS WHEN WE WERE MOST TESTED. AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE'S APT UP IN THE PAST. GEORGE H.W. BUSH RENOUNCING HIS MENTOR , MEMBERSHIP IN THE NRA. PRESIDENT CLINTON AFTER OKLAHOMA CITY. GEORGE W. BUSH GOING TO A MOSQUE AFTER 9/11. PRESIDENT OBAMA AFTER CHARLESTON . PRESIDENTS WHO LED, WHO OPPOSED, CHOSE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THE BEST OF AMERICAN CHARACTER IS ABOUT. THERE'S DEAFENING SILENCE NOW. SADLY, WE DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY. OUR PRESIDENT HAS ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH THE DARKEST FORCES IN THIS NATION. IT MAKES WINNING THIS BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION THAT MUCH TOUGHER. HARDER. TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT DID. ROOSEVELT SAID THAT THE PRESIDENCY IS ""PREEMINENTLY A PLACE OF MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE DOESN'T SEE WHAT JFK DID WHEN HE SAID ONLY THE PRESIDENT REPRESENTS THE NATIONAL INTERESTS. HE'S BLIND TO WHAT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON SET OF THE OFFICE WHEN HE SAID ""NOTHING MAKES A MAN COME TO GRIPS MORE DIRECTLY WITH HIS CONSCIENCE THEN THE PRESIDENCY. TRUMP OFFERS NO MORAL LEADERSHIP. SEEMS TO HAVE NO INTEREST IN UNIFYING THE NATION. NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENCY HAS AWAKENED HIS CONSCIENCE IN THE LEAST. INDEED, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH A TOXIC TONGUE WHO HAS PUBLICLY AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY EMBRACED A POLITICAL STRATEGY OF HATRED, RACISM AND DIVISION. SO, IT IS UP TO US, AS IT WAS IN THE 20'S. IT IS UP TO US. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A RARE MOMENT IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY WHERE OUR PRESIDENT ISN'T UP TO THE MOMENT. WHERE OUR PRESIDENT LACKS THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD. WHERE OUR PRESIDENT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH GEORGE WALLACE THAN HE DOES WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW , [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALMOST 330 MILLION AMERICANS. WE WILL HAVE TO DO WHAT OUR PRESIDENT CAN'T. STAND TOGETHER. STAND AGAINST HATE. STAND UP FOR WHAT IS BEST. OUR NATION'S BEST. IN THIS NATION, WE BELIEVE WHEN WE ARE AT OUR BEST. WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY. DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH RESPECT. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING NO ONE, NOT THE POOR, THE POWERLESS, THE IMMIGRANT OR THE OTHER. LEAD BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. THAT IS THE LOUDEST , THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO STAND AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD. BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. IT'S A CODE. IT'S A UNIQUELY AMERICAN CODE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET IT. BUT THIS PRESIDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT LIKE EVERY OTHER NATION ON EARTH, WE ARE UNABLE TO DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES AMERICA BY RELIGION, BY ETHNICITY, OR BY TRIBE. YOU CAN'T DO IT. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. AN IDEA STRONGER THAN ANY ARMY. EGER THAN ANY OCEAN. MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANT. IT GIVES HOPE TO THE MOST DESPERATE PEOPLE ON EARTH. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE OUR VALUES UNDER ASSAULT, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AS WELL. A FREE PRESS, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY. A LEGISLATURE THAT IS THE COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THESE OTHER GUARDRAILS. [APPLAUSE] THESE OTHER GUARDRAILS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE WRITTEN INTO OUR CONSTITUTION. IF YOU HAVE NOTICED, FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK. PHRASES LIKE FAKE NEWS. ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE NO JOKE. THEY ARE INSIDIOUS. THEY ARE CORROSIVE. JUST LOOK AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORST DESPOTS ARE USING TRUMPS LANGUAGE TO JUSTIFY THEIR OWN ABUSES OF POWER. TRUMP IS TRYING TO WEAKEN OUR INSTITUTIONS, THE PRESS, THE COURTS, CONGRESS, PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY CHECKS ON HIS POWER. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THE ABUSE OF POWER. THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T STAND AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T, THE ABUSE OF POWER, WHETHER IT IS A BOSS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS OR HER WORKERS, OR A MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO A WOMAN OR A CHILD. OR A PRESIDENT WHO IS RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY BELIEVES. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER HOW OLD OR YOUNG YOU ARE, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN YOUR LIFETIME. WE ARE BEING REMINDED EVERY DAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING GUARANTEED ABOUT DEMOCRACY. NOT EVEN HERE IN AMERICA. WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY EARN IT. WE HAVE TO PROTECT IT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA, AS LINCOLN NAMED US, IS THE LAST BEST HOPE ON EARTH. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHY. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY. THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BUT IT IS NOT WHY WE ARE AMERICANS. THE REASON IS, WHAT WE BELIEVE, THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT I THINK BEATS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, IT BEATS AND ALL OF US, NO MATTER YOUR RACE, ETHNICITY, YOUR GENDER IDENTITY, YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, NO MATTER YOUR FAITH. IT BEATS IN THE HEARTS OF THE RICH AND POOR ALIKE, HE UNITES AMERICA, WHETHER YOUR ANCESTORS WERE NATIVE TO THESE SHORES OR BROUGHT HERE FORCIBLY AND ENSLAVED, OR IMMIGRANTS FROM GENERATIONS BACK, LIKE MY FAMILY FROM IRELAND, OR THOSE COMING TODAY, LOOKING TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE AMERICAN CREED THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL WAS WRITTEN LONG AGO, BUT THE GENIUS OF EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAS OPENED IT WIDER AND WIDER, TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION. THAT IS WHY IT HAS NEVER GATHERED DUST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. IT IS STILL ALIVE TODAY, MORE THAN 200 YEARS AFTER ITS INCEPTION. AND I HONEST TO GOD DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP SEES IT THAT WAY. ON JANUARY 20, 2017, IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, DONALD TRUMP PAINTED A DARK, BLEAK ACTOR OF OUR COUNTRY IN CRISIS, WHEN HE DECLARED, AND I QUOTE, ""THIS AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT HERE, IT STOPS RIGHT NOW."" BUT AS A SITTING PRESIDENT, TRUMP'S ANGER, HATE AND DIVISIVENESS, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, PREYING ON OUR DIVISIONS AND DOING NOTHING, NOTHING ABOUT THE ENDEMIC AND EPIDEMIC OF GUNS THAT IS FUELING A LITERAL CARNAGE IN AMERICA. WE NOW HAVE MORE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 2019 SINCE JANUARY, THEN WE HAVE DAYS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE JANUARY 1, 2019. AS OF MONDAY, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE GUN VIOLENCE ARCHIVES, THERE HAVE BEEN 255 MASS SHOOTINGS IN THE FIRST 217 DAYS OF THIS YEAR. WE CAN'T LET THIS GO ON. WE CAN'T, AND I WILL NOT, LET THIS MAN BE REELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN'T. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THIS INCOMPETENCE, HIS IMMORALITY, HIS CARNAGE STOPS WITH US, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, STARTING IN THE MIDWEST. LIMIT TO FOUR YEARS, AND I BELIEVE HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS PRESIDENT AS AN ABERRANT MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED, HE WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE COUNTRY AND VISIONED BY WASHINGTON AND ADAMS AND JEFFERSON. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE NATION BOUND TOGETHER BY LINCOLN. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE NATION LIFTED UP BY ROOSEVELT OR INSPIRED BY KENNEDY. IT WILL NOT BE THE NATION THAT BARACK OBAMA PROVED BENDS TOWARD JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] THE DANGER OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE ALT RIGHT POSED TO THIS NATION IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL OR EXAGGERATED. IT IS REAL. THE CORE VALUES OF THIS NATION, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA, ARE AT STAKE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM. WE HAVE TO SHOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. , TRUTH OVER LIES. [APPLAUSE] IF WE STAND TOGETHER, IF WE STAND TOGETHER, WE WILL WIN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, IF WE STAND TOGETHER AND GET UP AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PERIOD. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHEERING] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2019] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO EL PASO, TEXAS, WHERE A GUNMAN SHOT AND KILLED AT LEAST 22 PEOPLE AT A WALMART ON SATURDAY.

CSPANJB88201917	Joe Biden	2019-08-08	Joe Biden at Iowa State Fair	HELLO, IOWA. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND. I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF AND QUICK WITH YOU. I'M RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS. WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WHAT WE SOW OUT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, THE HATE AND VENOM WE SAW, AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THE GROUPS WHO MET HIM AS LAW , AS WELL AS THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED, WHAT DID HE THINK ABOUT THEM, HE SAID THEY WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. VERY FINE PEOPLE. NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IS IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE, IT TO DIVIDE US CAN DIVIDE US IN A WAY THAT IS TOTALLY CONTRARY TO WHO WE ARE. WE REALLY ARE IN A FIGHT TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE LET THE WORLD IN THE PAST NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE THE MOST PARTIAL NATION IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS NOT THE EXERCISE OF OUR POWER, IT IS THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE'RE LOSING THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT IS VERY DAMAGING. THE SECOND REASON I AM RUNNING IS I WANT TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE MIDDLE CLASS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE TO RISE UP. THE POOR OT HAVE A ROAD UP. WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL, EVERYBODY DOES WELL. THE POOR DO WELL, THE WEALTHY DO WELL, AND THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER. IT IS FALLING APART RIGHT NOW. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION SAYING THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE A LIFE THAT THEY HAD. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, HE SAID A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY , HOW CAN YOU HAVE THIS NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN YOUR EYE AND SAY THEY WILL BE OK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE? WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CHILD WHO HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, OR WHEN YOUR CHILD OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS A TERMINAL DISEASE LIKE MY SON DID. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WATCHING HIM COMING HOME FROM IRAQ WITH AN INCURABLE DISEASE GIVEN MONTHS TO LIVE AND AN INSURANCE COMPANY COULD COME IN AND SAY YOUR TIME IS UP. SUFFER IN PEACE THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THAT IS WHY WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE, AND WE CAN AFFORD IT, TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON TITLE I SCHOOLS. RAISING SALARIES FOR TEACHERS. MAKING SURE THAT WE DEAL EARLY ON WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WE KNOW WE NEED TEACHERS. MY WIFE IS A FULL-TIME TEACHER. WE ARE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE ONE CHILD FOR EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, THERE ARE 1700 KIDS. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE CAN AFFORD TO CHANGE THIS IF WE JUST GET RID OF SOME OF THESE GOD-AWFUL TAX CUTS THAT WERE PASSED. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT WE HAVE TRILLIONS OF LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY JUSTIFY $500 BILLION WORTH OF LOOPHOLES. I CAN MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY HAS ADEQUATE INSURANCE. BUILT ON OBAMACARE, MAKE SURE IT HAS A PUBLIC OPTION CAN INCREASE THE PROSPECT OF LOWERING DRUG PRICES. HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE LEFT? HOW MUCH? 15 SECONDS? TO SPEAK? OH! Y'ALL ARE IN REAL TROUBLE THEN, MAN. THAT'S A BAD THING TO TELL ME I'VE GOT MORE TIME TO SPEAK. THE IDEA THAT WE CANNOT GAIN CONTROL AND GIVE PEOPLE A FIGHTING CHANCE IS NOT CORRECT. THERE USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN IN AMERICA. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREED ON IT. WE DISAGREED ON THE EXTENT OF IT, BUT WE AGREED AT THE END OF THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT IS IF YOU CONTRIBUTED TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR, YOU GET A SHARE OF THE BENEFITS. IF IT WENT WELL, YOU DID WELL. THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE ANYMORE. WE HAVE ADOPTED A POSITION IN AMERICA THAT SAYS THE ONLY PEOPLE ENTITLED TO REWARDS ARE STOCKHOLDERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY JOB CREATORS. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE FOLKS DELIVERING THE GRAINS TO THE MILL, THEY ARE JOB CRITTERS. THE FOLKS WHO MAKE THE AUTOMOBILE, THEY CREATE JOBS. I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY OR ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE. THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T REWARD WORK AS MUCH AS WELL IS BIZARRE. , AS MUCH AS WEALTH IS BIZARRE. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE TOP 1% PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN YOU DO BECAUSE IT IS MOSTLY CAPITAL GAINS. MORE THAN A TEACHER, FIREFIGHTER, A COP. IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE SHOULD BE REWARDING WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WE SHOULD BE RAISING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO THIS. SO MUCH MONEY. SO MUCH IN TAX BREAKS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED THEM. BY THE WAY THE WEALTHY KNOW THEY , DON'T NEED THEM. THEY ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE, BUT THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER TAX CUT. IF YOU ARE MAKING MORE THAN $10 MILLION, I AM NOT YOUR GUY. YOU DON'T NEED A TAX CUT. AND YOU KNOW IT. BUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED A TAX CUT , MAKE SURE WE CAN PROVIDE FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON WHO IS ELIGIBLE, QUALIFIED, AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN THEIR 50'S BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION BACK TO BE RETRAINED. WE CAN DO THAT ALL FOR ABOUT $6 BILLION A YEAR. ELIMINATE ONE LITTLE THING, STEPPED-UP BASIS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE I USED TO BE LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN CONGRESS. IF YOU HAVE A CAPITAL GAIN, YOU ARE ABOUT TO CASH IT IN, YOU GET HIT BY TRUCK, GOD FORGET, LEAVE IT TO YOUR CENTER DOT OR, THEY PAY NO TAX , LEAVE IT TO YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER, THEY PAY NO TAX. IT COULD FOR EVERY SINGLE QUALIFIED PERSON IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, OR TRADE SCHOOL. CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF COLLEGE. THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO CHANGE THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN ADDITION TO THAT, I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO GLOBAL WARMING. YOU KNOW THAT OUT HERE IN IOWA. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EXIST. I HEARD A FARMER TODAY SAY IT IS NOT CAUSED BY HUMANS, BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM. I HAVE A PROBLEM. WELL, THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO DRINK , POSITION WHERE THEY CAN BREATHE CLEAN AIR, WE DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. WOULD NEED RE-JOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, WHICH I HELPED PUT TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONE THING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT RECORD WHICH WE NEGOTIATED, IT CALLS FOR NATIONS TO UP THE ANTE EVERY TWO YEARS. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 15% OF GLOBAL WARMING. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 85%. WE DO EVERYTHING PERFECTLY AND THEY DON'T GET ON THE STICK, WE ARE ALL STILL IN TROUBLE. I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE WORLD LEADERS. I KNOW ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. THIS IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE U.S. AND TO THE WORLD. IT IS REAL. AND IT IS NOT JUST 11 YEARS. WE HAVE ABOUT 10 YEARS BEFORE WE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE EROSION THAT IS OCCURRING NOW. IT IS REAL. HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU SAW WHAT YOU DID WITH WIND. I REMEMBER AT A STATE FAIR 10 YEARS AGO, 12 YEARS AGO, TALKING ABOUT WIND. HOW YOU CAN PROVIDE ENERGY FROM WIND. GUESS WHAT, A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. THEN YOU STARTED DOING IT. IT CREATED 10,000 NEW JOBS AND DIDN'T CAUSE CANCER, AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS. IT GENERATED GROWTH. WE CAN INVEST. WE WILL INVEST. $44 BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT DEAL WITH SEQUESTERING OF CARBON. YOU FARMERS OUT HERE CAN HAVE AN ENTIRE NEW LIFE. THEY CAN BE THE FIRST GROUP OF AMERICANS TO ACTUALLY GET A CARBON-FREE ENVIRONMENT. IF WE DO THIS, WE WILL CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND IT'S REAL. IF WE INVEST IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE. WE SHOULD BECOME THE NET EXPORTER OF THIS CAPABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO THAT. WE UNDERESTIMATE OUR CAPACITY. GOING BACK TO HEALTH CARE, WE CAN CONTROL DRUG PRICES. MY PROPOSAL IS, AND I RAN WHAT THEY CALL THE MOONSHOT DEALING WITH CANCER, AND AFTER THAT SET UP THE BIDEN CANCER INITIATIVE. HERE'S THE POINT, WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF SOLVING SO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES. IT IS WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO IT. BUT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND FUND IT. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED DARPA. IT ALLOWS THE MILITARY TO DO RESEARCH. WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WITH HEALTH CARE. WE SHOULD SET UP THE SAME OPERATION. HARPA, MEANING HEALTH CARE ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISEASE OF ALZHEIMER'S, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HOSPITAL WILL BE FILLED WITH AN ALL-TIME IS PATIENT. NO DRUG COMPANY WILL MAKE THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST LIKE WE DID IN THE DEFENSE FORMAT WITH FAT OBESITY, ALL OF THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE OUT THERE. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BREAK THROUGH. WE CAN DO A MILLION BILLION CALCULATIONS PER SECOND. WE ARE SO FAR ADVANCED THAT WE ARE KEEPING OUR HEAD IN THE SAND. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN THAT, NOT INVESTING IN MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE VERY WEALTHY. LASTLY, I SAY THE THIRD REASON I AM RUNNING IS TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, FOLKS, I AM TOLD BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT YOU CANNOT UNITE THE COUNTRY. THAT BIDEN ON ONE SIDE, BIDEN HAS BEEN AROUND TOO LONG. THE OTHER IS BIDEN IS NAIVE. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. YOU THINK BEING AROUND A LONG TIME, YOU WOULD LEARN SOMETHING. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AFTER THREE YEARS ALREADY OF THIS GUY HAVE DECIDED THAT A LOT OF WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS HOKUM. LOOK THIS LAST ELECTION IN 2018 IN THE COUNTRY. I WENT TO 69 CANDIDATES I WENT INTO PURPLE STATES AND RED STATES AND IN THOSE STATES WE WON BACK 41 SEATS. BEATING REPUBLICANS , BY THE WAY, I WANT TO REPRESENT EVERYBODY, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE RAN ON HEALTH CARE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED TAKING AWAY HEALTH CARE THAT EVERYBODY , THEY STARTED TAKING AWAY HEALTH CARE THAT EVERYBODY REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. 100,000 PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ON AND ON. WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS WE ARE ABLE TO GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS PROTECTED. BUILDING ON OBAMACARE, RESTORING THE HISTORIC DEAL THAT WE DID. IN ADDITION TO THAT, ADDING A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION TO IT SO YOU CAN BUY INTO IT. EVERY SINGLE , BUT YOU ARE ABLE TO KEEP IF YOU LIKE YOUR EMPLOYER-BASED POLICY, YOU CAN KEEP THE POLICY, AS LONG AS THEY KEEP THE POLICY. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. IT COSTS ABOUT $740 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS FOR THE BUT GUESS WHAT, IT DOESN'T COST $30 TRILLION. THE MUTUALLY DOLLARS , $30 TRILLION, WHICH WILL RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. BERNIE IS GOING TO TELL YOU THAT. THERE WILL BE A WITHHOLDING TAX FROM YOUR PAYCHECK. WE CAN COVER EVERYBODY. AND WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE THE CHOICE THEY WANT. IN TERMS OF UNIFYING THE COUNTRY, WE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT, BUT AMERICA HAS BEEN AN IDEA. IT IS THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA. NOT A JOKE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN DEFEAT AMERICA IS AMERICA. THERE IS NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH, NO DICTATOR POWERFUL ENOUGH, NO OCEAN WIDE ENOUGH THAT CAN OVERCOME WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO, IF WE REMEMBER WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE REASON I DID MY LAST ANNOUNCEMENT IN PHILADELPHIA WAS TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE ARE A NATION THAT IS UNIQUE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. WE THE PEOPLE, ETC. WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THAT. BUT WE HAVE NEVER ABANDONED IT BEFORE. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. JEFFERSON DIDN'T LIVE UP TO IT, HE HAD SLAVES. BUT EVERY SINGLE GENERATION HAS BENT THE ARC MORE TOWARD INCLUSION. EVERY GENERATION. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. WE ARE, WE ARE THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA. IT IS AN IDEA WE CANNOT ABANDON. AND FOLKS, WE ARE BETTER PREPARED TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD BY A LONG SHOT. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE SENATE, I WAS LABELED THIS YOUNG IDEALIST. THIS GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY, WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN. IF WE GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP CAN WE HAVE A CLEAR PATH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS HAS COME OUT OF A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE FEDERAL AGENTS. THEY ARE NOT. YOU OWN THEM, YOU PAY FOR THEM. THEY BELONG TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST AGILE VENTURE CAPITALISTS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST EDUCATED PUBLICS IN THE WORLD, IF WE IN FACT INVEST IN THEM. THERE ISN'T ANYBODY OR ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHO CAN COMPETE WITH US IF WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, IF WE INVEST IN NEW WE ARE. REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO. THIS IS MY CONCLUDING COMMENT TO YOU ALL , IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER DECIDED TO DO THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO, PERIOD. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WE HAVE NEVER NEVER NEVER FAILED WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER. IT IS TIME TO GET UP. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. WE HAVE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER FACTS. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, JOIN ME. I COULD USE THE HELP. WE MUST DEFEAT THIS PRESIDENT TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. I GUESS I TAKE QUESTIONS NOW, HUH? DON'T LET ANYBODY KNOW I DID NOT USE ALL MY TIME. I HAVE A BAD REPUTATION OF GOING OVER ALL THE TIME. YES, SIR? GIVE YOU A MIC, OR , YES, YOU CAN BUY ME ANOTHER ICE CREAM. I ALREADY HAD ONE. HE SAID, CAN I BUY YOU AN ICE CREAM, AND WHO WAS MY FAVORITE HISTORICAL FIGURE. I THINK MY FAVORITE HISTORICAL FIGURE , THERE IS A COUPLE OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO I FIND UNDERSTOOD HUMAN NATURE BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE. BUT IN TERMS OF POLITICAL FIGURES, MAYBE MY FAVORITE POLITICAL FIGURE, IT IS A TOUGH CALL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO GAVE AMERICA HOPE. MADE THEM BELIEVE IN WHO WE ARE. YOU SAID NOT A PRESIDENT. I WOULD HAVE TO START OFF WITH JEFFERSON, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T LIVE UP TO IT. HE IS THE GUY THAT WROTE THAT INCREDIBLE DOCUMENT. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED IN THE DIRECTION TO PROVIDE US WITH THE KIND OF HOPE AND EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. MY FAVORITE LINE FROM JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON WASN'T WHAT MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER. WHEN I REMEMBER THE MOST IS WHEN HE SAID, WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER WHAT WE CAN DO IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS TIME TO GET THE HELL UP AND START TO MOVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BILLION A YEAR RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS MY PLAN? MY PLAN IS TO GATHER UP , I HAVE MET WITH MOST OF THE LEADING SCIENTISTS IN THE COUNTRY ALREADY. MY PLAN IS TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHEREBY WE INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TERMS OF RESEARCH. NO DRUG COMPANY WANTS TO OR CAN DO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TAKE THE RISK. I'M TIRED OF BEING TOLD WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER. WE FOUND CLEAR ANSWERS. WE USED TO THINK THAT CANCER WAS A SINGLE CELL, THAT RESIDED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY. WE NOW KNOW THERE ARE 204 DISTINCT TYPES OF CANCER THAT REQUIRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THERAPIES. THE SAME KIND OF RESEARCH HAS TO TAKE PLACE DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S. NOT JUST TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO GET IT, BUT IT SAVES , IT IS A GIGANTIC POSITIVE INVESTMENT. WE PAY FOR IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY IT REQUIRES A DEDICATION TO SAY WE CAN INVEST. IT WILL TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO IT. WE CAN AFFORD TO DO IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO DO IT. YES, MA'AM? 30 SECONDS? THE COURTS HAVE TURNED STRONG TO THE RIGHT. I WILL NOT APPOINT ANYONE TO THE COURT , YOU NOTICE I PRESIDED OVER MORE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS THAN ANYONE EVER HAS BECAUSE I WAS CHAIRMAN FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE PEOPLE I WILL PUT ON THE COURT ARE WILL BE LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO , LIKE A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR ME, ELENA KAGAN. THE FOLKS WHO UNDERSTAND , THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LAWYERS, THE QUESTION IS, ARE THERE UNENUMERATED RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION. FANCY WAY OF SAYING UNLESS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RIGHT OF PRIVACY IN THE CONSTITUTION, AS MOST LEADING SCHOLARS AGREED, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ALL THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT SO MUCH. I WILL NOT APPOINT ANYONE TO THE COURT WHO DOES NOT SHARE THAT BASIC PHILOSOPHY. THANK YOU. I WILL COME AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, OK? I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ANSWER ANYMORE. I'M GOING TO GET DRAGGED OFF THE STAGE.

CSPANJB248201920	Joe Biden	2019-08-24	Joe Biden in Keene, New Hampshire	"DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, GAVE A CAMPAIGN SPEECH AND MET WITH VOTERS IN KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF. [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU GUYS PUMPED TO SEE THE VICE PRESIDENT? I AM THE UNITED STATES NAVY VETERAN, A NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESS OWNER, A FORMER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY EXPERT AND SOMEONE WHO IS TIRED OF THE DIVISION AND DECLINE OF AMERICAN VALUES WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL REPAIR, AND REVITALIZE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALLIES AND NEIGHBORS TO RESTORE OUR GEOPOLITICAL LEADERSHIP. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VITAL TO OUR NICE , NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE WELL-BEING OF ALL AMERICANS. AS SOMEONE WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES TO MITIGATE THE SUICIDE NUMBERS IN THE VETERAN COMMUNITY, I CAN SAY THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD A START OVER. WE MUST IMPROVE AND EXPAND UPON THE MEDICAL CARE ACT AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, AND AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO DO THAT. AS A VETERAN, I KNOW THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN EXPERIENCES , APPRECIATES THE COSTS AND SACRIFICES OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY. BOTH OF HIS SONS SERVED THIS COUNTRY AND HE UNIQUELY UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DATA POSSIBLE FOR ME AS AN LGBT SERVICEMEMBER TO SERVE OUR NATION OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SOMETHING I COULD NOT DO WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY MILITARY CAREER AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT WE CANNOT MOVE BACKWARDS ON CIVIL LIBERTIES. IT IS AN HONOR OF A LIFETIME TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) FRMR V.P. BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO, KEENE. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW , WELL, I LOVE YOU TOO AND I LOVE THIS TOWN. THE DANGER IS I MAY COME BACK TO OFTEN. THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY. A BEAUTIFUL TOWN AND I REALLY MEAN IT. I WANT TO THANK BY THAT I WANT TO START BY THANKING PRESIDENT TREADWELL. SHE NEEDS THIS LIKE ANOTHER HOLE IN HER HEAD. I ALSO WANT TO STAY THAT THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT I HAVE A TRADITION THAT I HAVE HONORED SINCE AND MOST PEOPLE DO SINCE I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN NATIONAL POLITICS. I NEVER CRITICIZE A PRESIDENTS FOREIGN POLICY WHEN HE IS A BROAD AND I MEAN THAT SINCE EERILY. I WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY AND I DID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS FOREIGN POLICY AND WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE JEEZ EVAN AND WHAT IS IN FACT GOING ON WITH RUSSIA ETC. WHICH HAS ME GREATLY CONCERNED BUT I WILL NOT TAKE THE TIME TODAY. IT IS AN O MISSION BY INTENTION , OMISSION BY INTENTION BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT ALL HE IS A BROAD AS IT RELATES TO FOREIGN POLICY. [CHEERING] AND I WANT TO SAY TO ERIK, YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF WARRIORS THAT COME HOME IN REAL TOUGH SHAPE. I SHOWED ERIK , I HAVE A SCHEDULE THAT I'VE CARRIED EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST 470 YEARS. [LAUGHTER] BUT ON THE BACK, FOR I THINK IT IS THE LAST 12 YEARS, I CARRY WITH ME A LITTLE BLACK BOX THAT I HAVE IN THE BOTTOM. AND I HAVE MY STAFF EVERYTHING THAT MORNING, AND NOW I CAN DO IT ONLINE, CONTACT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE NUMBER OF FALLEN ANGELS THAT HAVE DIED OR BEEN WOUNDED. AND AS OF TODAY, YESTERDAY, WHEN I SPOKE IT WAS 6883. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY, IT IS 6885. I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE ARE OVER 5000 OR 6000. EVERY ONE OF THESE WOMEN AND MEN , AND SOME OF THEM BELONG TO YOU, EVERY ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS HAS LEFT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY BEHIND AND THEY DESERVE TO BE REMEMBERED. FOLKS, WHAT ERIK IS DOING IS WORKING WITH THESE FOLKS. IT IS NOT ON THIS LIST. IT IS OK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WHAT IS NOT ON THIS LIST IS THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY 300,000 SOLDIERS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SINCE WE WENT IN WHO IN FACT ARE COMING HOME WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS. MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF SUICIDE, OR MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE DYING FROM SUICIDE THAN THERE ARE BEING KILLED IN ACTION AND WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT. AND IT RELATES TO EVERYTHING FROM MENTAL HEALTH, STRAIGHT THROUGH TO DRUG ABUSE WHICH IN MANY CASES IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE ACROSS THE BOARD. AND FOLKS, IT ALSO RESULTS IN ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALMOST BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND SO, WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, ERIK, FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THESE WOMEN AND MEN. [APPLAUSE] AND, THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. AND OBVIOUSLY, I AM NOT GOING TO TRESPASS ON TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE IT COULD KEEP YOU STANDING FOR HOURS. BUT FOLKS, LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT JUST MENTIONED BRIEFLY. I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW, AS OF YESTERDAY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS FILED A BRIEF IN CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SAY THAT LGBTQ PEOPLE HAVE NO CIVIL RIGHTS. [BOOING] HE IS ALREADY CHALLENGING THE RIGHT TO MARRY, BANNING TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEMBERS , WE HAVE TO PASS THE EQUALITY ACT WHICH SOME OF YOU INVOLVED IN THIS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL GET IT PASSED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WHEN I LAUNCHED MY CAMPAIGN, AND MADE MY STOP HERE RIGHT AFTER MY ANNOUNCEMENT, I SAID YOU WOULD BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT YOU WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU GUYS HOLD ONE OF THE TWO KEYS TO GET THROUGH THE GATE. AND THIS IS , I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU, I GET IN TROUBLE WITH MICE HALF WHEN I SAY THIS BUT GOD, THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY APPEARED. YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY TO BE WHERE YOU ARE. BUT LOOK, I SAID WHEN I LAUNCHED THAT YOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF ME BUT I AM HERE THIS MORNING TO SAY THERE IS SOMETHING I THINK IS TRULY FRIGHTENING FOR NOT ONLY OUR NATION BUT FOR THE WORLD. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, TO BE FALLING APART. WHEN THE PRESSURE OF ECONOMIC, WHEN THE ECONOMY IS TEETERING ON A RECESSION, I THINK WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO HANDLE NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC PIECE OF IT BUT THE EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HAPPENS. THE TRADE WAR IN CHINA IS BLOWING UP. WE JUST LEARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES CREATED 500,000 FEWER JOBS THAN WE THOUGHT LAST YEAR. WARNING SIGNS FROM AN INVERTED BOND MARKET TO COLLAPSED MANUFACTURING ARE ALL AROUND US. AND WE ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE THIS ADMINISTRATION ACT MORE RADICALLY. THERE IS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AS I SAID BUT I WILL BE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY AND KEEP WITH MY TRADITION BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE AND HE KNOWS IT. WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT EVEN HARDER TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE WORST INSTINCTS COMING OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I PREDICT THEY WILL INCREASE. NOT DIMINISH. INCREASE. I SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS , CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME IN THE BACK? WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION. BUT IF WE GIVE IT ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, THIS WHITE HOUSE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY AND FOREVER CHANGE THE CULTURE , THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE POINT , WE CANNOT JUST BE A CAMPAIGN ABOUT EATING PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE IS TRAFFICKING IN SOME OF THE UGLIEST AND DARKEST FORCES THAT HAVE LONG RUN THROUGH THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION. A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN IS NOT ENOUGH TO BEAT HIM. THERE HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT. THERE HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT, A MOVEMENT GROUNDED ON THE VALUES AND IDEALS OF THE FINEST AS A NATION. AMERICA IS UNIQUE. UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD. NO OTHER NATION WAS FOUNDED THE WAY WE WERE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. NO OTHER NATION WAS FOUNDED ON THAT PRINCIPLE. WE THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION , IT IS UNIQUE IN HISTORY. NO NATION, NO TYRANT CAN TAKE AS DOWN. ONLY AMERICA CAN RIP ITSELF APART. SO THIS HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT TO STAND UP FOR WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WE DEMOCRATS HAVE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK, AN OBLIGATION TO DO MORE THAN JUST WIN. FOLKS, PRESIDENT WILSON I BELIEVE WAS THE ONE THAT SAID THE PARTY IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THAT FOR WHICH IT STANDS. WE HAVE TO STAND FOR THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REPAIR THE MORAL FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY. THE CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST TALKS ABOUT , HE SAID THERE IS AN INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP SOCIETY THAT IS BEING RIPPED, RENTDED AND HAS TO BE RESTORED. WE HAVE TO REACH BEYOND OUR PARTY IN MY VIEW AND UNIFY THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE WHAT WE ONCE WERE AGAIN. WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO OUR OBLIGATIONS. BUT WE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. WE NEVER ABANDONED THEM COMPLETELY. WE HAVE TO BE A NATION OF VALUES OF HONESTY AND DECENCY AND TREATING EVERYONE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING NO ONE. THE EMIGRANT, THE POOR, AND THE OTHER AS IS HAPPENING NOW AND LENDING THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, IT LEAD THAT WAY. AND STAND AS A BEACON FOR THE WORLD REMEMBERING THAT WE ARE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. WE ALL KNOW IN OUR GUT THAT THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. NOT BECAUSE I AM ON IT. BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL SAY I AM TALKING ABOUT ME. WE ALL KNOW THIS IS DIFFERENT. WE KNOW. THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT SAYS , SAY MATTER. THEY CAN MOVE MARKETS. THEY CAN SEND OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN TO WORK. THEY CAN CREATE PEACE. THEY CAN UNLEASH THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES OF THIS NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING , [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: AND BY THE WAY, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT WHO WHEN YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE SAID THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES? NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANDREW JOHNSON. THERE IS A SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING, I'M RUNNING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY MOTHER AND FATHER BUILT AMERICA. IT WAS BUILT BY HARD-WORKING, ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION AND HE SAID IT ALL THE TIME AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON AND HAD TO MOVE WHEN COLE DIED. MY DAD WAS A SALESPERSON. THERE WAS NO WORK. HE WOULD ALSO THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT EATING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT. MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAD TO DO IT IN THE GREAT RECESSION THAT WE HAD. A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE CALL IT THE LONGEST WALK , THE LONGEST WALK FOR A PEERING IS TO GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER THAT THEY CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL. MOMMY OR DADDY LOST THEIR JOB AND YOU WILL GO IN LIVE WITH GRANDPA FOR A WHILE. TODAY, , I KNEW MY DAD MEANT IT THAT IT WOULD BE OK. HE THOUGHT IT COULD HAPPEN AND IT HAPPENED. BUT TODAY, MANY PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. THEY CANNOT DO IT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THE MAJORITY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE DO NOT PLEAD THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE A CHANCE. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE WORLD. I AM PRETTY DARN SOPHISTICATED ABOUT WHAT BUILT THE NATION. AND HERE IS THE DEAL , THE REASON WHY WE NEED A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL, EVERYONE DOES WELL. THE POORER MOVE UP AND THE WEALTHY DO VERY WELL. AND FOLKS, THE REASON FOR AMERICA'S SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES HAS BEEN A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS. BELIEVING ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. AND WE ARE LOSING THAT NOW. I WILL BE REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY. BY THE WAY, I HAVE A NUMBER OF BRILLIANT ECONOMISTS THAT WORK FOR ME. WHEN YOU ASK THEM TO DEFINE THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEY WILL GIVE YOU A NUMBER. BUT IT IS NOT A NUMBER. IT IS A VALUE SET. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME. BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A PARKED AND OTHER WILL COME HOME SAFELY. BEING IN A SITUATION TO SEND YOUR KID TO A LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL AND IF THEY DO WELL THEY CAN GO BEYOND. AND IF THEY DO QUALIFY, YOU CAN FIGURE HOW TO PAY FOR IT. BEING ABLE TO TAKE YOUR MOM HOME AFTER YOUR DATA PASSES AWAY AND HOPE YOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. YOU HAVE A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM. IT IS A VALUE SET. BUT EVERY AMERICAN, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT VALUE SET, IT MATTERS TO EVERY FAMILY THAT THERE BE A GOOD EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. A CLIMATE THAT YOU CAN BREEZE, THE AIR, AND DRINK THE WATER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: I DON'T HAVE A MIDDLE GROUND. [INDISCERNIBLE] NO FRACKING. FRMR V.P. BIDEN: YOU CAN FRACK WITH ME LATER. WE WILL TALK LATER. [INDISCERNIBLE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: I'M HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU LATER. ANYWAY, BUT BY THE WAY, I AGREE WITH HER. HERE IS THE DEAL , IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN DIGNITY, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND DECENT. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK CHILD WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND YOU LOOK AT THAT CHILD AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT? NOT ONLY IS THAT CHILD IN TROUBLE BUT IT DEPRIVES YOU OF YOUR DIGNITY. OR YOU ARE BEING TOLD SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HUSBAND, A WIFE, A SON, OR A DAUGHTER WHO HAS TERMINAL CANCER. AND THEY SAY , BY THE WAY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER? OR ARE DEALING WITH IT? IT IS THE SAME IN EVERY SINGLE CROWD I SPEAK TO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR MY SON BEAU, A DECORATED VETERAN COMING HOME FROM THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND AFTER BEING IN A WAR IN IRAQ FOR A YEAR AND TWO YEARS LATER CONTRACTING TERMINAL CANCER. THEY GAVE HIM A MONTH TO LIVE, HE OUTLIVED THE MONTH BUT DID NOT OUTLIVE THE PROGNOSIS. HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE DETERMINED TO FINISH HIS JOB AND HE DID. I CANNOT IMAGINE LOOKING AT MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND MY TWO GRANDCHILDREN LYING IN BED AND IF AN INSURANCE OFFICER HAD COME IN AND SAID , BY THE WAY, YOUR TIME IS UP. YOU HAVE OUTRUN YOUR COVERAGE. YOU ARE FINISHED. FOLKS, THIS IS ABOUT NOT ONLY THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES, IT IS ABOUT , WHAT IS THE WORST THING FOR A PARENT? TO LOOK AT A CHILD WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OR A PROBLEM AND NO THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM. NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM. THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO FINISH THE JOB ON HEALTH CARE. WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. I DID NOT KNOW , THANK GOD MY MOM WAS NOT AROUND. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY. YOU KNOW HE MADE HIS TOWARD PROGRESS AND EXTENDING HEALTH INSURANCE TO SOME 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE A BEFORE. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT, PROVIDING PROTECTIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE NOW HAVE TO FINISH THAT JOB. WE HAVE TO MAKE HEALTH CARE RIGHT , A RIGHT TO AND NOT A PRIVILEGE. AND GIVE EVERYONE THE PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY DESERVE. MAKE THAT REMAIN A PUBLIC OPTION. IT IS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, MY WIFE, WHO IS A TEACHER AND WHO IS TEACHING NOW, BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE SHE TEACHES IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, AND SHE HAS AN EXPRESSION , ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE FUNDING GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN MINORITY WHITES AND , MAJORITY WHITES AND NONWHITES DISTRICTS, BETWEEN RICH AND POOR DISTRICTS. THAT IS WHY I HAVE PUT A PLAN IN TO TAKE TITLE I FUNDING FOR DISTRESSED SCHOOLS IN A DISTRICT AND TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND FROM $15 BILLION TO $45 BILLION. WE NEED TO BRING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO FUND THIS. INVESTING $400 MILLION AS NO ONE ELSE HAS SUGGESTED IN RESEARCH AND ENERGY TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION. PARTNERING WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION OF I/O FUELS AND WORKING WITH FARMERS TO CAPTURE CARBON. BUILDING CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HAVE THE CHARGING STATIONS IN PLACE FOR 2030. A RAILROAD SYSTEM AND YOU NEED ONE HERE IN YOUR STATE, BY THE WAY, IN MY VIEW. PUTTING AMERICA ON A COURSE FOR ZERO EMISSIONS AND A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. FINALLY, I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE NEED TO UNIFY THIS NATION. I KNOW I AM TOLD THAT I FIND IT FASCINATING, SOME OF MY 300 OPPONENTS , I AM ONLY KIDDING. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND MAY. THAT I KNOW I AM BEING ATTACKED FOR BEING NAIVE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PULL A NATION TOGETHER. IF WE CANNOT PULL A NATION TOGETHER, WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE AND WILL GET ANYTHING DONE. WE WILL JUST ENGAGE IN THE GREATER ABUSE OF A POWER , OF A PRESIDENT. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET ANYTHING DONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BY WORKING TOGETHER. THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO BE PRESIDENT FOR HIS BASE. I WILL BE PRESIDENT FOR EVERY AMERICAN. EVERY AMERICAN. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. TRUTH OVER LIES. AND SCIENCE OVER FICTION. LOOK, FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BECAUSE I KNOW I'M KEEPING YOU STANDING TOO LONG. HERE IS THE DEAL , I GET FRUSTRATED AND THE PRESS IS PROBABLY TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THIS. I GET FRUSTRATED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN WHILE THEY WALK AROUND. FOLKS, FOLKS , THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND THIS NATION'S CAPACITY. WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD TO THE SENATE AND I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BE SWORN IN THEY SAID I WAS A YOUNG IDEALIST AND AN OPTIMIST. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR CHANCES THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. WE HAVE TO FIRST GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP IN ORDER TO DO IT. SO VOTE. THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES AND THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WE ARE IN A POSITION IN THE U.S. WHERE OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THEY ARE IN ASIA. WHAT ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT? WHAT ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT? IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. ON THE HEALTH FRONT, WHY DON'T WE SET UP WHICH I'M GOING TO DO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, A SECTION JUST LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. IT IS CALLED DARPA. ADVANCED RESEARCH PRODUCTS , PROJECTS. WHY DON'T WE DO THE SAME IN HEALTH CARE? WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S, DIABETES, CANCER. NO OTHER GROUP CAN DO THAT BUT WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT. AND WE CAN GET IT DONE. FOLKS, THE OPPORTUNITIES , THIS YOUNG MAN STANDING IN THE FRONT, HIS GENERATION IS GOING TO SEE MORE INCREDIBLE CHANGE IF WE MOVE FORWARD AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY THAN IN THEE NEXT 10 YEARS THAN YOU OR I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS IS A GENUINE OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY TAKE OUT DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO STANDS IN THE WAY OF ALL THESE THINGS BUT UNITE THE COUNTRY IN A COMMON PURPOSE. A COMMON PURPOSE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, AGREE ON THE ISSUES WITHIN A SPAN THAT IS RATIONAL. BUT IT IS OUR POLICIES THAT ARE BROKEN. THEY ARE UGLY, MEAN. AND THEY ARE DIRECTED BY A WHITE HOUSE THAT IS NOW PREACHING DIVISION BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, AS IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION , IT IS JUST WRONG. WE HAVE TO BRING IT BACK TOGETHER. AND SO FOLKS, I WILL BE BACK AND GO INTO GREAT DETAIL AND I'M HAPPY TO DO IT AND PROVIDE TO ALL OF YOU THE ABILITY TO KNOW IN GREEN DETAIL , IN GREAT DETAIL ALL OF MY POSITIONS IN GREAT DETAIL. BUT FOLKS, ONE THING IS CERTAIN, I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL IN FACT ALONE THE 21ST CENTURY IF IN FACT WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, AND REMEMBER IT IS ""WE THE PEOPLE, WE THE PEOPLE ARE CO GOD BLESS YOU ARE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

BOTTOM LINE, THREE THINGS. WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING. IS SOMETHING LIKE 9%. IT USED TO BE THAT STATES WERE PAID TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITIES. SECONDLY, STUDENT DEBT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY BACK UNLESS WHEN YOU GRADUATE, YOU'RE MAKING MORE THAN $135,000. AND WHEN YOU PAY BACK, IT SHOULD NOT BE A 10% RATIO. AND IF YOU GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE YOUR DEBT SHOULD BE FORGIVEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOULD JUST BE FREE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST FOR COLLEGE EDUCATION. WE CAN AFFORD IT AT $6 BILLION A YEAR AND ELIMINATE JUST ONE OF THOSE TAX CUTS, WE COULD PAY FOR IT ALL. I AM TEACHING, BEFORE THAT I WAS A REHAB MANAGER. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT DESPITE WHICH UPSIDES, I AM VOTING FOR JOE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME UP WITH A. , WITH THAT.

THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO SPEAK WAS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) FRMR V.P. BIDEN: HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE. GREAT TO BE HERE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THEY TOLD ME I HAVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. I BETTER GET GOING. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN AND I AM HERE FOR JEANNIE CHICANE. , JEANNE SHAHEEN. AND TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW IN YOUR BONE THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY WE HAVE EVER FACED. THIS PRESIDENT HAS UNLEASHED THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES IN THIS NATION. HE HAS ASSIGNED MORAL EQUIVALENCE TO THOSE VIEWING HE , HATE AND THOSE THAT HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST IT. I SAID AFTER WE SOLVE THOSE FOLKS WALKING ON THE FIELD CARRYING TORCHES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THAT WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. AND WE ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO REBUILD. WE HAVE TO REBUILD. THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO REBUILD DEATH THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING CRUSHED. THE POOR IS GETTING POORER AND INCOME EQUALITY , INCOME INEQUALITY IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH MADE WORSE BY THE GOD-AWFUL TAX CUT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PASSED THAT BENEFITS NO ONE BUT THE SUPER WEALTHY. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU BELT THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND UNIONS BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WHY IN GOD'S NAME SHOULD A NURSE, A FIREFIGHTER, A POLICE OFFICER, A TEACHER , WHY IN GODS NAME SHOULD THEY PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? IT IS WRONG AND IT WILL CHANGE IN MY ADMINISTRATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO GUARANTEE AND WE CAN, IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER, GUARANTEE EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN THAT HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COVERED MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE NEVER COVERED BEFORE, WHEN I DID WILLIAM PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. NOW COVERED. WE WILL GO FURTHER. WE WILL PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, IF THEY DO NOT LIKE THE PLAN THEY HAVE, CAN CHOOSE THE PUBLIC OPTION AND ANYONE, ANYONE THAT CANNOT AFFORD IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY THE ENROLLED IN IT, ANYONE QUALIFYING FOR MEDICAID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO MAJOR THAT WE HAVE TO MAJOR THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. ACCESS TO ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND A PORTABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHICH I DO PROVIDE FOR. IT IS TIME, IT IS TIME THAT WE REMAKE THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT REPUBLICANS SAY THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY , DON'T SHOW ME WHAT YOU VALUE, SHOW ME YOUR PLEDGE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU VALUE. THEY DO NOT VALUE EDUCATION. I WILL TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON TITLE I. IT WOULD PROVIDE RAISES FOR TEACHERS MAKING SURE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA, 3, 4, 5 YEARS OLD CAN GO TO PRE-K, KINDERGARTEN AND REAL SCHOOL AND INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS DRAMATICALLY. MAKING SURE THAT EDUCATION IS AVAILABLE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO WANTS TO GO TO A TRADE SCHOOL OR WHO WANTS TO GO ON TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IT SHOULD BE FREE AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. WE CAN AFFORD IT NOW. FOLKS, THE GREATEST CRISIS OF OUR TIME IS CLIMATE CHANGE. WE MUST BEGIN TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL FOR A $400 BILLION INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR ALTERNATIVES , NEWS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BRING US DOWN TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. AND I WOULD IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH OUR ADMINISTRATION PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR 85% OF THE PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO LEAD THEM AND THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP NOW. FOLKS, OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT. WE ALL KNOW THAT. WHERE HE LACKS THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD THIS PRESIDENT , THIS PRESIDENT HAS MORE COMMON WITH GEORGE WALLACE THEN WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE 330 MILLION AMERICANS THAT HAVE TO DO WHAT THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT DO. STAND TOGETHER. STAND UP AGAINST. STAND UP AGAINST THIS GOD-AWFUL SITUATION WE FACE WITH HIS AND HIS PRESIDENCY. STAND UP FOR OUR BEST AND WHAT OUR NATION BELIEVES. WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. YOU BRING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT AND LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND AND GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING KNOW WHEN. NOT THE POOR OR THE POWERLESS. THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, LEADING NOT BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE AS WE ALWAYS HAVE. WE ARE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. IT IS THE CODE, THE AMERICAN CODE, IT IS WHO WE ARE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT GET IN. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. AN IDEA THAT IS STRONGER THAN ANY ARMY, BIGGER THAN ANY OCEAN, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANTS. IT GIVES HOPE TO THE HOPELESS. AND, NOT ONLY ARE OUR VALUES UNDER ATTACK, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY IS. WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT NOTHING IS GUARANTEED ABOUT DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO EARN IT, WE HAVE TO PROTECT IT, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BEATS IN THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT BEATS IN ALL OF US. THE AMERICAN CREED. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. WE THE PEOPLE IS THE MOST UNIQUE EXPERIMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE GENIUS OF EVERY GENERATION, UP TO THIS ONE WITH THIS PRESIDENT, OF EVERY GENERATION IS WE HAVE OPENED OUR ARMS WIDER AND WIDER TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE IN THAT ARC. THAT IS WHY IT HAS NEVER GATHERED DUST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. IT IS STILL ALIVE TODAY MORE THAN 200 YEARS AFTER IT INCEPTION. WE CANNOT AND I WILL NOT LET THIS MAN BE REELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LIMIT THE FOUR YEARS. I BELIEVE HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS PRESIDENCY AS AN ABERRANT MOMENT IN TIME. BUT IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED , IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED, HE WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. DONALD TRUMP DOES POSE , IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL, HIS THREAT TO THIS NATION. HE DOES POSE A REAL THREAT. EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA IS AT STAKE. NOW, WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. AND YES, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. FOLKS, FOLKS, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I AM TODAY. WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY NATION AND THE WORLD TO LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY. WE HAVE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL ECONOMY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES THAN ALL OF THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WE FIND OURSELVES WITH A WORKFORCE THAT IS THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME TO GET THE HELL UP. IT IS TIME TO STOP WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE CAN DO ANYTHING. WE CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL WE SET OUR MINDS TO. ANYTHING. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WE ALL HAD TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON. THE ONE LINE IN THAT SPEECH , MY FRIENDS HAVE HEARD ME REPEAT THIS OVER THE YEARS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THAT MADE THE MOST SENSE TO ME. HE SAID WHEN ANSWERING THE UNSPOKEN QUESTION WHY WE ARE DOING THIS , HE SAID, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE, I REFUSE TO POST ON ONE MORE DAY TAKING BACK THIS COUNTRY. THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AMAZING.

LIVE AT NOON EASTERN THURSDAY HERE ON C-SPAN ALSO ONLINE AT C-SPAN.ORG AND ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. CAMPAIGNING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CALLED FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS IN ROCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THANK YOU ALL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO EXCITED THAT WE HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH US TODAY IN ROCHESTER WHERE I LIVE. [APPLAUSE] SO I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING JOE FOR QUITE A WHILE AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN ON HIS PERSONAL SIDE IS HIS WARMTH AND HIS CARING AND THE WAY HE TAKES TIME OUT TO HEAR PEOPLE. AND IT'S A LOVELY BEAUTIFUL TRAIT, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT DEFINES JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN'S INTELLECT IS INCREDIBLE. JOE BIDEN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND OUR PLACE IN IT AND HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PEOPLE LIVE THROUGH IN THIS STATE AND IN AMERICA EVERY DAY. HE COMES FROM WORKING-CLASS ROOTS. HE UNDERSTANDS WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR ALL OF US THROUGH THESE YEARS. I'LL TELL YOU ON THE VICE PRESIDENTS AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WORKED ON THAT WITH HIM SAY TO ME, IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT JOE BIDEN. BUT AFTER HE GOT THAT PASSED, HE DIDN'T LEAVE IT BE. HE MADE SURE WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR VOICE. JOE HAS STOOD THERE THROUGH THE YEARS FOR ALL OF US IN LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN GET HEARD, GET SEEN, GET BELIEVED. NEXT THING THAT JOE DID THAT WAS VERY LIFE CHANGING FOR SO MANY IN THIS ROOM AND FOR OTHERS IS THAT HE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT HOW SICKNESS AFFECTS FAMILIES AND ABOUT LOSS. AND HE HEARD THESE STORIES FROM HIS OWN COMMUNITY AND AREA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT WAS A HARD PULL. AND WE WANT TO THINK ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET THIS DONE? NOT JOE BIDEN. JOE STAYED ON IT BECAUSE HE KNEW AMERICANS NEEDED TO HAVE THIS SO HE WAS THERE AND I WAS PRIVILEGED BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE IN THE HOUSE AND TO WATCH HIS PLACE AND WE HAD CHILDREN WHOSE LIVES CHANGED FOR THE BETTER IN THE ROOM WITH US AND TO WATCH JOE BIDEN'S FACE WAS TO KNOW EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT JOE BIDEN THAT HE WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING AND UNDERSTANDING AND CARING AND MAKING SURE IT HAPPENED AND WORKING WITH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WENT THROUGH. I SPENT ALMOST NINE YEARS ON THE HOUSE SERVICES COMMITTEE AND DURING THAT TIME, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD AND TALKING TO WORLD LEADERS AS WE DO, CONGRESSIONAL AND HEARING WHAT WAS ON THEIR MIND AND THEIR WORRIES AND CONCERNS IN TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ROLE, AS WELL. AND IT WAS SO WONDERFUL, ALWAYS JOEJOE BIDEN'S NAME BROUGHT THE GREATEST RESPONSE, KNOWING THAT JOE BIDEN CARED ABOUT OUR ALLIES AND CARED ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS OUTRAGEOUS, FRIGHTENING, DEVASTATING IN EVERY WAY. WHEN JOE BIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT WHAT WE WILL SEE IS SOMEBODY A WORLD LEADER WELCOMED ON THE STAGE, HE ALREADY IS IF YOU HEAR COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE MAKE ABROAD, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT HIM. HE'LL BE ABLE TO TURN THIS AROUND AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THIS IS JUST A MOMENT IN HISTORY THAT WE ARE FAR BETTER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE'RE STILL THE GREATEST, STRONGEST NATION IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THIS MATTERS. [APPLAUSE] THIS MATTERS GREAT SO HAVING TRAVELED WHILE WE SAW JOE BIDEN AS VICE PRESIDENT AND HAVING TRAVELED WHILE I WAS SERVING AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN THE OFFICE, THE DIFFERENCE COULD NOT BE STARKER SO I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE GO OUT AND TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT A MAN THAT HAS THE GREATEST RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT HE WILL BRING US BACK TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY ARE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. SO I'M READY, ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE NOW TO INTRODUCE IT, BECAUSE JOE BIDEN SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS YOU KNOW, LOVES US. I WILL TELL YOU VERY QUICKLY THAT WHEN I WAS IN PORTSMOUTH, I HAD LUNCH WITH JOE BIDEN AND 5,000 PEOPLE FROM PORTSMOUTH. IT WAS A WONDERFUL, WARM EXPERIENCE AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. JOE BIDEN IS YOUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN IS YOUR LEADER, JOE BIDEN IS A MAN WHO WILL MAKE US FEEL PROUD EVERY SINGLE DAY AND MAKE US FEEL SAFE. SO IN THAT, IT'S MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PUBLIC LIFE, SOME OF YOU HAVE RUN, SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN ELECTED. A LOT OF YOU HAVE WORKED FOR OTHER CANDIDATES. I MUST TELL YOU AS I LISTEN TO HER TALK, ONE OF THE GREAT, GREAT BENEFITS THAT COMES FROM SERVING IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT UNTIL I STARTED TO LISTEN HERE IS THAT YOU GET TO MAKE SOME OF THE DEEPEST, MOST PROFOUND FRIENDSHIPS IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BECAUSE YOU WATCH PEOPLE GOING THROUGH GREAT DIFFICULTY. YOU WATCH THEM TAKING POLITICAL RISKS TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT. AND YOU CAN FIND THE ONES WHO ALWAYS ARE GUIDED BY BASIC MORALITY, BASIC DECENCY AND BASIC SENSE OF HONOR AND CAROL, YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FELLOW YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER HAS GONE WAY OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE HELPFUL TO ME. SENATOR CHRIS KUNTZ IS NOW , NOW OCCUPIES THE SEAT THAT I HELD FOR MANY YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS IN THE SEVERAL YEARS HE'S OUTDONE BY 36 AND I'M PROUD OF HIM. THIS IS A MAN WHO AGAIN, HAS A MORAL CENTER THAT IS REAL, PROFOUND AND DEEP. AND I REMEMBER YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE HAD OTHER JOBS, HE'S BEEN ELECTED TO OTHER OFFICES AND I WAS , BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED, I WAS ELECTED AT AGE 29. AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND SAY WHAT'S THE SECRET? THERE HAD TO BE A SPECIAL SECRET IF I WON. AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S ONE THE SECRET IS HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT IS WORTH LOSING OVER? THAT YOU WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE DEEP, ABIDING CONSEQUENCES TO YOU? HE FIGURED OUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER AND THEREFORE, THAT'S WHY HE'S WON SO HANDILY IN DELAWARE. CHRIS, THANKS FOR BEING MY FRIEND. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I HAVE A FAIRLY SERIOUS SERIES OF COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THIS STATE WAS BUILT ON FIERCE PRIDE IN YOUR INDEPENDENCE, PRIDE IN YOUR REPUTATION, AND PRIDE IN THE CHARACTER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND THAT'S BEEN TRUE FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR NATION WHEN LIVE FREE OR DIE WASN'T A MOTTO, IT WAS AN IMPERATIVE FOR SURVIVAL BEFORE IT BECAME YOUR STATE'S MOTTO, SAYING. IT SPRUNG FROM THE GRANITE-HAND DETERMINATION THAT NO ONE, NO ONE WOULD DECIDE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO, WHO WOULD CONTROL OUR FUTURE. ONLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND WHEN THOSE FREEDOM FIGHTERS EARNED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND COBBLED TOGETHER A NATION CAPABLE OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, OF MEETING THREATS BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, THEY KNEW AND WE FORGET THIS SOMETIMES, THEY KNEW THAT THE BATTLE FOR OUR NATION DIDN'T END AT YORKTOWN. AT THE TIME, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS FOREIGN NATIONS WOULD INTERFERE IN OUR DEMOCRACY, IN OUR EXPERIMENT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE TO PREVENT PRESIDENTS FROM BEING SECRETLY BRIBED OR PAID OFF BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS, GEORGE WASHINGTON SPECIFICALLY WARNED AGAINST FOREIGN NATIONS MEDDLING IN OUR AFFAIRS. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. SINCE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE PROVE THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL, ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL FOES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE TO BE ALERT. OVER 200 YEARS PLUS HAS FOLLOWED AND WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN OUR VIGILANCE TO KEEP FOREIGN NATIONS OUT OF OUR ELECTIONS. THAT WAS UNTIL PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. LAST WEEK, ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, PRESIDENT TRUMP INVITED CHINA TO GET ENGAGED IN DECIDING OUR ELECTION AND WHO OUR NOMINEE WOULD BE. HE DID IT WHILE STANDING IN FRONT OF REPORTERS AND CAMERAS LIKE I AM THIS MOMENT, IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF DAY. IT WAS A THIRD FOREIGN POWER THAT WE KNOW OF, THAT HE'S ASKED IN CLEAR, UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE, CLEAR, UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE, TO INTERFERE ON BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, INTERFERE WITH THEM. QUOTE, RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, OR QUOTE, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A FAVORITE, THOUGH, END OF QUOTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. QUOTE, CHINA SHOULD START INVESTIGATION, END OF QUOTE. IT'S WRONG. IT'S THE VERY THING WASHINGTON WARNED ABOUT. IT UNDERMINES OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. IT'S UN-AMERICAN. GO IN ANY CITY OR TOWN IN THIS NATION OR STATE. GO IN ANY SCHOOLHOUSE, GO INTO ANY TOWN HALL, ANY VFW POST, ANY FOOTBALL OR BASEBALL GAME AND ASK THE QUESTION, IS IT OKAY FOR A FOREIGN NATION TO MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTIONS? TO SPREAD LIES ABOUT OPPONENTS? SPECIFICALLY AT THE DIRECT INVITATION OF A SITTING PRESIDENT? THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY, NO. AS AMERICANS IT OFFENDS EVERY BONE IN OUR BODY. THE BALLOT BOX IS SACRED GROUND IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHERE WE MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD. THAT'S WHERE WE DECIDE WHO LEADS US. THAT'S WHERE WE CHART AMERICA'S FUTURE. IT'S WHERE WE FULFILL OUR DUTY AS CITIZENS. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY. WE BELIEVE AMERICANS SHOULD DECIDE AMERICAN ELECTIONS, PERIOD. BUT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET REELECTED, INCLUDING VIOLATING THE MOST BASIC FORMS OF DEMOCRACY. IT'S STUNNING. AND IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE. IT'S A FACT. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER DARED TO ENGAGE IN SUCH UNIMAGINABLE BEHAVIOR. WITH HIS WORDS AND HIS ACTIONS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INDICTED HIMSELF BY OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE, REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY. HE'S ALREADY CONVICTED HIMSELF IN FULL VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS VIOLATED HIS OATH OF OFFICE, BETRAYED THIS NATION AND COMMITTED IN PEACHABLE ACTS. [APPLAUSE] TO PRESERVE OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR BASIC INTEGRITY, HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. THAT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S DONE. TO ANSWER WHETHER HE'S COMMITTED ACTS SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT IMPEACHMENT IS OBVIOUS. WE SEE IT IN TRUMP'S OWN WORDS, WE SEE IT IN THE TEXTS FROM STATE COMPARTMENT OFFICIALS THAT HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC. WE SEE IT IN HIS PULLING MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT INTO HIS CORRUPT SCHEMES, INDIVIDUALS, HIS APPOINTEES. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IMPEACHMENT ISN'T ONLY ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S DONE. IT'S ABOUT THE THREAT THE PRESIDENT POSED TO THE NATION. IF ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE. ONE THING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN CONTRADICT HE IS SEEING NO LIMITS TO HIS POWER REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CONSTITUTION SAYS. HE BELIEVES THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CAN BE CORRUPTED INTO FURTHERING HIS PERSONAL, POLITICAL NEEDS. HE'S EVEN WILLING TO HOLD CONGRESS AND AID TO A FOREIGN NATION HOSTAGE TO PERSON POLITICAL DEMANDS. HE BELIEVES IF HE DOES SOMETHING, IT'S LEGAL, PERIOD. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY HE BELIEVES THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. HE BELIEVES HE CAN AND WILL GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING HE DOES. WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN HE SAID HE COULD STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEONE AND GET AWAY WITH IT. IT'S NO JOKE. HE'S SHOOTING HOLES IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND WE CANNOT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS DECIDED THAT THIS NATION DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS OR THE POWER OR THE POLITICAL WILL TO STOP FIM FROM DOING WHATEVER HE WANTS. TRUMP ISN'T JUST TESTING US, HE'S LAUGHING AT US. HE HAS NO SENSE OF DECENCY. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE LAW. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS THAT FOLLOW THE RULES ARE ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUCKERS OR FOOLS OR LOSERS. WE HAVE TO PROVE HIM WRONG. WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS ARE UP TO THIS MOMENT AND YOU SEE THE, ESPECIALLY A DANGEROUS MOMENT FOR THIS NATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PRESSURE ON TRUMP IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE. AND WHEN THAT PRESSURE INCREASES HE'S ONLY GOING TO GROW MORE VOLATILE, MORE SELF-SERVING AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. HE HAS ANOTHER YEAR IN OFFICE. NO, I'M SERIOUS, THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. HE'LL STOP AT NOTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF. NO INDIVIDUAL, NO INSTITUTION, NOTHING, NOTHING THAT WE'VE HELD NATIONSACRED IN THIS NATION MORE THAN 200 YEARS WILL BE SAFE. IF DONALD TRUMP WAS JUST A REALITY TV STAR IT WOULDN'T MATTER, BUT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. HE'S COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WITH THE FREE WORLD UNDER THREAT OF ADVANCING AUTHORITARIANISM, HE HAS EMBRACED THOSE AUTOCRATS AND THE TIME CHINA IS ENGAGED IN HUMAN RIGHTS BUTCHES THAT ARE STAGGERING, MORE THAN 100 MUSLIMS ARE IMPRISONED IN SO-CALLED REEDUCATION CAMPS IN THE WEST. IN HONG KONG, PROTESTERS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING MET WITH VIOLENT REPRESSION AS THEY DEMAND THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS THEY WERE PROMISED. THEY WERE GUARANTEED BY US AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. DOES HE SPEAK OUT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND STAND FOR THE PEOPLE IN HONG KONG? OR THE PEOPLE IN REEDUCATION CAMP? NO. HE PROMISED TO STAY SILENT. TRUMP AND HIS EMISSARIES HAVE SOUGHT REPEATEDLY TO EXTORT THE EXISTENTIAL FEARS OF UKRAINIAN LEADERS FOR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, HOLDING UP POLITICAL SUPPORT OF VITALLY NEEDED MILITARY AID TO PRESSURE UKRAINE AT A TIME WHEN IT'S ENGAGED IN A LIVE WAR WITH RUSSIA. MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IN THE WEST THERE'S A WAR GOING ON NOW. A WAR THAT'S COSTING THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN LIVES. THIS ISN'T A GAME. IT'S DEADLY SERIOUS. THE UNITED STATES CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ABUSE WHATEVER POWER IS AVAILABLE TO HIM TO GET REELECTED. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND HERE'S THE KICKER. THE PEOPLE AROUND THE PRESIDENT KNEW THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS WRONG, PROFOUNDLY WRONG. WHAT DID THEY TRY TO DO? THEY TRIED TO COVER IT UP BY HIDING THE EVIDENCE, CLASSIFYING IT LIKE NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS HAD TO CLASSIFY THESE CONVERSATIONS. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS THANKS TO THE COURAGEOUS ACTIONS OF A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO HAS BEEN JOINED BY OTHERS STEPPING UP TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. TRUMP'S SCHEME HAS BEEN EXPOSED. LOOK, FOLKS, TRUMP DID IT BECAUSE, LIKE EVERY BULLY I'VE EVER KNOWN AND EVERY BULLY WE'VE READ ABOUT IN HISTORY, HE'S BASICALLY A COWARD, HE'S AFRAID. HE'S AFRAID. [APPLAUSE] HE'S AFRAID ABOUT HOW BADLY I WILL BEAT HIM NEXT NOVEMBER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, HE'S TARGETED ME AND MY FAMILY WITH LIES AND DISTORTIONS AND SMEARS. THAT'S ONLY , HE THINKS HE WILL UNDERMINE MY CANDIDACY FOR THE NOMINATION AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENCY IF I'M THE NOMINEE. HE'S JUST FLAT DOING WHAT HE'S ALWAYS DONE: LYING. EVEN THOUGH THE MAIN STREAM HAS CALLED HIM OUT FOR HIS LIES, WHILE THE PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERRUPTED HIM SAYING HE'S LYING? MAYBE. I DON'T REMEMBER. AND HE'S SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ISEARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN TO ENGAGE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TO SPREAD LIES. HE'S TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE A CAMPAIGN WHERE TRUTH AND THE FACTS ARE IRRELEVANT. YOU SAY IT LONG ENOUGH, OFTEN ENOUGH, PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE IT. AND HE'S LYING IS MATCHED ONLY BY HIS MANIFEST INCOMPETENCE. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE AT THE OUTSET OF MY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO LEVEL TO WHICH HE WILL NOT STOOP. HE'S INSINUATED THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER SHOULD BE EXECUTED. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SAID IN THE CLOSED DOOR MEETING WITH U.S. DIPLOMATS, QUOTE: I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S THE PERSON? WHO'S THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE WHISTLEBLOWER THE INFORMATION? BECAUSE THAT'S CLOSE TO A SPY, I'M STILL GOING QUOTING. YOU KNOW WHAT WE USED TO IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE WERE SMART, RIGHT? AND I'M STILL GOING QUOTING, RIGHT? SPIES ANDTREASON, WE USED TO HANDLE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO NOW. WHAT PRESIDENT HAS EVER USED SUCH LANGUAGE? THINK ABOUT THIS: WHAT PRESIDENT HAS EVER USED SUCH LANGUAGE? AND NOW, ALLEGEDLY I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THE WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY, THANKS TO OUR PRESIDENT? IT IS SHAMEFUL. HE HAS NO SHAME, THOUGH. TRUMP EVEN DARED TO SAY IF HE'S REMOVED FROM OFFICE, QUOTE, I'M NOT POSITIVE OF THE QUOTE. I'LL BE VERY PRECISE. THAT IT WILL SPARK A CIVIL WAR. [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT WING MEDIA OUTLETS ARE FULL OF BASELESS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IN THE DARKEST REACHES OF THE INTERNET RUWASH WITH THOSE VILE ATTACKS AND HE'S SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, OF CAMPAIGN MONEY FROM SPECIAL ENTER B GROUPS WHO HATE ME AND MOST DEMOCRATS TO SPREAD HIS LIES. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE, THEY'RE LIES. THERE'S NO TRUTH IN HIS CHARGES, IN THE ATTACKS AGAINST ME AND MY SON, ZERO. EVERY INDEPENDENT NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT'S REVIEWED HIS CHARGES AT LENGTH FOUND THEM TO BE FLAT OUT LIES. AND TRUMP KNOWS IT. BUT THE OLD METHOD HE HAS USED VERY WELL SINCE HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN, REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT THE LIE. MY INSISTENCE THAT A PROSECUTOR WHO WAS VIEWED AS CORRUPT BE REPLACED WAS THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED BY REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO SENT A LETTER, SENT A LETTER IN 2016 CALLING FOR THE REMOVAL BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION. SUPPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. OUR ALLIES, INCLUDING THE U.K., FRANCE, GERMANY. WHAT TRUMP DID IN UKRAINE WAS TO CARRY OUT A SECRET POLICY FOR HIS ON PERSONAL POLITICAL BENEFIT AND HOPE THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE ME AND MY GUESS IS ANYONE ELSE WHO HE THOUGHT WAS LIKELY TO WIN. WHAT I DID WAS TO SEEK TO REPLACE A WEAK PROSECUTOR WITH ONE WHO WE HELPED WOULD GO AFTER CORRUPTION THAT WAS HOLDING UKRAINE BACK. THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS THREATENING NOT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE, UNLESS THEY DEALT WITH THE CORRUPTION. WHAT TRUMP DID WAS HOLD HOSTAGE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DESPERATELY NEEDED DOLLARS TO A COUNTRY AT WAR TO ADVANCE HIS OWN POLITICAL DEMANDS. IF IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN AS A SITCOM, IT WOULDN'T BE BELIEVED. THINK ABOUT THIS. AND NOW, THERE'S A REPORT THAT NOBBLE DID TRUMP SEND RUDY GIULIANI, A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY , [AUDIENCE REACTS] HIS PERSONAL LAWYER, TO CARRY OUT HIS SCHEME AND CO-OPT THE STAGE, THAT THE ALLIES OF GIULIANI WERE WORKING HIM A SIDE DEAL AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE MILLIONS OF UKRAINE. JUST ALLEGED, I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT. A CORRUPT SCHEME WITH THE ADDITIONAL HELPING OF CORRUPTION AND SELF-DEALING ON THE SIDE. CLASSIC TRUMP. LOOK, THE ABUSE OF POWER IS A DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. HE ACTS, HE REACTS, HE TWISTS, HE TURNS ACCORDING TO WHAT HE THINKS IS GOOD FOR HIM. FOR HIS EGO. FOR PERSONAL POLITICS, FOR CAMPAIGN MONEY. VIRTUALLY EVERY DAY HE LAUNCHES A BARRAGE OF TWEETS TO DISPARAGE, THREATEN, ANYONE WHO NOT ONLY DOESN'T CRITICIZE HIM, BUT DOESN'T BATHE HIM IN PRAISE. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU EVER BEEN TO A CABINET MEETING WHERE THEY SAY YES, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE THE GREATEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THINK ABOUT IT. WE'VE BECOME SO INURED BY THIS RIDICULOUSNESS. ANYONE WHO CHALLENGES HIS OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR THAT'S BENEATH ANY PRESIDENT AT ANY TIME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THINK ABOUT THE WAY HE TWEETS AND TALKS ABOUT WOMEN OF COLOR. WHO DARE TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS AGAINST HIM AND HAPPEN TO BE SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THINK ABOUT THE WAY HE TURNED ON THE FBI AND AMERICA'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WHO WERE JUST POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT RUSSIA AND PUTIN WERE DIRECTLY ENGAGING AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH OUR SOVEREIGNTY BY ENGAGING IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. NOBODY, NOBODY DOUBTS IT. AND ON THE WORLD STAGE HE DISSED THEM AND SAID I BELIEVE PUTIN. HE'S REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED HIS DESIRE TO ADVANCE HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND HE'S READY TO DO ANYTHING IT TAKES TO STAY IN POWER, TO PROTECT HIMSELF, BECAUSE WHEN HE'S OUT OF POWER HE MAY BE A LOT MORE VULNERABLE. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. THIS ISN'T JUST AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE AND POLITICAL THEORY. A PRESIDENT WHO PUTS HIS OWN SELF-INTEREST AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC GOOD AND NATIONAL SECURITY ALSO POSES A THREAT TO EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN IN OUR DAILY LIVES. HE'S ALREADY THREATENED THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND ANYONE WHO TALKS TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER. NOW, ADDITIONAL WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE COMING FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IT FOR A FACT, I JUST KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. SOME WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HE WAS PRESSURING UKRAINE. OTHERS ABOUT PRESSURE HE MAY HAVE PUT ON THE IRS ABOUT HIS TAXES. AND BY THE WAY, EVEN THOUGH NIXON RELEASED HIS TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WHERE ARE HIS TAXES? WHAT'S BURIED IN THOSE RETURNS. WHY CAN'T THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY THEM? WHY CAN'T HE RELEASE THEM? [APPLAUSE] WELL, HE'S PROVEN HE'LL USE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AGAINST ANYONE HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS POWER, HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE. NOW, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INTERVENTION ON TRUMP'S BEHALF IN HIS PERSONAL LAWSUIT TO HIDE HIS FINANCES FROM THE PUBLIC EYE. TRUMP HAS PROVEN THAT HE'LL USE THE STATE DEPARTMENT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES, HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS POWER OR HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE. HE WILL ORDER THE REMOVAL OF CAREER DIPLOMATS WHO WON'T CARRY OUT HIS WHIMS WITHOUT QUESTION. DOES ANYONE DOUBT HE WOULD USE ANY OTHER PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, ANY OTHER POWER AVAILABLE TO HIM AS PRESIDENT TO DESTROY ANYONE? HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN POWER AND STAY BEHIND THE VEIL? THE ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE? WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY, AND I DID IT HERE AS WELL, I SAID I WAS RUNNING IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IT WAS NOT HYPERBOLE AND IT WASN'T JUST WHAT WE SAW IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS AND FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, CHANTING ANTISEMITIC BILE ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND KU KLUX KLAN. IT'S BEEN REPEATED AND REPEATED AND REPEATED. SO FOLKS, RESTORING THE SOUL OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE IN 2020. THAT'S WHY THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET DONALD TRUMP TAKE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT PERIOD. I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. HE'S PICKED THE A FIGHT WITH THE WRONG GUY. [APPLAUSE] I'M NOT GOING TO BE DISTRACTED BY ALL HIS LIES AND SMEARS AND DISTORTION. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THEY KNOW ME, AS WELL. NONE OF THESE ATTACKS ARE TRUE AND I'M GOING TO STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR LIVES. THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT.. IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES, YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND YOU CAN'T WAIT, YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET PAID A DECENT WAGE IN A JOB YOU HAVE. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION. YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO DO SOMETHING RATIONAL ABOUT GUNS. YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO TAKE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR CLIMATE AND THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE WORLD. IT CAN'T WAIT. [APPLAUSE] AND THE WORLD CAN'T WAIT FOR AMERICA TO LEAD A STABLE, PEACEFUL INTERNATIONAL ORDER. WITHOUT ONCE WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE. THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN LIKE JFK SAID WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT TAKING AMERICA TO THE MOON. HE SAID I AM WILLING TO POSTPONE THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE FOR YOU, FOR AMERICA, OUR POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITLESS, BUT IT TAKES VISION AND YES, IT TAKES PLANS, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT TAKES A PROVEN ABILITY TO GET BIG THINGS DONE. AND NO ONE IN THIS RACE HAS HAD A STRONGER RECORD OF PASSING IMPORTANT, CONSEQUENTIAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAN I HAVE OR PROMOTING THEM WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT FROM THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT RENEWLING TO THE BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS, TO THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, TO OBAMACARE TO THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH KEPT US FROM SLIDING INTO A DEPRESSION. I'VE BEEN THERE. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THESE THINGS DONE. SO LET ME FINISH WITH THIS. A LOT OF MY PRIMARY OPPONENTS AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST DEFEAT TRUMP. I AGREE. WE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] C-SPAN'S 2020 COVERAGE CONTINUES AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HOSTS A KEEP AMERICA GREAT RALLY IN MINNESOTA THURSDAY ON C-SPAN.

CSPANJB1610201925	Joe Biden	2019-10-16	Joe Biden in Davenport, Iowa	"HELLO FOLKS HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU SHE WRITES ABOUT SHE IS SERIOUS AND MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME AT THAT TIME SHE WOULD ENDORSE ME. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. IT MEANS A LOT. AND I HAVE A GREAT, GREAT FRIEND THAT WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER WE LOST ONE OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS WHO PASSED AWAY BUT JIM IS SOMEWHERE IN HERE. [APPLAUSE] AND YOUR MAYOR I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS FOR A WHILE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A GREAT HONOR OF REPETITION OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS YOU GO ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU END UP IN THE PROCESS MAKING FRIENDS FOR LIFE. NO MATTER IF YOU WIN OR LOSE HER WHAT HAPPENED TO BECOME FRIENDS FOR LIFE. SO THE FOLKS THAT I JUST NAME THEY ARE FRIENDS SHE ALSO LOST HER HUSBAND AND I LOST MY SON BUT WE CARED WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE OTHER PERSON. NOT JUST TO OURSELVES. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM APPOINTED PERSONAL PRIVILEGE WERE SO GOOD TO MY SONS. AND HUMAN BRACED HIM. AND MENTIONING A GENTLEMAN'S NAME THE GOOD GUY I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM IN A LONG TIME AND HE SAID I WOULD RATHER HAVE VOTED FOR YOUR SON BUT I WILL VOTE FOR YOU. MY DAD SAID WHEN YOU TURN TO LOOK AT YOUR CHILD AND REALIZE THEY TURNED OUT BETTER THAN YOU. THE WAY YOU EMBRACED MY SON AND ME WHEN THINGS HAPPENED , THAT MEANS A LOT. I SEE SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES. AND YOU HAVE CINDY HER LUNG CASHIER ESTATE REPRESENTATIVE AND FOR HER TO BE HERE AND OF ALL THE ROLES THE UNITED STATES HAS TO FILL, THERE WAS ONE THAT IS MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN ANY OTHER. THAT'S TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE COMMANDER OF UNITED STATES MILITARY. IT IS A SACRED DUTY AND NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DONE OR LOOKED AT. SO I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I MAKE A SERIOUS SPEECH THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT 25 MINUTES ABOUT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND WHY I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SECURITY AND THE CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. THE POWER TO DEPLOY THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, NEVER BEEN MORE CONFIDENT WARRIORS OR A MORE CONFIDENT MILITARY THAN WHAT WE HAVE. IT IS NOT AN EGO BOOSTER OR RATINGS BOOSTER. YOU TAKE THE YACHT OATH OF OFFICE TO SWEAR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE ONLY SACRED OBLIGATION WE HAVE IS TO PROTECT THOSE WE SEND TO WAR TO CARE FOR THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME AND THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY ARE GONE. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES SO THEIR GOVERNMENT CAN WORK. ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT WHEN A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IT'S FOR AN OVERWHELMING NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSE. AND ALSO DRIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR ALLIES AND TO OUR PARTNERS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL STAND BEHIND ITS WORD AND STAND WITH OUR ALLIES IN TIMES OF NEED. OUR ADVERSARIES KNOW THE UNITED STATES SEEKS PEACE THAT WILL NOT HESITATE TO DEFEND OUR NATIONAL INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THOSE WE HAVE SWORN SACRED ALLIANCES. DONALD TRUMP I BELIEVE, I'M UNCOMFORTABLE TO SAY THIS ABOUT A PRESIDENT, BUT HE IS A COMPLETE FAILURE IS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. IS MOST WRECK ONE - - RECKLESS AND INCOMPETENT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WE HAVE EVER HAD. AND HE FAILS REPEATEDLY. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. HE IS JUST INCOMPETENT. I MEAN IT. HE HAS IMPULSES AND THEY ARE IMPULSES THAT HE HAS. AND THEN WHEN THE UNPREDICTABLE HAPPENS HE'S NOT PREPARED AND IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT. IT NEVER STOPS AT HIS DESK. TALKS ARE BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN A DELUSIONAL PROMISE BY A BLOODIED DICTATOR. CAUSING HUGE PAIN INCLUDING HERE IN IOWA 160 WORKERS LAID OFF HERE IN THE QUAD CITIES WITH JOHN DEERE NOT TO MENTION THE PAIN IT HAS CAUSED TO MANUFACTURING. SO VIRTUALLY NO GAIN AT ALL IN THE STRATEGY. IRAN IS GROWING MORE AND MORE PROVOCATIVE. STARTING THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP CHOSE TO RENEGE ON A DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT ON THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS WORKING WITH THE REGIME TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THAT EVER OCCURRED IN MODERN HISTORY. AND NOW TURKISH FORCES ARE INVADING WITH OUR KURDISH ALLIES AND PARTNERS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THEIR WITHDRAWAL. ACCORDING TO THE ADMIRAL , FORMER HEAD OF NAVAL OPERATIONS AND WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION TO THE MILITARY. THEN TO HAVE CLARITY. TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD TO THE BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN SERVING IN UNIFORM. BUILDING AND MAINTAINING FOR OUR ALLIES IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. SINCE WORLD WAR II. A SMALL NUMBER OF AMERICA SPECIAL FORCES IN SYRIA, TRUMP MANAGED IN ONE FELL SWOOP HELP TO FEED ISIS, CREATE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE 160,000 NEWLY DISPLACED PERSONS RUN OUT OF THEIR HOMES. FORCING OUR TROOPS TO RETREAT. THEY ARE IN RETREAT. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS IN RETREAT FROM TURKEY. RUSSIA AND THE MURDEROUS ASIDE REGIME IS MOVING IN TO FILL THE VACUUM. ISIS, FORMERLY AL QAEDA HAS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE BY FORCING THE KURDS TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT ISIS AND HOLD THOSE PRISONERS THAT THEY HAVE AND TRY TO PROTECT THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND FAMILIES. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE REMNANTS OF THE CALIPHATE ISIS HAS SET UP 10000 ISIS TERRORISTS. SOME OF WHOM HAVE ALREADY ESCAPED. AND WITH GLOBAL CONFIDENCE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN A COMPLETE FREE-FOR-ALL. IF YOU SAY SOMETHING VERY SELF-SERVING THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW A LOT ABOUT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THAT AREA I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED BECAUSE THAT WAS MY JOB AS CHAIRMAN OF FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND DOING MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. ALL THE CONSEQUENCES I HAVE MENTIONED, EVERY SINGLE ONE CAN BE LAID AT THE FEET OF DONALD TRUMP. HE GREENLIGHTED TURKEY'S INVASION. NOW HE IS LEFT ASKING TURKEY TO STOP IT. THAT THE DAMAGE IS DONE. YOU DON'T GET A DO OVER WITH NATIONAL SECURITY. THE DECISIONS HAVE DEADLY AND SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. BUT YET THE DYNAMICS OF SYRIA ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED. AND YES THE CONFLICT BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE KURDS GOES BACK DECADES BUT BEFORE TRUMP'S TWEET A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF US FORCES WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR KURDISH PARTNERS WAS ACTUALLY KEEPING NORTHERN IRAQ RELATIVELY STABLE. PEOPLE WERE NOT DYING THEY WERE KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON WHAT WAS LEFT OF ISIS. NOW THEY BEEN BLOWN APART. IMAGINE HOW DEMORALIZING THAT IS TO OUR TROOPS AS RUSSIA POURS IN MERCENARIES TAKING VICTORY LAPS INSIDE US CAMPS AND FACILITIES. IN THE PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED THEM TO ABANDON. IN TURKEY ATTACKING THE VERY PEOPLE THEY FOUGHT ALONGSIDE OF. THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMEBODY IN THE OVAL OFFICE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY OF THEIR DECISIONS. IS GREAT UNMATCHED WISDOM""MY GOD WHAT A DELUSIONAL MAN. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THAT GREAT UNMATCHED WISDOM WITH THAT PROGRESS ACROSS TO ADMINISTRATIONS SO AS A RETIRED ADMIRAL EVERYONE WAS FLABBERGASTED. IN THE PENTAGON AND THROUGHOUT. OUR MILITARY DID NOT SIGN ON TO THIS. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MUSTERS ENOUGH BACKBONE TO CRITICIZE HIM ON. [APPLAUSE] THAT SOUNDS OUTRAGEOUS AS IT IS EVEN MITCH MCCONNELL KNOWS HE IS WRONG. [LAUGHTER] THINK ABOUT IT. LINDSEY GRAHAM IS NOW BEING ATTACKED BY TRUMP AGAIN. TRUMP TRY TO JUSTIFY HIS DECISION TO ABANDON THE KURDS BY MAKING THE ABSOLUTE RIDICULOUS UNINFORMED CRAZY COMMENT THEY DIDN'T HELP US IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. [LAUGHTER] THEY DIDN'T HELP US IN NORMANDIE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WHAT A GLOBAL EMBARRASSMENT. GUESS WHAT? A DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN DURING WORLD WAR II. BUT SOME OF IT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. YOU THINK HE WOULD REMEMBER HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT AT THE TIME AND SAID THE KURDS STOOD WITH US WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVE OF THE UNITED STATES THE DESTRUCTION OF ISIS AND THE TEMPORARY CALIPHATE. WE ACHIEVE THIS WITHOUT SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS OR SPENDING A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS AS WE DID WITH THE IRAQ SURGE. INDEED THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WORKED ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS IN SYRIA, THE KURDS THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES, BUT JUST A FEW HUNDRED AMERICANS STOPPING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOCAL FIGHTERS TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO ISIS ON THE GROUND. THE STRATEGY WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IT TURNED OUT THE SECRET PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS IS TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE UNTIL LAST WEEK. THOSE BRAVE KURDISH AND ARAB FORCES PAID A STEEP PRICE TO DEFEAT ISIS IN THE CALIPHATE THEY LOST OVER 10000 SOLDIERS. 10000. 10000. DEAD. THEY MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE AND THEN TRUMP SOLD THEM OUT. ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE PHONE CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY WHO KNEW VERY WELL. SO NOW INSTEAD OF BEING A RELIABLE AMERICAN PARTNER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY KEEPING A LID ON TERRORISM THE KURDS HAVE HAD TO MAKE THE ONLY BARGAIN THEY COULD MAKE TO AVOID BEING WIPED OUT IN THEIR WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO BE WIPED OUT. WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE TURKEY MILITARY THEY MADE A DEAL WITH TWO DEVILS. BASHIR ASIDE WHO HEADS THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA. THAT'S THE DEAL. BUT NOW BEING HANDED OVER TO THOSE TWO PEOPLE, CONTROL OF NORTHWEST SYRIA. THE BRUTAL RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN BACKED REGIMES HOW DOES AMERICA STAY SAFE AND HOW DOES THAT ADVANCE OUR INTEREST AROUND THE WORLD? THE ANSWER IS QUITE SIMPLE, IT DOESN'T. HOW DOES IT BENEFIT OUR ADVERSARIES, RUSSIA THE GREATEST INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT SYRIA, TO ENCOURAGE IRAN TO BE MORE ENGAGED ON THE WESTERN AND EASTERN SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. AND THEN TO SIT BACK AND WATCH ONE NATO ALLY TO POSE A DISTINCTION ON - - IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON ANOTHER TO FURTHER HIS GOAL OF FRACTURING THE NATO ALLIANCE. IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL. ISIS WHICH IS CLEARLY SEEN TO BE GROUP IS NOW RELEASED BACK INTO THE REGION. EVERY SINGLE STRONGMAN AS A DICTATOR AROUND THE WORLD TO ABANDON OUR PARTNERS UNDER THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF PRESSURE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WILL DO? ALL WE ARE LEFT WITH OF AMERICAN CREDIBILITY. MORE CHAOS, MORE STABILITY, MORE THREATS THESE ARE OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES IN THE REGION. POINTED OUT ALONG THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST PLACED. WHO'S COMING? THEY WILL GO TO EUROPE. THAT'S OKAY. AND WITH TRUMP'S ARGUMENT OR WITH THOSE FOREVER WARS HE MAY HAVE CAVED TO PUTIN AND ERGOGAN BUT ALSO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL TROOPS INTO THE GULF OF SAUDI ARABIA. FOR ANOTHER CRISIS WITH THE ONE WITH IRAN BUT THIS TIME THE CRISIS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN IRAN WE HAVE TO GO ALONE. NONE OF OUR PARTNERS WANT IN ON THE DEAL. AMERICA, YOU CAUSE A PROBLEM, YOU DEAL. YOU DEAL WITH THE TERRORISTS COMING OUT OF IRAN. NOT US. THIS IS NOT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. THIS IS BENDING TO THE WILL OF A STRONG MAN. THIS IS A RECIPE FOR MORE FOREVER WARS. HE IS STILL MORE THAN ONE YEAR IN OFFICE. GOD FOR BID US FOUR YEARS AFTER THAT? AS ERRATIC AS HE HAS BECOME THE MORE HE IS CERTAIN I WILL BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [APPLAUSE] REALLY. THINK ABOUT IT DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D SEE AT TIMES SPENDING $10 MILLION ON ADS THIS FAR OUT IN THE OTHER PARTY'S PRIMARY TO PICK WHO THE CANDIDATE WOULD BE? OVER 70 POLLS IN A ROW SHOWING ME DEFEATING HIM AS I BECOME THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTION IMAGINE WHAT DAMAGE HE COULD DO. EITHER INTENTIONALLY WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY TO SALVAGE OUR REPUTATION TO REBUILD THE CONFIDENCE WHAT WE SAY WHAT WE DO WE KEEP OUR WORD. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THE WORLD AS HE OR SHE FINDS IT JANUARY 2021 WHATEVER THE STATE OF DISARRAY TRUMP LEAVES IT. THERE WON'T BE TIME TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. WE NEED A LEADER ON DAY ONE TO PICK UP THE TELEPHONE TO CALL THE ALLIES TO KNOW THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL DO OUR TREATY OBLIGATIONS AND STANDBY DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. AT FIRST WITH EVERY SINGLE WORLD LEADER STILL ON THE STAGE I HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH ERGOGAN I KNOW HOW HE OPERATES PROGRESSIVE SPENT MORE TIME WITH HIM ALONE I BELIEVE THAN THE PRESIDENT HAS. IN FACT, THE REASON THE UNITED STATES PARTNERED WITH THE KURDISH MILITIA IN SYRIA IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE TURKEY DRAGGED ITS HEELS ON HELPING US TO DEFEAT ISIS. REMEMBER ALL THE PEOPLE LED IN ACROSS THE BORDER TO GO FIGHT WITH ISIS? THE TURKISH BORDER? I SPENT HOURS WITH MY SECURITY TEAM GOING OVER PROPOSALS WITH ERGOGAN. HE WANTED US TO LEVERAGE TO DEAL WITH OUR CONCERN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD HE WANTS US TO DECLARE WAR TO SEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS INTO SYRIA. BUT WE WOULD NOT DO THAT. THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT EITHER THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE PEOPLE WANT ANOTHER ENDLESS WAR. IN FACT UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORITY TO TELL ERGOGAN KNOW. BUT WE KEPT WORKING WITH TURKEY. HELPING THEM WITH THE SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOWING OUT OF SYRIA. DESIGNED AS MUCH HUMANITARIAN AID AS WE COULD TO ALLEVIATE AS MUCH SUFFERING AS POSSIBLE FOR ALSO THOSE FLEEING VIOLENCE TO OUR SHORES WE PUT IN PLACE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR THE KURDS TO BRING DOWN ISIS WHILE PREVENTING THE TURKS AND THE KURDS FROM COMING TO BLOWS. THERE WILL NEVER BE A SOLUTION IN SYRIA THAT SATISFIES OUR BEST HOPE FOR A REGION OF PEACE WITHIN ITSELF. NO ONE ONCE AMERICAN TROOPS TO BE FOREVER EMBROILED IN CONFLICT IN THE MEAT - - MIDDLE EAST OR NATION BUILDING. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMBAT TROOPS TO THE MIDDLE EAST INDEFINITELY WHICH I OPPOSED ONLY USING SMALL OPERATORS TO SUPPORT LOCAL FORCES TO DO THE FIGHTING AND ADVANCING OUR COMMON INTEREST. I WAS SURPRISED LAST NIGHT IN THE DEBATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID SHE WITHDREW ALL THE TROOPS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. WE CAN BE STRONG AND SMART AT THE SAME TIME. AND WHEN WE DO DRAWDOWN THERE'S A RIGHT WAY AND THE WRONG WAY. AND WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE IN SYRIA IS DISASTROUSLY WRONG. SO THIS TRUMP CREATED CRISIS THAT EVOLVES FURTHER INTO CHAOS, WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? FIRST WE SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATO ALLIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO BRING MORE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TO THE TABLE. THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY ARE ALLIES EVEN IF THEY DON'T ACT LIKE ONE. SO WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING A BROADER COALITION TO PULL BACK OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS SEES THE CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR CIVILIANS. THE COMMUNITY SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE INVESTIGATE IN THE REPORTS OF WAR CRIMES TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE ARE RESPONSIBLE. THE SECOND THING YOU SHOULD DO WITH THAT IMMEDIATE RESULT THAT THERE IS A WAY THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE SET UP TO FACILITATE THOSE TALKS IN THE FREE WORLD REQUIRES US TO SHOW UP AND HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. WE SHOULDN'T BE DELEGATING THIS TO PUTIN. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CRITICALLY HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT WITH THE REFUGEE CRISIS UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SENDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO SYRIA BUT THAT IS ONLY ONE QUARTER OF THE 200 MILLION THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT BUT HE SUSPENDED THAT LAST YEAR. HOW WILL THAT BE DISTRIBUTED? ON THE FRONT LINE HUMANITARIAN GROUPS ALL THROUGH THE REGION, HOW WILL THEY DO THIS AS THEY PULL THE STAFF OUT OF THE AREAS WE ARE FIGHTING? WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO CARRY OUT THE AIR LIFTS AND FIRE ON - - FOOD AND WATER AND TO REMAIN LASER FOCUSED TO PREVENT ANY RESURGENCE OF ISIS. INTO PRISON VENT VILLAGES FROM TURKISH ATTACK IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE ISIS RE- GROWING AND FILLING THE VOID. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN FOR OUR OWN SAFETY SAKE. NO MATTER HOW MUCH DONALD TRUMP TWEETS IT'S EASY FOR EUROPEANS TO ESCAPE ISIS FIGHTERS OR FOR US TO GO BACK. THAT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKED THE FIRST TIME AND CERTAINLY NOT NOW IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT ISIS AGAIN. DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION WE BUILD A COALITION TO TAKE ON ISIS WITH 81 PARTNERS THAT WAS PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT THAT TOGETHER. EIGHTY OTHER NATIONS TO PARTICIPATE WITH US TO CURTAIL THEIR EXPANSION WITH THE CALIPHATE AND THOSE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. ASK YOURSELF IF THERE'S ANYTHING TRUMP HAS DONE, ANY INTERNATIONAL TREATY, ANY ALLY ALLY, AFTER LEAVING PARTNERS TO BE SLAUGHTERED WITH NO DISCERNIBLE STRATEGY, TAKING THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THUGS IN THE WORLD FROM KIM JUNG-UN TO PUTIN, WHO WILL STAND WITH US? HOW MANY MORE BRAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS DO WE HAVE TO SEND TO FIGHT ALONE TO PROTECT US? AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT TODAY. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING WHAT HE'S DOING IN SYRIA IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN SYRIA IT'S MORE INSIDIOUS THAN THE BETRAYAL OF OUR PARTNERS AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN TAKING THE BOOT OFF THE NECK OF ISIS. HE IS DEMOLISHING THE MORAL AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE CONFIDENCE IS SO EXTREME IN THE ABUSE OF POWER IS SO RAMPANT THAT HE IS TORCHING AMERICA'S INFLUENCE AND THE ABILITY TO GET THINGS DONE AROUND THE WORLD. CLIMATE CHANGE. 85 PERCENT WILL COME BACK TO COOPERATE WITH US WHEN WE PUT TOGETHER THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. MASS MIGRATION. FROM VENEZUELA AND OTHER PLACES. UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THE ASCENDANCY OF CHINA AND THE RESURGENCE OF RUSSIA. HOW WILL WE MEET THESE CHALLENGES WE FACE IF THE UNITED STATES IS EVER REDUCED IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD TO BE AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER? WHO WAS GOING TO STAND WITH US? NOT JUST A SERIES OF HANDSHAKES AND PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. CONSTANTLY BUILDING AND MAINTAINING. WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE COMMON INTERESTS OR OF MANAGING POINTS OF CONFLICT THAT IS A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS TO EMPOWER AND A COHERENT NATIONAL SECURITY PROCESS FOR EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE EXECUTED. ALMOST THREE YEARS AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS. AND NEVER WILL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT IS DONALD TRUMP. NOT OUR ALLIES, NOT HER NEIGHBORS, NOT OUR DIPLOMATS ARE VALUES OR LEADERSHIP. NOT OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. NOT THE INCREDIBLE HUMAN SUFFERING THAT IS BEING CAUSED. NOT EVEN WITH ISIS THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORIST GROUP IN MODERN HISTORY. HOW MANY THINK THEY WILL REGENERATE ONCE AGAIN TO GAIN STRENGTH AND THREATEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. IT SHOULD MATTER TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACT SPEECH BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. OR A GROUP OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS. THIS IS EVERY DAY AMERICANS AND EVERY SINGLE FAMILY. WHAT DOES AMERICA STAND FOR? WHO DO WE WANT TO BE? UNITED STATES WORKS WITH OUR PARTNERS OF DEMOCRACIES FOR THE SAKE OF OUR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY AND HER OWN PROSPERITY. NO COUNTRY MORE THAN OURS CAN GO ALONE AGAINST THE CHALLENGES OF RESPECTING HER BORDERS THAT CANNOT BE CONTAINED BY LAWS. THE INVESTMENT WE HAVE MADE HAVE COME BACK TENFOLD. AND THEN TO ATTACK THOSE GLOBAL CHALLENGES AND THEN TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE US. I MET A GENTLEMAN AT THE AIRPORT WITH VIETNAM VETERANS. AT THE TIME IS THAT WITH ME JUST BEFORE I CAME OVER HERE TALKING ABOUT GOING AGAINST BEING THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN. AMERICA FIRST MEANS AMERICA ALONE. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH A CRISIS THAT WILL AFFECT US IN EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN IOWA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? ALL THE PLACES AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SURVIVE IN THE FAIR TRADE POLICY. HOW DO WE DO THAT? MAKE NO MISTAKE. NATIONS WILL MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE PICTURE AND MAKE THEIR OWN DEALS TO BE A PART OF AN ALLIANCE. WHAT DO THEY KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP'S VISION EVERYTHING THAT AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND SACRIFICED, I BELIEVE WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP THINKS WE ARE. THAT WE CAN AND MUST BE THE NATION THE WORLD LOOKS TO MOBILIZES OTHERS FOR COMMON GOOD AS A BEACON OF LIBERTY. WITH THOSE OPPRESSED OPTIONS IN A BULWARK OF DEMOCRACY. A CHAMPION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. A LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. ALL OF THIS IS ON THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER. THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IF WE WANT TO RETAKE OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD TO KEEP THE UNITED STATES SAFE AND SECURE BECAUSE WE BUILT ON OUR ALLIANCES AND CHOOSE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL REBUILD OUR CREDIBILITY TO RESTORE THE VALUE OF AMERICA'S WORD. I PROMISE YOU IF WE DO NOT OTHERS WILL MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS. IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT NATO OR THE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE. IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT ALLIANCES IN THE PACIFIC. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR SOME OF THESE NATIONS TO NO LONGER TAKE OUR WORD BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO GO NUCLEAR? BEFORE THEY DECIDE BEFORE THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOMMODATION WITH PUTIN OR CHINA? FOLKS, THIS POLICY IS A DISASTER THIS PRESIDENT IS A DISASTER. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. IT IS TOTALLY WITHIN OUR POWER. HAVE TO BE SURE WHAT WE MEAN AND EXPLAIN WHAT WE DO AND MAKE NO APOLOGIES SO THE WORLD OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC CAN LOOK AT WHOEVER WE PICK AND SAY I BELIEVE THAT PERSON AND I BELIEVE ONE DAY NUMBER ONE THAT PERSON IS READY TO COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE, DOES NOT MEAN ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY FROM PUTIN TO OUR ALLIES TO BE WHAT HE SAYS WHAT THEY ARE. AND NOT TO DO ANYTHING THOROUGHLY RECKLESS BUT WE CANNOT. AND FOREVER CHANGE THE NATION OF WHO WE ARE. THAT'S MY INTENTION. THANK YOU GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

CSPANJB1710201927	Joe Biden	2019-10-17	Democratic National Committee Women's Leadership Forum Conference, Joe Biden Remarks	HELLO FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN I'M JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND AND VALERIE'S BROTHER IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK WITH SO MANY OLD FRIENDS I HAVE BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE HAVE DONE TO BUILD A PARTY. YOU HAVE BEEN THE HEART AND SOUL NOT HYPERBOLE INCLUDING THE TOUGH FIGHTS. BUT WHEN WE DID IT WASN'T ALWAYS ON THE FIRST TRY EITHER. BUT THE RECORD WILL SHOW WE WON MOST OF THEM TOGETHER. AND IT'S DUE TO THE POWER AND RESILIENCE OF SO MANY WOMEN IN THIS ROOM I SAW THOSE QUALITIES FIRSTHAND BY THE WAY BECAUSE I'M CHARACTERIZED AS THE OLD GUY BUT I HAVE CAMPAIGNED IN DISTRICT CAMPAIGNS FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES THAN ANYBODY AROUND AND THIS LAST TIME OUT I WENT INTO 24 STATES CAMPAIGNING FOR OVER 60 CANDIDATES AND ALONGSIDE WALKING DOOR TO DOOR TO SPEAK AT RALLIES WITH 33 WOMEN LAST YEAR. MOST IN THE RED AND PURPLE STATES. I CAN SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THE MOST REMARKABLE GROUP OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES I HAVE EVER CAMPAIGNED FOR. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE HELPED TO CHANGE IN THIS ROOM IS THAT WE NO LONGER TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES. EVERY SINGLE ISSUE IS A WOMAN'S ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] THE ECONOMY, GUNS, HEALTHCARE ECONOMY, GUNS, HEALTHCARE, NATIO NAL SECURITY. THE WOMEN THAT I CAMPAIGNED FOR THEY HAD GRADUATED FROM ONE OF THE ACADEMIES WHETHER NAVAL OR AIR FORCE ET CETERA. AND EVEN IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ONE CAMPAIGNED FOR ME. THEY FORGOT MORE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. THIS IS NOT A JOKE THEN DONALD TRUMP WILL EVER KNOW. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW. REALLY. THE AIR FORCE CAPTAINS AND THE ATTENDANT THING COMMANDERS. THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT IN COMBAT WOMEN UNDERSTAND IN THEIR BONES WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE BACKS OF OUR ALLIES WHEN WE MAKE A COMMITMENT. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW WE THINK ABOUT THESE IN MALE TERMS BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS CHANGING HERE. YES TOLD YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING MY SON COULD DO THAT MY DAUGHTER COULD NOT DO AS WELL AND IT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD. I UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF WHAT IT MEANS WHEN WE ABANDON IT'S NO SURPRISE THOSE WOMEN 25 THAT WE WON BACK THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE ALL FIGHTERS. LAST SMART LAWN - - LAST MONTH MARKED THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST FIGHT. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST DRAFTED THE ACT THERE WAS DIFFICULTY TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE TRY THAT BEFORE AND IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGED WITH CHOICE AND GENDER BUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAID YOU'RE ALREADY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS CENTERS. AS SOME OF YOU REMEMBER WHAT OUR OPPONENT SAID WHEN WE SUGGEST WE HAVE FEDERALLY FUNDED WOMEN'S SHELTERS AND THIS WAS LITERALLY REPEATED THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL CHURCHES BIDEN WANT TO SET UP THE INDOCTRINATION CENTERS IS NOT A JOKE OF COURSE WE WERE FACING A POLITICAL ATTACK WE CONTINUE TO FACE THE NEED TO CHANGE AMERICAN CULTURE AND HOW WE TREAT WOMEN IN SOCIETY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS CONSIDERED A FAMILY AFFAIR AS A MEMBER OF THE CHRISTIAN COALITION THOSE THAT SUPPORTED US TO SAY BIDEN IS BREAKING UP FAMILIES THE BURDEN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS ALWAYS LAID OUT THE WOMAN'S FEET. WHAT WERE YOU WEARING? DID YOU HAVE ON A BRA WE WEARING A SLIP? WHAT DID YOU SAY? REMEMBER THAT LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME TO NEW YORK CITY I CONVINCED HER TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHE WANTED TO LEAVE HER APARTMENT COMPLEX ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE AND HAD A RESTAURANT BAR ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE LANDLORD KEPT HARASSING HER EVERY TIME SHE WANTED TO MOVE FROM A EFFICIENCY TO A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT SO SHE GOT A CALL WHEN DOING A SHOOT AND SAID IF YOU STOP AT THE RESTAURANT ON THE WAY BACK WE WILL HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT I HAVE A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. SHE DID WHEN SHE STOPPED SHE WENT TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT AND HE HIT ON HER AGAIN SO SHE WALKED OUT SO THEY SLASHED HER FACE WITH RAZORS BECAUSE HE HIRED TWO GOONS. AND I ASKED HER BEFORE SHE TESTIFIED ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION AT THE TIME WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER SAY? SHE SAID WHY WAS I IN A BAR? WHAT DID YOUR GIRLFRIEND SAY TO YOU? WHAT WE WEARING? HOW SHORT WAS YOUR SKIRT? FOLKS, THESE ARE INSIDIOUS AND DESTRUCTIVE WAYS TO APPROACH AN ISSUE. WE ARE STILL FIGHTING THIS BACKWARD THINKING TODAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE BRAVERY OF THOSE WHO CAME FORWARD WITH THEIR STORIES AND THEN TO BEGIN TO BREAK THE DAM OF CULTURAL RESISTANCE WE PASSED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT AS WE EXPANDED THE COVERAGE BUT I WANTED TO DO FROM THE BEGINNING BUT COULD NOT GET DONE WE AUTHORIZATION IS TO IMPROVE THE LAW AND COVER MORE PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN LGBT COMMUNITY OF WHAT WE SHOULD'VE DONE 25 YEARS AGO AND COULD NOT GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE ALONG THE WAY BUT STILL TODAY MITCH MCCONNELL AND REPUBLICANS THAT THE BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE I TRY TO SAY YOU CAN'T OWN A WEAPON EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT MARRIED WITH A DOMESTIC ABUSE ORDER OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR MISDEMEANORS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE NRA WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHETHER YOU HAVE A DATING PARTNER RATHER THAN BEING MARRIED. YOU SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND NOBODY SHOULD HAVE A WEAPON. WHAT ALSO KEEPS FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CONVICTED FOLKS? THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SOLD OUT TO THE NRA IN A WAY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS. WE HAVE TO GET THIS PAST PROGRAM SORRY TO RAISE THIS WITH YOU NOW THAT WE NEED YOUR VOICES IN ADDITION TO HELPING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WIN BUT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE AND PUT THE PRESSURE ON THIS ADMINISTRATION ON THIS PRESIDENT BUT MORE PORTLY ON THE CONGRESS AND UNITED STATES SENATE TO FORCE THEM TO HAVE TO VOTE. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY IS A PRESIDENT THAT HAS BELITTLED WOMEN AND DEGRADED THAN HIS WHOLE LIFE LIFE, NOW HE HAS GONE BEYOND THAT TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. HIS ENTIRE LIFE IS BUILT ON ABUSE OF POWER. SO I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FINALLY ON TO HIM. AND THE MORE THAT CONGRESS FOCUSES ON HIS CORRUPT BEHAVIOR THE MORE ERRATIC HE WILL BECOME. HE HAS ANOTHER YEAR IN OFFICE. MAYBE. MAY BE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION IN ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY. IT IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE. SCORES OF ADVISORS AND MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THEY HAVE GONE TO JAIL CONVICTED OF FELONIES AND OTHERS WILL BE GOING TO JAIL. [APPLAUSE] AND HE GETS MORE VICIOUS AND ERRATIC AND SELF-SERVING AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY CLOSES IN ON HIM. IT HAS GONE SO FAR TO CROSS THE LINE. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A FRUSTRATED HISTORIAN BETTY GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID FIRST THING AFTER BECOMING PRESIDENT PRESIDENT, THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT OUR REPUBLIC FACES, I AM PARAPHRASING, IS INTERFERENCE FROM FOREIGN POWERS. THEY BRING DOWN THE REPUBLIC. GUESS WHAT? WHAT HAS HE DONE? NOW HAS INVITED THREE FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO ENGAGE AND INTERFERE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. HE HAS $10 MILLION OF ADS WORKING OUT THERE TO SAY I WILL BEAT THEM AGAIN THE NRA. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WITH THE HUNTSMAN ONE - - HENCHMEN AND HIS THUGS WITH THIS INVOLVEMENT. SO TWO OF THOSE GOT ARRESTED SNEAKING OUT OF THE COUNTRY WARREN GOT ARRESTED COMING BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE MASTERMINDS RUDY GIULIANI. [LAUGHTER] HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE. [LAUGHTER] HE REFUSES TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THAT REMINDS ME OF THE LINE FROM VOLTAIRE THAT SAID SAID. I HAVE NEVER MADE ONE PRAYER TO GOD. OLD LORD MAKE MY ENEMIES RIDICULOUS AND GOD GRANTED IT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] AND GOD HAS GRANTED IT AGAIN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [LAUGHTER] THIS ELECTION IS NOT TO GET ME OUT OF THE RACE BUT IT'S ABOUT YOU AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT HEALTHCARE WE HAVE TO OVERCOME THE SPECIAL INTEREST INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO PRAY AND PAY A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CAN CHOOSE THE PUBLIC OPTION THAT BY THE WAY WE CAN FULLY AFFORD TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THE CODE AND WHEN YOU DO THAT SO EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD AND THEN TO PAY TEACHERS WHAT THEY DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER WHAT THEIR GRADES ARE THE DEAD BY CODIFYING ROE V WADE AS A MATTER OF LAW. THE MEANS OF FEAR AND PANIC RELATED TO GUN VIOLENCE YOU SEE THEM HERE TO DEATH AND THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO MOVE IN AND NOT BE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST CONCERN. CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND 17 THINK THEY WILL BE SHOT IN SCHOOL. WHAT HAVE WE BECOME? WE HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING ON THE NRA I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS BEATEN THEM NATIONALLY I'VE BEEN THEM TWICE IF I'M THE NOMINEE I PROMISE YOU I WILL BEAT THEM LIKE A DRUM AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE WOMAN I ASKED TO BE ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, DIANE FEINSTEIN IS THE REASON WE FINALLY MY - - FINALLY GOT THIS. ELIMINATING MAGAZINES WITH MULTIPLE MOUNT YOU CANNOT RUN AROUND WITH MORE THAN THREE SHOTGUN SHELLS WITH A MAGAZINE THAT CARRIES 100 ROUNDS. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? THAT MEANS TAKING ON THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD TO MAKE SURE IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY ADMINISTRATION ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE CLIMATE ACCORD WILL COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO RECOMMIT TO FOR WHAT THEY CAN DO THEY MAKE UP 85 PERCENT OF THE PROBLEM. IF WE DON'T LEAD IT THE VACUUM WILL BE FILLED BY OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE INTEREST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. LITERALLY WE CANNOT GET A DAMN THING DONE UNLESS HE IS DEFEATED. IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE CALLED INTO WHOEVER WINS THE RACE IT WILL TAKE A HELLUVA LOT OF WORK TO MAKE UP FOR THE DAMAGE HE IS DONE INTERNATIONALLY AND NATIONALLY. THE THUGS AND CO-CONSPIRATORS WILL UNDERMINE THE DEMOCRACY IN THE MEANTIME. IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN UKRAINE. MORE IMPORTANTLY BUT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OF IRAN. WHEN HE EMBRACES THE THUGS AROUND THE WORLD LIKE KIM JUNG-UN LIKE ANY BULLY I HAVE EVER KNOWN. BUT HE IS DEFINITELY AFRAID. THAT HE SHOULD BE BECAUSE OF THE WOMEN IN THIS ROOM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEN YOU WILL GO OUT AND HIT THEM LIKE A DRUM. BUT I'M SO TIRED OF DEMOCRATS WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN LIKE WHOA IS ME. WHAT WILL BE DUE? HOW CAN WE GET ANYTHING DONE? WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO ON THE 21st CENTURY. WHAT I GOT ELECTED AS A 29 -YEAR-OLD KID I WAS LABELED AS THE IDEALISTIC OPTIMISTIC GUY. WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD MORE RESEARCH AND DIVERSITY MORE CHANGES TAKEN PLACE THAN ALL OVER THE WORLD COMBINED WHERE SITUATION THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING WE CAN DO. I SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE WORKING ON HOW TO BE CANCER. WE ARE ON OUR WAY. IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THOSE AROUND THE WORLD TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF HOW WE RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. FOLKS, I AM SO DAMN TIRED OF US FORGETTING OF WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE HAS NEVER EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN AMERICA SETS ITS MIND TO SOMETHING IT HAS NOT GOTTEN IT DONE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LET'S TAKE IT BACK AND LEAD THE WORLD AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING THE TROOPS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. I AM ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS PENNSYLVANIA AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO PENNSYLVANIA. SORT OF TELLS YOU WHO I AM. I AM HONORED THAT I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS INTERACTION THIS MORNING. I AM A SCHOOLTEACHER FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I AM REALLY HONORED THAT THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I TAUGHT 10-YEAR-OLDS AND 11-YEAR-OLDS AND TOLD THEM THESE THINGS COULD HAPPEN. I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ME. THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE AND I'M ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING IS TRULY AMAZING TO ME. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH I'M NOT APPRECIATIVE THAT JOE BIDEN ENTERED THIS RACE. [APPLAUSE] NOT JUST BECAUSE HE IS A FRIENDLY , BUT HE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATES EDUCATION. PUBLIC EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MY DISTRICT, THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IN WHAT THEY CALL FINANCIAL RECOVERY, WHICH MEANS WE ARE BROKE. IF WE WERE UNIQUE, THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT, BUT WE ARE NOT. YOU HAVE WATCHED TELEVISION AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY HAVE HAD TO WALK IN ORDER TO GET THE SALARIES THEY DESERVE OR THE HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE. WHAT ABOUT OUR STUDENTS? ONE OF THE THINGS I AM HAPPY ABOUT IS MR. BIDEN'S PLAN, TITLE I FUNDING. HE WANTS TO TRIPLE THAT. MOST OF US DEPEND ON THESE FUNDS FOR OUR STUDENTS. IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT, WE HAVE A PROUD HERITAGE. WE HAVE PRE-K THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD EDUCATION. WE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT AND HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS. OUR CHILDREN DESERVE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE, THIS IS SOMETHING EVERY PYRO , EVERY CHILD AND PARENT IN THE UNITED STATES DESERVES. HOW ABOUT THE FACT WE HAVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS? HOW ABOUT THAT? HOW ABOUT IF WE CORRECTLY , IF WE CORRECT THE IDEA AND ACTUALLY FUNDED? , FUND IT? WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY HELP OUR NEEDY CHILDREN INSTEAD OF PUTTING CHILDREN IN CAGES? [APPLAUSE] I THINK IT IS TIME, ALSO, THAT PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WE, IN EDUCATION, ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF COLLEGES, WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS, WE WE IN THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE 38 OPEN LANGUAGES. 38. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES AND ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN. WE NEED HELP, AND WE NEED LOTS OF IT, AND SO DOES EVERY TEACHER IN EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY THIS. FOR THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEARS, THE CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED. THE OTHER MORNING, I READ THE NEWSPAPER LOCALLY, THAT THE LATEST THING FROM THE PRESIDENT IS TO CUT FUNDS FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. SHAME ON HIM. SHAME ON HIM. SHAME ON HIM IS RIGHT. . THE PRIVILEGED SHOULD REALIZE THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE. IT IS TIME TO START LEARNING TO SHARE, AND SHARE AMONG OUR NEEDIEST IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT BEGINS WITH THREE AND FOUR EUROS COMING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS , FOUR-YEAR-OLDS COME INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GETTING THE START THEY DESERVE. I DON'T WANT TO JUST STOP WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME WITH 10 AND 11 EUROS, SO I WAS GIVEN AN EDUCATION. BUT, I DON'T WANT TO FORGET THAT EDUCATION GOES BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AND IT GOES INTO THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND THE TRADES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT MAYBE IT IS TIME WE INVESTED SOME TIME AND MONEY, AND MAYBE ACTUALLY, IT IS TIME THAT WE WORKED ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND LOAN FORGIVENESS. AND GIVE PEOPLE A BOOST UP. [APPLAUSE] BUT, I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT REPRESENTING THE 900 MEMBERS OF THE TEACHERS IS ONE OF MY PROUDEST ACCOMPANIMENTS OF MY LIFE, AND AS LONG AS THEY KEEP ME WORKING, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. BUT WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT SOUTH SCRANTON JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, SEE? I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT IS STILL LIVING. WHEN I WAS A STUDENT THERE, I WORE A PIN, AND IT WAS PROBABLY AROUND THIS TIME, THE PEN I WORE SAID, ""START PACKING, AMY, THE KENNEDYS ARE COMING."" SO I SAY TODAY, ""MELANIA, START PACKING, THE BIDENS ARE COMING."" [APPLAUSE] IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN: THANK YOU. HELLO, FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU. WE WANT JOE! JOE BIDEN: PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT GENEROUS INTRODUCTION. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND. I'M HAPPY TO BE HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS GOOD TO BE HOME. SCRANTON, WHEN YOU ARE A KID, NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU LIVE HERE, CLIMBS INTO YOUR HEART AND OCCUPIES YOU. SO MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE FROM SCRANTON. SO MANY PEOPLE FROM SCRANTON, AND SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE HERE. MY MOTHER, EUGENIA, RAISED IN SCRANTON, FIRST 35 YEARS OF HER LIFE BEFORE MOVING TO DELAWARE. SHE LIVED TO AGE 92, THANK GOD. THE LAST 10 YEARS OF LIFE, SHE LIVED WITH ME. YOU KNOW, AFTER MY DAD PASSED, SHE MOVED IN, BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO GET HER TO MOVE IN WITH US, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN DELAWARE IN OUR THREE BEDROOM, SPLIT LEVEL HOME FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, WE ALWAYS HAD A RELATIVE LIVING WITH US, EITHER MY GRANDPA OR MY GREAT AUNT OR AN UNCLE. THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMEONE IN OUR THREE-BEDROOM HOME WITH FOUR KIDS AND MOM AND DAD. IT WAS GREAT FOR THE KIDS. IT REALLY WAS. IT WAS GREAT HAVING MY GRANDPA WITH US, AND SO ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER WAS, MY MOTHER, LOOKING BACK ON IT, THOSE WALLS WERE PRETTY THIN. AND SO, AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY, I TRIED TO GET MOM TO MOVE IN WITH ME IN A HOME WE HAD JUST BUILT. I BUILT A SUITE FOR MY MOM AND DAD, BUT MY DAD WAS IN HOSPICE THE LAST FIVE MONTHS OF HIS LIFE IN OUR HOME. BUT MY MOM WOULDN'T MOVE IN BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE WASN'T ""GOING TO DO THAT TO ME."" BUT I SAID, ""MOM, YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT TO ME. YOU ARE DOING THAT FOR US."" SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN. BUT THAT'S HOW MY SISTER AND BROTHERS WERE RAISED. WE WERE TAUGHT THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FAMILY. AND FAMILY IS NO BURDEN. EVEN THEN, SHE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY MOVE INTO OUR HOUSE. SHE SOLD HER HOUSE, AND THERE IS A LITTLE BARN ON THE PROPERTY I BOUGHT. THE FIVE ACRES ARE PURCHASED. , I PURCHASED. SHE WANTED ME TO BUILD HER A HOUSE THERE. EVERY NIGHT, I WOULD COME HOME AND GET TO KISS HER GOOD NIGHT. MY WIFE JILL WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF HERS. SHE WOULD SAY, ""EVEN WITH YOUR MOTHER, I CAN SMELL ICE CREAM."" [LAUGHTER] I GOT TO KISS HER GOOD MORNING AS SHE LEFT TO THE TRAIN. BUT THAT SATISFIED HER PRIDE AND GAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY SOLACE. EVERYTHING MY SISTER, VALERIE, AND I LEARNED CAME FROM SCRANTON. SCRANTON, AS I SAID, CREEPS INTO YOUR HEART AND NEVER LEAVES YOU. WHEN PEOPLE WOULD ASK MY MOM AFTER SHE HAD BEEN IN DELAWARE , NOT AN EXAGGERATION , OVER 50 YEARS, SHE WOULD SAY ""I'M FROM SCRANTON."" ""I'M FROM SCRANTON."" NOT A JOKE. SHE AND MY DAD PASSED ALONG THOSE VALUES THAT SCRANTON FAMILIES ARE ALL ABOUT. SHE USED TO SAY, JOE, , ""JOE, REMEMBER, YOU ARE DEFINED BY YOUR COURAGE AND YOU ARE REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY."" THAT WAS MY GRANDFATHER, AMBROSE FINNEGAN. JOE, COURAGE IS THE GREATEST VIRTUE WITH ALL , VIRTUE OF ALL BECAUSE WITHOUT COURAGE, YOU CAN'T LOVE WITHOUT ABANDON. MY DAD MOVED HERE WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER TO DUNMORE WHEN HE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE WENT TO ST. THOMAS PREP. ALL OF MY EXTENDED FAMILY IS HERE AS WELL, INCLUDING SOME OF MY RELATIVES HERE TODAY, THE FINNEGANS AND GAFFNEYS. MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING MY FATHER TAUGHT ME WAS THAT WE WERE RAISED IN THE SAME TRADITION THAT I FOUND WITH EVERYBODY I CAME IN CONTACT WITH HERE. AND STAYED IN TOUCH WITH THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME NOTION. EVERY SINGLE PERSON, MY DAD USED TO SAY, ""NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE, IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY."" , THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY."" ""DIGNITY."" A WORD I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY USED MORE HERE IN SCRANTON, AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE, THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. IT'S ALL ABOUT DIGNITY, IN A MATTER WHAT YOUR STATION IN LIFE, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS. EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. MY DAD , [APPLAUSE] MY DAD WAS A REAL GENTLEMAN. HE WOULD TELL ME ""JOE, REMEMBER, , SHE WOULD SAY THE SAME TO MY SISTER, EXCEPT HE WOULD SAY A WOMAN , ""YOU HAVE TO BE A MAN OF YOUR WORD, OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT A MAN."" IT'S ABOUT HONOR AND IT'S ABOUT FAMILY. I LEARNED THAT MY GRANDPA'S KITCHEN TABLE. NOT A JOKE. HE WOULD SAY, ""JOEY, FAMILY IS THE BEGINNING, THE MIDDLE, AND THE END."" THE OLDER I GOT, THE MORE I LEARNED TO ADMIRE MY DAD'S COURAGE AND RESILIENCE. WHEN SCRANTON FELL ON HARD TIMES IN THE LATE 1940'S AND EARLY 1950'S, MY DAD , IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, HE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT SCRAPPY JOE BIDEN FROM SCRANTON. PEOPLE RESENT THE HELL OUT OF THAT, BECAUSE I REPRESENTED THEM FOR FOUR , FOR YEARS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WAS IN A PARADE IN A LITTLE TOWN BEFORE MY SON PASSED AWAY, ONE OF THE FAVORITE PARADES MY KIDS WOULD GO TO WITH ME. I WAS WALKING DOWN THE PARADE ROUTE AND THANKING THEM FOR BEING GOOD TO MY BOY, AND THREE GUYS LOOKING LIKE YOU I PLAYED BALL WITH IN SCHOOL CAME BEHIND ME AND SAID, ""WHAT IS ALL OF THIS ABOUT SCRANTON? DAMMIT, YOU'RE FROM DELAWARE."" [LAUGHTER] BUT MY DAD, LIKE I SAID, IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, YOU'D THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE, BUT MY DAD WAS A WHITE COLOR SALESPERSON. I REMEMBER HIM MAKING WHAT I CALL THE LONGEST WALK, THAT SOME OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS HAD TO MAKE. THE LONGEST WALK UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO YOUR CHILD'S BEDROOM TO TELL THEM, ""HONEY, YOU CAN'T PLAY IN THE LITTLE LEAGUE ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A JOB. DAD'S GOT TO MOVE. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE."" I REMEMBER DAD DOING THAT. I REMEMBER BACK TO MY ANCESTRAL HOME UP THERE, A LOVELY WOMAN , A LOVELY PERSON WHO BECAME A FRIEND, , WHO BOUGHT IT FROM MY GRANDPOP. IT JUST BRINGS BACK MEMORIES. HE SAID, ""WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE, HONEY. IT'S ONLY 157 MILES AWAY."" HE'D BEEN RAISED IN WILMINGTON UNTIL HE WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE SAID, ""ONLY 157 MILES AWAY, AND I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND."" I REMEMBER THINKING THAT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON. AND HE DID. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT A LOT OLDER THAT I REALIZED HOW MUCH IT MUST HAVE AFFECTED HIS PRIDE, HAVING TO WALK INTO THE KITCHEN, AND MY GRANDPA FINNEGAN, WHO HAD FOUR SONS, AND SAY, ""CAN I LEAVE GENE AND THE KIDS HERE WITH YOU? , WITH YOU?"" IT TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE FOR A MAN OR WOMAN TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH IT WAS HARD FOR HIM, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS HARD FOR MY GRANDPA, BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT'S FAMILY. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT GREAT MEMORIES ABOUT SCRANTON. CLIMBING WHAT USED TO BE THAT 10 FOOT STONE WALL IN MARYWOOD, HAVING FIGHTS BEHIND THE WALL. CLIMBING THE FLAGPOLE AT MALONEY FIELD. MY GENERATION , GOING DOWN TO THE MATINEES AND PLAYING UP THE MATINEE ON THE WAY HOME, TRYING TO WALK ACROSS THAT PIPE ACROSS THE LUCKY , THE LACKEY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE HEROES DID, SOMETIMES FALLING IN. THEY ARE NOTHING BUT GOOD MEMORIES, BUT MORE THAN A MEMORIES, WHAT I REMEMBER MOST AS , THAT I THINK ABOUT AS I GET OLDER IS THE VALUES THAT WERE INSTILLED IN ME UP HERE. THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS AS I LOOK BACK ON IT IS THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT LOYALTY. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT PATRIOTISM. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT WHAT FRIENDSHIP MEANS. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT FAMILY AND FAITH. FAITH THAT HELPED ME GET THROUGH A LOT OF TOUGH TIMES IN MY LIFE , AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH TOUGHER TIMES THAN I HAVE. THE PHILOSOPHER KIERKEGAARD SAID ""FAITH SEES BEST IN THE DARK."" WELL, WE ALL GO THROUGH DARK TIMES. BECAUSE OF THE FAITH INSTILLED IN ME HERE, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVERSE IT. WHEN MY DAD MADE THAT WALK UP THE STAIRS, HE TOLD ME, ""HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK ONCE WE GET SETTLED IN DELAWARE. WE ARE ALL GOING TO COME DOWN AND BE TOGETHER."" AND IT WAS. MY DAD THEN, IN THE MID-1950'S, BELIEVED EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS STILL HAD A FIGHTING CHANCE. , A FIGHTING CHANCE THEN. WE MOVED TO CLAYMONT, DELAWARE. THAT IS NO LONGER A STEEL TOWN. WE RENTED APARTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE FINALLY GOT TO MOVE INTO A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD NOT FAR FROM THERE, SUBURBAN WILMINGTON. WHEN THE DEVELOPMENTS WERE BEING DEVELOPED, THREE-BEDROOM, SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH FOUR KIDS IN , AND AS I SAID, A RELATIVE. BUT FROM THAT TIME WHEN WE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LISTEN, ANYTIME SOMEONE, A RELATIVE IN DELAWARE OR A FRIEND, LOST A JOB, OR A NEIGHBOR LOST A JOB BECAUSE OF RECESSION OR BECAUSE THE COMPANY WENT UNDER, MY DAD USED TO SAY, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD TO THIS, HE WOULD SAY, ""JOEY, REMEMBER, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT."" THAT'S HOW WE WERE RAISED. MY GUESS IS THAT'S HOW MOST OF YOU WERE RAISED HERE IN SCRANTON. WE WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE FAMILY, LOYALTY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO. BECAUSE A LOT OF US KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY BY PEOPLE WITH WEALTH, BY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT WE WEREN'T QUITE THEIR EQUALS. I CAN HEAR HER NOW, MY MOM. I USED TO STUTTER BADLY WHEN I WAS A KID. SHE WOULD SAY, ""REMEMBER, JOEY, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL."" MY DAD WOULD SAY, NOT A JOKE, ""JOEY, THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN. IT'S HOW QUICKLY YOU GET UP, SO GET THE HELL UP, MY DAD, AS HE GOT OLDER, HE WOULD BE ANGRY IF I DIDN'T CALL HIM, BECAUSE HE HAD TO MAKE SURE HE HAD A SPORT COAT ON TO MEET YOU. HE WANTED TO GREET YOU AT HIS HOME. MY DAD WAS MANNERS, TO MY DAD, WERE A BIG DEAL. ONE DAY HE WAS OVER AT OUR HOUSE, THE HOUSE I HAD BUILT, AND I GUESS I WAS LOOKING OUT OVER THIS POND IT'S ON IN DELAWARE, AND I GUESS I WAS KIND OF FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF. I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY DECEASED WIFE, AND HE SAID, ""JOEY, COME ON."" HE LEFT AND WENT UP TO THE HALLMARK STORE AND CAME BACK. I HAVE IT ON MY DESK TO THIS DAY, A CARD. A CARD, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO IN THAT STORE AND GET A GLASS, RECTANGULAR CASE WITH A CARTOON. ORY SAYING ON IT, OR SOMETHING. HE CAME BACK AND IS ME THIS CARTOON. I HAVE THIS CARTOON AND IT SITS ON MY DESK. IT'S BEEN THERE FOR OVER 25 YEARS. THAT'S NOT TRUE, 19 YEARS. I'M NOT A BIG FUNNY PAPER GUY, BUT MY DAD WAS. THERE'S A CARTOON CHARACTER THAT USED TO BE CALLED ""HAGAR THE HORRIBLE,"" A VIKING. THERE ARE TWO FRAMES IN THIS PICTURE. AGAIN, IT REMINDS ME OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE PEOPLE IN SCRANTON AND CLAYMONT. IT'S A PICTURE OF HAGAR, AND THE , AND HIS VIKING SHIP IS CRASHED ON THE ROCKS. THE MAST IS DOWN. HE'S STANDING AND SHAKING HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAYING, ""WHY ME, GOD?"" AND A VOICE FROM HEAVEN, THE SAME SCENE WITH HIS HAND UP AND THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYS, ""WHY NOT? WHY NOT YOU? WHY NOT YOU?"" FOLKS, A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN SCRANTON AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA HAVE, OVER THE LAST DECADES AND EVEN NOW, HAD TO MAKE THAT LONGEST WALK. BUT TODAY, TOO MANY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WORKING-CLASS FOLKS CAN'T LOOK THEIR KIDS IN THE EYE ANY LONGER AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. I'M RUNNING TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE MIDDLE CLASS. YOU KNOW, IN THIS TIME , [APPLAUSE] AND THIS TIME, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE, YOUR ETHNICITY, YOUR DISABILITY, YOUR GENDER. EVERYBODY'S GOT TO COME ALONG. [APPLAUSE] AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. AND ALL THIS TALK , I DID AN INTERVIEW FOR ""60 MINUTES"" THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING ON, ""60 MINUTES"" FOR 90 MINUTES. [LAUGHTER] THEY SAY, WELL, UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN. YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOODS. ASK THEM HOW THEY ARE DOING, HOW THEY ARE FEELING. THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. THERE USED TO BE A BARGAIN IN AMERICA, THAT IF YOU CONTRIBUTED, YOU GOT TO SHARE THE BENEFITS. THAT BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. CORPORATE AMERICA HAS BEEN DOING INCREDIBLY WELL FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THEIR PROFITS HAVE GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY. IT USED TO BE THERE WAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SO-CALLED PRODUCTIVITY, HOW MUCH MORE GOT PUT OUT ON THE FACTORY FLOOR, AND SALARY. , OR OUT OF A CORPORATION, AND SALARY. FROM THE END OF WORLD WAR II TO THE END OF THE 1970'S, PRODUCTIVITY WENT UP OVER 90%. 94%, I THINK IT WAS. WAGES WENT UP 95%. SINCE THEN, PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP 68% OR 69%. WAGES, 8%. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT BARGAIN? IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. STUDIES SHOW THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HAVE DIFFICULTY. , DIFFICULTY MAKING, AND ARE LOSING HOPE. YOU ARE RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WORKED HARD, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF THAN YOUR PARENTS, BUT NOT TODAY, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. STUDIES SHOW THAT IF YOU HAVE AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF $400 OR MORE, YOU CAN'T PAY IT. YOU HAVE TO EITHER BORROW THE MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY MIDDLE-CLASS. A LOT OF ECONOMISTS WILL TELL YOU, MIDDLE-CLASS IS $51,800. MIDDLE-CLASS IS A VALUE SET. MIDDLE-CLASS IS BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO THE PARK AND KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO COME HOME SAFELY. BEING ABLE TO SEND THEM TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL, WHERE YOU KNOW IF THEY DO WELL, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GO BEYOND SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] MIDDLE-CLASS IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE YOUR GERIATRIC MOM HOME WHEN DAD DIES AND HOPE YOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. THAT'S MIDDLE-CLASS. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. IT'S HARD FOR A FAMILY TODAY TO MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. I CAN'T IMAGINE TURNING TO YOUR CHILD WHO HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND SAYING, ""SORRY, KID. NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU. I CAN'T HELP YOU."" LOOK, THE SAME WITH INSURANCE. LOOK, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR PEOPLE. MANY OF YOU KNOW IT, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER, OR HAD CANCER YOURSELF. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER, A SON OR DAUGHTER, A LOVED ONE OR WIFE? I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE WHEN MY SON BEAU, A VETERAN, VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AND WAS THERE FOR A YEAR , A BRONZE STAR, COMES HOME AND GETS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER. I CAN'T IMAGINE LYING IN THAT BED TOWARDS THE END WHEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD HAVE COME IN AND SAY, ""YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE."" I CAN'T FATHOM IT. HOW CAN A FAMILY MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEY HAVE A CHILD WITH SOME TALENT THAT ONCE TO GO , THAT WANTS TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEY CAN'T GET THERE? MY DAD, WHEN WE GOT TO DELAWARE, THE FIRST GOOD JOB HE WAS ABLE TO GET AFTER SEVERAL YEARS ENDED UP BEING MANAGEMENT AT AN AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THAT IS, YOU ALWAYS GET A NEW CAR FOR THE PROM. [LAUGHTER] I REMEMBER GOING DOWN AFTER A BASEBALL GAME. THE DEALERSHIP HE RAN WAS DOWN WHERE THE UNIVERSITY IS IN NO WORK , NEWARK, AND WE LIVED ABOUT 25 MINUTES FROM THERE. I WENT TO A SCHOOL IN CLAYMONT AT THE TIME. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN IN MY BASEBALL UNIFORM, RACING DOWN IN A 1951 PLYMOUTH CONVERTIBLE WITH A RIPPED TOP AND BEACH TOWELS FOR SEAT COVERS. I WOULD PARK IT IN ONE SPOT, RUN , I RAN IN AND ASKED THE SECRETARY, ""WHERE'S DAD?"" I WAS GOING TO GET A CAR TO GO TO THE SENIOR PROM. SHE SAID, ""HE'S OUT IN THE ALLEY. GO ON INTO THE SHOP."" MY DAD WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH. TRUE STORY. HE LOOKED UP AND SAID, ""JOEY, I'M SO SORRY. SO DAMN SORRY."" THIS IS BEFORE CELL PHONES. I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY MOM. HE SAID, ""I WENT TO THE BANK TO FINANCE ALL THE CAR LOANS THEY HAD. I SPOKE TO CHARLIE, THE VICE PRESIDENT. THEY WON'T LEND ME THE MONEY TO GET YOU TO COLLEGE. I'M SO DAMN ASHAMED."" I'M ASHAMED."" WHY WOULD HE BE ASHAMED? , ""I'M ASHAMED."" WHY WOULD HE BE ASHAMED? HOW MANY PEOPLE SAT AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLE TODAY AND HAD THE CONVERSATION SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE ON THOSE TIRES FOR ANOTHER 10,000 MILES. WE CAN'T AFFORD A NEW SET OF TIRES THIS MONTH. WE'VE GOT TO WAIT. WHO'S GOING TO TELL HER, SHE CAN COME BACK? WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE INSURANCE? THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NO IDEA WHAT HARD-WORKING, DECENT, ORDINARY AMERICANS ARE GOING THROUGH. YOU KNOW, A PARENT , HOW MANY OF YOU, MOMS OR DADS, GRANDPAS ARE GRANDMAS , OR GRANDMAS, DROP OFF YOUR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, PRESCHOOL, FIRST, SECOND, THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE IN AMERICA, HAVING TO LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER? TELLING KIDS, YOU GET BEHIND THIS PILLAR HERE IF SOMEONE COMES IN. YOU KNOW, THE GREATEST CONCERN , I SPOKE TO THE INTERNATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION IN LONDON. YOU KNOW THE GENERATION THAT HAS THE GREATEST DEGREE OF ANXIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA? KIDS BETWEEN SEVEN AND 20 YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR GREATEST FEAR IS? BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. NO, NOT A JOKE. BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. YOU SAW ALL OF THE PICTURES OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL ABOUT KIDS AT THE NEW SCHOOLS WE ARE BUILDING. THAT'S ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE NERVE TO TAKE ON THE DAMN NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. THERE IS NO NEED , [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS. SOME OF YOU ARE HUNTERS. I'VE GOT SHOTGUNS. MY SONS ARE HUNTERS. MAINLY GEESE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO OUT AND HUNT FOR GEESE, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE IN YOUR SHOTGUN MORE THAN THREE SHELLS. TO PROTECT THE GEESE. WE HAVE FEDERAL LAWS THAT PROTECT GEESE. THINK ABOUT IT. WHY IN GOD'S NAME SHOULD ANYONE BE ABLE TO HAVE A CLIP THAT HOLDS 100 ROUNDS? [APPLAUSE] SO FOLKS, THE ADMINISTRATION KEEPS DOING THE BIDDING OF THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT SAYS IT'S NOT ABSOLUTE. MY FRIENDS ON THE FAR RIGHT TALK ABOUT THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. GUESS WHAT? YOU NEED AN M1 TANK. YOU NEED AN F-15. YOU NEED SOME HELLFIRE MISSILES. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM. YOU CAN'T HAVE BAZOOKAS. YOU CAN'T HAVE MACHINE GUNS. WE HAVE NEVER ARGUED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN WEAPONS PEOPLE CAN'T OWN. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHEN WE SAID ANYBODY CAN OWN A WEAPON, ANYBODY. FOLKS, HOW CAN A PARENT FEEL GOOD ABOUT RAISING A CHILD IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE GROUNDWATER IS POLLUTED BECAUSE OF OIL COMPANIES POLLUTING IT? OR WHETHER OR NOT THE GROUNDWATER PIPES ARE PUT IN IN , ARE MADE OF WOOD OR WERE PUT IN IN 1960 AND ARE NO LONGER SAFE? HOW MANY SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY, FOR ALL I KNOW HERE IN LUZERN COUNTY, THE WATER IN THE SCHOOLS IS NOT SAFE? LOOK, WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. A FAIR SHOT, A LIFE OF DIGNITY, AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS SICK, YOU HAVE A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM WHEN THE BILL COMES THROUGH? A SHOT FOR A BETTER FUTURE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AND I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF EMPATHY AT ALL FOR PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I'VE NOT SEEN IT, IF IT EXISTS. UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT THAT I'VE EVER WORKED WITH. AND FOLKS, I'M NOT SURE DONALD TRUMP HAS ANY IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE LONGEST WALK. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE LONGEST WALK HIS FATHER EVER MADE WAS THE DROP-OFF FOR $100 MILLION IN HIS TRUST ACCOUNT. [APPLAUSE] BUT LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'M RUNNING. FIRST, THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE. NINE YEARS AGO, WE FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO GET OBAMACARE PASSED. GENERATIONS HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT. WE GOT IT DONE. HEALTH CARE IS MORE THAN JUST A LUXURY RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. IT'S A RIGHT. IT'S A RIGHT WE ALL DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] IT GOES TO OUR DIGNITY AND WHO WE WANT TO BE AS A COUNTRY. ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS IN THOSE YEARS OF STANDING ALONGSIDE PRESIDENT OBAMA. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT TO GET THAT DONE. IT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL. I WISH I HAD NOT WHISPERED THAT IN THE PRESIDENT'S EAR. THANK GOD MY MOTHER WAS NOT AROUND. UNDER MY PLAN, YOU ARE FREE TO STICK WITH THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU GET TO SIGN UP FOR A PUBLIC OPTION, A MEDICARE-LIKE PROPOSAL. MY PLAN REDUCES PREMIUMS, DEDUCT WILL, OUT-OF-POCKET COST. FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WILL FORCE PRIVATE INSURANCE TO COMPETE WITH YOUR BUSINESS, NOT JUST WITH EACH OTHER, BUT WITH A PUBLIC COMPETITOR. THAT IS WHAT THE MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION PROVIDES. IT WILL KEEP PREMIUMS EVEN LOWER. BOTTOM LINE IS MY HEALTH CARE PLAN IS THE FASTEST, MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE COST FOR AMERICANS NOT IN FIVE YEARS, NOT IN 10 YEARS, BUT RIGHT NOW, AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. [APPLAUSE] THE SECOND THING, WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AS WAS STATED AT THE BEGINNING BY ROSEMARY , YOU KNOW, MY WIFE, WHO TAUGHT HER WHOLE LIFE IS TEACHING AT THIS MOMENT. THAT IS WHY SHE'S NOT UP HERE WITH ME. SHE'S GOING TO IOWA TOMORROW, BUT SHE'S IN THE CLASSROOM TODAY TEACHING. SHE SAID IT BEST , ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. IT IS A BASIC THING. [APPLAUSE] IN THE 21ST CENTURY, DOES ANYBODY THINK 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IS ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN IT? I DID A STUDY FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE ASKED YOU TO DO A STUDY ON JOBS IN THE FUTURE. SIX IN 10 JOBS AT THIS MOMENT REQUIRE SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. SIX IN 10. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, REGARDLESS OF THE ZIP CODE. THAT'S WHY MY PLAN TRIPLES TITLE I FUNDING FOR AT RISK SCHOOLS. WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. IT MEANS EVERY CHILD WILL HAVE ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND PRE-K UNIVERSALLY , X FINANCIALLY INCREASES , EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE CHANCE THE CHILD WILL MAKE IT THROUGH SCHOOL WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE. IT MEANS WE WILL FIND AND PAY TEACHERS THE SALARY THEY DESERVE. TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL, THEY GRADUATE WITH A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE AND GET PAID LESS THAN ANYBODY ELSE GRADUATING AS A STARTING AND FINISHING SALARY. LOOK, THE WORK WE DO IS OF EXTREME NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. THEIR SALARIES REFLECT THAT. WE KNOW THE 21ST CENTURY, AS I SAID, 12 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH. UNDER MY PLAN, EVERYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE ABLE TO GO FOR FREE. [APPLAUSE] YOU SAY, THERE GOES THAT BEEN SPIT , THAT BIG SPENDING DEMOCRAT, RIGHT? GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL ARE HAVING A GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR RETRAINING BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY ELIMINATING JOBS. THERE ARE $1.6 TRILLION IN LOOPHOLES IN THE TAX-CUT , TAX CODE. YOU GET A DEDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. ELIMINATE ONE OF THEM. IT'S CALLED STEPPED UP BASIS. YOU ARE ABOUT TO GO AND CASH IN A CAPITAL GAIN. YOU FIGURE YOU GET HIT BY A CAR OR TRUCK, YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE, IT GOES TO YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER, THEY DON'T PAY A CENT. GUESS WHAT? THAT COSTS $17 BILLION A YEAR. ELIMINATE THAT ONE LOOPHOLE AND IT COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO IS QUALIFIED. INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY , [APPLAUSE] YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING CRUSHED BY THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT. MANY OF YOUR PARENTS ARE AS WELL. IF YOU ARE PAYING BACK STUDENT LOANS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT, MY PLAN IS TO CUT YOUR PAYMENTS IN HALF. THE WAY YOU DO IT, IF YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL, YOU'RE MAKING LESS THAN $25 A YEAR TO START WITH, YOU DON'T PAY ANYTHING BACK. NO INTEREST ACCRUES. IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN THAT, YOU WILL ONLY PAY 5% OF YOUR DISPOSABLE INCOME MEANING AFTER ALL YOUR BILLS ARE PAID AND ALL YOUR COST OF LIVING IS TAKEN CARE OF. POLICE OFFICERS, COUNSELING VICTIMS, THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE, ANYTHING INVOLVING PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU GET $10,000 A YEAR THAT YOU WORK OFF YOUR DEBT UP TO $50,000 AND AFTER 10 YEARS OF DOING IT, YOU HAVE NO DEBT AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. BY THE WAY, COMMUNITY COLLEGE , YOU KNOW, EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THIS STATE, IF YOU DO WELL, YOU GET TO GO ON TO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE. ALL THOSE CREDITS ARE TRANSFERABLE TO A FOUR-YEAR STATE SCHOOL. YOU HAVE SOME GREAT SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY. PENN STATE IS NOT DOING BAD, ARE THEY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE GOING TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE NEED TO START REWARDING WORK AGAIN, NOT JUST WEALTH. UNDER THE REPUBLICAN AND TRUMP PLAN, WE ONLY REWARD WEALTH. DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY FROM BARACK AND ME. THINGS WERE BEGINNING TO REALLY MOVE. AND JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE'S IN THE MIDST OF SQUANDERING IT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH, REFLECTS OUR VALUES, AND THAT IS GOING TO START , I'M GOING TO START BY REVERSING THE TRUMP TAX CUTS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS. [APPLAUSE] WEALTHY DID NOT NEED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CORPORATIONS HAVE SPENT THEM ON STOCK BUYBACKS TO GIVE BENEFITS TO THEIR STOCKHOLDERS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO THEIR CEO'S. IT USED TO BE WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, THE AVERAGE CEO OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES MADE 36 OR 37 TIMES WHAT THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE MADE FROM VICE PRESIDENT ALL THE WAY DOWN. KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? OVER 420 TIMES AS MUCH. WHAT HAPPENED? AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, WHO DIED AND LEFT HIM BOSS? [LAUGHTER] NO, I'M SERIOUS. I THINK CORPORATIONS CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS, BUT THEY DON'T NEED THAT TAX-CUT. WE WILL RAISE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT ON EDUCATION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE REST. I'M GETTING RID OF THE SUPER WEALTHY TAX LOOPHOLES, DOUBLING THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. RIGHT NOW, IF YOU ARE A FIREMAN AND A SCHOOLTEACHER, OR YOU WORK AS A POLICE OFFICER OR NURSE, YOU PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING $10 MILLION A YEAR. HIGHER TAX RATE. WHY IS THAT? IT MAKES NO SENSE. WHY SHOULD THE CAPITAL GAIN BE AT 21%, AND EVEN THEN, MOST DON'T PAY THAT. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON, OUR CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE TREATED LIKE REAL INCOME AND THEY WILL PAY 40% ON THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. IT IS A BASIC BARGAIN TO REBUILD A STRONGER INCLUSIVE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] AND IT DOES NOT AFFECT ANY GAINS ON YOUR HOME AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU IN FACT ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS AWFUL GUN VIOLENCE THAT'S RIPPING US APART. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEARS CHILDREN ARE FACING. WE CANNOT LIVE WITH OURSELVES UNTIL WE TAKE IT ON. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER TAKEN ON THE NRA NATIONALLY AND BEATEN THEM AND BEATEN THEM TWICE. [APPLAUSE] SUCCEEDED IN BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR 10 YEARS AND LIMITING THE SIZE OF MAGAZINES. HOW MANY CARTRIDGES CAN BE IN A MAGAZINE. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET IT DONE, AND I CAN DO IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS THE ISSUE FACING THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 15% OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE, AND I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN WHERE WE GET TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050 AND BETWEEN NOW AND 2030, WE MAKE SUCH DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT IT CANNOT BE TURNED AROUND, BUT 85% OF THE PROBLEM COMES FROM BEYOND OUR BORDERS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN MARSHAL THOSE OTHER NATIONS TO CONFRONT THE GREATEST THREAT WE'VE EVER SEEN TO HUMANITY. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. IT'S REAL. [APPLAUSE] IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY, I WILL INVITE THE OTHER NATIONS THAT ARE PART OF THIS TO WASHINGTON, D.C., SO THEY UP THE ANTE OF WHAT THEY PROMISED THEY WILL DO AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE LOST THE RESPECT OF NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD BY THE WAY THIS PRESIDENT HAS ACTED. CLIMATE IS NOT JUST AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. HANDLED RIGHT, IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD CONFRONTED WITH A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT AND TURN IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CAN BUILD A NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA MOVED TO , AND MOVE TO ALL-ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE HAVE AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR STANDARDS FOR BUILDINGS, CARS, POWER GRIDS. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE YOU MONEY, SAVE YOU OPPORTUNITY, AND ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE CLEANER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AN HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, INVESTING $400 BILLION IN THE INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE SO WE BECOME A NET EXPORTER OF ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY, CREATING LITERALLY MILLIONS OF JOBS. IT WILL CREATE MORE THAN 10 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, UNION JOBS MAKING 40 BUCKS AN HOUR, NOT 15 BUCKS AN HOUR. FOR REAL. THIS IS THE PROJECTION. [APPLAUSE] THE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT, THESE ARE BIG CHALLENGES BUT NO BIGGER THAN OUR CAPACITY AS AMERICANS, SO WE HAVE TO GET STARTED THINKING BIG AGAIN, THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WE CAN BUILD. AMERICANS ARE DOING THEIR PART. THEY ARE OUT THERE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY. THEY DESERVE THEIR LEADERS TO WORK AS HARD FOR THEM. WE DO NOT DESERVE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT CRUSADES AGAINST PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE DO NOT DESERVE A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THAT PUTS CORPORATE PROFITS AGAINST , AHEAD OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE. WE DON'T DESERVE A FOREIGN POLICY WASTE ON LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND ABANDONMENT. , FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND ABANDONMENT. [APPLAUSE] MOST OF ALL, WE DO NOT DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO MAKE LIFE IN AMERICA HARDER, CRUELER, PETTY OR. HE SAID WE HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN AMERICAN. THE AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS BRINGS DIGNITY AND INTEGRITY EVERY DAY TO WORK. THEY DESERVE DIGNITY AND INTEGRITY REFLECTED IN THEIR LEADERS. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE REALLY SERIOUS. I STAND HERE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I WAS WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I HAD TO WAIT DAYS TO BE ELIGIBLE. I WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A YOUNG, IDEALISTIC GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO THE HELL WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NEVER , THINK ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER IF WE MOVE THIS ADMINISTRATION OUT OF THE WAY. WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS A MATTER OF FACT THAN THEY ARE IN ASIA. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR LIFE-CHANGING THING HAS COME OUT OF A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY MONETIZED BY CORPORATE AMERICA, BUT IT HAS COME OUT OF RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES YOU OWN, IF IT'S LOS ALAMOS OR ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WHY IN GOD NAME WOULD WE WALK AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD , NO HYPERBOLE , AND WE HAVE LEAD THE WORLD NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, AND IT IS BEING ERODED. THE EMBRACE OF DICTATORS AND THUGS, KIM JONG-UN, LOVE LETTERS . THE GUY WHO HAD HIS UNCLE'S BRAIN FALLING OUT SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE, HAD HIS BROTHER ASSASSINATED IN AN AIRPORT. PUTIN, WHO I KNOW RELATIVELY WELL , I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM , PRUDEN WHO HAS NOTHING IN MIND OTHER THAN TO BREAK UP NATO, REDUCE OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD. THE ONE THING HE FEARS IS OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD. THE ONE THING HE FEARS, POKING FINGERS IN THE EYE, TREATING NATO LIKE IT'S A PROTECTION RACKET. YOU SAW WHAT JUST HAPPEN. I'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHERE THE KURDS ARE. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TURKEY, SIGNIFICANT MANNER TIME IN A RACK IN THAT WHOLE AREA, SYRIA. WHAT HAVE WE JUST DONE? HAVE YOU FOUND A SINGLE MILITARY PERSON WHO DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE JUST BESMIRCHED AMERICA'S REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD OF BEING RELIABLE? 10,000 KURDS DIED , DIED , DEFEATING ISIS. CAPTURING 10,000 ISIS TERRORISTS IN PRISON OR THE PRESIDENT ON A WHIM, WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF ANY OF HIS MILITARY COMMANDERS, DECIDES HE'S GOING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ERDOGAN, WHO I KNOW WELL, TO MOVE HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS WHO ARE TRAINERS FOR THE KURDS AND ISIS FORCES. YOU SEE ON TELEVISION, WOMEN STANDING THERE HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN, UNDER BOMBARDMENT WHEN OUR TANKS ARE MOVING OUT. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO'S GOING TO BELIEVE AMERICA'S WORD AS WE GIVE IT? THAT IS WHAT A PRESIDENT DOES, . HE SPEAKS FOR AMERICA. HE KEEPS COMMITMENTS. WHEN THEY SAILED AS PRISONERS ARE GOING TO ESCAPE, HE SAYS, ""WELL, THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO GO TO EUROPE. THEY WILL NOT COME TO THE UNITED STATES."" THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? FOLKS, LOOK, THERE'S NOT A THING WE CANNOT DO. WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANYONE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE CAN DO IT IN A REASONABLE AND QUICK WAY. WE CAN UNITE THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE, FOLKS, I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE , DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS , WALKING AROUND WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN LIKE ""WOE IS ME."" FOLKS, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. STAND UP. TAKE IT BACK. WE CAN, IN FACT, DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

CSPANJB211201929	Joe Biden	2019-11-02	Joe and Jill Biden Open New Iowa Field Office	"THAT IS NO SMALL FEAT. THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ON THE MOVE, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT, IN THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT BATTLE GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. THAT'S GOOD SOUTH SIDE. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT FROM SOUTH SIDE, WELCOME TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF DES MOINES. [APPLAUSE] OR, AS THE REST OF US LIKE TO CALL IT, GOD'S COUNTRY. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE PART OF A FAMILY WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SOUTH SIDE. BECAUSE WE ON THE SOUTH SIDE ARE A WORKING CLASS FAMILY. WE ARE A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY THAT BELIEVES THAT IF YOU WORK HARD FOR A LIVING, IF YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, IF YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT, YOU DESERVE A LITTLE DIGNITY IN YOUR LIFE. WE ARE A DIVERSE FAMILY WITH ITALIANS LIVING NEXT IRISH, TO LATINOS, NEXT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, NEXT TO GAZE, NEXT TO STRAITS, IMMIGRANTS, , STRAIGHTS, IMMIGRANTS, NATURAL BORN CITIZENS. WE ARE A FAMILY THAT BELIEVES THIS DIVERSITY MAKES US A STRONGER FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE A FAMILY THAT LOOKS OUT FOR EACH OTHER. WE MAY NOT GET ALONG ALL OF THE TIME, BUT BY GOD WE WILL MAKE SURE OUR NEIGHBORS ARE CARED FOR AND LOOKED OUT FOR. WE MAY FIGHT A LITTLE BIT, BUT, BY GOD, IF YOU COME AFTER US, WE ARE COMING AFTER YOU ENFORCE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU TAKE ON ONE OF US, YOU ARE TAKING ON ALL OF US. SO WELCOME TO THE SOUTH SIDE. BECAUSE THE SOUTH SIDE IS FAMILY. AND, THAT'S MEANS WE ARE ALL FAMILY. WE ALL HAVE VALUES. AND, WE ALL NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LEFT BEHIND. AND, THIS IS THE AMERICA THAT WE ARE GOING TO, AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY. MY WIFE, BETTY, AND I WERE IN MINNESOTA WITH HER FOR THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY. THE NIGHT AFTER SHE PASSED, WE CAME BACK DOWN TO DES MOINES TO GET A CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND OUR FUNERAL CLOSE AND SLEEP IN OUR OWN BED FOR ONCE. THE NEXT MORNING, WE HAD TO BACK , HEADED BACK UP TO MINNESOTA. ON OUR WAY UP THERE, WE GOT A PHONE CALL, AND IT WAS A BLOCKED CALL SO I THOUGHT I WOULD WIN A FREE-TRADE TO , TRIP TO ORLANDO , FREE TRIP TO ORLANDO OR THE IRS IS AFTER ME. [LAUGHTER] I ANSWER THAT PHONE CALL AND IT WAS JOE BIDEN CALLING. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK TIME OUT OF HIS DAY TO MAKE SURE I WAS DOING ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILY DOES FOR ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA SHOULD BE DOING FOR ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE SOUL OF AMERICA. COMPARE THAT TO OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] [BOOING] WE DON'T DO THAT IN AMERICA. BUT, THAT'S WHY JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS NATION, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY AND BRING THIS FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AS FAMILY AND AS AMERICANS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP. NOW, TURN AWAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEN LOOK AT JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A LITTLE BETTER SIGHT, BUT THE STRANGE THING IS, PUTIN DOESN'T WANT JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT. AND DONALD TRUMP IS OBVIOUSLY SCARED TO RUN AGAINST HIM IN A GENERAL ELECTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S BECAUSE JOE BIDEN, AND JOE BIDEN'S WORDS, WILL BEAT DONALD TRUMP LIKE A DRUM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND EVEN BETTER, ONCE JOE BIDEN IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, HE WILL BRING PETER SCHIFF TO THE WORLD STAGE. AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, A DIGNIFIED LEADERSHIP HERE AT HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE KNOWN JOE BIDEN FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW, AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING, HE IS WHAT HE IS. THAT MEANS IF JOE BIDEN TELLS YOU SOMETHING, YOU CAN TAKE IT TO THE BANK. YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT ALL OF THE TIME, BUT YOU WON'T HAVE MICK MULVANEY COMING OUT THE NEXT DAY SAYING THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID. [APPLAUSE] , [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS WORD MEANS SOMETHING. HE IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND MORALS THAT HAVE BEEN A GUIDING FORCE THROUGH THIS WORLD FOR YEARS ON END, AND HE WILL BE A GUIDING FORCE THROUGH THIS WORLD AND COUNTRY IN ANOTHER YEAR. THAT'S WHAT A LEADER IS ALL ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE , UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STRUGGLE AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD AS A FAMILY AND AS AMERICA. HE KNOWS THE PROBLEMS OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE, AND THE PROBLEMS THEY FACE, AND AS PRESIDENT, HE WILL WORK TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND RESTORE THE FAMILY THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I'M SO HONORED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, MY HERO, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY, AND FIRST GRANDCHILD. [LAUGHTER] OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN , JOE, JILL, AND NATALIE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING] MRS. BIDEN THANK YOU, BRUCE , THANK YOU, BRUCE FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE. AS A TEACHER, I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS. HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT MY HUSBAND'S CAREER THAT I'M PROUD OF. FROM THE BILLS HE PASSED IN THE SENATE TO TRULY CRITICAL WORK HE DID SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS, ANTI-DEMAND IS JUSTICE FOR WOMEN THROUGH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE STOOD UP TO THE NRA AND ONE TWICE , WON TWICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE FOUGHT FOR THE FINAL VOTES TO GET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED AND HE LED THE EFFORT TO END CANCER AS WE KNOW IT. BUT, SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME PROUDEST OF HIM WEREN'T COVERED BY THE NEWS OR AREN'T RECORDED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. FOR EXAMPLE, ONCE, WHEN JOE WAS MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEST WING ON THE WAY TO PREPARE FOR A MAJOR SPEECH, THERE WAS A TOUR GOING THROUGH. THEY TAKE TOURS THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SO HE STOPPED TO TALK TO THEM. ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS WHO WAS ON THAT TOUR HAD A STUTTER. MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW JOE HAS A STUTTER , HAD A STUTTER WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG KID AS WELL. HE PULLED THE LITTLE BOY AND HIS MOM ASIDE AND HE INVITED THEM TO COME TO THE SPEECH PREP. FOR THE NEXT HOUR, HE TALKED TO HIM, THE LITTLE BOY, ABOUT HOW MUCH FEAR HE USED TO HAVE ABOUT HIS OWN IMPEDIMENT AND HOW HE LEARNED TO OVERCOME IT. HE SHOWED HIM HOW HE MARKED UP HIS SPEECH AND HOW HE USED RHYTHM AND MUSIC TO CONTROL THE CADENCE. HE ENCOURAGED HIM AND KEPT SAYING, YOU CAN DO IT, TOO. HE KEPT TELLING HIM HE BELIEVED IN HIM. THAT LITTLE BOY WASN'T , AND THAT THAT LITTLE BOY WAS NOT DEFINED BY HIS STUTTER. AND THAT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME HE DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE BRUCE SAID, JOE IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE CALL. HE STOPS AND TAKES TIME WHEN HE SEES PEOPLE HURTING. HE FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT, AND EVEN AS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WAS NEVER, EVER TOO BUSY TO CALL A FRIEND OR MAKE A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL. HIS KINDNESS, HIS CHARACTER, IT IS A PART OF EVERYTHING HE DOES. IT'S WHY HE WORKS SO HARD TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT , WOMEN ACT IN THE ACA. IT IS WHY HE HAS THE TAKE , HAS THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA. IT'S WHY HE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP WITH COLLEGE TUITION AND MEDICAL BILLS AND HOPE FOR BETTER JOBS. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I WAS IN SEATTLE AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SHE HAD TEARS IN HER EYES. I ALWAYS SORT OF BRACE FOR THAT, BECAUSE I KNOW OR I FEEL THEY ARE USUALLY SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST A CHILD OR IS SUFFERING WITH CANCER, SO I HAD TO BRACE MYSELF TO TALK TO THIS WOMAN, BUT HER STORY WAS NOT A SAD STORY. SHE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRATITUDE. HER SON HAD SUFFERED WITH A STUTTER ALL HIS LIFE, BUT HE HAD MET JOE, AND JOE KEPT IN TOUCH WITH HIM. HE CALLED HIM EVERY SO OFTEN AND, THINGS TO JOE'S ENCOURAGEMENT, HE BUILT UP HIS CONFIDENCE AND HE OVERCAME HIS FEARS OF FAILING. TO HER ASTONISHMENT, HER SON, JUST LIKE JOE, HAD CONQUERED HIS IMPEDIMENT, FOCUSED ON HIS STUDIES, AND IS NOW HEADED TO COLLEGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN A TIME WHERE OUR NATION IS DROWNING IN CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION AND, LET'S FACE IT, CRUELTY, WE NEED A MAN LIKE JOE MORE THAN EVER. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST FEEL LIKE OR WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO HAVE ALIKE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WE CAN FEEL PROUD OF AGAIN? SO, PICTURE IT IS 2021, A MORNING LIKE THIS MORNING, A BEAUTIFUL FALL MORNING, YOU ARE SIPPING YOUR COFFEE, AND YOU PICK UP THE MORNING PAPER. THE HEADLINE ISN'T ABOUT SOME LATE NIGHT TWEET STORM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INSTEAD, IT IS A STORY ABOUT CHILDREN WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM UNIVERSAL PRE -K. YOU TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THE ANCHORS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WERE GOING TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND REPORTING THAT, FINALLY, SOMEONE IS STANDING UP TO THE NRA AND KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN SAFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU CALL YOUR KIDS IN FROM THE OTHER ROOM, ""COME IN, COME IN, THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE TV."" BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR CHILDREN HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY. I PRESIDENT THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER, NOT TEARS FAMILIES APART. A PRESIDENT THAT BELIEVES OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE FUTURE THAT I WANT, AND I KNOW THAT'S THE FUTURE THAT YOU ALL WANT, TOO, BUT IT IS UP TO US, ALL OF US HERE IN THIS ROOM, YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO STAND UP, WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP, WE HAVE TO SIGN COMMITMENT CARDS, AND YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR FRIENDS OUT TO KNOCK ON DOORS, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW. JOE LIKES TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW HE HAD TO ASK ME TO MARRY HIM FIVE TIMES. [LAUGHTER] BUT, THE TRUTH IS, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM MANY MORE TIMES THAN THAT. AND OF COURSE, HE HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL BOYS, NATALIE'S DADDY AND HUNTER. I FEEL SO PROUD TO STAND BESIDE HIM, IN ALL OF THE ROLES HE'S PLAYED, FATHER, GRANDFATHER, SENATOR, VICE PRESIDENT, AND SOON, WITH YOUR HELP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, HONEY. I APPRECIATE IT. THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR FOR HER LIFE AND A PROFESSOR AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. BEFORE THAT, SHE TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WAY WE WERE BOTH RAISED. WE BOTH COULD HAVE COME FROM THE SOUTH SIDE, NOT A JOKE. I WAS , I MAY BE IRISH BUT I'M NOT STUPID. [LAUGHTER] IT'S NOT A BAD COMBINATION. WE CAME FROM A SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOOD IN TWO DIFFERENT STATES, BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. I HAVE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN, FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS, AND THEY LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] BUT NATALIE IS OUR SON BO'S OLDEST AND SHE HAS ALL OF HE WAS MADE OF AND A LOT MORE. SHE HAS BEEN COMING OUT WHEN SHE CAN. SHE WAS ABLE TO PLAY A LITTLE HOOKY YESTERDAY TO COME OUT, AND SO SHE IS WITH US AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I WANT TO THANK BRUCE AND BETTY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE BETTY IS BUT I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS A LONG TIME. FOLKS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT A BASIC, BASIC POINT. MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY, FOR REAL, YOU REMEMBER THE THINGS YOUR FATHER SAID OR MOTHER SAID MORE THAN ONCE. HE WOULD SAY, JOEY, EVERYBODY , NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT WAS A MANTRA IN MY HOUSE. NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES A SHOT. I CAME FROM TWO LITTLE TOWNS AS A KID, SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. IF YOU LISTEN TO PER ROCK , BARACK OBAMA, YOU WOULD THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF THE COAL BUCKET WITH A SHOVEL IN MY HAND, BUT MY DAD WAS A WHITE COLLAR SALESPERSON. EVERYTHING DIED ECONOMICALLY. I MOVED BACK TO CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, WHICH WAS THEN A BIG STEEL TOWN. WE HAD SEVERAL STEELWORKERS IN THAT TOWN AND I GREW UP SELF-CONSCIOUS. I CAME FROM AN IRISH CATHOLIC NEIGHBORHOOD IN SCRANTON AND I WAS SUBCONSCIOUS THAT I WASN'T POLISH OR ITALIAN BECAUSE THAT WAS EVERYBODY THAT WORKED IN CLAYMONT. EVERYBODY BELIEVED, LIKE BRUCE SAID, IF YOU WORKED HARD AND PLAYED BY THE RULES, THERE WASN'T ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T DO. YOU HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE IT. I'M THE FIRST PERSON IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL TO MY DAD, BUT IT WAS LIKE, THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO. HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT OF IT IS, WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW REALLY IS , WE REALLY ARE AND THE BAD SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT HOW THIS MAN IS CONDUCTING WORLD AFFAIRS OR AFFAIRS AT HOME, PITTING PEOPLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON THEIR RACE, RELIGION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE, AND THE THINGS HE SAYS WHEN TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IS DISGRACEFUL. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF SAYING IT. AS MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY, IF YOU SPOKE LIKE THAT, WE WOULD WATCH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD EVER IMAGINE WE WOULD HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT WE WOULD HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. FOLKS, THE REASON I TALK ABOUT RESTORING THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY, WE CAN'T DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IF WE DON'T RESTORE THE BASIC SENSE OF DIGNITY AND DECENCY FOR WHICH WE TREAT ANOTHER. IT SOUNDS CORNY TO SAY IT, BUT WE WERE ORGANIZED ON A PRINCIPAL. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, BUT WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT. WE'VE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THAT. THIS MAN FUNDAMENTALLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT, AND HIS WORD CANNOT BE TAKEN AT HOME AND/OR ABROAD. HE HAS ABANDONED OUR FRIENDS, AND BRACED DICTATORS, , EMBRACED DICTATORS, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. AS DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING, BUT YOU KNOW, ONE OF YOU SAID TO ME, I WANT EXPOSE YOU, BUT I MET SOME FOLKS IN THE BACK THAT SAID "" STOP TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND TALK ABOUT YOUR VISION."" HERE'S THE DEAL. THE PRESS WANTS VERY MUCH, AND SOME OF THE OPPONENTS, WANT TO CHARACTERIZE VIEWS IN TERMS OF IF YOU'RE THINKING BIG AND IF YOU ARE CRITICIZED. IF SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IS OUTLANDISH, YOU MUST BE REPUBLICAN, AND IN FACT YOU EITHER THINK BIG OR SMALL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VISION I HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS NOTHING SMALL ABOUT IT. IT IS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON. LOOK, WE CAN PROVIDE FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. I VISION IS NO ONE GOES TO BED LIKE MY DAD DID IN OUR THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRAND POP LIVING WITH US, WORRYING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HIS FAMILY , FOLKS. IF YOU NOTICE, THEY LEFT BEFORE I COULD ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR PARTY RIGHT NOW. THAT EVERYTHING IS TAKEN IN CONTEXT THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE , CONTEXTS THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE. HERE'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE, THE PLANS WE HAVE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME IMPLEMENT, ARE BOLDER THAN ANY PLANS THAT HAVE COME ALONG. EVERYTHING A PERSON IN AMERICA IS ENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, BUT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HEALTH CARE. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE AND PASS IT, AND I KNOW HOW TO COVER IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU NOTICE, SOME OF OUR OPPONENTS ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND ARE STRUGGLING TO TELL YOU HOW IN GODS NAME THEY WILL PAY FOR ANYTHING. I TELL YOU STRAIGHT UP HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND HOW IT WILL GET DONE, AND I'VE DONE IT. THE SECOND THING GOING ON IS WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY RADICALLY CHANGE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT WE CAN DO THAT. WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT GOING OUT AND MAKING A PROMISE WE WILL COVER EVERYBODY'S DEBT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, NO MATTER HOW IT WAS ACQUIRED, WHETHER YOU FINISHED SCHOOL OR NOT, ETC.. EVERYBODY KNOWS IF YOU START OFF IN A TITLE I SCHOOL, YOU ARE FINDING YOURSELF AT A SLIGHT DISADVANTAGE TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE YOU COME FROM A COMMUNITY THAT HAS FEWER RESOURCES. I TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, $15 BILLION TO 14 BULLION DOLLARS. TEACHERS GET SALARIES OF $60,000, YOU CAN BRING IN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, AND EVERY SINGLE STUDY IN YOUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES AND AROUND THE COUNTRY SHOW IF YOU DO THAT, IT EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE PROSPECT OF A CHILD GOING PAST HIGH SCHOOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE VISION I HAVE IS THAT EVERYBODY IS QUALIFIED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHETHER YOU LOST YOUR JOB AT AGE 50 AND HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND A NEW WAY TO MAKE A LIVING, OR WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, CAN DO IT FOR FREE BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD IT. IT IS A $6 BILLION PROJECT. $6 BILLION, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CUT ONE OF THE ONE TRILLION , $1,400,000,000,000 IN TAXES OUT THERE , TAX CUTS OUT THERE. IT'S A VISION. RIGHT NOW, I DID A STUDY FOR THE PRESIDENT, MY PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND ON WHAT THE JOBS IN THE FUTURE ARE. SIX IN 10 JOBS REQUIRE MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE TO GET THE JOB TODAY. THERE ARE RATIONAL WAYS TO DO THIS, BUT IT IS A BOLD VISION, A BOLD VISION. WE CAN ALSO HAVE PEOPLE PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT DEBT AND HAVE STUDENT DEBT FORGIVEN IF THEY DO WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE, ENGAGE IN CHARITABLE OR VOLUNTEER WORK. IF YOU ARE A TEACHER, WORKING A WOMAN'S SHELTER, YOU WORK AND YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THE PEACE CORPS OR DOMESTIC POLICY, THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN WRITE OFF THAT DEBT IF YOU VOLUNTEER. SO, PUBLIC SERVICE, THAT IS THE POINT. THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW. YOU DID IT AS A SENATOR. YOU MADE IT SO PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, FIRST TIME COLLEGE GOERS COULD WORK AT THE CAPITOL HILL AND DO THE SYMPOSIUM AT THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] LOOK. THE OTHER THING IS THAT GLOBAL WARMING, LOOK, THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE MAKE THESE ASSERTIONS THAT GET ELIMINATED IN TWO YEARS, NO ONE SAYS THAT, BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO GET TO ZERO IN MISSIONS , EMISSIONS BY 2050, AND BY 2030, WE CAN LOCK IN SYSTEMS YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF SO WE CAN GET THERE AND GUARANTEE IT. BUT FOLKS, WE ONLY MAKE UP 15% OF THE WORLD'S PROBLEM. THE REMAINING 85% IS THE GROUP , 85% IS THE GROUP I PUT TOGETHER CALLED THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WITH 170 THREE OTHER NATIONS THAT, IN FACT, MAKE UP 85% OF THE PROBLEM. THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE HAVE TO DO, THE FIRST THING AS PRESIDENT IS I WILL REJOIN THE THING I HELP PUT TOGETHER, NUMBER ONE. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER TWO, WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS, I WILL HAVE THOSE 173 COUNTRIES AND THEIR LEADERS COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CONFERENCE ON HOW WE WILL UP THE ANTE AND GET THIS DONE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. RINGING NATIONS TOGETHER AS WELL AS PASSING THINGS IN THE LEGISLATIVE HALL, CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION, AND I WILL RESIST THE 10 PATIENT TODAY TO CRITICIZE ANY OF MY OPPONENTS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR THE NOMINATION. THE WAY WE WIN IS UNIFY, COME TOGETHER AS DEMOCRATS. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME HOPES AND DREAMS. THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE GET THERE. IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. MY VISION IS AND UNDERSTAND. WE ALL HAVE BASICALLY THE SAME HOPES AND DREAMS. THE QUESTION IS PRACTICALLY HOW DO WE GET THERE? BUT IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. THE VISION IS MY PRACTICALLY HOW DO WE GET THERE? BUT IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. THE VISION IS MY VISION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN ANYBODY'S OUT THERE. IT'S MADE TO LOOK LIKE BIDEN IS COMING OUT WITH SOME MODERN PROPOSAL. THERE'S NOTHING MODERN ABOUT MAKING SURE EVERYONE HAS HEALTHCARE AND CAN AFFORD IT. THERE'S NOTHING MODERN ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN AMERICA SO WE CAN, IN FACT, COMPETE IN THE 21st CENTURY. I COULD GO ON AND ON. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALL HERE TO HELP, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING OUT OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ATTACKING ANY OTHER DEMOCRAT EVEN WHEN THEY SAY NOT SO ENLIGHTENING THINGS. OR EVEN WHEN THEY ATTACK US. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. I'VE NEVER, EVER RUN A NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN. AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT NOW. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COMPETE HONESTLY, AND FAIRLY AND, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST IN THE LAST , I GOT STARTED LATE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO RUN. WE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAMPAIGNED LIKE THE DEVIL FOR HILLARY, DID 84 EVENTS FOR HER AROUND THE COUNTRY, SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT PRESIDENT, BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, I SAID I CAN'T REMAIN SILENT. JILL AND I DECIDED WE SHOULD DO IT, BUT WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A VERY UGLY CAMPAIGN WITH THIS GUY. THERE'S NOTHING , I HAVE FOUND IT HARD TO FIND AN OUNCE OF DECENCY IN THE MAN AND SO WE KNEW THE UGLY AND KNEW IT WOULD BE HARD FOR OUR CHILDREN, BUT MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND HER FOUR OTHER SIBLINGS OR COUSINS WHO ARE ALSO OUR GRANDCHILDREN, WE HAVE A RULE IN OUR FAMILY, NOT A JOKE. ANYBODY CAN ASK FOR A FAMILY MEETING. FOR REAL. BECAUSE BACK TO MY DAD'S , AND MY FAMILY. AND SO THE KIDS CALLED AND ASKED FOR A FAMILY MEETING, AND SO I GOT A CALL FROM MY OLDEST GRANDDAUGHTER, SHE'S HUNTER'S OLDEST CHILD AND SHE'S IN HER LAST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL IN NEW YORK. SHE SAID CAN WE HAVE A FAMILY MEETING, YOU AND NANA? COME DOWN AND TALK AND THAT WAS ON A THURSDAY, WE MET ON SUNDAY SO ONE OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN CAME DOWN FROM SCHOOL IN NEW YORK, ONE FROM SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA, ONE FROM SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON AND THE BOTH CHILDREN LIVE A MILE FROM US. THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT. AND THEY SAID WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE MEAN. HER WHOLE LIFE HER DADDY HAS BEEN AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OR DECORATED GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY. THEY UNDERSTAND. AND MY OTHER GRANDCHILDREN WERE ALSO THERE , I'VE BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT OR A SENATOR FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND THEY'RE HARDENED, THEY'RE SOPHISTICATED AND THEY KNEW WHAT IT'S LIKE. AND IT STARTED OFF WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER WHO'S NOW IN EIGHTH GRADE AND GNAT'S IN NINTH GRADE, SHOWING ME SOMETHING ON THE , ON A , ON THE INTERNET. I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM AND HE SAID POP WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE MEAN. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY. AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS KID WHO'S THEN JUST GETTING OUT OF SEVENTH GRADE, AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS? AND HE TAKES OUT HIS PHONE, AND HE SHOWS ME A PICTURE OF US WALKING OUT OF THE CHURCH, MY HAND ON AN AMERICAN FLAG DRAPED COFFIN OF OUR SON, HER DADDY AND I'M REACHING DOWN AND I HAD MY ARM AROUND HIM AND I'M HOLDING HIM UNDER THE CHIN, AND THE BOTTOM LINE WAS BIDEN, MOLESTING ANOTHER CHILD. AND SO YOU KNOW, IT'S , AND THEN EACH OF THEM CAME UP, I WON'T GO THROUGH WHAT EACH OF THEM SAID, WHAT THEY KNEW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THE POINT IS YOU'VE GOT TO RUN, POP. THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND FINALLY, DO IT. THE POINT I'M MAKING IN ALL OF THIS IS WE DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH OTHER DEMOCRATS IN A WAY OTHER THAN WE WANT TO BE DEALT WITH. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY AND DO. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS PARTY. WE HAVE TO BRING IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO WIN. [APPLAUSE] AND THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A WHILE, JUST THIS LAST MONTH, THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND FULL QUARTER WE'VE EVER BEEN ENGAGED IN, YOU KNOW, RAISING MONEY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN. WELL, WE RAISED OVER $5,300,000 ONLINE AT $20 OR LESS. WE'RE IN A POSITION. THINGS ARE MOVING. AND FOLKS LOOK, THE FACT IS WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF YOU. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT GETS DOWN TO A EXAMPLE PROPOSITION. DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AT A CAUCUS. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING IT MOSTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK, YOU'RE DOING IT AT NIGHT IN A GYMNASIUM SOMEWHERE, OR A SCHOOL. IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET THERE, AND IT'S COLD. BUT , WE REMEMBER. BUT I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A GOOD LUCK CHARM AND IT'S BO'S BIRTHDAY ON FEBRUARY 3rd, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WE'RE GOING TO WORK LIKE THE DEVIL TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. AND WE NEED YOU BECAUSE IT'S JUST , THIS IS HAND TO HAND, WE'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE TO THE CAUCUSES. AND I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT. CONCLUDING POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED AND I KNOW THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID IT, BUT IT'S TRUE, THAT IN REFERENCE TO PUTIN NOT WANTING ME TO BE PRESIDENT. FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED IT, THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SO-CALLED BOTS PUT ON THE INTERNET BY THE RUSSIANS, MISREPRESENTING WHO I WAS. THEY HAD PICTURES OF PEOPLE FROM IOWA OR PENNSYLVANIA OR WHEREVER AND THERE'S A PICTURE OF AN AMERICAN AND BELOW THERE IS A TEXT SAYING BIDEN IS A NO GOOD SO AND SO. HE'S A BAD MAN IN EFFECT. AND THEY TOOK THEM ALL DOWN. NOW, WHY IS IT THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE , I'M NOT JOKING. WHY DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE THE PRESIDENT? BECAUSE I FORGOT MORE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY THAN ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THIS GUY KNOWS ME. HE KNOWS I KNOW WHO HE IS AND HE KNOWS HE KNOWS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO FACE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY OF HIS MALARKEY. THE SECOND THING WE'VE LEARNED. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP REALLY DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A TIME THAT A YEAR OUT FROM A GENERAL ELECTION, A PRESIDENT HAS HIS CRONIES OUT THERE NOT ONLY MAKING QUID PRO QUOS AND HOLDING UP AND BLACKMAILING COUNTRIES WHO IN FACT, WE'RE PREPARED TO SAY IF YOU WANT OUR MILITARY HELP TO KEEP FROM MORE RUSSIANS KILLING UKRAINIANS THAN A DOM BOSS, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO INVESTIGATE JOE BIDEN. NOT A SINGLE, SOLITARY SHRED OF EVIDENCE HAS COME FORWARD FROM ANY AND THE SINGLE , AND EVERY MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATION AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED IT. I DID MY JOB AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE, AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. THEY ARGUE ABOUT APPEARANCE AND MY SON GOT OFF THE BOARD AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT HE KNEW NOW THAT THUGS LIKE RUDY GIULIANI WHAT THEY DO, HE WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE FROM A LAW FIRM WHO WAS NEGOTIATING WITH THESE FOLKS WITH HELP FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY REFERRED TO AT THE TIME AS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT. SO LOOK FOLKS, THE FACT IS THEY'VE SPENT , THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE OF IT, I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE SPENDING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND $15 MILLION ATTACKING ME AND JUST FLAT LYING. MOST NETWORKS WON'T EVEN PUT THEIR ADS ON THE AIR BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE FLATOUT LIES. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, THERE'S A REASON WHY HE'S DOING IT. THERE'S A STRAIGHT-UP REASON. BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE POLL SHOWS ME BEATING HIM AS I SAID, LIKE A DRUM. IN STATES THAT WE HAVE TO WIN. PENNSYLVANIA, MINNESOTA, OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA, TEXAS, ETC. SO FOLKS, DON'T BE DISWAYED BY HIM. DON'T WAVER IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THIS GUY. LIKE I SAID, CONCLUDING POINT. THE REASON I'M RUNNING IS TWOFOLD. ONE BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SENSE TO THE WORLD WHO HAVE WE ARE. OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY EVISCERATED. WE HAVE LED THE WORLD NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, THAT'S HOW WE'VE DONE IT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER ALLIANCES THAT MAKE US SAFER BECAUSE WE KEEP OUR WORD THAT HE DOESN'T KEEP. THE WORLD DOESN'T TRUST HIM ANYMORE TO KEEP HIS WORD AS WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. SO FOLKS, TWO THINGS I THINK I CAN BRING TO THIS RACE AND BRING TO THE PRESIDENCY IF IT ELECTED WITH YOUR HELP. FIRST IS I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS EVER DONE A NUMBER OF MAJOR INITIATIVES. I WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I GOT IT PASSED. I GO DOWN THE LINE, BECAUSE I DON'T DEMONIZE THE OPPOSITION. I DON'T GO AFTER MOTIVE. I GO AFTER THEIR JUDGMENT. WE ARGUE ABOUT JUDGMENT. THINK OF ALL THE THINGS , WHO GOT SENT UP TO CAPITOL HILL TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM? ME. NOW, THEY SAY THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WELL, IF THEY CHANGED, WE CAN'T TALK ACROSS THE AISLE AND GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE, MAN. WE CAN'T , WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. WE'LL SEE THE ABUSE OF POWER EXTEND. AND THE SECOND THING IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON DAY ONE, ON DAY ONE, THERE'S GOING TO BE NO CHANCE FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING. NOT A JOKE. NO TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING. WHOMEVER WE NOMINATE HAS TO BE READY ON DAY 1 TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE WORLD AND THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOK AT THAT PERSON AND SAY I KNOW HIM, I KNOW HE KNOWS WHO HE IS, I'VE MET WITH HIM, I'VE BEEN WITH HIM, I UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU ARE A FRIEND THAT HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH US OR IF YOU'RE A FOE, HE IS GOING TO RESIST US. AND FOLKS, I'VE MET EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER IN THE 35 YEARS, IN THE LAST 35 YEARS. THERE'S A FEW THAT ARE NEW NOW, RECENTLY ELECTED, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S COUSIN AND PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN, JOKING, BUT FOLKS, THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO. CONCLUDING POINT. WE HAVE SO MUCH, SO MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO, MY GOD. THE CAPACITY OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITLESS NOW COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. LITERALLY. WITH DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY THERE'S NOT A THING WE CAN'T DO. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IS INCREDIBLE. WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN AMERICA THAN , ALL THE WORKERS ARE LITERALLY THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. SO WHY DO WE WALK AROUND LIKE OH, MY GOD WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'RE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF TRUMP. WITH TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER POSITION TO LEAD THE WORLD IN THE 21st CENTURY AND RESTORE AMERICA'S INTEGRITY AND WORD AROUND THE WORLD SO FOLKS, THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. WE HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE MORE OF ME THAN YOU WANT TO SEE, BUT I PLAN ON WINNING IOWA. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) AND FOR A YEAR I ILLEGALLY BOUGHT MY MEDICINE IN CANADA AND SEVERAL TIMES, THEY WERE CONFISCATED. AND YOU AND BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT AND SAVED MY LIFE. YOU'RE MY HERO. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. FOR 10 YEARS I HEARD REPUBLICANS SAYING REPEAL AND REPLACE, NOW I'VE GOT TO FIGHT DEMOCRATS DOING THAT SAME STUFF. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]"	https://www.c-span.org/video/?465963-1/joe-jill-biden-open-iowa-field-office	Joe and Jill Biden opened a new field office for Mr. Biden&rsquo;s 2020 presidential campaign on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa. They were introduced by Bruce Hunter, a Democratic Iowa state representative who was supporting Mr. Biden&rsquo;s campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. During his remarks to supporters and volunteers, Mr. Biden touted his experience as vice president and as a senator, saying he would not need &ldquo;on-the-job training&rdquo; to serve as president. After his remarks, Mr. Biden met and greeted those in attendance before leaving for another scheduled campaign event.	465963-1	Speech		
CSPANJB811201930	Joe Biden	2019-11-08	Joe Biden Campaign Rally at New Hampshire State House	I AM SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT THERE ARE FOUR MAIN ONES. I TRUST JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE CHARACTER OF THE WHITE HOUSE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD A TEAM OF OUTSTANDING POLICY ADVISERS, DOMESTIC POLICY ADVISERS, AND FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS AND STAFF THEM WITH COMPETENT PEOPLE, SOMETHING WE DO NOT SEE WITH THIS CURRENT WHITE HOUSE. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN, WOMEN, FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED DOMESTIC ABUSE, FOR VETERANS, MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, AND IT WILL BE GREAT TO HAVE JOE BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WON'T IT? IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE DR. JILL BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, GOVERNOR LYNCH. THANK YOU. JOE AND I ARE SO HAPPY TO BE BACK AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ESPECIALLY TO SEE YOU AND SUSAN AGAIN AND NOW THAT WE HAVE JULIA, YOUR DAUGHTER, THANK YOU FOR COMING. I WAS RECENTLY AT A GREEK FESTIVAL HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND WE WENT WITH THE LYNCH'S, AND WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME WAS JUST HOW MUCH ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION THAT GRANITE STATERS HAVE FOR BOTH OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS DAY WITH US. FRIENDSHIP LIKE YOURS IS WITHOUT MEASURE. THE MEN AND WOMEN YOU REPRESENT ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO JOE. I TAUGHT A LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS OVER THE YEARS, AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SELFLESSNESS, THEIR DEDICATION TO PROFESSIONALISM AND ESPECIALLY THEIR COURAGE AND WHAT THEY DESERVE. THEY DESERVE OUR GRATITUDE AND OUR RESPECT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT OF MY HUSBAND'S CAREER I AM PROUD OF, FROM THE BILLS HE PASSED IN THE SENATE TO THE WORK HE DID SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA EIGHT YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKE ME THE PROUDEST OF HIM WERE NOT COVERED BY THE NEWS AND CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. ONCE WHEN HE WAS ON A PHOTO LINE, HE MET A LITTLE BOY WITH A STUTTER. JOE HAD A STUTTER AS A CHILD AS WELL. JOE GAVE THE BOY'S MOM A NUMBER TO CALL SO THAT THEY COULD VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY WERE IN THE D.C. A FEW MONTHS LATER, THIS LITTLE BOY AND HIS MOM DID RETURN TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND JOE TOOK THEM ALONG TO HIS SPEECH PRESS, AND JOE SHOWED THE LITTLE BOY HOW HE WOULD MARK UP HIS SPEECH AND USE RHYTHM TO GET THROUGH IT. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH FEAR HE USED IT TO HAVE HIMSELF ABOUT HIS OWN IMPEDIMENT AND HOW HE LEARNED TO OVERCOME IT, AND HE ENCOURAGES THE LITTLE BOY AND HE SAYS, YOU ARE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN I AM. IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT. JOE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE KIND OF PERSON WHO STOPS WHEN HE SEES SOMEONE WHO IS STRUGGLING. WHO FIGHTS FOR PEOPLE, WHO FEELS LEFT OUT. EVEN AS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WAS NEVER TOO BUSY TO CALL A FRIEND OR VISIT A HOSPITAL OF SOMEONE WHO WAS SICK. HIS KINDNESS, HIS CHARACTER, IT IS A PART OF EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES. IT IS WHY HE WORKS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MIDDLE AND WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SEEING THE DOCTOR OR SENDING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. IT IS WHY HE HAS HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SOMETIMES, IT IS THE UNREMARKABLE CHOICES WE MAKE THAT DEFINE WHO WE ARE. SOMETIMES, IT IS THE SMALL KINDNESSES THAT CAN CHANGE SOMEONE'S LIFE FOREVER. AND IN A TIME WHEN OUR NATION IS DROWNING IN CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION AND CRUELTY, WE NEED THAT KIND OF CHARACTER MORE THAN EVER. WE NEED A LEADER WITH EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM. SOMEONE WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND NOT TEAR FAMILIES APART. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO WE CAN TRUST. A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. AND THAT, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, JOE. [LAUGHTER] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. YOU HAVE BEEN STANDING OUT HERE A WHILE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO MEET SOME NEW PEOPLE DIRECTLY. THEY ONCE ASKED ME, WHAT WAS THE BEST THING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? THE MAIN THING IS THE NUMBER OF FRIENDS YOU MAKE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU MEET. I CALLED THE FIREFIGHTERS HERE ARE LED BY YOUR STATE PRESIDENT, BUT ALSO BY THE INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENTS, MY BUDDY, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I PROMISE I WILL NOT KEEP YOU LONG BECAUSE IT IS FREEZING OUT HERE. [LAUGHTER] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WENT TO SCHOOL IN SYRACUSE, IT IS EVEN COLDER. BUT HEARING YOUR STORIES, THE FEAR IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND KITCHEN TABLES THIS MORNING OF ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING FOLKS, THINGS THAT I THINK THE FELLOW OCCUPYING THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NO SENSE OF, NO EMPATHY FOR, AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF. I WONDER HOW WOULD PEOPLE SAT THE KITCHEN TABLE TODAY AND SAID, WHO WAS GOING TO TELL HER? WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO SEND HER BACK TO UNH. OR YOU GOT A RIDE ON THOSE TIRES , THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS IN MY HOME GROWING UP, WE HAVE TO RIDE THOSE TIRES ARE ANOTHER 10,000 MILES, WE CANNOT AFFORD NEW TIRES NOW. PRACTICAL THINGS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIVES. IT IS ABOUT, I THINK IS ON THE BALLOT RIGHT NOW, THE CHARACTER OF OUR NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. IF TRUMP IS REELECTED, FIRST OF ALL, WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS WORRIED CAN WE EVEN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF HIM. WE CAN. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE FOUR YEARS. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. WE NEED SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THE WORLD, BUT IT IS WITHIN OUR REACH. BUT EIGHT YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I HAVE LEARNED TWO THINGS. ONE IS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. ALL OF THOSE BOTS HE PUT OUT ON THE INTERNET. BUT ALSO, THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. I WONDER WHY HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I TELL YOU WHAT. WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING, I SAID WE WERE IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. AND I MEANT IT. IT IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION BUT LIVING UP TO OUR VALUES. I TALK ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE NATION, I TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT, LIKE MY DAD WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED IF I GET SICK, WHAT HAPPENS I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAMILY , WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? OR SENDING OUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL, ACTIVE FIRE DRILLS, LIVE FIRE DRILLS IN SCHOOL, SENDING THESE KIDS OFF , HOW MANY OF YOU DID THAT THE SEPTEMBER? WHAT IS WRONG WITH US. WE DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA? I HAVE TAKEN THEM ON TWICE AND BEATEN THEM TWICE, AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WILL LEAVE IN A SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT NOBODY SAYS YOU CAN HAVE A MAGAZINE WITH 100 BULLETS IN IT. WE PROTECT GEESE MORE THAN WE PROTECT, NO JOKE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHOTGUN SHELLS WHEN YOU GO SHOOT FOR GEESE. WE PROTECT GEESE BETTER THAN WE DO OUR KIDS. FOLKS, LOOK. THE FACT IS THAT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THEIR HEALTH CARE. LOOK, WE CAN BUILD ON IT, I WAS THERE AND HELPED PASS OBAMACARE. IT MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA. 160 MILLION PEOPLE, AND NOW THAT HAVE INSURANCE. THE FOLKS I AM RUNNING AGAINST OR WITH ARE SAYING YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE. I THINK, LET THEM MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS. IF THEY DO NOT WANT THEIR PRIVATE INSURANCE, THEY CAN JOIN THE PUBLIC OPTION THAT I PROVIDED AN OBAMACARE AND EXPANDED. HERE IS THE POINT. THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE , DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , THEY DO. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE STAND FOR UNITY, NOT DIVISION. WE STAND FOR HOPE, NOT FEAR. WE STAND FOR SCIENCE, NOT FICTION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: AND DEMOCRATS, WE STAND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY FOR TRUTH, NOT LIES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I PROMISE YOU, IF I AM YOUR NOMINEE, IT IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO DEFEAT THEM SOUNDLY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT TOLERATE ANOTHER PRESIDENT LIKE THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. IF YOU GIVE ME THE NOMINATION, I PROMISE YOU, I AM GOING TO BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I LOVE YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) FORMER VP BIDEN: WHERE IN CALIFORNIA? FINISHING UP OUR COVERAGE OF THIS CAMPAIGN RALLY OF JOE BIDEN FROM CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

CSPANJB312201933	Joe Biden	2019-12-03	Joe Biden in Mason City, Iowa	"THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO PARTICIPANTS IS NOT TO BE AFRAID TO TAKE YOUR ISSUES SERIOUSLY. YOU ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO HAVE AN OPINION, SO LET YOUR VOICE THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY GRACIOUS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I TOLD THE SENATOR, I SAID, I KNOW YOU HAVE EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. MY MOTHER HAD THEM. EVERY DAMN THING I DID, SHE CAUGHT ME DOING. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL. WHAT A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL CROWD. YOU KNOW, LET ME BEGIN BY JUST SAYING, STATING THE OBVIOUS. EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE STARTING GUN. YOU'RE THE ONES THAT DECIDE AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WHO IS LIKELY TO BE THE NOMINEE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND FOR THAT MATTER, REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHEN THERE IS NOT AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. AND IT MATTERS A LOT, BECAUSE OF THE VALUES YOU ALL BRING TO THE PROCESS ARE REAL. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT VALUES. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'M RUNNING FOR , I DECIDED , JILL AND I DECIDED WE ARE GOING TO , WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS TIME FOR THREE BASIC REASONS. MOST IMPORTANT ONE WAS IS, WE HAVE TO LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE IN TROUBLE. WE'RE IN TROUBLE. [APPLAUSE] THE WAY OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTING NOW IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHO AMERICA IS. THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS OF HIS OPPONENTS, THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS OF HIS , THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE OUR OPPONENTS, THE THUGS LIKE KIM JONG-UN AND OTHER DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD, THE WAY HE POKES HIS FINGER IN THE EYE OF OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THE WAY HE CHARACTERIZES PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY DEFICIENCY AT ALL, ANY PHYSICAL AILMENT. THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH HIM IS NOT HOW WE ARE RAISED. NOT HOW ANY OF YOU WERE RAISED IN THIS TOWN, IN THIS COMMUNITY, IN THIS COUNTY. NOT HOW JILL AND I WERE RAISED AT HOME. NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING TO WHAT'S GOING ON. AND IT HAS AN IMPACT. WHEN PRESIDENTS SPEAK, NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, NO MATTER WHO IT IS, PEOPLE LISTEN. THE PRESIDENT CAN, BY HIS OR HER WORDS, RAISE OR COLLAPSE MARKETS OUT THERE. A PRESIDENT BY THEIR WORDS CAN SEND BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR. THEY CAN BRING PEACE, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BREATHE OXYGEN TO THE HATRED THAT EXISTS IN SMALL AMOUNTS, THAT LIVES UNDER THE ROCKS OUT THERE IN AMERICA. THE HISTORY OF AMERICA HAS NOT BEEN A FAIRY TALE. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE HAD FOLKS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEMAGOGUE AND BLAME WHATEVER THE PROBLEM THEY THINK THEY HAVE ON THE OTHER. IT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER. THE OTHER. A GUY THAT'S BECOME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, JOHN MEECHAN, WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND HE HAD A CHAPTER IN THE BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW BACK IN 1925 YOU HAD OVER 32,000, I BELIEVE THE NUMBER HE GIVES, PEOPLE, THE KU KLUX KLAN AND THEIR POINTED HATS MARCHING DOWN THE STREETS IN WASHINGTON DC. BECAUSE THEN IT WASN'T ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IT WAS ABOUT CATHOLICS AFTER WORLD WAR I WHO WERE IN FACT DECIMATED, WERE LEAVING COMING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE DEGRADING OF CHRISTIANITY BECAUSE OF THOSE CATHOLICS COMING FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND ITALY AND OTHER PLACES. AND HE POINTS OUT WHAT IT TOOK THEN AND EVERY OTHER TIME WE HAD TO CONFRONT THIS KIND OF , THIS KIND OF DEMAGOGUERY, IS IT TOOK EVERYBODY STANDING UP. ALL FAITHS. ALL PARTIES. ALL LEADERS. PEOPLE STANDING UP AND SAYING NOT HERE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU FOUGHT FOR. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES MARINE. I AM NOT BEING MELODRAMATIC. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. OR WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. IT SOUNDS CORNY. BUT THAT'S WHY THE PEOPLE LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. OUR WARRIORS ARE THE FINEST WARRIORS THAT HAVE EVER, EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH, BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE WORLD. NECESSARY, BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. WE'VE LED THE WORLD BY THE EXAMPLE, OUR EXAMPLE, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT'S WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS UP TO US. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNITE, KEEP THE PEACE FOR THE LAST 70 YEARS THROUGH NATO AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER. AND FOLKS, THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WONDERING ABOUT US. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NATIONAL POLLING DATA , THAT INTERNATIONAL POLLING DATA THAT GOES ON ABOUT , I THINK IT'S THE PEW POLL, THAT GOES OUT AND LOOKS AT WHERE WE STAND IN , WE ARE THE MOST RESPECTED NATIONS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE JUST BEHIND CHINA AND JUST AHEAD OF RUSSIA. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. YOU SAY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? WE ARE NOT RUNNING A POPULARITY CONTEST. BUT WE ARE. WE ARE. AS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE SAID, THE ESSENTIAL NATION, WE GENUINELY ARE. WE ARE THE OUTFIT THAT HOLDS THINGS TOGETHER. AND HERE AT HOME, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D SEE A TIME, COMING OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D, I COME FROM THE STATE THAT HAS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK STATE IN , POPULATION IN AMERICA. I LOVE READING THESE BIOGRAPHIES OF ME. BIDEN KNEW HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. I WAS JUST A KID. JUST GOT ENGAGED. IT JUST GOT ME, IT MOTIVATED ME IN A WAY I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENCY THAT EXISTED. BUT, FOLKS, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE IN 2017, AS A SITTING VICE PRESIDENT, THEN OUT OF OFFICE, COMING OUT OF THE STREETS OF, IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, CONTORTED FACES. I MEAN, SCREAMING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT THE SAME BILE THAT WAS HOLLERED AND SCREAMED AND CHANTED IN GERMANY BEFORE WORLD WAR II BEGAN ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. WHITE SUPREMACISTS. A YOUNG WOMAN GETS KILLED. SHE WAS PROTESTING. THE PRESIDENT GETS ASKED, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. PRESIDENT? AND HE SAYS SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. FOLKS, WE GOT A LOT AT STAKE HERE, A LOT GOING ON. IN ORDER TO GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE TO GET TO RESTORE THE , TO BEGIN TO RESTORE THE ESSENCE OF WHO AMERICA IS. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN, ALWAYS BEEN HARDWORKING, WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE NOT BAD, PER SE, BUT THEY DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA. PEOPLE THAT BUILT AMERICA ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS I COME FROM AND PEOPLE HERE IN MASON CITY AND THAT'S NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW WE ARE ALL RAISED. WE ARE ALL RAISED THE SAME WAY, BASICALLY. DIFFERENT EMPHASIS, BUT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE WAS, NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAME FROM, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. WELL, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW. MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA IS GETTING CLOBBERED. WE'RE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. SECONDLY, YOU HAVE WELL OVER HALF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS THINKING THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING AS HIGH AS THEIRS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN SO MUCH, HOW CAN I SAY IT? NOT DEPRESSION. SO MUCH ANXIETY. SINCE PROBABLY THE GREAT DEPRESSION ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS TIME BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. WE HAVE TO BUILD, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL AMERICA, IN THE SMALL TOWNS AND IN RURAL AMERICA. NOT JUST REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS SO THAT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO LEAVE TO GO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE HAVE TO BUILD IT HERE. HERE. IN THE PARTS OF MY STATE, THE TOWNS OF 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 PEOPLE, IN TOWNS OF 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 PEOPLE, SO PEOPLE HAVE A REASON TO STAY, BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF HYPERBOLE. YOU ARE THE MORAL CENTER OF THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, WE ALL SAY, Y'ALL TALK ABOUT AMERICAN VALUES AND MIDWESTERN VALUES AND MIDDLE-CLASS VALUES BUT IT'S TRUE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, THE THIRD THING WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SEEKING NOMINATION DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE, BY THE WAY. ALL THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING WITH AND WE ARE RUNNING WITH ONE ANOTHER, THEY ARE GOOD, DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE. BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF THEM THINK THERE'S NO WAY TO UNITE THE COUNTRY, NO WAY TO BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IF YOU WATCH ANY OF THOSE DEBATES WHICH ARE REALLY NOT DEBATES, THEY ARE 60-SECOND ASSERTIONS WE MAKE , [LAUGHTER] AND THAT'S NO CANDIDATE'S FAULT. IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF HAVING 10, 12, 90 PEOPLE ON A STAGE. [LAUGHTER] BUT LOOK, THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, UNLESS WE PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AGAIN, WE GOT A REAL PROBLEM. THE WAY OUR RULES ARE SET UP, THE WAY OUR CONSTITUTION IS SET UP, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS. OR YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE. IT JUST RESULTS IN THE ABUSE OF POWER IF YOU DON'T GET CONSENSUS. THE PRESIDENT SAYS, WELL, NO ONE'S ACTING SO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT FOR A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I THINK, ARE READY. LOOK, LOOK HOW WE'RE EVEN GETTING DIVIDED BASED ON URBAN AND RURAL NOW. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN A SKYSCRAPER IN NEW YORK CITY OR IN LOS ANGELES HAVE ANY MORE OR LESS OF AN OPPORTUNITY, WHY DO WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THAT AND SOMEONE LIVING ON A FARM IN THIS COUNTY? BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF MAKING IT OUT THESE DAYS. LOOK AT THE SPLIT. YOU READ ALL THAT, THOSE OPINION PIECES IN THE PRESS. THE GREAT DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AMERICA AND RURAL AMERICA. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS EXIST. ALL THESE DIFFERENCES BUT NEVER EXISTED THE WAY IT DOES NOW. AND FOLKS, WE GOT TO CHANGE IT. AND THE WAY TO START TO CHANGE IT, AND I AM GOING TO GET RIGHT TO IT AND NOT KEEP YOU LONG HERE. THE WAY TO CHANGE IT IS THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN GROWING UP IN MASON CITY IN THIS COUNTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION THAT WHEN THEY GROW UP, THEY CAN CHOOSE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO STAY, RAISE THEIR FAMILIES RIGHT HERE IN MASON CITY AND IN THE RURAL COUNTIES AROUND SURROUNDED , SURROUNDING YOU. BUT IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO DO, ISN'T IT? I REMEMBER AS A KID, WE USED TO TAKE THE IOWA TEST. REMEMBER THE IOWA TEST? NO, I MEAN IT. YOU HAD THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU WERE THOUGHT TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S HAPPENING? SO FOLKS, LET ME GET RIGHT TO IT. I THINK, YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS I WANT TO DO AND OTHERS WANT TO DO, IS TO HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IN FACT PROVIDES FOR EVERYONE, EVERYONE HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, EVERYBODY. WELL, I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT. THE WAY IS TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE. THE PROUDEST, ONE OF THE PROUDEST MOMENTS I HAD AS VICE PRESIDENT IS HELPING THE PRESIDENT GET EVERY DEMOCRAT WE NEEDED, WHICH IS NOT ALL THAT EASY TO DO INITIALLY, ALL THE, COME ON UP. COME ON. HOW ARE YOU DOING? MEET MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WHAT'S YOUR NAME DECK OF , WHAT'S YOUR NAME? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT WAS A GIGANTIC CHANGE. WE MADE SURE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS AND PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COULD BE COVERED, THEY GET INSURANCE, CAN AFFORD IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE BEFORE ARE COVERED. WE CAN GO ON, BUT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THIS. NOW IS TIME TO BUILD ON THAT. DO WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED TO DO THE FIRST TIME OUT, ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, MEDICARE OPTION, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PRICE OF DRUGS BY SETTING UP A BOARD THAT IN FACT SETS THE PRICE OF THOSE DRUGS LIKE THEY DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES. PUT IN A POSITION WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES TO BUY INTO WHAT WILL BECOME, GOD WILLING, BIDEN-CARE, OBAMA, , BIDENCARE, OBAMACARE ASIDE. WE CAN DO IT. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY OVER 10 YEARS BUT ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU NEGOTIATED AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT YOUR EMPLOYER SET UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. BUT IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN BUY INTO A PLAN WHERE YOU HAVE NO MORE THAN $1,000 DEDUCTIBLE. YOU CAN AFFORD IT. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT, YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY JOIN A MEDICARE PLAN THAT EXISTS WITHIN THIS PROBLEM. , THIS PUBLIC OPTION. BUT HERE'S THE POINT. IT DOESN'T COST $35 TRILLION. [LAUGHTER] BUT WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN RURAL AMERICA. MY STATE IS RURAL, BY THE WAY. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT DELAWARE IS A BIG URBAN STATE. THE LARGEST TOWN IS 85 THOUSAND, NEXT LARGEST TOWN IS 20000 AND EVERYTHING BELOW THAT. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD TEACHERS, DON'T HAVE ACCESS, AND YOU DO, DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, IT'S GETTING TOUGHER. WE'RE LOSING. WE ALREADY ARE ABOUT 150,000 , THAT'S THE PRESIDENT CALLING ME. JUST PUT HIM THROUGH. [LAUGHTER] HE ALWAYS DOES THAT. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT I WANT HIM TO DO. [APPLAUSE] DO ME A FAVOR. HE'S WITH NATO RIGHT NOW. TELL HIM DON'T KEEP SCREWING IT UP, OK. TELL HIM TO, OK. ALL RIGHT. ANYWAY. I GUESS I SHOULDN'T KID SO MUCH. ANYWAY. I'M VIOLATING MY OWN RULE. NEVER CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT WHENEVER HE'S ABROAD. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL HE GETS HOME. ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT ANYWAY, LOOK, IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT MAKING SURE TEACHERS' SALARIES ARE MORE COMPETITIVE, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN 500,000 TO 700,000 TEACHERS IN THE NEXT GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] THEY GET PAID A LOT LESS. THERE'S ANSWERS. THERE'S THINGS CALLED TITLE 1 SCHOOLS, SCHOOLS IN DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND IS, IT'S NOT BASED ON RACE OR, IT'S BASED ON INCOME OF THE COMMUNITY. WELL, A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES DON'T, THEY'RE TITLE 1 SCHOOLS. RIGHT NOW WHAT WE DO, WE SPEND A TOTAL OF $15 BILLION YEARLY FOR ALL THOSE SCHOOLS TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. IF WE TRIPLE THAT TO $45 BILLION A YEAR AND BY THE WAY, JUST ELIMINATED A COUPLE INCREDIBLY LUCRATIVE TAX CUTS THIS PRESIDENT HAS PUT FORWARD FOR THE TOP 0.1%, WE CAN PAY FOR ALL THIS. ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, IF WE DO THAT, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD NO MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND IS CAN START SCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE, SCHOOL AT AGE 3, 4, AND 5. THE STUDIES AT ONE UNIVERSITY HERE IN THIS STATE SHOW THE FOLLOWING. A CHILD WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY HAS AN EXPONENTIALLY GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE. BEING ABLE TO DO WELL. IT'S A GIGANTIC IMPACT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL CATCH UP QUICKLY. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS GET PAID A COMPETITIVE SALARY. THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE MONEY FIRST BECAUSE TEACHERS, AS THEY GRADUATE FROM IOWA STATE OR UNIVERSITY OF IOWA OR ANYWHERE ELSE AROUND HERE, WHAT HAPPENS? THEY GRADUATE AND THEY MAKE 27% LESS THAN ANY OTHER GRADUATE COMING OUT OF THE SAME SCHOOL WITH A DIFFERENT DEGREE. AND IT SOUNDS CORNY. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I'D BE SLEEPING ALONE IF I DIDN'T SHARE THIS VIEW. [LAUGHTER] YOU THINK I'M KIDDING, DON'T YOU? NO. TEACHING IS NOT WHAT JILL DOES, IT'S WHO SHE IS. MY POINT IS THIS. WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE POSITION. TEACHERS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE WE HAVE. THEY ARE THE, THESE AREN'T SOMEBODY ELSE'S KIDS. THEY ARE ALL OUR KIDS. THEY'RE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS TO , NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT. AS JILL SAYS ALL THE TIME, ANY COUNTRY THAT OUTEDUCATES US IS GOING TO OUTCOMPETE US. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. NOT A JOKE. DOES ANYBODY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE IN 2020 OR 2030 OR 2040 TO BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION ALONE? IT'S NOT, THINGS ARE CHANGING SO RAPIDLY. DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE A CERTIFICATE. YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP THAT YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH QUICKLY. YOU MAY HAVE TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE CAN AFFORD THESE THINGS. I CAN MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON QUALIFIED FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN GO FOR FREE, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE OLDER, WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF, BECAUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES THAT'S TAKING PLACE TO COME BACK AND BE RETRAINED AS HARD AS IT IS. WE'VE LOST OVER 200,000 SALES JOBS IN AMERICA. AVERAGE AGE OF THE PERSON LOSING A JOB, 49. AVERAGE SALARY, $50,000. WHY? NOT BAD. NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS EVIL. BUT AMAZON CAME ALONG. EVERYBODY, I AM NOT GOING TO ASK YOU BUT HOW MANY BUY ONLINE FOR CHRISTMAS? AGAIN, I AM NOT SAYING IT'S BAD. GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENED? YOU GOT AN AWFUL LOT, MANY OF YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT LIKE MY DAD DID. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE BEEN DOING WELL, YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY, ALL OR HALF THE INCOME, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE NO JOB AND YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD. WHAT DO YOU DO? WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY OTHER MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS TAKING PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA WE HAVE NOT ONLY PROVIDED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY, WE'VE PROVIDED FOR OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO GET PUT OUT OF PLACE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE NOT DOING IT. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AVAILABLE TO US. AND FOLKS, I THINK THE BEST COMMENT I EVER HEARD, THE MOST HONEST COMMENT I EVER HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP USE, REMEMBER, RIGHT AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, THE PRESS WILL RIGHTLY CORRECT ME ON THIS. I HOPE THEY'LL HELP ME ON THIS ONE TO GET IT RIGHT. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER HE WAS ELECTED HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS JOB IS HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. I WAS LIKE, OK. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE SAID IT. I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS SERIOUS. IT'S HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. WELL, I GUESS SO. I GUESS SO. BUT HERE'S THE THING. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN RURAL AMERICA UNDER HIS POLICIES. FARMING. THIS TRADE WAR IS DEVASTATING. IT'S DEVASTATING NOT ONLY TO AGRICULTURE BUT MANUFACTURING. I SAW SOMEONE HAD A JOHN DEERE HAT ON. JOHN DEERE HAS A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE ARE GETTING LAID OFF. WHAT ABOUT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY? I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN BEING ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF PUTTING IT BACK ON ITS FEET BECAUSE I WAS THE AUTOMOBILE GUY IN THE ADMINISTRATION. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. THE PRESIDENT DID IT. BUT I WAS THE GUY WHO WAS PUSHING IT. WELL, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW? THE TRADE WAR HE'S ENGAGED IN ARE ALL THE WRONG WARS, AND NOW I READ THIS MORNING HE'S ABOUT TO GO AFTER LATIN AMERICA NOW. SOUTH AMERICA NOW. OK. BUT ALL THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT. THE THING THAT MATTERS IS, CHINA, WE'RE STILL THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, BUT CHINA IS SO DARN BIG WE MAKE UP 25% OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY. IF IN FACT WE JOIN WITH THE OTHER 25% OF OUR ALLIES, WE CAN MAKE CHINA PLAY BY THE RULES THEY DON'T GET TO PLAY FOR REAL, NOT A JOKE. NOT A JOKE. ONLY WAY TO GET THEIR ATTENTION, BECAUSE THEY BREAK THE RULES. NOT SO MUCH ON AGRICULTURE, BUT THEY BREAK THE RULES ON STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON CYBERSECURITY. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON DUMPING STEEL. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON A LOT OF THINGS. BUT GUESS WHAT, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ASIA NOW? JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AREN'T GETTING ALONG ANYMORE. WE ARE IN POSITION WHERE NORTH KOREA IS GAINING FOOTING. AUSTRALIA IS NOT SURE WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THAT GOLIATH ABOVE THEM, CHINA, IS JUST LEANING DOWN ON THEM. FOLKS, THERE'S NO WAY WITH NO POLICIES. THE REASON I'M TALKING ABOUT , I KNOW I AM THE FOREIGN POLICY GUY. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I AM TALKING ABOUT IT. I AM TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE AS DIRECT IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC IMPACT , IT HAS DIRECT IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS AT HOME. AT HOME. IMAGINE IF WE INVEST IN OUR OWN PEOPLE? BUT HERE'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY AND MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. TOM VILSACK, WHO IS , YOU KNOW , THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW YOU REALLY WELL, YOU CAN NEVER BE A HERO, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS I'VE WORKED WITH. NOT A JOKE. HE WAS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME AUTHORITY TO HANDLE ISSUES OVER FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICY, NOT BECAUSE, LOOK. NO PRESIDENT CAN HANDLE ALL THE, EVERYTHING THAT LANDS ON HIS DESK, BY HIMSELF. IT'S GETTING TOO COMPLICATED. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VICE PRESIDENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO TURN OVER A CHUNK OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND TURN OVER PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME AUTHORITY, HE GAVE ME PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY. I ONLY DID ABOUT 20% OF WHAT HE DID, BUT THE THINGS HE GAVE ME, I DID. FROM THE CANCER MOON SHOT TO DEALING WITH THE RECOVERY ACT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. AND ALLOWED ME TO GO OUT AND PICK OUT ANYBODY I WANTED TO IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK ON WHAT I WANTED THEM TO WORK ON. I HELD ALMOST AS MANY CABINET MEETINGS AS THE PRESIDENT DID. JUST BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES I HAD. MY GO-TO GUY THROUGH THE WHOLE THING, NOT A JOKE, WAS TOM VILSACK. HE WAS THE GO-TO GUY. SO WHEN I WANTED TO REFINE MY AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND RURAL POLICY, I SAT DOWN WITH THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. AND HERE'S THE DEAL, AND I'LL CONCLUDE WITH THIS. THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY LIES IN LARGE PART IN RURAL AMERICA. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. NOT ONLY ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE FOOD AND FIBER FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT MORE THAN THAT NOW. WHEN GLOBAL WARMING, YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME THE GO-TO SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY. WE SHOULD BE PAYING RURAL AMERICA AND FARMERS TO GROW CROPS WITH DEEPER ROOTS. WHY? ABSORB CARBON FROM THE AIR. WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TOM HARKIN'S CONSERVATION PROGRAM, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ACRES PUT ASIDE AND PAY FARMERS TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT BECOMES A CARBON SINK LIKE AMAZON, TAKES THE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. IT MOVES US TOWARD NET ZERO EMISSIONS. WE SHOULD BE TAKING, LIKE WE DO IN MY STATE OF DELAWARE, BECAUSE WE, WE HAVE A LARGE AGRICULTURE ECONOMY IN THE DELMARVA PENINSULA, IT'S BETWEEN A $4 BILLION AND $5 BILLION A YEAR INDUSTRY. IT'S CHICKENS. BROILER CHICKENS. TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND HERE'S THE DEAL. IT HAS SOME SIDE EFFECTS. THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY DANGEROUS. LIKE YOU HAVE OUT HERE WITH CATTLE. IT'S CALLED , AND PIGS. IT'S CALLED MANURE. WELL, GUESS WHAT, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PELLETIZE THIS. TAKE THE METHANE OUT OF IT. USE IT FOR ENERGY AND SELL THE PELLETS, BUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO, YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE EVERY 20, 30 MILES NEW HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THERE TO DO THIS. CLEANLY AND EFFICIENTLY. ETHANOL. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE TO ETHANOL. HE'S CHOSEN THE OIL COMPANIES OVER THE FARMERS. WE SET THIS PROCESS GOING. YOU ALL ENDED UP IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU GO, AND THOSE ETHANOL PLANTS, YOU END UP, THEY ARE NOT MAKING $10 AN HOUR, THEY ARE MAKING $45 AN HOUR. THEY'RE GROWING AN ECONOMY. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? BUT ALL THE FUTURE, SO THEY LOST SO MANY THINGS. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE, I PROMISE YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE, ESPECIALLY IF I GET ELECTED, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN RURAL AMERICA FOR THE SAKE OF URBAN AMERICA. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU BECOME, AGAIN, THE ANSWER FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND I REALLY MEAN IT. THE FUTURE IS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. BUT WE GOT TO INVEST. WE GOT TO INVEST. I LOOK OVER AT MY WIFE AND SHE IS GIVING ME THIS, MEANING, CUT, YOU ARE GOING ON TOO LONG AND SHE'S RIGHT, DEAD RIGHT. SHE'S WRITTEN , SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT. I AM JILL'S HUSBAND. BUT, LOOK, THE POINT IS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS, I'VE LAID OUT IN DETAIL MY RURAL AMERICA POLICY. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, I'M COMMITTED TO RESTORING THE PROMISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN RURAL AMERICA TO STAY IN RURAL AMERICA. BECAUSE, AGAIN, IF WE LOSE THE ESSENCE AND THE ETHIC OF RURAL AMERICA, WE LOSE PART OF AMERICA'S SOUL. WE REALLY DO. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE, HOW WE'RE RAISED. AND FOLKS, IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND JUST LOOK DOWN THE ROAD HERE A LITTLE BIT, I KNOW THAT WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I'M THE FIRST SENATOR I EVER REALLY KNEW. [LAUGHTER] YOU ALL THINK I'M KIDDING. I'M NOT. [LAUGHTER] I SWEAR TO GOD. I DIDN'T REALIZE I KEPT GOING OVER TO GET AN ASSIGNMENT FROM THE MAJORITY LEADER, NOBODY GETS AN ASSIGNMENT. NO SENATOR IS EVER ASSIGNED ANYTHING BY ANYBODY. BUT I SHOWED UP EVERY TUESDAY AT 2:00 TO MY ASSIGNMENT FROM SENATOR MANSFIELD. FOLKS, I AM OPTIMISTIC. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY ENTIRE CAREER BECAUSE, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S THE REASON I'M RUNNING, BECAUSE I THINK MY EXPERIENCE CAN HELP US GET TO THE PLACE WE HAVE TO GO. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ELECTED PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE, HAS DONE BIG THINGS, PASSED BIG PIECES OF LEGISLATION, BEEN ABLE TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE AND PRODUCE OUTCOMES LIKE I WAS ABLE TO DO ON CANCER AND ABLE TO DO ON RESEARCH AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. BECAUSE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT, IN ADDITION, THEY ARE GOING TO FIND A DIVIDED NATION AND GOING TO FIND A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THAT PRESIDENT, ON THE DAY THEY'RE ELECTED AND SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20 HAS TO ASSUME THE WORLD STAGE. WITHOUT ANY, AND NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. NOT A JOKE. IT'S NOT EVERY YEAR, NOT EVERY PRESIDENTIAL RACE REQUIRES THAT. BUT TODAY IT DOES. TODAY IT DOES. AND I HAVE VIRTUALLY MET EVERY SINGLE MAJOR WORLD LEADER AND I KNOW MOST OF THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES AND EVEN THE BAD GUYS I KNOW AND THEY KNOW I KNOW THEM AND THEY KNOW ME. IT'S NOT CONFRONTATION. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. PRESIDENT OBAMA USED TO ALWAYS KID ME. I'D SAY TO HIM ALL THE TIME, REMEMBER, MR. PRESIDENT, ALL POLITICS IS PERSONAL. BY THAT I MEAN, IF I WANT TO GET SOMETHING WITH YOU, WHETHER YOU , GET SOMETHING DONE WITH YOU, WHETHER YOU ARE A GOOD GUY, BAD GUY, I HAVE TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHAT THE CORE OF YOU IS, AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. PUTIN KNOWS I KNOW WHO HE IS. NOT A JOKE. THE GOOD GUYS. BECAUSE AMERICA'S WORD MATTERS. WHEN A PRESIDENT STANDS BEFORE THE WORLD AND SAYS SOMETHING, OUR FRIENDS HAVE TO KNOW AND OUR FOES HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT'S THE COMMITMENT AMERICA'S MADE. AND SO, FOLKS, THE REASON I'M OPTIMISTIC IS TAKE A LOOK AT WHO WE ARE. WE'RE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? GOD, THINGS ARE SO TERRIBLE. WE HAVE THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE THAT IF IN FACT WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE. I'VE NOT MET ONE WORLD LEADER , INCLUDING XI JINPING, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WANTED ME TO GET TO KNOW HIM KNOWING HE WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF CHINA, TRAVELED 17,000 MILES WITH HIM. HAD DINNER WITH HIM. THEY TELL ME 24, 25 HOURS OF PRIVATE DINNERS. I WOULD HAVE AN INTERPRETER WHISPER IN MY EAR. HE HAD ONE WHISPER IN HIS EAR. BY THE WAY, MY INTERPRETER TURNED IN THEIR NOTES. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, HE CHANGED PLACES WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A HEARTBEAT. CHINA HAS GREAT POTENTIAL. MY GOD, THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE THERE ARE OVERWHELMING. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A TRILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT TO TURN RIVERS AROUND TO MAKE THEM FLOW NORTH SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO DRINK. IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. IT'S NOT GOOD. I AM NOT HAPPY THEY'RE HAVING THAT PROBLEM. THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF LAND, SOMEWHERE ESTIMATES BETWEEN 30% AND 45% OF THEIR LANDED IS , THEIR LAND IS PRETTY , POLLUTED AND CAN'T PRODUCE CROPS. THEY HAVE A MILLION MUSLIM, UIGHURS IN THE WEST IN RE-EDUCATION CAMPS, BETTER KNOWN AS CONCENTRATION CAMPS. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HONG KONG TODAY. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE REGION. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS THAT MAKES OURS PALE IN COMPARISON. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR OWN PEOPLE, THOUGH. SECONDLY, WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN ALL THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN STATE IN THIS NATION THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR NEW LIFE CHANGING, ALTERING THING THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, MONETIZED, MONETIZED BY BUSINESS, BUT YOU OWN THEM. YOU OWN THEM. OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF BEING ABLE TO CHANGE CANCER AS WE KNOW IT. DEAL WITH ALZHEIMER'S IF WE INVEST IN IT. MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. SO IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO IT'S TIME TO GET UP. LIFT OUR HEADS UP, AND LET'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY AND DO WHAT JOHN MCCAIN WANTED US TO DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU THE BETTER HALF OF MY FAMILY, DR. JILL BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO IN 62 DAYS, IOWA HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE. BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT I WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO THE FUTURE. I WANT TO TAKE YOU PAST THE CAUCUS, PAST THE ELECTION AND INTO THE NEXT YEAR, THE NEXT NOVEMBER. IT'S 2021. SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING LIKE THIS MORNING IN IOWA AND YOU WAKE UP AND LIKE JOE AND I DID THIS MORNING, WE HAD OUR MORNING COFFEE. AND THEN YOU PICK UP YOUR MORNING PAPER AND THE HEADLINE ISN'T ABOUT SOME LATE NIGHT TWEET STORM. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD, IT'S ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, AMERICA'S CHILDREN WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM UNIVERSAL PRE-K. IT'S ABOUT HOW THE TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FINALLY GOING TO GET A RAISE. YOU READ ABOUT INVESTING IN WIND TECHNOLOGY AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GOING TO CREATE JOBS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. AND THEN, LIKE WE DID THIS MORNING, YOU TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THE ANCHORS AREN'T TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF SOME ILL-ADVISED WAR. INSTEAD, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH A PUBLIC OPTION AND BRING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. AND - [APPLAUSE] AND THEY'RE REPORTING THAT FINALLY, FINALLY SOMEONE IS STANDING UP TO THE N.R.A. AND KEEPING OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS SAFE! [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN THEY TURN TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU DON'T TURN THE CHANNEL. [APPLAUSE] YOU CALL IN YOUR KIDS FROM THE OTHER ROOM BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TO SAY. A COMMANDER IN CHIEF YOU CAN TRUST. A LEADER WHO BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER INSTEAD OF TEARING FAMILIES APART LIKE WE'VE SEEN AT THE BORDER OF THIS COUNTRY. A PRESIDENT YOU CAN FEEL PROUD OF, WHO BELIEVES THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN GET US TO THE FUTURE. THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THIS DIVIDED TIME, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN TAKE ON TRUMP IN STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO AND WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND THAT PERSON IS MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT IOWA, HE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU. 62 DAYS. 62 DAYS, NOT THAT I'M COUNTING - [LAUGHTER] SO I'VE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THIS STATE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU A TRUE STORY. SO THEY HAVE ME MAKING PHONE CALLS TO PEOPLE AS I TRAVEL, AND THEY SAY, I'LL CALL SOMEBODY AND SAY, WELL, SUSAN, YOU KNOW, WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING? DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SUPPORT MY HUSBAND BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND I EXPLAIN IT AND THEY SAY, WELL, JILL, I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY MET YOUR HUSBAND THREE TIMES. [LAUGHTER] AND I'VE MET SENATOR X SEVEN TIMES. DO YOU THINK JOE COULD COME TO OUR HOUSE FOR DINNER? AND IT'S THE SPOUSE OF A CANDIDATE. IT HURTS MY FEELINGS LIKE, WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU HAVEN'T MADE UP YOUR MIND YET? SO NOW IS THE TIME. IT'S TODAY. TODAY. YOU MUST COMMIT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. I KNOW YOU HAVE LOTS TO DO. IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON. YOU'RE MAKING YOUR LIST. SO ON YOUR LIST, WHERE YOU HAVE WRITTEN, DECIDE WHO I'M GOING TO COMMIT FOR, CROSS IT OFF BECAUSE TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE BUSY. I KNOW THIS IS A BUSY TIME, BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE SO COMMITTED. IT STARTS TODAY. IT STARTS HERE. IT STARTS WITH YOUR COMMITMENT TO MY HUSBAND, AND DO WE HAVE EDUCATORS IN THIS , YES. LOTS OF EDUCATORS. OK. THOSE EDUCATORS, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND I WANT YOU TO BE OUR PRECINCT CAPTAINS BECAUSE YOU ARE ORGANIZED. YOU HAVE A STRATEGY. YOU HAVE A TEACHER VOICE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND GET THEM TO CAUCUS. SO I WANT OUR TEACHERS TO BE OUR PRECINCT CAPTAINS. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, ALL OF YOU, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR FAITH IN AN IDEA THAT'S BIGGER THAN ANY ONE OF US, THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER NATION IF WE DO THIS TOGETHER. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) PLAYING: JACKIE WILSON, ""YOUR LOVE KEEPS LIFTING ME HIGHER""] (music) MR. BIDEN: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BUILT US. [INDISCERNIBLE] THERE WAS A TWEET SENT OUT ABOUT A NICKEL BACK SHOW WHILE [INDISCERNIBLE] WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT [INDISCERNIBLE]"	https://www.c-span.org/video/?466970-1/joe-biden-mason-city-iowa	Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Historic Park Inn&rsquo;s ballroom in downtown Mason City, Iowa. He talked about his campaign&rsquo;s platform, which he framed as a fight for the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of the United States. He criticized President Trump in his remarks, which focused largely on creating secure educational and health care opportunities for middle class families. His wife Jill Biden also spoke to the crowd of attendees before many of them were greeted by the former vice president.	466970-1	Speech

When I went out to seem a littl e vacation goodb ye and and take Kennedy same way there were people who were when fact I've been through a n awful lot of by the way people talk about what I've been through. Many people al l through the stages ho me been through much more than I have w ithout the hel p I' ve. Tru e that I. G ot el ected I was 29 year old guy I wa s only about. Not not even 10 years ol der than many of you about that. And I got elected whe n I was 29 when o ld o f to be s worn in as vice pre sident I mean excuse m e as I'm going to jump away ahe ad as a United St ates senator y ou ha ve to be 30 to be sw or n in and I didn't turn 3 0 until 17 days after I got elected. I was i n Washington I got a phone call saying that my wife and 3 children were to s hop in a tractor trailer bro adsided and kill my wife a nd kill my daug hter and my 2 boys are ve ry bad. A lot of people been throu gh that without the help I had I have an incredible sister and a brot her and a mot her was alive at the time who just helped me just moved in just to help me take care of my kid giv e all the people you know b een through wha t I've been through and mor e and don't have anyb ody to get u p every sin gle day and put o n e foot in front of th e other they move on genuine he re general ly here of.

I think what I've b een through is. Give m e a t least some insigh t in to what ot her people both and folk s I know one of the reasons why I'm ta king this bus tou r 660 miles thr ough rural I owa is because you ar e the heart and soul this country I 'm not joking about but he mi ght m y state is on e of the most rura l states in America. Every body thinks Del aware is a big northeastern sta te with m ajor corporat ions i t is. Bu t the fact is of la rgest town of my state is 89 000 people next largest 2 0 and after tha t everythi ng ranges from 1500 to about 7000 people an d what I find that's where the heart and so ul relations when al l of you. I'm not be solic itous when all of you you ge t to reach out to neighbo rs you may not ev en particularly l ike when you're in trouble you in fact are there when people have a probl em treat each other with respec t you th ink honesty matters y ou think dignity is important word you think that we i n fact as Americans have an obligatio n to kind of l ive the American creed we don't always do it don't always do it we don't al ways live up to that's who we a re. That's why I believe that is so important that r ural Am eri ca and sma ll town America have an opport unity to ec onomically flourish bu t it's g oing to be very b rief and make 3 basi c s tatements to you and then open to question s if that 's alrigh t with for one no.

Present Democrat or Repu blican Party when t here's not an incumbent president but I don't think there' s any time you've had a more serious resp onsibility in t his. Because I'm runn ing not because any one of us were ru nning for the nomination because the man who occupi es the White Hous e.

But they're very much in jeopardy I'm not going to it now but mocking and making fun of a sittin g president I'm still so Ameri can th at's not who w e are that's not who we ha ve to be and so folks let me just so yo u know how. He. And t he next president wh oev er he o r sh e is God willi ng he's going to hurt a nation that's divided. And d eliberately divided by t his man s etting race r eligion and cream color against on e another from the very beginn ing as well as going to head a world in disarray when Burl eson thugs an d the tyrants around th e world were poking a fin ger in the eye while a llies and our friends w ho were going to need for our collective security o therwise we'll have to be the world's police man and we're not going to do that we have to be able t o be in a positi on to be able to put t ogether coalitions to ta ke out ISIS For exam ple I was part of what putting to gether a 16 nation coalition to do tha t we're not allowed t o stand enormous around the wor ld but we need to we need to leave man y people to loo k at us and say yes the United State s roots and we're prepare d to follow we're prepared t o work with them and so folks let me conclud e I want to say I want to go to questions i s t hat you know I think i t really is i mportant wh en you're stor ing the soul of this c ountry and I really mean it that 's not hype rbole I g enerally men who only rar think of wha t we always been made fun o f internationally an d that is that thos e tha t those quoting American values ho ne sty truth decency We ll guess what the world knows that to be t rue about us that's why they've b een w illing to follow us but it's very much in jeo p ardy righ t and folks i n addition to that you look out an d what are we doing we' r e tha t's the preside n t he does this a ll the time. So froz en Trump I'm busy O k reminder in the. Calls every time I 'm going to. But Rossley. Th e 7 nation reflects. Because a lot to do with whethe r or not the American people are going to be able to be unified again we have to unify this c ou ntry. I know some of my colleagues think that's not possible wit h the curr ent notify the c ountry we're in deep trouble when don't trouble but I bel ieve we can so much prose it 's going to have to be able t o stand on a world stage on day one and d ouble story here she can put the nati on b ack together a gain by bringing the public is no inde pende nce to common ground on many things as we ll as learned the world whe n I as sumed the stora ge the world stage Ja nuary 20th 20 21 well knows how t o know who th ere are w ho that person is and I got to know that pe rson not ion of they ar e friend and foe and so folks. That's why I'm running th at's why I'm running for president of States of America to the broader now sense restore the sort of this country and so folks let me I am of that and take any questions you all have I should cherish on your mind thank you. Yeah. Really . But the important p oint was hosp itals no t only the state but all across Ameri ca I was ra tional and I will hold it why many places where you know 60 percent of t he trauma deaths occ ur in th e America you know abo ut 20 per cent of th e populatio n 60 perce nt acut e occur in Ame rica where I lac k of access to mental acces s to hospital s or the services and sort of a lonely so it's happening everywh ere in America an d I suspect he re as well right he re is that the Rambus Mr su pposed to come are not comin g quickly enough and they're not enough th at's right in the Biden Af fordable Car e Act which I'm talkin g about is taki ng Obamacare and both n eed on Obam acare not dismantl ing it because and I p rovide for funding addi tional fu nding for hospitals not even if they don't have beds availa ble to provide for e mergency service s and to be ru de and boorish to. Post on the Medi caid Medicare because th ey can't get under t he reimburs ement for Medicare and t hey can't be timely it' s not timely enough and so when I want to do with anybody who wa nts to know give me a copy of the detail of the playing rather than the one I would not but but. Make sure we find That in this to w n. But. Th at's a plus. Because in fact qu ickly. This is in thi s book right now right is m ore likely some of the soon er you determine what it is and where it i s and how you have to d o that and the nurse I can tell God love it. I f there is only one was on the other woman. I know They came decorated hero i n the war a nd women up w ith. Knowing that they onl y had months t o live inc red ibl e man and joking Russians a re absolut ely incredib le doctors much un les s. You want it and I was in i.c.u. they come a nd look at th at you 're not goi ng to. Monit or is up t here you go sla ck you're not but afte r all I don't care if you're not i n pain a nd my nurses no w from a com e in my ear they talk to me and change my pill or read you the sense of not only about me fr om for exam ple but now. I have. That you can carr y around from t own to the to wns I found the most on m y proposal so people do n't have to wait wait in the comma nd of the services that's the biggest. Everything To try to figure out there's so mu ch me can do and I pr omise yo u that is one of my classes wh en I get in to office and I'm going t o continue the moo n shot in a way that's going to make funda ment al change but. Ask me that qu estion but I fe el. Th ere. Are also a copy of my health care plan . I ha ve a question concern i ng. The fu nd ing of the heal th c are when I lived in Washin g ton State I bought it in th e m ar ketpla ce and it became more a nd more difficult we had fewe r and fewer providers of insura nce and what they ended up doing was wh ere they would provide i n some areas of Wa shington they refused in. Our count y because they said t hey had too many elderly and sick peo ple wh ich is w hy you want insurance anyway but what they started doing is saying no you they cost us too muc h money and so this wa s on the mar ketplace so how is this goi ng to be funded if b asically the people who buy in the m arketplace or can't afford to buy elsewhe re or don't h ave it or a re the sickest a nd the elderly becau se t hat's th e problem that I saw thos e were all communit ies that you know they didn't have a lot of jo bs so the youn ger peop le would move out of them and what you would have left were a lot of people who wer e older and ha d no incomes and so t hen the y said we're not go ing to provide their interest you know the insurance because it costs us too much so. drug prices are going to come down becaus e we're going to change the w a y. We're go ing to. Over the side o f the public of all this now a s if taken away. In a prison. D rug. With the drug comp anies o n the prices of what they're goin g to charge for other drugs we're going to . Have a significa nt ret urn on your invest m ent. 1 21520 p ercent on your inv estment but you can. Run and some of t he boa rd at a church that in fact are made up of experts from around the co untry many seri ous drugs. The pri ce t hat you can charge for. D rugs come up with has been approved b y the f.d.a. have that patent that inflows should . Have don e something considerab ly different with the d rug bef ore. Y ou so I would st op and nothing but the expo n enti ally. Fact cost peo ple a lot o f this co sts. $ 20000.00 a year for g odsake and through the insura n ce company. Crossed. Not a sin gle thing ha s chan g ed. For the drug excep t. That ha s no other option but to try to purchas e the drug f rom there for mo st happy people are up to. Treat it and people are d ying becau se of it s o. That we can afford t o make it if in fact the dr ug companies sold are not going to participate in we're going to we're going to put from abroa d anything it's in fact f act because drug prices are can cert ainly cheape r with the sa me drugs in other countries in ot her places so we've got t o make it clea r we got to play fair into the system and insurance companie s they're going to be held accountable to no other ways but I have I'm happy to send you some of thi s stuff but I know I can tell by th e looks on some of the kids' faces it's kin d of glazing over right now. The boat gu y Th ank you Mr Vice Presi dent my name is Ethan Rezai I'm a high school senior her e at New Hamp ton and I just turned 1 8 yesterd ay. To plac e my question is strictly rush recession s have occurred ar ound eve ry 10 to 15 years and if you were elected in 2020 and this trend continues and using your experiences from previous administrati on that has gone through a recession w hat would you do t o lessen the impa ct of s.s. and wou ld have on people my age tha t are in college and p repa ring to enter the wor kforce from some que stions and tell you what you're going to school next year. You. Know. it was a different kind of recession it was a funny recessi o n. Has been cyclical w hat kind of talk about what you're talking a bout. H appened there's been cyclical recessions b ased upon ex penditures a whole range of o ther things but they've not been financial in the s ense that they wer e brought on by the b anks and brought on by the fin anci al industries this is a different a diffe rent kind of rec ession but there's sti ll a lot of now. In f act t hat. Are going to stimulate well. Maybe Re member it's ridiculous for the Senate a year. Ago. To change so it can pas s . The psychiat r ist. Which is a very conservative ec onom ic base pointed o ut that. D e pre ssion. And the God of every s i ngle sol itary. I spoke. To over 150 I spoke. are a rational choice to sa y a domest ic policy that can s top Ko nami growth of t hings that we h ave to do. And turn op portunity to grow t he economy because room and somethin g. T hat is the 1st off it's g oing to do is goi ng to mark my words about American Idol cultu re those are going to do it and the y're going to make money as th ey do we still gro wth so that when. What happens is I forget which one of you said something what ha ppened. Up in the decider got a roof changed the law saying that if you ar e brutal ly beaten and beat up by your sp ouse and your comm unity yo u know that doesn't qualify you fo r asylum i n America this is a ro om the y soon ripped children from th e arms of their mot hers and f athers and broken up familie s which i s not what we've done is not what we've done in the past as a na tion and so the 1s t thing I'm g oing to do is make sur e that a ll of those so-called dreame rs and thos e killed soon in fact came across the border or flown on a visa with their parents and in fact oversold the visa to push now tha t there is a dreamer's pro gram but there's also a pr oblem and so we' re not going to separate f am ilies or our families to s tart other robber That's from the stuff that's comi ng through is coming thr ough legal por ts of en try the b ad stuff and those who ar e alleged terrorists a nd the like that's coming through the physical ports of entry so it made sense to put up a wel l just because it made it 1st triple to come thr ough a legit imate port of entry but so m ethi ng. That happene d to so me kid legalization for the 11000000 undocumente d he r e. Or the over genera tion of immig rants has had t o do it. You know learn the citizenship as you go throu gh the process and you earn a p assage to the store a nd if you're turning out a felony or committing a felon y to cr imes while you're her e in fact you don't get to stay here but out of the one Jo e I am al o ne. I will r e tire. And I' m kind of unique because I'm not a R e pub lic an. I'm Ok. I've g ot 2 pro ble ms with you one is your game ther e's a reason I am her e to work for th e job I need th rough me and I kn ow damn well I don't have the mental faculties I did when I was 30 years ago all right the oth er Forget that stuff that's all. The woman I got I go t a quest ion I'm not sure answer w rong or Trump. Has been messing aro und in your cre w and over t here holdi ng her for a route for them to come out saying th ey're going to inve stig ate you we know all about t hat Graham and he's he's no back bone we know that for t hat but you were on the other hand se nt y our son river there to get a job and w or k for a gas compan y that he had no experience with gas o r nothing in order to get access to the tr uth for the president so you're you're selling access to the president just like he was. So you. to go other places and so they're stil l going to do we hav e t o not only back to reest ablish standards we had to be gin with when we le ft office and sig nificantly add to them an d that i s for example. In th e state of Ohio unders tand about trying to do in the state flood whethe r it's a barrier up a foot and a half or 2 feet it means that you're not g oing to have the Road Block Gr ant can't get into a community where thin gs flood out.

CSPANJB812201935	Joe Biden	2019-12-08	Joe Biden Campaign Event in Nashua, New Hampshire	"GOOD MORNING, NASHUA, THANK YOU FOR TURNING OUT, GREAT TO SEE YOU. A SNOWY MORNING. SOME HOLIDAY CHEER GOING ON. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A BREAK FESTIVITIES TO BE HERE TO PICK THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THESE FOLKS ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU VET CANDIDATES, TALK TO CANDIDATES, HAVE THEY SHOVELED YOUR LAWN LATELY. SO I'M SUPER EXCITED AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE TWO OF MY FAVORITE CANDIDATES OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SECRETARY JOHN KERRY IS WITH US, FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE 2008 CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] SECRETARY KERRY IS A FRIEND TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, VETERANS, WOMEN, ENVIRONMENTALISTS. WE WERE PROUD TO SEND HIM ON HIS WAY TO THE NOMINATION. AND JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] LIKE MANY OF YOU I HAVEN'T MADE MY FINAL DECISION BUT I'M EXCITED TO HAVE HIM IN THE HOUSE AND ROOM TODAY, GIVE HIM A BIG APPLAUSE, WELCOME HIM, HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, HE HAS BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND SAVING OUR PLANET AND SECURITY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN THIS TIME THAT WE ARE ALL FACING RIGHT NOW, HE WILL BRING DIGNITY, HE WILL BRING HONOR, HE WILL BRING COURAGE AND HE WILL BRING RESPECT BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WELCOME JOHN KERRY AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] IT'S SUNDAY MORNING, YOU SLEPT YESTERDAY. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GRANITE STATE, A SECOND HOME FOR ME. I HAVE TWO SECOND HOMES, IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER] I LOVE THIS STATE. GROWING UP, I HAVE GREAT MEMORIES OF VISITING HERE CLIMBING RATTLESNAKE, GETTING UP THE HIGHWAY THERE TOWARDS SOME OF YOUR BLUE ICE YOU GET TO SKI ON SOMETIMES. AND HIGH SCHOOL IN CONCORD WHERE I WOULD RARELY LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING OF THE HOCKEY SEASON ON THE BLACK ICE AND HOW THE ICE DOESN'T EVEN FREEZE. SO IT'S HARD TO DO TODAY, BUT I LOVE THE PRIMARY TRADITION OF THIS STATE. NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU VOTED FOR ME. IT GOES FARTHER BACK THAN THAT. WHEN I WAS 24 YEARS OLD, STATIONED ON THE OTHER OF THE EARTH, WHEN RADIO BROADCASTS AND WEEKS OLD NEWSPAPERS IN A MAIL POUCH THAT FINALLY GOT TO US, SHARED WITH ME MY IDEALIZED INTRODUCTION TO THE PHENOMENON OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. JUST 40 DAYS AFTER ONE OF MY VERY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN COLLEGE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS NO LONGER JUST A PLACE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE WINTER OF 1968, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. SOME OF YOU MAY OR MEMBER THAT CLOSELY. LEGIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE MY AGE, AN ARMY OF KIDS FOR PEACE, CARRYING PAMPHLETS WHILE I WAS CARRYING A GUN 1000 MILES AWAY, JUST KIDS KNOCKING ON DOORS, THE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY BRIGADE WE CALLED THEM. THEY PROVE THEMSELVES POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SEND A MESSAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT LYNDON JOHNSON COULDN'T BE PRESIDENT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF VIETNAM. IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, IT WAS PALPABLE. AND YES IT DESERVES TO BE APPLAUDED BECAUSE YOU DID IT. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS A GRASSROOTS PRAIRIE FIRE AND THANK , AND A GREAT LESSON FOR ME AND THE POWER PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED , WE NEED NOW. 36 YEARS LATER IN MY OWN , AND MY OWN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, NEW HAMPSHIRE TOPPING OF THE LESSON OR TWO. SOMETIMES THE BEST LESSONS FRANKLY WITH THOSE LEARNED THE HARD WAY. TOWN HALL MEETINGS WHERE THE AIR CRACKLES WITH SKEPTICISM. IN 2003 IT'S NO SECRET AS WE CAME INTO DECEMBER, MY CAMPAIGN WAS STRUGGLING A BIT AND I REMEMBER YOU ALL REMEMBER UP THE HIGHWAY TOWARDS FRANCONIA, THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN. WELL A REPORTER WROTE I LOOK LIKE THE OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAIN. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE HALF OF IT FOLKS BECAUSE NO SOONER DID HE WRITE THAT I LOOKED LIKE THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT THE OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAIN CRUMBLED AND FELL SO I DID NOT THINK THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD METAPHOR. BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU ALL SAW THROUGH THAT, WE SAW THROUGH THAT. WE FOUGHT ROOM FOR ROOM, JIM FOR GYMNASIUM, FIRE HALL FOR FIRE HALL AND YOU LISTENED. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. I DIDN'T , YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND YOU REALLY LISTEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS STATE GIVES PEOPLE A LOT OF CHANCE TO PROVE THEMSELVES. YOU ARE ALSO CHUFFED , TOUGH JUDGES. YOU OUGHT TO BE, YOU BRING THOSE NOTEBOOKS MEET PEOPLE A BUNCH OF TIMES, YOU WRITE DOWN THE COMPARISON, YOU CARE, YOU REALLY CARE. BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY GOES BEYOND JUST THE PRIMARY VOTE NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO YOU CARRY THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND I LEARNED THAT THE DECEMBER AND JANUARY DOESN'T BRING UP THE BLACK ICE OCCASIONALLY, IT KICKS OFF DECISION TIME. THE MOMENT WHEN YOU GET THE CENTER STATIONED ON THE COURSE TO PRESIDENT, THE STRETCH RUN TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. AND FOLKS, THAT IS WHEN I LEARNED PEOPLE REALLY BUCKLE DOWN AND MAKE A DECISION. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DECISION IS? WHO CAN BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHO , [APPLAUSE] AND NOT JUST IN THEORY, BUT WHO CAN GET ELECTED. WHO CAN WIN THE RACE? WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND GET THE JOB DONE. HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE ARE ON THE FIRST STEPS RIGHT NOW BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF THROWING THAT WRECKING CREW OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND PUTTING SOMEBODY IN THERE WHO'S GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. I AM NOT HERE FOR ANY OLD REASON, I'M HERE BECAUSE I KNOW TO MY CORE AND MY GUT AND IN MY HEART, IN MY MIND, I'VE SEEN IT AND WORKED WITH THIS MAN, I KNOW JOE BIDEN IS THE PERSON WHO CAN BE DONALD TRUMP AND BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AND GET THE JOB DONE. [APPLAUSE] WE SPENT 24 YEARS TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE ONLY TEAM THAT HAS BEEN MORE EFFORT COOPERATING THAN US WAS DONALD TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. SO LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR, I AM NOT HERE, I'VE KNOWN HIM, WE GO BACK TO 1971 IN THE ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATIONS AND ALL THE EFFORTS WHEN WE DID CHANGE THE WORLD. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN HIM SO LONG THAT I'M HERE, IT'S BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN HIM SO WELL. I KNOW THIS MAN AND I ALSO KNOW HAVING AT THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING OUR NATION AROUND THE WORLD. I KNOW THAT THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE AND THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH IT, OUR DEMOCRACY IS NOT WORKING THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE. TOO MANY DISENFRANCHISED, TOO MANY PEOPLE SEPARATED FROM THE UPPER END OF THE UPPER LEVEL. AND ANY COUNTRY THAT SEES 51% OF ALL OF ITS EARNINGS GO TO 1% OF HIS PEOPLE IS LIVING WITH AN UNSUSTAINABLE POLITICAL EQUATION AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT LIKE JOE BIDEN TO CHANGE THAT. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED AS SECRETARY OF STATE IS IF THE UNITED STATES IS ABSENT, OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T JUST AUTOMATICALLY STEP UP TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE, I THINK MADELEINE ALBRIGHT TOLD , CALLED IS THE INDISPENSABLE NATION. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHILE JOE BIDEN AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR NATION. ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WHERE WE SET UP FOR FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY WHERE WE STOOD UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE FRANCHISED AND HAVE A VOTE. REVOLUTION AFTER REVOLUTION IN THE MIDEAST, WAR IN PLACES WE DIDN'T ASK FOR. AFGHANISTAN WERE WE PUT TOGETHER A HUGE COALITION TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR NATION. ISIS, WHERE WE PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION OF 68 PLUS NATIONS TO DEFEAT ISIS. THEN RESTORE OUR SENSE OF RULE OF LAW. MY FRIENDS, WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. IT'S WHY IT STARTED THE NEW EFFORT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS LITERALLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACE BECAUSE IT IS EXISTENTIAL. SCIENCE TELLS US THAT IT IS TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT TO THE ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE SCIENCE HE IS READING, BUT BELIEVES THE SCIENCE HE IS READING. [APPLAUSE] THE SECOND CRISIS IS TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY BUT THE SOLUTION OF THAT IS WE BEAT HIM. THIS SOLUTION CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE US , THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY BIG, BUT NOT REALLY THAT COMPLICATED FOLKS. SOLUTION IS ALREADY HERE, IT'S CALLED ENERGY POLICY. YOU START TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES, WE CAN WIN THIS WAR, WE CAN WIN THIS BATTLE. SO WHO CAN BRING THE PUBLIC? A QUESTION NOW IS WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE, WHO HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS. WHO HAS THE GRAVITAS AND CREDIBILITY. THE LIFT TO ON DAY ONE BE ABLE TO BRING TO THE TABLE ALL THE AUTOMAKERS AND GET THEM TO ACCELERATE THE RATE AT WHICH WE MOVED TO ELECTRIC. SOMEONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES TO THE GOVERNORS, CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES OF OUR NATION TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WE'VE EVER HAD. TO BEGIN TO TRANSITION FOR OUR COUNTRY THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE A SMART GRID AND BEGINS TO ALLOW US TO USE THE ENERGY. THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS MISSING TODAY IS LEADERSHIP QUEST , LEADERSHIP. THE WILL TO DO THIS. I WATCHED THIS GUY CREATE WILL WIN THERE WASN'T ANY AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP WHEN THERE WASN'T ANY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE REALITY OF WHAT THIS ELECTION REALLY MEANS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE AND THEY ARE THERE FOR THE TAKING AND THE MAKING IF WE DO OUR JOB. THIS IS NOT SCARY. THE ONLY THING THAT SCARY IS THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY AND TO QUALITY CHINESE HOAX RATHER THAN LEAD THE NATION TO THE TABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE BRING WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO BUYS INTO THE REALITY THE GREATEST MARKET THE WORLD IS EVER KNOWN IS THE ENERGY MARKET. 4.5 BILLION USERS TODAY. IT'S GOING UP TO 9 BILLION USERS OVER THE COURSE THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IT'S ALREADY A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET, ALREADY IN AMERICA THE FASTEST GROWING JOB IS SOLAR POWERED TECHNICIAN. THE SECOND-FASTEST JOB, WIND TURBINE TECHNICIAN. FAR MORE THAN THERE ARE INVOLVED IN THE COAL INDUSTRY AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF COAL ARE TODAY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT TO UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE OF OUR NATION IS TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THIS CRISIS AND TO MAKE AMERICA, TO MAKE IOWA A PLACE WHERE YOU BECOME THE SAUDI ARABIA OF WIND POWER, NEW HAMPSHIRE PRODUCING THE TECHNOLOGIES, MAYBE EVEN THE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES WHERE WE TAKE CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF THE AIR AND PUT IT TO USE. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT EFFORT IN THAT LIKE JOHN KENNEDY ASKED US TO PUT TOGETHER TO GO TO THE MOON. NO BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THAT AND I WANTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THERE ON DAY ONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO CATCH UP FOR LOST TIME. THIS IS THE MAN TO DO THAT AND YOU HAVE TO HELP US GET THERE. I KNOW HOW TO HAVE SURE WORKS. [APPLAUSE] , I KNOW HOW NEW HAMPSHIRE WORKS. [APPLAUSE] IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT NEVER HAS IT BEEN MORE IMPORTANT WHETHER PRESIDENT WHO GENERALLY , GENUINELY WORKS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS OUR COUNTRY. TOO MANY PEOPLE FIGHTING THAT MAKE UP FOR THE LOST GROUND OF 2008. WHICH BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BROUGHT US BACK ON THE BRINK OF THAT CRISIS. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE TODAY IS I UNDERSTAND JOE BIDEN, FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, GROW UP UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES, WHAT IT MEANS TO PAY THOSE BILLS, WHAT IT MEANS TO FIND A JOB. HIS OWN FATHER HAD TO MOVE TO DO THAT. THIS IS A MAN WHO COMES FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, WILL FIGHT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. NOT SOMEONE NEW COMES DOWN ON A GOLDEN PLATED ESCALATOR AND PROMISES TO GET RID OF A SWAMP WHICH HE FEEDS WITH MORE ALLIGATORS THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] SO CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT, EXPERIENCE, WISDOM, MUSCLE MEMORY, JOE BIDEN IS LIKE THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. FUN TO WATCH, FUN TO WATCH THE PROMISE AND POTENTIAL OF YOUNG QUARTERBACKS, BUT IN FEBRUARY, I LIKE HAVING AN EXPERIENCED QUARTERBACK LIKE TOM BRADY CALLING THAT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN CHAIRMAN BIDEN BECAME VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, HE DIDN'T JUST HAND ME A GAVEL. HE HANDED ME A LEGACY OF GETTING THINGS DONE WITH INTEGRITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP. OF SHARED EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAD TRAVELING LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES AND I'VE SERVED ON WITH ALL BUNCH OF PEOPLE, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE CHAIRMAN OF ANY COMMITTEE. BUT I BECAME CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE WHEN HE BECAME VICE PRESIDENT AND THEN I REMEMBERED IN 2008 WHEN RUSSIAN TANKS ROLLED IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRY CALLED GEORGIA, IT WAS CHAIRMAN JOE BIDEN WHO IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP THE PHONE, HE DID NOT PICK IT UP TO ASK FOR A PERSONAL FAVOR TO DO ANYTHING WITH AN ELECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, HE PICKED UP THE PHONE TO FIND OUT WHAT AMERICA COULD DO TO HELP THE PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY AND THAT COUNTRY SURVIVE. [APPLAUSE] HE DIDN'T STOP WITH A PHONE CALL. HE GOT ON A PLANE RIGHT AWAY AND FLEW OVERNIGHT AND SAT ON A HILLTOP IN GEORGIA WITH THAT PRESIDENT OF OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY AND HE MADE IT CLEAR, THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH THE FORCES OF FREEDOM, NOT THE DARKNESS OF DICTATORSHIP. [APPLAUSE] SO JUST THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN RUSSIAN STOOGES IN FAKE UNIFORMS ROLLED IN EIGHT YEARS LATER, ROLLED INTO UKRAINE, CANDIDATE TRUMP ALSO HAD A TEST. IN HIS FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO SAY IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. BASICALLY HE SAID VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN HAVE CRIMEA. ASK YOURSELVES WHEN THEY DO IT AGAIN SOMEWHERE, WHO IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO CALL? WHAT FRIENDS DOES HE HAVE IN THE WORLD BESIDES KIM JONG-UN AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. AND I'M PRETTY SURE KIM JONG-UN ACTUALLY UNFRIENDED HIM THIS PAST WEEK. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] SO FOLKS, WE NEED A PRESIDENT LIKE BOTH , LIKE JOE BIDEN, WHO KNOWS IN HIS GUTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS ADVERSARIES AND BASHAR ADVERSARIES AND ALLIES. NOT A PRESIDENT WHO IS OPENLY MOCKED AND LAUGHED AT BY OUR CLOSEST ALLIES IN THE WORLD. SO PERSONALLY DISTURBED LIKE A CHILD AT A PLAYGROUND THAT HE PICKS UP HIS MARBLES AND GO HOMES , GOES HOME, SLINKS AWAY AND STARTS TWEETING IN SOLITUDE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO LEADS WHERE THOSE LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES RESPECT TO THEM, LIKE THEM, UNDERSTAND OUR VALUES, SHARE THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SACRIFICE FOR IN WORLD WAR II, FOR THE WORLD WE BUILT AFTER WORLD WAR II WHICH DESERVES THE SAME LEADERSHIP TODAY AS WE GAVE IT THEM , GAVE IT THEN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE STANDS NEXT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN A FEW FEET , A FEW FEET AWAY, HE DOESN'T LOOK AT HIM AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK OUR ELECTION. AND THROW THE ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND NET WORTH OF THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE BUS. IN ONE FELL SWOOP. I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY? FOR THAT STATEMENT ALONE I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY ANYONE WOULD GIVE THIS PRESIDENT FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S GET DOWN TO BASICS HERE. I WOULD LOVE TO BE, AND I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS ALL DAY LONG. THAT'S HOW I LEARNED THE MOST WHEN I WAS RUNNING. WE CAN'T DO THAT TODAY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM MAKING AS CLEAR AN ARGUMENT AS I CAN. A LIFETIME OF SERVICE, I DON'T COME TO THIS LIGHTLY. NOR TO SEE. I KNOW THE VALUE OF EXPERIENCE. SINCE WHEN DID NOT MATTER? YOU ARE GOING TO ASK FOR THE MOST EXPERIENCE CAPABLE PERSON. THIS IS BIG STUFF RIGHT NOW. I'VE SEEN THIS MAN SIT IN THE SITUATION ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TOUGH CHOICES WERE IN FRONT OF US, EBOLA AND AFRICA. WE WERE TOLD A MILLION PEOPLE WOULD DIE IN FOUR MONTHS IF WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT HAVE THE COURAGE TO SEND 3000 PLUS TROOPS TO WEST AFRICA TO HELP BUILD THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER LIFE-SAVING HEALTH CARE. WE DELIVERED THAT AND A TINY FRACTION OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED OVER THE COURSE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE LONELY AND TOUGH DECISIONS. I'M ASKING YOU OVER THE NEXT WEEKS, THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN LIFE BASED ON SOME EXPERIENCE. WHAT I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, JOE WAS AN ALLY FOR THE HARDEST ISSUES. DIPLOMACY TO END THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR THREAT, JOE ARE MEMBERS THIS, WE HAD THE KING OF ARABIA WAS TELLING ME AND I'M SURE HE TOLD THE VICE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO BOMB IRAN. THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT, YOU MUST BOMB IRAN. THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL CAME OVER TO THE COUNTRY AND SAID I WANT PERMISSION TO BOMB IRAN. WILL YOU BACK ME UP? PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD THE INTELLIGENCE AND FORTITUDE TO SAY WE HAVE TO DO DIPLOMACY BEFORE WE TAKE YOUNG AMERICANS AND SEND THEM TO WAR. THAT'S PART OF THE TEST. I KNOW DONALD TRUMP HAS LET THE GENIE BACK OUT OF THE BOTTLE. EVERYTHING WAS FORESEEABLE AND IT WAS FORESEEN. THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF. SO I THINK WHEN ISIS HAPPENED, THEY WERE SWEEPING ACROSS SYRIA. ABOUT TO TAKE BAGHDAD, MOUNTS IN JAR HAD THE IS EDIE'S , HAD THE , THEM ABOUT TO BE WIPED OUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED TO SEND BOMBERS BUT WE DIDN'T JUST SEND AMERICAN BOMBERS, WE BUILD A COALITION. WE GOT THE ARAB COUNTRIES TOGETHER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, ARAB COUNTRIES , SUNNI ARAB COUNTRIES BOMBED SUNNI ARABS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE. THIS GUY WALKS AWAY, PROMISES, RATTLES THE MAN HE SAYS HE LOVES, WHO HAPPENS TO BE THE WORST TYRANT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. I WANT A MAN WITH RACING DECENCY AND STRENGTH WHO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHO WAS A FRIEND AND WHO ISN'T, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. I ASK YOU JUST TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP IS THE DIFFERENCE , THAT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP, I HOPE. [LAUGHTER] HE IS AN INTERRUPTER, A DISRUPTOR, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. THIS IS SERIOUS. THINK ABOUT LIFESTYLE. THINK ABOUT LIFE CHOICES, THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF A LIFETIME. THINK ABOUT A MAN WHO LOST HIS WIFE AND CHILD, TWO KIDS, SURVIVED, DAYS AFTER HE WAS ELECTED. BEFORE HE'S EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. AND HE GETS THROUGH THAT, THINKING I SHOULD NOT GO TO THE SENATE, I'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS. THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN TESTED PUBLICLY. AND SO HAVE HIS SKILLS AS A LEADER. AS A SENATOR, HE STOOD UP OR CRIMINALS. HE PASSED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. HE WROTE ONE OF CONGRESS'S FIRST EVER CLIMATE AGREEMENTS. AGAIN AND AGAIN I SAW JOE FIGHT THE FIGHTS THAT NEEDED FIGHTING AND WOMEN. I SAY TO YOU , AND WIN THEM. I SAY TO YOU VERY SIMPLY, WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOUGHT AND PASSED THE LANDMARK VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WHO STOOD UP AND BEAT THE NRA IN ORDER TO WIN AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN DO WHAT I SAW HIM DO, SOMETHING THAT ELUDED EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE HARRY TRUMAN AND PASS THE BIGGEST HEALTH-CARE REFORM PROGRAM IN HISTORY THAT TODAY, WE PROUDLY CALL OBAMA CARE. [APPLAUSE] AND REMEMBER THAT JOE BIDEN WAS TRUSTED PRESIDENT OBAMA ON EVERY TOP ISSUE. HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. HE HAD PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THAT ACT LITERALLY SAVED US AND BROUGHT US BACK FROM ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. HE WAS DESIGNATED TO FACE DOWN THE PROBLEM OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN POURING IN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. REMEMBER THAT? WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW TO PROTECT FOREIGNERS WITHOUT TRAMPLING ON THE RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND AN ISSUE WHERE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HIM. YOU CAN FIND AN ISSUE WITH ANY OF THE CANDIDATES WERE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ONE OR THE OTHER. BUT UNLESS IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN IS THAT WE ACTUALLY REMOVE DONALD TRUMP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO , [APPLAUSE] WHEN I HEAR SOME PEOPLE DRAW THESE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SOME OF THE CANDIDATES, I MUST SAY TO YOU, I'M TEMPTED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LIKE BUTLER AND GONE WITH THE WIND AND SAY FRANKLY, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. THE DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS DECENT, WHO KNOWS HOW TO LEAD THE NATION, WHO HAS RELATIONSHIPS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, WHO ON DAY ONE CAN BEGIN TO HEAL A WOUND THAT IS BROKEN BECAUSE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE TO PULL IT APART. ALL OVER THE WORLD, PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHO WE ARE TODAY. 16 YEARS AGO, YOU VOTED FOR ME AND I THANK YOU PROFOUNDLY FOR THAT. TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER OF THAT YEAR, WE TURNED NEW HAMPSHIRE BLUE AGAIN. WE CARRIED MICHIGAN, CARRIED WISCONSIN, CARRIED PENNSYLVANIA. WE CAME WITHIN ONE STATE AND SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF VOTES OF DEFEATING A WARTIME INCUMBENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE DID TOGETHER. YOU KNEW THE STAKES THEN, AND THEY ARE EVEN HIGHER NOW IN 2020. I WOULD NEVER COME HERE TO TELL ANYBODY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HOW TO VOTE, THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT I AM WORKING FOR AND WHAT I AM VOTING , WHY I AM VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN. THE WORLD IS STILL WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA. IF HE GETS EIGHT YEARS, THEY WILL BE WONDERING WHO WE REALLY ARE. NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHEN YOU VOTE IN FEBRUARY, DON'T JUST SEND A MESSAGE. SEND US A PRESIDENT. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PUT OUR NATION BACK TOGETHER. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO IS FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO CAN MAKE AMERICA AMERICA AGAIN. SEND US A PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. GOOD TO BE BACK IN NASHVILLE. LET ME START OFF BY THANKING HIM FOR BEING MY FRIEND FOR SO LONG AND ALL THE HARD WORK SHE DOES IN CONGRESS AND BEING WILLING TO STAND BY ME AGAIN. YOU KNOW, JOHN HAS BEEN A FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WE'VE ALSO WORKED TOGETHER IN SOME REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES. I ADMIRE, AND YOU ALL DO, TOO , I AM NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME, BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM WELL. BUT I ADMIRE JOHN FOR HIS COURAGE. WHAT I ADMIRE MORE THAN HIS COURAGE IS IS MORAL COURAGE. THE COURAGE TO COME BACK FROM VIETNAM AND BEGIN THE END OF A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] I'VE NEVER FOUND ANYBODY WITH MORE GUTS THAN JOHN. BUT YOU KNOW, THE EXPRESSION JOHN KENNEDY SAID, MORAL COURAGE IS A RARE COMMODITY THAN PHYSICAL COURAGE. JOHN HAS DEMONSTRATED BOTH. THERE IS OF THINGS THAT JOHN HAS COVERED, HE'S GIVEN THE CREDIT, SOME OF WHICH I DON'T DESERVE BECAUSE JOHN WAS THE GUY IN THE FIGHT IN SOME OF THESE FOREIGN-POLICY ISSUES. WHAT JOHN AND I HAVE INTELLECTUALLY AND POLITICALLY HAS GONE FOR A LONG TIME. YOU CHOSE VERY WELL WHEN JOHN RAN AND LIKE JOHN, I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I DESERVE YOUR VOTE. I'M TELLING YOU I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOOK ME OVER. WHERE I COME FROM, I WOULD KNOCK ON DOORS AND SAY MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR UNITED STATES SENATE. LOOK ME OVER. IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, HELP ME OUT, IF NOT, VOTE FOR THE OTHER PERSON. BUT GIVE ME A LOOK OVER. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO. YOU ARE REALLY THE STARTING GUN IN THE PRIMARY RACE FOR THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENCY. YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OBLIGATION. NOT TO ME, BUT TO YOURSELVES. BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO HERE IN IOWA , WHAT YOU DO HERE IN A PRIMARY, AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IS SET THE TONE FOR WHO IS LIKELY TO BE THE NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YOU ALWAYS TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU REALLY DO. YOU ALWAYS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAS EVER BEEN A MORE SERIOUS VOICE. NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING, BUT BECAUSE OF THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT NOW. I DON'T THINK ANY OF YOU, AT LEAST I DIDN'T, I KNEW HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH, WHEN RIGHT AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, BEFORE THAT, REMEMBER, HE SAID, I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS JOB WOULD BE HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE MEANT IT. HE MEANT IT. FOLKS, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. SO, SO, SO MUCH AT STAKE. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE FROM. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO RATHER THAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT SPECIFIC ISSUES FROM HEALTH CARE TO GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMANITY RIGHT NOW, JOHN TOGETHER A COALITION OF OVER 70 WORLD LEADERS, BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THAT DEAL WITH THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. JOHN AND I AGREED, AND JOHN HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE U.N., THE REASON WE HAVE A PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. THIS GUY PUT ALMOST 200 NATIONS TOGETHER TO SAY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. [APPLAUSE] I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME OF MY CAREER IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DEALING WITH IRANIANS. JOHN WAS THE GUY THAT WAS ABLE TO , JOHN WAS THE GUY ON THE GROUND. PUTTING TOGETHER THE SINGLE MOST INVASIVE REGIME OF INSPECTION THAT HAD EVER BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN ALL HUMAN HISTORY. WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY THE IRANIANS WERE DOING RELATIVE TO TRYING TO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. JOHN WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION OF OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BE ABLE TO PUT A STOP TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND IT WORKS. AND ALONG CAME THE GUY IN THE ART OF THE DEAL. THE ART OF THE DEAL, MY LORD. LOOK WHAT HE DID. AMERICA FIRST NOW MAKES US AMERICA ALONE. AMERICA ALONE. THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO SAY, BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO QUESTIONS, I SAID EARLY ON, I COME OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY STATE HAS THE EIGHT LARGEST BLACK POPULATION OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. THAT EXCITED MY PASSION AND ANGER WHEN I WAS A KID. AND THAT'S WHY I GOT SO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN MY COMMUNITY WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY AFTER WE GOT IN THROUGH SO MUCH AND ELECTED AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO I WAS PROUD TO SERVE WITH, THAT WE WOULD SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA IN 2017, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN, CHANTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE SAME EXACT BILE CHANTED IN GERMANY IN THE 30'S, CARRYING NAZI FLAGS AND TORCHES. I REALLY NEED IT. THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GET HOME. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION. THE HATRED. THE HATRED IN ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF AMERICA. AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED IN THE MELEE. AND THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO SPEAK TO IT AND HE SAID ""THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES."" NO PRESIDENT, NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS GUY HAS QUOTED GEORGE WALLACE WHEN HE MEANT GEORGE WASHINGTON. THIS GUY HAS GIVEN OXYGEN TO WHITE SUPREMACY. DIVIDED THE NATION LIKE EVERYBODY, EVERY SINGLE SCAM ARTISTS OUT THERE HAS DONE WHEN TRYING TO GAIN POWER, DIVIDING US. DIVIDING PEOPLE. THE REASON I HAVE WORKED SO HARD AND SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THERE IS A MORAL CENTER OF WHO WE ARE. WHEN YOU CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS A RIGGED GAME, THEY CAN'T BENEFIT BY PLAYING BY THE RULES, THAT IS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO TAKE IT VANTAGE. FOLKS, , TAKE ADVANTAGE. FOLKS, THE WORDS PRESIDENCY USE MATTER. PEOPLE LISTEN. AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORDS MATTER. A PRESIDENT BY HIS OR HER WORST CAN SEND A NATION TO WAR. IT CAN BRING PEACE, IT CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE OR FALL. AND ALSO, IT CAN APPEAL TO THE DEEPEST, DARKEST ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY AND GIVE THEM OXYGEN. THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. SO I KNOW I INITIALLY WAS CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR, YOU KNOW IT ALL. WE LEARNED IN SCHOOL, WE THINK IT'S ALMOST CORNY SOMETIMES THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S REAL. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. BUT NO LEADER HAS EVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT LIKE WE HAVE NOW. EVERY GENERATION IS OPEN, THE APERTURE OF OPPORTUNITY, MORE AND MORE AND MORE. THIS GUY SHUT IT DOWN. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO. NOT ONLY FOR OUR SAKE AT HOME, BUT INTERNATIONALLY. RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WHEN HE SAID THOSE THINGS, REMEMBER, ANGELA MERKEL, THE CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY WONDERED OUT LOUD WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICA. OTHER LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD SAID WHAT IS GOING ON? WE HAVE ALWAYS LED NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. FOLKS, WE HAVE LED BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHAT UNITED THE WORLD. NOW IT'S IN JEOPARDY. FOLKS, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OF YOU. WHOMEVER THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IS, GOD WILLING. AND THE REASON WHY IT HAS GOT TO BE ALL OF YOU, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE RHETORIC, THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO SOME DEGREE OF CIVILITY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO NOT ONLY BEGIN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THEY HAD BETTER BE READY ON DAY ONE. THEY HAD BETTER BE READY ON DAY ONE. THE REASON I'M RUNNING IS BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. NOT IN SPITE OF IT. BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. WITH THE HELP OF AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET MORE MAJOR LEGISLATION PASSED THAN EVERYBODY ELSE RUNNING AND THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC FIELD. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE. I DON'T TREAT ALL REPUBLICANS AS MY ENEMY. THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. ANY REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT VOTES TO SAY THAT THIS GUY IS BETTER THAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN, GOD ALMIGHTY. I PRAY FOR THE RETURN OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND ON THE WORLD STAGE AND ON DAY ONE, WHEN HE OR SHE SPEAKS,KNOW HE KNOWS WHO HE IS AND WHO THAT PERSON IS. KNOWS THAT OUR ALLIES CAN SPEAK WHEN HE OR SHE SAYS SOMETHING, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA'S WORD. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT. FOLKS, WHY DON'T I STOP, I'M MORE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WAS ON YOUR MIND. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. IT REALLY IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT MY KIDS AND MY GRANDKIDS. IT IS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE, MOST UNIQUE NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BECAUSE WE WERE BUILT ON AN IDEA. UNLIKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY. AND THAT HAS TO BE RESTORED. SO AS MY MOTHER FROM SCRANTON WOULD SAY, HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. FIRE AWAY, RAZOR HAND. GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I SAY IS I WOULD TURN AND I WOULD SAY EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET ME TELL YOU WHO I AM. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. [APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, YEAH. REALLY AND TRULY, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. I NEED TO LET THEM KNOW WHO I AM, WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. LIES. I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT I LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO I AM. [APPLAUSE] WHAT IS MY POSITION ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE. WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT AND THERE IS SOME EARLY RATIONALE FOR A. THE REASON WE GOT THE CONNECTICUT COMPROMISE WAS BECAUSE STATES LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND DELAWARE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE VERY SMALL POPULATIONS, WHO HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION, AND NO ONE WOULD SHOW UP. I STILL THINK THERE'S VALUE TO IT, BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH US GOING BACK AND CONSIDERING. I'VE TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR OVER 21 YEARS AND I THINK IT'S WORTHY TO BE CONSIDERED LOOKED AT AGAIN IN A SERIOUS WAY BY SCHOLARS. TO SEE IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY CHANGE OR ALTERATION TO IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER, IT IS WHAT IT IS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT WAS NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THERE IS AN ELECTORAL COLLEGE, YOU ALL WOULD NOT GET A CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU WOULD GET TO VOTE, AND I THINK IT REQUIRES , THE WHOLE PURPOSE WAS, IF YOU REMEMBER, IS NOT ONLY TO GET THE CONSTITUTION PASSED, BUT TO BRING DISPARATE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT CONCERNS THEN PEOPLE HAVE IN MISSISSIPPI. NOT JUST ABOUT RACE, ABOUT HOW THE FOLKS IN NORTH DAKOTA HAVE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAN THE FOLKS IN VIRGINIA. THERE IS A REASON WE HAVE TO BRING EACH OTHER TOGETHER IN A FEDERAL SYSTEM. I'M GOING TO START TO SOUND LIKE A LAW PROFESSOR INSTEAD OF A CANDIDATE BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT AND BEAT THEM BOTH WAYS, THE POPULAR VOTE AND THE ELECTORAL VOTE. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST RECKLESS PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY. BY HIS VULGAR MESSAGE AND LANGUAGE. I STROVE TO BE A POLITICIAN BUT MIGHT NOT MAKE IT DUE TO THE ABUSES OF POWER FROM THE PRESIDENT. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO DEAL WITH CHINA, AND HOW WOULD YOU REASSURE THE KURDISH FORCES AND OUR ALLIES OF OUR SUPPORT, AND WOULD YOU EVER ENDORSE A GREEN NEW DEAL? I HAVE A GREEN NEW DEAL. WE DID THE FIRST GREEN NEW DEAL. THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE RATEC MY GROUP B PLUS TO A PLUS. THAT GOES WITH WHAT JOHN SAID. WHO COULD GET IT DONE? THE FIRST THING I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT BEYOND TALKING ABOUT HOW TO JOKE IS TO REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. ALL OVER THE NATION BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT DID WITH THE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, TO BRING THEM TO THE UNITED STATES. AMERICA SAY HERE IS THE DEAL, WE MADE A COMMITMENT. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE UP TO US. BECAUSE WE MAKE UP 50% OF THE PROBLEM , 15% OF THE PROBLEM. WITH REGARDS TO WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, WHAT WOULD I DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN CHINA? THERE'S ONE MILLION MUSLIMS BEING PUT IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN THE WEST. I WOULD AND I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT ON THAT FROM THE BEGINNING. IF WE DO NOT SPEAK OUT, IF WE DO NOT SPEAK OUT ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOBODY ELSE WILL. A FLASHING GREEN LIGHT, GO, GO, GO. LOOK HOW FAR OUT OF HAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN HONG KONG HAS GOTTEN. DO YOU THINK BARACK AND I WOULD HAVE WAITED 10 SECONDS TO TALK ABOUT THAT? WE REMINDED THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT THEY MADE AN AGREEMENT. AND WE GOT THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SAY AND STAND UP FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND SAY YOU ARE WRONG, YOU CANNOT ACT THAT WAY. AND SO YOU GOT TO SPEAK UP. IT'S NOT ABOUT SENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO FIGHT ANYWHERE, IT'S ABOUT MOBILIZING THE WORLD TO SAY YOU WILL PAY A PRICE THAT AT LEAST RELATES TO YOUR REPUTATION AS WELL AS POSSIBLY TRADE AND OTHER AREAS IF YOU CONTINUE TO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS EMPOWERED AND INTOLERABLE. WE'VE GOT TO SPEAK OUT. WE ARE UNDERESTIMATED THE INCREDIBLE POWER, THE MORAL POWER OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT SPEAKS OUT. IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE , LOOK AT MY PHOTOGRAPHER HERE. [APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAYBE WE CAN TALK AFTERWARDS. A LITTLE BIT OF A DISTRACTION. LOOK. WE HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN A MORAL CENTER OF GRAVITY FOR THE WORLD. AND IT HAS IMPACT. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IN VENEZUELA. WE ARE SILENT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? YOU MAY SEE COLUMBIA IN REAL TROUBLE, NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE IN BOLIVIA , BORDER IN BOLIVIA. YOU MAY SEE THINGS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECT OUR PHYSICAL SECURITY. AND WE DON'T SAY A WORD. HE HAS NO NOTION OF WHAT TO DO. MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION TO THOROUGHLY. I'M NOT SURE SHE HAD MUCH CHOICE. LAST MONTH IN NOVEMBER, THE UNITED STATES RESETTLED 1400 REFUGEES AND IN OCTOBER, IT WAS ZERO FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY STARTED KEEPING RECORDS. MY QUESTION TO YOU AND SECRETARY KERRY WOULD BE, WHAT WOULD YOUR POLICY BE FOR RESETTLEMENT, AND WHAT IS AN IDEAL NUMBER OF REFUGEES? THE IDEAL NUMBER IS WHAT WE CAN HANDLE AND WE CAN TOLERATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE REFUGEES WHO ARE GOING FROM OPPRESSION. I AM THE GUY THAT STARTED THE EFFORT A LONG TIME AGO TO DEAL WITH THE RESETTLEMENT OF RUSSIAN JEWS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT. I WAS RAISED BY WHAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY CALLS A RUSSIAN CHRISTIAN. MY DAD WOULD COME HOME FOR DINNER, DINNER WITH ONE TIME WE WERE ALL TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. HE WORKED AND CAME HOME FROM DINNER AND THEN WENT BACK TO WORK. OUR DINNER TABLE, THERE WERE TWO THINGS REQUIRED. YOU HAD TO HAVE PERFECT MANNERS. MY DAD WAS INSISTENT UPON , IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, YOU COULD NOT COME IN WITH A TEACHER AND A BASEBALL HAT ON. YOU NEVER PUT YOUR ELBOWS ON THE TABLE, YOU HAD TO KNOW WHICH FORK TO USE. BUT THE OTHER THING MY DAD WAS ABOUT, OUR DINNER TABLE WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS AND INCIDENTALLY EIGHT. , ATE. YOU THINK I'M JOKING, I'M NOT. MY DAD USED TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS A STUDENT OF THE HOLOCAUST. HE USED TO TALK ABOUT WHY DIDN'T WE BOMBED THE RAILROAD TRACKS? WHY DIDN'T WE DO THIS, WHY DIDN'T WE DO THAT? THE POINT IS THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS PROFOUND IMPACT. LOOK HOW IT CHANGED THE SOVIET UNION, OUR ATTITUDE. WE SAY YOU ARE GOING TO ACT THIS WAY, WE ARE GOING TO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING. AND IT WAS NOT ABOUT NOT GOING TO WAR. WE POINTED OUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WHICH LEADS ME TO THIS LAST POINT ON THIS ISSUE. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT, BUT THERE WAS A POLL IN FEBRUARY OF THIS PAST YEAR. YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAID? IT SAID THAT THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP WAS MORE RESPECTED THAN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE ARE JUST A CLICK ABOVE RUSSIA. WE YIELD OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE POWER. THE POWER OF THE MORAL LEADERSHIP WHEN WE SPEAK UP. LOOK WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO IN AFRICA. BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO DO, BEGINNING TO CHANGE , HE IS A GOOD FRIEND, BY THE WAY. LOOK WHAT ONE HAS DONE. IT HAS CHANGED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHY DOES THAT MATTER? IT MATTERS IN TERMS OF GENERATING LEADERSHIP IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO EMERGE, THAT LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES NOT AS A PROBLEM OR THE ENEMY, BUT AS A SOLUTION. IT MATTERS WHAT WE SAY, IT MATTERS WHAT WE DO, AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE ARE UNWILLING, THAT WE SAID BARACK AND I AND JOHN THOUGHT WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES, AND AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM, TEMPORARY STATUS, LIKE WE SHOULD BE DOING IN VENEZUELA NOW. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. AND I'M THE GUY THAT WROTE THE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE $750 MILLION TO GET THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE ALL THE MOVEMENT FROM CENTRAL AMERICA IS COMING, TO MOVE THEM IN A DIRECTION OR THEY HAD TO REPAIR THE CORRUPTION IN THEIR COUNTRIES TO GET A, HAD TO SET UP SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WE DID NOT GET ANY MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNMENTS, THERE IS NO STREET LIGHTING IN TOUGH CITIES. ELECTRIC JUST BEING ABLE TO TURN ON. YOU FLIP A SWITCH BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE IT. WHAT HAPPENED? THE FLOW BEGAN TO DIMINISH SIGNIFICANTLY. IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYBODY SITS AROUND THE WORLD SAYING I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA, LET'S LEAVE EVERYTHING WE KNOW, LET'S GET UP AND GO TO THE UNITED STATES. WON'T THAT BE FUN? SERIOUSLY. PEOPLE LEAVE WHAT THEY LOVE BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER LIVE THERE BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE ARE THE REPOSITORY OF EVERY LOST SOUL IN THE WORLD. BUT IT DOES MEAN WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A MORAL LEADERSHIP TO GET THE REST OF THE WORLD UNITED. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE CAN. WHEN WE ARE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WITH THE MASSIVE FLOWS FROM AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND FROM LIBYA. WE HAVE BREXIT NOW. WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM IN EUROPE THAT THIS PRESIDENT THINKS SHOULD BE BROKEN ANYWAY. HYDE AMENDMENT. WHEN YOU MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE IS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A FEDERAL SYSTEM, THE AMENDMENT WHICH EVERY SINGLE MEMBER RUNNING FOR OFFICE HAS VOTED FOR, EVERY SINGLE ONE, THE AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO SAY THAT WHEN THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, WHEN YOU WORK CUTTING OFF EVERYTHING FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THEN IT MADE SENSE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. ONCE YOU GO OUT AND SAY MEDICARE FOR ALL OR YOU GO OUT AND YOU POSE WHAT I DO, THAT YOU INCREASE OBAMACARE AND PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION, THEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THAT ROE V. WADE IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO I CAME OUT A WHILE AGO SAYING WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER DOABLE AND USABLE AND NO LONGER A SERIOUS OPTION FOR ANYBODY. YOU HAVE ALL THESE STATES GOING OUT AND NOT ONLY CHALLENGING WHETHER OR NOT, THEY ARE SAYING THAT IT'S A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULED ROE V. WADE, I'M GOING TO SEND THE LEGISLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO PASS AND CODIFY IT. [APPLAUSE] WHERE I COME FROM DELAWARE, TO KEEP PEOPLE STANDING MORE THAN 15 MINUTES, YOU LOSE THEM ALL. BUT LET ME CONCLUDE. LIKE I SAID, JOHN AND I GOT STARTED VERY YOUNG. WE RAN FOR OFFICE WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 20'S. I GOT ELECTED UNITED STATES SENATE BEFORE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I'M THE FIRST SENATOR IN FACT. I WAS ALWAYS LABELED AS THE IDEALISTIC YOUNG GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. I CAN SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TO LEAD THE WORLD THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER. AND I MEAN IT, THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA IS ME W , OE , WOE IS ME. THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. IT IS OWNED BY THE PEOPLE. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY, LIFE ALTERING CHANGE THAT HAS COME OUT OF YOUR RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT IS OWNED BY YOU, MONETIZED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WHETHER IT'S LOS ALAMOS OR ANY OTHER GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. AND SECONDLY, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE OUR WORKERS , I AM GOING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION. SHE'S NOT GOING TO QUIT. LET ME FINISH MY THOUGHT HERE AND I WILL TAKE THIS LAST QUESTION. THIRDLY, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, JOHN AND I HAVE MET EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER. I HAVEN'T FOUND A SINGLE ONE, AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, WOULD NOT TRADE PLACES IN A HEARTBEAT WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE PRESIDENT. A HEARTBEAT. THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST ADVANCED RESEARCH PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN A DEMOCRACY THAT GENERATES ENORMOUS INGENUITY. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT VENTURE CAPITALISM THAT KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE ARE FORGETTING WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE, SOLITARY AIM IN OUR HISTORY THAT WE HAVE NOT SET OUR MIND TO DO THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO A COLLEGE, LITERALLY. NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY THING. MY MESSAGE ISRAEL CLEAR. LET'S GET THE HELL , MY MESSAGE IS REAL CLEAR. LET'S GET THE HELL UP AND TAKEN IT BACK AND LEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. I WILL COME OVER AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EVERY TIME I WALK OUT OF MY GRANDFATHERS HOUSE OF IN SCRANTON, HE WOULD YELL JODEY, KEEP THE FAITH. SPREAD THE FAITH. WE CAN DO ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) SERIOUSLY. IF A WOMAN STRIPPED STARK NAKED, NO MAN WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO LAY A HAND ON HER. PERIOD. BY THE WAY, IF THE WOMAN CAN'T SAY YES, IT IS A VIOLATION AND RAPE. ONE OF THE THINGS I DID [INDISCERNIBLE] I SENT A BRILLIANT WOMAN WHO WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME [INDISCERNIBLE] AT THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE [INDISCERNIBLE] WE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT OFFENSES AGAINST WOMEN MORE THAN REPORTED. [INDISCERNIBLE] HOW CAN THAT BE? TELL ME WHAT YOU MOST WANT AND THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? OVER 50% SPONTANEOUSLY SAID [INDISCERNIBLE] THAT IS WHEN I STARTED TO [INDISCERNIBLE] BECAUSE GETTING MEN ENGAGED. THEY REMAIN SILENT. BY THE WAY, WOMEN REMAIN SILENT. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU DON'T SAY LET ME GET INVOLVED WITH YOU, LET ME GET YOU TO A SUPPORT GROUP IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. STILL, PEOPLE ARE STANDING BACK. NOW YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, TENS OF THOUSANDS, SIGN A PLEDGE IF I SEE SOMETHING, I WILL DO SOMETHING. HE DOES NOT MEAN IF YOU ARE A GUY WEIGHING 140 POUNDS AND A 340 POUND FULLBACK IS MOVING ON A WOMAN, YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING. YOU CAN HOLLER. YOU CAN MENTION SOMETHING. I DO AN AWARD EVERY YEAR FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO STAND UP AS ACTIVE BYSTANDERS BECAUSE THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. [INDISCERNIBLE] IT HAS GONE DOWN SLIGHTLY. WOMEN DROPPED OFF AT COLLEGE THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR, THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING ABUSED IS STILL ONE IN FIVE. THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON WOMEN DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE IS BECAUSE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. THAT IS WHY THEY LEAVE. HARASSMENT. I HAVE A SITUATION WHERE [INDISCERNIBLE] TWO YEARS AGO. A SIMPLE PROPOSITION. IF YOU ARE A FRATERNITY GUY AND GET A WOMAN DRUNK IN YOUR FRATERNITY HOUSE, FOR A LOT OF DEM WOMEN IT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF SCHOOL, WHEN YOU SEE A BROTHER WALKING THAT YOUNG WOMAN UP THE STAIRS, YOU HAVE TO GO, ""NOT IN MY HOUSE."" NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE COMPLICIT IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING. IT IS AMAZING WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. THAT IS THE REQUIREMENT TO SIGN ON. [INDISCERNIBLE] WE HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA [INDISCERNIBLE] DIRTY COAL [INDISCERNIBLE] THEY ARE EXPORTING THAT IS MY POINT. NOT IN OUR COUNTRY. WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO CHINA, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SANCTIONS ON YOUR OPERATION JUST LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IN BRAZIL. IT IS THE RAIN FOREST. IT IS THE AMAZON. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE SENT $200 MILLION. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, WE WOULD ORGANIZE THE WHOLE WORLD. [INDISCERNIBLE] WITH THE HELP OF THE PRESS AND OTHER WAYS. IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL BE AT THE OTHER END OF SIGNIFICANT [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING JOE BIDEN SUPPORTERS AFTER A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE HE APPEARED WITH JOHN KERRY WHO HAS ENDORSED HIM. WE WATCHED THIS WHILE WE WAIT FOR ANOTHER LIVE EVENT ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY. IN A FEW MINUTES, WE EXPECT PRESIDENT CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS TO SPEAK AT SIMPSON COLLEGE AND INDIANOLA , IN INDIANOLA. WE EXPECT THE EVENT TO GET COMPLETELY UNDERWAY WITH THE SENATOR SHORTLY. WHILE WE WAIT, LET'S LOOK AT A SEGMENT OF THIS MORNING'S ""WASHINGTON JOURNAL."" WE WANT TO WELCOME BACK MARC LOTTER, CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST OF THE PRESIDENTS REELECTION. GOOD SUNDAY MORNING.

LAST TIME WE WERE HERE WITH OUR FAMILY, IT WAS THE HOTTEST WEEK OF JULY AND RIDING OUR BIKES WHERE WE LIVE AND STAYED AT THE HOTEL AND BOWLED AND ATE GOOD FOOD AND GOT ON OUR BIKES AND WENT BACK. NICE TO BE HERE IN DECEMBER. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING OUT. AND WE ARE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET JOE AND JILL BID BIDEN 3 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY CAME TO IOWA TO CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. I TRUST THEM AS MUCH TODAY AS I DID THEN. JOE BIDEN WAS ROCK SOLID , GO AHEAD AND CLAP. [APPLAUSE] WHAT DO I WANT FROM THE 2020 ELECTIONS? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY DAY KNOWING THAT I CAN TRUST THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL KEEP IN MIND MY BEST INTERESTS AS THEY DEAL WITH ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD AND I WANT TO LOOK MY GRANDCHILDREN IN THE EYE AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN LOOK UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS THE AMERICAN VALUES THAT WE ALL SHARE. AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY MORNING AND GO ABOUT MY WORK AS AN EDUCATOR AND COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER KNOWING THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN CONGRESS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE US ON THE DOMESTIC LEVEL. AND I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS THAT PERSON TO DO THAT. SO I WANT MY NEIGHBORS , [APPLAUSE] I WANT MY NEIGHBORS, MY FRIENDS, MY COLLEAGUES, MY FAMILY TO RESPECT THE PRESIDENT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. AS I MADE MY DECISION, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN THE TOWN NEAR PERRY IN SOUTHEAST IOWA, ABOUT ANY CLASSMATES AND DIVERSE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE COLLEGE WHERE I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE EIGHTH GRADERS THAT I TAUGHT WHO NOW HAVE EIGHTH GRADERS OF THEIR OWN AND I THOUGHT OF THE TEACHERS THAT I WORKED WITH WHERE I VOLUNTEER AND I THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE WHERE I TRAVELED AS FIRST LADY AND THE PEOPLE IN THE 4TH DISTRICT WHERE I CAMPAIGNED FOR CONGRESS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT DO WE NEED IN A CANDIDATE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT SO MUCH? AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WORD TRUST, WHO DO I TRUST TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE? ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES THAT A CANDIDATE HAS TO HAVE IS COMPASSION. AND I HAVE SEEN JOE AND JILL BIDEN OVER THE LAST 33 YEARS REACH OUT AND COMFORT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN TROUBLE AND LOST LOVED ONES LIKE TOM AND I AND SENT CHILDREN OFF TO THE MILITARY AND DIDN'T COME HOME OR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN NATURAL DISASTERS. AND AFTER A YEAR OF LISTENING TO EVERY CANDIDATE AND I HAVE HEARD THEM ALL IN PERSON AND TOM AND I HELPED PEOPLE AND WE DEVELOPED POLICIES, I DECIDED THE PERSON WHO BEST COULD BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020 IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET MY FIRST PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. IF I DIDN'T HAVE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS, I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS AT ALL. MY DAD WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T CHANGE ME. BUT I MARRIED A GUY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT WHO IS SITTING BEHIND ME HERE AND I SUPPORTED MEN AND WOMEN IN THE IOWA CAUCUS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT I COULD RESPECT DESPITE OF PARTY. AND I'M CHOOSING ROCK SOLID AGAIN THIS QUEER. I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T MADE UP YOUR MINDS YET WILL THINK HARD ABOUT THIS. I HOPE YOU WILL THINK ABOUT NOT WHO YOU LIKE OR WHO BEST FITS YOUR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WON'T COME TO THE CAUCUS OR CAN'T COME TO THE CAUCUS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE OUR INDEPENDENT AND REPUBLICAN FRIENDS A CHOICE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOU ARE MAKING THAT DECISION. AND I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE WHO ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS CHOICE IN 2020 AND I HOPE YOU CHOOSE JOE BIDEN AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO THE PODIUM, OUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO, PERRY. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: WELL, THEY TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE 35 TO 50 PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE TIME. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT TOM AND CHRISTY, I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT FRIENDS. DON'T WORRY, I'M USED TO IT, OK. BABIES , SAY HI. SAY HI. GO AHEAD. DONE IT. OK. VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THAT MAY BE THE MOST INTELLIGENT THING YOU HEAR ALL NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. IT'S A REALLY TOUGH TIME, NOT TOUGH TIME IN TERMS OF TIME, HAVING TIME TO SPARE. WE ARE ONLY A COUPLE DAYS FROM CHRISTMAS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THE TIME. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, WE HAVE BEEN ON A BUS TOUR AROUND IOWA AND NOW GOTTEN TO 23, 24 RURAL COUNTIES AND I GUESS IT'S NOW 12 DAYS. I HAVE BEEN IN ALL 99 AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, BUT TRY TO CATCH AS MANY AS WE CAN. THE FACT IS THAT YOU ALL VIEW IN IOWA, YOU TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LISTENS TO YOU. TO BE VERY BLUNT ABOUT IT, YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHO YOU SEND OUT OF IOWA WITH A PLANE TICKET, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING TO WASHINGTON, YOU ARE GOING , IT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE PRESIDENCY AND CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME A LOOK. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK FOR COMING DURING THE HOLIDAYS. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR OUR FAMILIES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I GET TO GO HOME. TONIGHT I LEAVE HERE, GET TO AN AIRPORT, GO HOME AND I ALREADY HAD FOUR OF MY GRANDDAUGHTERS CALL ME, POP, WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME? THEY LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. THEY WOULD BE AT THE HOUSE AND MY MOTHER USED TO JEAN FINNEGAN WOULD SING AND HAVE THE KIDS GO TO SLEEP AND I CAN'T SING WORTH A DARN. BUT I WOULD PUT THE KIDS WHEN THEY WERE BABIES AND I WOULD SAY REMEMBER, THE FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD IS POP. SO I WORKED VERY HARD. BUT I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM AS YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK HOME AND FINISH THE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO AT HOME. YOU KNOW, FROM THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN, I SAID SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. AND I HAVE SAID THAT WE NEED TO UNIFY THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO INE FILE THE COUNTRY. AND FROM THE MOMENT THE RACE, THAT WAS THE FOCUS. I WAS TOLD THAT IS A BIT NAIVE. AND I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE TRUE NOW. WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH AN IMPEACHMENT. I HAVE BEEN THERE TWICE FOR IMPEACHMENTS AND THERE IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENTS. NOTHING TO CELEBRATE AS ALL. IT IS HARD ON THE COUNTRY AND HARD ON THE PEOPLE. DON'T GET ME WRONG. TRUMP BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF AND HE BASICALLY INDICTED HIMSELF AND THE CONGRESS HAS NO CHOICE. IT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ACT, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY EASIER ON THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN, THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WORK ON UNFILING THE COUNTRY THAN ANY TIME IN MODERN HISTORY BECAUSE IT IS SO DIVIDED AND UNNECESSARILY DIVIDED AND WE HAVE TO UNFILE THE COUNTRY. MY OPPONENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, THEY SAY I'M LIVING IN THE PAST. THEY SAY THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND I LOVE THIS ONE, THEY SAY THAT I'M NAIVE. NAIVE, REALLY? I UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE I THINK BETTER THAN ANYONE IN POLITICS TODAY. THE REASON I SAY THAT THERE IS NO ONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAS MORE REASON TO BE ANGRY WITH THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN ME. AFTER ALL THE LIES AND SMEARS AND ATTACKS THEY HAVE LEVELED AT ME AND TRIED TO RUIN MY ONLY SURVIVING SON AND GONE AFTER MY FAMILY. BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, NOT ABOUT MY FAMILY. IT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. IT'S ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. AND IT IS LITERALLY OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN TROUBLE. I THINK WE ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. I DON'T THINK THAT IS AN EX AGE RATION, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION THAT YOU WILL HAVE EVER VOTED IN THUS FAR. IT TRULY IS. YOU ALL KNOW IT. AND YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR GUT. AND FOLKS IT ISN'T NOSTALGIA, WE HAVE TO RISE ABOVE THE ATTACKS TO DO SOMETHING TO BRING THIS NATION TOGETHER. I THINK IT'S CALLED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP TO TRY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. AND WE DESPERATELY NEED IT. I DON'T SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AROUND AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD HANDS AND SINGING EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE WONDERFUL. BUT, BUT, I SAY IT, IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET ANYTHING DONE, ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THINGS DONE FOR THESE CHILDREN HERE TONIGHT. IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT. AND LOOK, IT'S THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO WORK. IT'S THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES CONSENSUS. NOTHING CAN GET DONE UNLESS YOU ABUSE THE CONSTITUTION AND ENGAGE IN EXECUTIVE POWER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE. IT REQUIRES US TO GET A CONSENSUS THAT WE HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. FOLKS, I'M NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S AUTOMATIC BUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS DESIGNED. OUR DEMOCRACY IS REALLY AT RISK. MAYBE OTHERS ARE WILLING, BUT I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT WE WILL BE PERMANENTLY AT WAR WITH THE OTHER PARTY. WHAT HAPPENS TO US IF THAT'S THE CASE? WHAT HAPPENS TO US? I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT. AND IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND IT'S BECAUSE THAT , IT BEGINS RIGHT HERE, BEGINS RIGHT HERE IN RURAL AMERICA, SMALL TOWN AMERICA. I PUT FORWARD AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO REVITALIZE RURAL ECONOMIES. PEOPLE THINK I COME FROM DELAWARE, BIG CORPORATE ENTITY, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THE LARGEST CITY IN MY STATE IS 86,000 PEOPLE AND ONE LARGE COUNTY AND THE REMAINING TWO COUNTIES ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO VIRGINIA, THE LARGEST CITY IS 21,000 AND AFTER THAT, PROBABLY AVERAGES ABOUT 4,000, 5,000 PEOPLE BUT IT'S AGRICULTURAL BUT IT REPRESENTS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S WHERE , KIND OF WHERE OUR SOUL RESIDES. ALL ALL OF YOU KNOW THINGS, WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN, AND INDEPENDENT. I DOUBT ONE OF YOU WOULD PASS BY SOMEONE ON ONE OF YOUR RURAL ROADS HERE WITH A FLAT TIRE AND NOT STOP TO HELP THEM. NOT A JOKE. I DOUBT IF ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU ARE NOT CRAZY ABOUT THEM, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU TRY TO HELP. HONESTY MATTERS. IT SOUNDS CORNY. HONESTY MATTERS. YOUR WORD MATTERS. YOUR WORD MEANS SOMETHING. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY YOU ARE LITERALLY THE HEART AND THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REBUILD RURAL AMERICA. THE POLICIES YOU HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING, WE HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING, HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING, NOT JUST FOR AGRICULTURE, BUT SMALL TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS TOM SAYS, WHEN WE PUT TOGETHER THIS, MY RURAL PLAN, MY EGG PLAN , MY AG PLAN, IT RECOGNIZES FARMERS, YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A PLAYOFF. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE COMMUNITY. BE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE WORLD FOR REAL. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY , I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN AGRICULTURE WHO IS SAYING, ALL WE WANT, JUST PAY ME OFF. WE WILL BE FINE. I DON'T CARE WHAT I PRODUCE IN MY WORK. AG PRODUCERS SHOULD BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE, THE CUTTING EDGE OF USING LAND CONSERVATION TO STORE CARBON, TO BEGIN THE FRONTAL ATTACK ON GLOBAL WARMING, AND GETTING REWARDED FOR DOING IT, HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY GAIN , YOU WILL BE DOING FAVORS FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AND YOU SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR IT. WE WILL INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BIOFUELS, CREATING MILLIONS, MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS ON THE WAY. OUR ETHANOL PLANTS PROVIDE GOOD JOBS, IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT, AND WE CAN MAKE MORE OF THAT HAPPEN WITH A NEW WAVE OF BIOFUELS. UNLESS WE YIELD TO THE OIL COMPANIES, LIKE WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN. WE WILL INVEST IN RURAL BROADBAND. THINK OF ALL OF THE POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS IN THIS TOWN. ALL THAT POTENTIAL, SOME OF WHICH GOES UNMATCHED, UNMET. THE CHILDREN, IN SCHOOLS AND MY STATE, ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND IN MANY PLACES. YOU MAY HAVE IT HERE. MANY PLACES DON'T. AUTOMATICALLY, THEY ARE DISADVANTAGED. I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY COME FROM. THAT PHONE HAS MORE COMPUTING CAPACITY IN IT THEN TOOK MAN TO THE MOON. LITERALLY, NOT FAVORABLY. YOU EVER WATCH THESE KIDS, HOW THEY CAN HANDLE IT? THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM. BUT SOME ARE PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF ACCESS, THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN URBAN AREAS AND SUBURBAN AREAS. THERE IS SO MUCH POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS HERE. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO INVEST, AS I SAID. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN MAKING SURE NOT ONLY WE HAVE BROADBAND, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE BROADBAND, YOU HAVE ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU CAN TRADE AND WHEN YOU CANNOT TRADE. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO WE ARE LEAVING UNDONE THAT WOULD BUILD THE WHOLE COUNTRY , NOT JUST SMALL TOWN AMERICA, BUT ALL AMERICA. YOU ARE THE SEED CORN, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, FOR OUR REBIRTH AS A COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK, I HOPE, GOD WILLING, IF WE GET ELECTED AND OUR PLAN COMES TO FRUITION, NO LONGER WILL YOU BE FACED WITH CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN BELIEVING THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN MAKE IT IS TO LEAVE HOME, TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET THAT GOOD JOB. THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE. MY PLAN IS TO RESTORE THE PROMISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR RURAL AMERICA, IN RURAL AMERICA. GIVEN THE CHOICE, THEY WOULD RATHER LIVE WHERE THEY CAN WORK, WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A LIVING, WHERE YOU CAN RAISE YOUR FAMILY. AND THAT IS BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. NOW, WE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PROSPERITY OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY LITERALLY DEPENDS ON COMMUNITIES LIKE PERRY. THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PERRYS ALL OVER AMERICA, ALL OVER AMERICA, WITH THE NORMA'S GOING UNMET. BUT QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. , WITH ENORMOUS POTENTIAL GOING ON THAT. BUT QUITE PRICKLY, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD VIEWS US. WHAT THEY THINK OF US. WHETHER WE ARE THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. WHY HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD REPAIRED TO US? WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE POWER WE HAVE, BUT THE EXAMPLE. THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS UNITED THE WORLD. WHY DON'T PEOPLE COME? THEY COME NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS. THEY COME BECAUSE WE, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, STAND FOR THE VALUES OF THE FREE WORLD, AND THOSE YEARNING TO BE FREE, CARE ABOUT. BUT LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT TREATS MADE A LIKE IT'S A PROTECTION RACKET. HE EMBRACES THUGS , THE PRESIDENT TREATS MADE A LIKE AS A PROTECTION RACKET. HE EMBRACES THUGS. , THE PRESIDENT TREATS NATO LIKE A PRODUCTION RACKET. OUR ALLIANCES ARE FRAYING. HIS UNNECESSARY TRADE WAR HAS DECIMATED FARMERS AND PRODUCERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND PARTICULARLY THROUGHOUT THIS STATE. BUT EVEN MORE THAN HIS POLICY FAILURES, WHICH I WILL NOT KEEP TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I GET YOU KNOW THEM, BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT, EVEN WORSE, THE DAMAGE HE HAS DONE TO THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN IT. TO THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. FANNING THE FLAMES, FANNING THE FLAMES OF THE GROUPS HERE AT HOME. FANNING THE FLAMES. THINK ABOUT IT. MY STATE HAS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN AMERICA. WAS SEGREGATED BY LAW. I GOT INVOLVED. I THOUGHT AFTER ALL WE WENT THROUGH, I WAS AT A STREET , I WAS AT A TRAIN STATION WHEN TO BE PICKED UP BY A BLACK MAN AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER AFTER PARTS OF MY CITY HAD BEEN TURNED TO THE GROUND, PARTS OF IT, I WAS WITTING FOR BLACK MEN TO COME 27 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA , I WAS WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 27 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PICK ME UP. I THOUGHT WE MADE IT. I DON'T JUST MEAN BARACK AND I HAD MADE IT. I THOUGHT THE NATION TURNED A CORNER. BUT I WAS WRONG. I DIDN'T REALIZE. HATE DOESN'T GO AWAY. IT ONLY HIDES. HIDES. WHEN IT IS GIVEN OXYGEN TO BREATHE, IT GROWS. A PRESIDENT'S WORDS MATTER. THEY CAN SEND BRIEF WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR LIKE THIS BRAVE MARINE HERE. THEY CAN SEND PEOPLE, THEY CAN BRING PEOPLE HOME. THEY CAN IN WARS. THEY CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE OR FALL. BUT THEY CAN ALSO BREED HATE THAT BRINGS OUT THE WORST ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. THE HISTORY OF AMERICA IS NOT A FAIRYTALE. WHEN YOU GIVE THAT PEOPLE AUTHORITY, THINGS GET TOUGH. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. YOU FIND WHEN YOU HAVE ICE AGENTS RIPPING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS' ARMS AT THE BORDER , MY WIFE, JILL, IS NOT HERE TODAY BECAUSE SHE JUST CROSSED THE BORDER TO MEET WITH PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS, BROWNSVILLE, TO SEE THEM HUDDLED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER, SEEKING ASYLUM. NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE REFUSED TO ALLOW ASYLUM SEEKERS TO AT LEAST COME AND HAVE A HEARING. IT'S DAMAGING US IN WAYS THAT IS HARD TO TELL. THIS IS WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, I BELIEVE WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY, WE CAN OVERCOME IT. BUT IF WE GIVE HIM ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, I BELIEVE HE WILL PERMANENTLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY, AT LEAST SEVERAL GENERATIONS. WE CANNOT AFFORD IN THIS DANGEROUS WORLD WE FIND OURSELVES IN. SO, I AM ASKING YOU, I AM ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER JOINING ME, JOINING TOM AND CHRISTIE, JOINING IOWANS ACROSS THE STATE TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP HIS WALKING PAPERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER COMING OUT AND CAUCUSING FOR ME ON 43RD. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS. I BELIEVE WE CAN DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. , I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER COMING OUT AND CAUCUSING FOR ME ON FEBRUARY THIRD. I BELIEVE WE CAN RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. AND ONCE AGAIN, WE CAN LEAD TO THE WORLD. WE CAN OWN THE 20 CENTURY. THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY , NEVER. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN AMERICA HAS SET ITS MIND TO A GOAL THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO COLLEGE. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY, OLD BUDDY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOTHING, NOTHING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. SO MY DISCREET MESSAGE TO YOU IS THIS. IT'S TIME TO GET THE HECK UP. REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. AND BEGIN TO TAKE THIS OUT THAT BACK. NOW. NOW. NOW. NOW. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO IT. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME INTRODUCE A BUDDY OF MINE. ONE OF THE GREATEST GUYS I KNOW. FORMER GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TOM. . , TOM VILSACK. GOV. VILSACK: IT IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE TO SPEAK KNOWING I HAVE BETWEEN YOU AND GETTING BACK TO THOSE GRANDKIDS. AND YOU WILL HAVE BEEN PATIENT. THE STAFF HAS ASKED ME TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I AM SUPPORTING JOE. WE HAD AN EARLIER EVENTS IN ATLANTA, AND THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AT THE CHURCH, SAW HIM AT THE CHURCH AND AT THE EVENT. IT MAY ME THINK OF MY GRANDSON JAKE. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, HIS PARENTS CAME TO ME. WE HAD GONE THROUGH A FAMILY CRISIS. JAKE HAD HIS FIRST COMMUNION CLASS AND HIS PARENTS ASKED IF I WOULD TEACH HIM HIS FIRST COMMUNION CLASS. I GOT THE MATERIALS. I STUDIED UP. WE HAD EIGHT OR NINE SESSIONS ABOUT RECONCILIATION, CONFESSION, THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I SAID, JAKE, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. THE FIRST THREE ARE ABOUT HOW WE RESPECT GOD AND LOVE GOD. THE LAST SEVEN ARE ABOUT HOW WE RESPECT AND LOVE EACH OTHER. I THOUGHT I HAD TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. I SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE PASTORS AND MINISTERS IN EVANGELICAL CHURCHES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE UPSET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. JAKE SAID, WHY ARE THEY UPSET? WELL, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN IN PUBLIC FAR TOO OFTEN. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE. I WAS GOING TO MOVE ON. JAKE DID NOT HESITATE A MILLISECOND AND HE SAID, AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: THREE QUICK REASONS I AM SUPPORTING JOE AND THE PERSONAL NOTE. JUST, YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST PLANS IN THE WORLD, YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST VISION IN THE WORLD, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET IT DONE. I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE WAS , ALL WORKING WITH THREE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS, TWO DEMOCRATS, ONE REPUBLICAN. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO GET THINGS DONE. THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS RACE THAT HAS THE KIND OF TRANSFORMATIONAL IDEAS, PROGRESSIVE IDEAS THAT ARE DOABLE, THAT HAS THE EXPERIENCE IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET IT DONE THEN JOE BIDEN. THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA NEEDED SOMETHING DONE AND CONGRESS, WHEN HE NEEDED TO CONVINCE A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS, THIS IS THE MAN HE SENT UP TO DO THE JOB BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT JOE HAD THE RELATIONSHIPS, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE AWARENESS OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CONVINCE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE SENATE TO ACT. IT'S THAT EXPERIENCE, THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL ENSURE THIS RURAL PLAN THAT JOE HAS, WHICH WILL CREATE NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HAMMERS, MANUFACTURING JOBS IN PLACES LIKE PERRY ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN GET DONE WITH A MAN WITH HIS EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND RELATIONSHIPS. HE MENTIONED AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD. ON ANY GIVEN DAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN BE CONFRONTED WITH THE FOLLOWING. A PANDEMIC IN AFRICA, A CYBER ATTACK IN ASIA, A GUN VIOLENCE INCIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY GIVEN DAY. THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS LEADERSHIP TO TACKLE ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE, TO TACKLE ISSUES LIKE CYBER ATTACKS AND TERRORISM. THE HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED , UNTIL RECENTLY , TO THE UNITED STATES FOR THAT LEADERSHIP, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS PROVIDED IT. BUT TODAY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY. THERE IS HESITANCY. THERE IS A LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR AND WHAT IT CARES ABOUT. FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, A NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEALING AND REPAIRING THE CREDIBILITY AND REPUTATION OF THE U.S. AND I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS NOBODY IN THIS RACE, INCLUDING , WHO HAS , INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE JUDGMENT OF JOE BIDEN. HE CAN BEGIN ON DAY ONE. IT WILL NOT BE A YEAR OR TWO OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. HE CAN GET IT DONE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: BUT YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS. YOU CAN'T EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WITH THE PUBLIC OPTION, YOU CANNOT FIX THE RURAL ECONOMY, YOU CANNOT REPAIR OUR NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD UNLESS YOU GET ELECTED. KIND OF A PREREQUISITE. YOU'VE GOT TO WIN. THE OTHER NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO BED, KRISTI WAS READING, AS SHE DOES. SHE SAID, WHAT YOU DOING? , CHRISTIE WAS READING, AS SHE DOES. I SAID, I'M LOOKING AT THE POLLS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN NORTH CAROLINA AND MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TEXAS AND ARIZONA AND NEVADA. I WANT TO SEE WHICH CANDIDATE IN OUR CURRENT PRIMARY, WHICH CANDIDATE HAS THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF STRENGTH IN ALL THE STATES. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE TODAY THAT IS EITHER BEATING DONALD TRUMP BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN OR IS TIED WITH DONALD TRUMP IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE STATES, AND THAT CANDIDATE IS HERE IN PERRY TONIGHT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: JUST IMAGINE ON ELECTION NIGHT, WHEN DEMOCRATS WHEN GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA AND WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND TEXAS, NEVADA, ARIZONA , WE NOT ONLY WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WE WENT A LOT OF CONGRESSIONAL RACES. WE WIN A LOT OF SENATE RACES. WE BEGIN TO TURN THE CORNER ON WHAT HAS OCCURRED THE LAST THREE YEARS. THAT IS WHY I AM SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: LET ME FINISH WITH A VERY PERSONAL NOTE. CHRISTIE MENTIONED WE HAVE UNDERGONE A TRAGEDY IN OUR FAMILY. WE LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT KNOCKS YOU OUT. IT MAKES YOU THINK, WHAT'S THE REASON, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE? OUR SON AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HAVE GONE THROUGH A SERIOUS CHALLENGE. IN EARLIER THIS YEAR, JEFF WENT TO A JOE BIDEN EVENT. HE SAW HIM AND HE WENT UP TO HIM AND HE SAID, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A POLITICIAN GOING, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE ANSWERED IT LIKE, I'M FINE. JOE BIDEN STOPPED MY SON, LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE AND SAID, NO, NO, NO. I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DOING. BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE MEMBERS OF A FRATERNITY WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE PART OF, OF HAVING LOST A LOVED ONE. I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DOING. I SHARE THAT STORY WITH YOU FOR TWO REASONS. THIS MAN HAS GREAT EMPATHY. IF AT THE IS SOMETHING , EMPATHY IS SOMETHING THAT A PRESENT NEEDS. THINK ABOUT IT. A PRESENT GOES INTO A GYMNASIUM OF PARENTS , A PRESIDENT GOES INTO A GYMNASIUM WITH PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GUNNED DOWN. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS EMPATHY. THE PRESENT GOES INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, WITH SOMEONE ON THE PHONE WHO LOST A LOVED ONE. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS EMPATHY. THEY TORE A DEVASTATED COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN , THEY TOUR A DEVASTATOR IMMUNITY WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LOST, LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS TO PUT THE. NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO SUFFER, THEY ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING A SENSE OF HOPE. GETTING TO THE NEXT DAY. BEGINNING REBUILDING. MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF AN EXTRAORDINARILY TRAGIC SITUATION. I WANT MY PRESIDENT TO HAVE THAT CAPACITY. AND WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT LACKS IF AT THE. I WANT THE COUNTRY ITSELF IS SUFFERING. , AND WE'VE SEEN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT LAX CKS EMPATHY. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE THE DISUNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE US THERE. THAT REQUIRES EMPATHY. THAT REQUIRES HEART. A GREAT PRESIDENT NOT ONLY HAS TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE RELATIONSHIPS, THE AWARENESS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD. THAT PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE HEART , BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. I AM SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO CAN WIN. THE CAUSEY'S THE ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS DOABLE, TRANSFORMATIONAL PLANS AND VISIONS THAT CAN GET ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE OF ITS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS. HE CAN BEGIN REPAIRING AMERICA'S DAMAGED IMAGE AND REPUTATION ON DAY ONE. AND BECAUSE I WILL NEVER, EVER HAVE TO WORRY IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MY PRESIDENT WILL LACK THAT. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO WHAT CHRISTIE AND I HAVE DONE IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE, FILL ONE OF THESE CARDS OUT. JOE NEEDS YOU. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS YOU. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, THE COUNTRY NEEDS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

CSPANJB2912201937	Joe Biden	2019-12-29	Joe Biden Town Hall in Peterborough, New Hampshire	"THANK YOU. THAT IS NOT WHY I WROTE THE BOOK , BUT I WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FACT OF THE MATTER IS, ANY U.S. POLICY BASICALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE OF 80 TO 100 YEARS FROM NOW. EVEN THE GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD MAKE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES THAT IS FEEDING GLOBAL EMISSIONS. JOE BIDEN. COME ON, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS HERE TODAY IN PETER'S , PETERBOROUGH, WE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT LOUDER. THERE WE GO. MY NAME IS JAKE, I AM THE ORGANIZER FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IN PETERBOROUGH, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. SO I AM HERE SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAS THE CHARACTER AND THE MORAL INTEGRITY THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO REPAIR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. SO I'M ORIGINALLY FROM OHIO AND I GREW UP IN AN INDEPENDENT CATHOLIC FAMILY, SO IT REALLY BROKE MY HEART, SEEING A LOT OF FAMILY, FRIENDS, TEACHERS, PEOPLE WHO I LOOK UP TO GO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. THEY RAISE ME TO TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED, THEN THEY SUPPORT A MAN LIKE THAT. WELL, THAT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF WHAT JOE BIDEN IS. HE IS A STRONG LEADER WHO HAS ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR THOSE WHO NEED HELP TO MOST, WHETHER IT IS PROTECTING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, OR HELPING BRING AMERICANS OUT OF THE 2008 RECESSION WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT, JOE BIDEN HAS ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR THOSE WHO NEED HELP THE MOST. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED IN A COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THAT IS WHO IS GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. BUT WE CANNOT DO THAT ALONE. IF WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THIS WHITE HOUSE, WE CANNOT LOOK AND THINK, WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE IN ORDER TO GET THIS DONE. I NEED EVERYONE TO PULL OUT YOUR PHONES. RAISE THEM UP HIGH. LET ME SEE YOUR PHONES, EVERYBODY. SO I NEED YOU TO TEXT THE LETTERS ""NH"" TO 30330. THAT IS NH TO 30330. THERE ARE ALSO MUCH ORGANIZES AROUND WITH CLIFF TOWARDS , CLIPBOARDS. CAN YOU RAISE THEM UP? TALK TO ANYONE WITH THE BIDEN T-SHIRTS AFTER THIS EVENT, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU BIDEN ELECTED, WE ARE GOING TO GET HIM VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY KNOCKING ON DOORS AND MAKING PHONE CALLS, SELECTED THIS TOGETHER. LET'S DO IT RIGHT HERE TOGETHER. THANKS, EVERYONE, FOR COMING OUT TO SEE JOE BIDEN, AND WE WILL GO AHEAD SHORTLY. THANKS, EVERYONE. (music) GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. AS YOU KNOW, I'M GAIL HERNANDEZ. I LIVE IN WILSON, JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM PETERBOROUGH, AND I AM REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY. ONE ME TO LIFT MY MICROPHONE? I WILL TRY. I AM REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, AND I'M NOT A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, BECAUSE I AM JUST LIKE ONE OF YOU. I AM A VOTER, A PERSON, A DAUGHTER. I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE TOLD YOU ANYTHING ABOUT ME, BUT I COME FROM A MIDDLE-CLASS BACKGROUND. MY PARENTS WERE TEACHERS, THEY WERE UNION REPRESENTATIVES. EVERY TWO YEARS, WE TOOK A VACATION BECAUSE MY MOM'S A DUCK THE MONEY. , MY MOM SAVED UP THE MONEY. SO I APPRECIATE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO FIGHT FOR US. I WORKED IN CORPORATE AMERICA FOR 30 YEARS. LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GOT LAID OFF, MOVED UP THE LADDER, WHICH DOWN THE LADDER, I GOT LAID OFF THIS YEAR. IT WAS A LITTLE CONCERNING IT MY TIME OF LIFE, LOOKING TOWARD RETIREMENT IN A FEW YEARS. WHAT WAS MORE CONCERNING WAS THAT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA THREE YEARS AGO. SO FOR ME, MY HEALTH CARE IS OF A BIG CONCERN. BECAUSE THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IMPROVED OUR COBRA BENEFITS, WHICH ALLOWED ME TO HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS LONGER THAN BEFORE, I HAVE 18 MONTHS OF HEALTH CARE. IT AFTERWARDS, IF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS GONE, I WILL HAVE TO START SPENDING MY RETIREMENT SAVINGS TO PAY MY PREMIUMS, TO PAY FOR ANY HEALTH CARE. AND THAT COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME FOR ANY OF US. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT CANCER, WE TALK ABOUT ASTHMA, DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES , HOW MANY OF US HAVE NOT HAD ANY OF THOSE CONDITIONS AMONGST OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY? THAT IS WHY I HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE THIS PERSON, BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE WILL FIGHT FOR ALL OUR RIGHTS,, WHETHER THEY ARE UNIONS RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, LGBTQ RIGHTS, IMMIGRATION RIGHTS , MY FAMILY COMES TO SENSORY'S APART, BUT IMMIGRANTS, BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL , TWO CENTURIES APART, BUT IMMIGRANTS, BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE TRAITS I WANT IN A PRESIDENT, I FIRST WANT THAT PERSON TO BE HITTING THE GROUND ON DAY ONE. I WANT THE WORLD TO LOOK AND THEY, THERE IS A PERSON WE CAN TRUST AGAIN TO LEAD THE U.S. BACK TO THE GREATNESS THAT IT HAD ONLY JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. I AM ALSO LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN BRING A TEAM WHO IS EXPERIENCED, WHO CARES ABOUT US, WHO WILL STAND WITH HIM AND IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES THAT WE ALL NEED, ALL OF OUR HEALTH CARE , WHETHER IT BE WORKERS RIGHTS , EVERYTHING WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE LOST SOMETIMES IF YOU ARE IN MY SITUATION. I ALSO WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN REACH ACROSS THE AISLE IMMEDIATELY. I WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, BUT WILL IMPROVE ON BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. MAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT EVEN BETTER THAN IT IS, HELP OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND BRING IN THOSE PEOPLE AND WORK ACROSS THE AISLE TO HELP US. FINALLY, I WANT SOMEONE WHO'S TRUSTWORTHY AND HONORABLE AND A GENUINELY GOOD PERSON. AND I CAN SAY WITH THIS PERSON WHO WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT IN THIS PERSON. LET US GIVE A LOUD AND WELCOMING RESPONSE FOR VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS. SUNDAY IN PETERBOROUGH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE THIS STATE, FOR REAL. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT. I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REPRESENTED THIS STATE, AND SOME OF YOU HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT , EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATTER OF FACT, FIRST TIME I RAN FOR THE UNITED DATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD DOES UNITED STATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I BETTER BE CAREFUL. BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN IRAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS , , I RAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS. I REMEMBER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. WE WERE A BORDER STATE, NOT SURE WHAT SIDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOUTHERN. THEY TALK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE A GOOD OLD FELLA. THE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YOUR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOWN HERE. EDGAR C BENNETT , YOU COULD NOT CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU ARE NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOME. EDGAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HAPPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN DOWNTOWN SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, AND HAD THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FRONT LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH'S. YOU WALK THROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENTRANCE TO GO UP. THE MINISTER WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. HE SAID, WE HAVE WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED EIGHTH SENATE , UNITED STATES SENATE. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GREET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WALK OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT, BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTER SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR SEAT WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER THE WORDS , AFTERWARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HORSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE SAID OF, THAT IS MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. [LAUGHTER] TRUE STORY. I WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMBER ONE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUE YOU ON THOUGH, MR. MAYOR, IF WE GET FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. IT MATTERS A LOT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO PICK. WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SENATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE MERELY WHY I WAS RUNNING WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE'S THREE REASONS. ONE, TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY THOUGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING, TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THOSE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVERY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED THE ARK OF CONCLUSION , OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER, AND IT IS BEING SHUTDOWN. I THINK IT IS BEING CORROSIVE FOR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING, TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS TAKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE DATA SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CENTURY. WE HAVE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE OF CALLER, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKING PEOPLE , MY DAD WOULD SAY I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE ME A SHOT. THE THIRD REASON I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. I WAS PRETTY ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM THE PRIMARY , NO, THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE, REMEMBER? HEATED THE ARMS CONTROL TREATIES, HE DID , AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFERENT. IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LOT OF THESE THINGS. I THINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE , I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY WELL. I HAVE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONALD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ONLY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FAMILY, GOING AFTER ME , I UNDERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGES. THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED TO RUN AND REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE. IMMIGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE , DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO ANYTHING. THIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS, I CAN'T GET IT DONE THOUGH I AM JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. AND THE NEED TO DO IT. I BELIEVE WE CAN, BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION , SOME OF THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING WITH IN THIS NOMINATION SAY TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] SO WE HAVE TO. WE CANNOT SURRENDER THE NOTION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE. DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT GOING TO BE HARD THIS TIME. HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, AND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DO NOT MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSONALITIES OR THE DIRTY POLITICS OF GOING AFTER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS. EVEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CLOSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPENS? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THINK YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSINESS. I THINK YOU ARE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU ARE THIS , BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORKOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO FROM MIKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORITY LEADER FROM MONTANA, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST PEOPLE HADN'T HIT THEIR WHOLE BODY , HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID IT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR MOTIVES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. THEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING PASSED. WHEN IN FACT A LOT HAS CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARDI SHOW , CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIND OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UNDER THE THREE SHELLS, YOU USUALLY KNOW BETTER THE SECOND TIME. , BETTER THE SECOND TIME. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN IN FACT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN ONLY 21ST CENTURY. WE , OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF THEY DISAGREE WITH US, HERE IS THE DEAL. TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS. CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FOR 67, 60 9 , I AM NOT SURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES , LAST TIME OUT IN 2018. THE ONLY GUY INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FROM ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANIA, STATE THAT WE LOST AND/OR WERE CLOSE. GUESS WHAT WE DID? WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE PERSONALITIES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAINST, WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN 41 FEET AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE WON 41 SEATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEMY GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT, DROPPING BOMBS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SAID, ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REALIZED REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE. PEOPLE SAID, YOU LOST BECAUSE IT IS NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPENED?THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL AGE 26 ANYMORE, ETC. EVERYONE SAID WELL, WHAT? BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT , I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BUT JOHN KNOWS , MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. I GOT IN TROUBLE ARE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRESIDE CHAT , REMEMBER THAT? BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. IF YOU ARE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, GOVERNOR, YOUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRESSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THIS THING YOU HAPPY. , YOU HAVE. PEOPLE SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN YOU CANNOT CONVINCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. PEOPLE KNOW , I AM CONCLUDING WITH THIS AND I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS REALITY. EVEN THE SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KNOW WHO HE IS, PEOPLE LIKE CAM, THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THEM ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR THINGS DEMOCRATS DID NOT DO OR WHATEVER. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAUSE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEARS PEOPL , FEEDING FEAR TO PEOPLE. IF YOU SAY THE LIE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IT BREAKS THROUGH. IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT , WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. OVER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. . WE GOT A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING EVERYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KIDDO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE, BUT AFTER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBODY UNDER 15, YOU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY, BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE BORING, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. MY MOTHER WOULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. SO FIRE AWAY. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE, GIVE THE MICROPHONE TO THEM , HELLO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE ACA. MY CHILD WAS BORN SUPER SICK AND BEFORE THE ACA LIFTED LIFETIME INSURANCE CAPS, I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WITH ALL THESE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ACA, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED AND CAN ACCESS THE MEDICAL SERVICES THEY REQUIRE? SARAH. YOU COULD HEAR A CRACK IN SARAH'S VOICE THERE, BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED, BEFORE I GOT SWORN IN, I WAS IN WASHINGTON AND A TRACTOR-TRAILER BLINDSIDED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, AND KILLED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER. MY SONS SURVIVED. BUT WHAT HAPPENED, I HAVE INSURANCE. I HAD THE PEACE OF MIND THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM GOOD DOCTORS. YOU KNOW, I GOT HOSPITALIZED YEARS AGO WITH A CRANIAL ANEURYSM. I WAS HOSPITALIZED THE COUPLE OF TIMES. THEY TOOK THE TOP OF MY HEAD OFF THE SECOND TIME, SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND THE BRAIN THE FIRST TIME. [LAUGHTER] BUT THOSE NURSES GAVE YOU HOPE. AND MY SON, BEAU, ATTORNEY GENERAL, A DECORATED WAR HERO , FOR REAL. A YEAR IN IRAQ, SIX MONTHS IN COZUMEL FOR , BEFORE THAT. HE CAME HOME AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA, GIVEN MONTHS. IT WAS NOT COULD HE , WOULD HE LIVE, IT WAS WHEN. RUN OUT OF COVERAGE. SUFFER PEACE. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. ONE OF THE THINGS MY DAD USED TO SAY IS THAT EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY WHEN THEY HAVE A DYING DIALED CHILD AND THERE IS NOT A DAMN THING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT?HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY WHERE THEY HAVE A CHILD IN SCHOOL I CANNOT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY TO GET THEM THERE. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. HERE IS WHAT I SUPPOSE. I WILL NOT GO INTO EXCRUCIATING DETAIL, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO DO MORE, LET ME KNOW. NUMBER ONE, I TAKE OBAMACARE AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZE IT SO IT COSTS LESS TO GET INTO OBAMACARE FOR EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR INCOME IS, SO YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU CALL A GOLD PLAN, AND IF YOU CAN AFFORD, IF YOU HAVE GOOD INCOME, YOU CAN BUY INTO IT AND IN FACT, YOU WILL NOT HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE MORE THAN $1000. THAT IS THE GOLD PLAN. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THAT PLAN. YOU CAN BUY A CHEAPER PLAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE. FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE PLAN, I PROVIDE WHAT A ROCK AND I WANTED , , WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED , ARE USUALLY WOULD CALL HIM PRESIDENT, BUT I DO NOT WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH THE OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] I MEAN IT. I DO NOT WANT TO GET THEM MIXED UP. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION THAT PROVIDED MEDICARE, A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO IN FACT WANTED TO BUY INTO A MEDICARE OPTION, IF THEY WANTED TO DO IT, AND IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT, IF THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THIS MEDICARE OPTION. IT IS MEDICARE FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT, BECAUSE WE HAVE 160 MILLION PEOPLE NATIONWIDE WHO IN FACT LIKE THE HEALTH CARE PLANS THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED, MANY OF THEM WITH THE UNIONS AND COMPANIES, THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE PLANS THAT THEY LIKE. THEY GAVE UP SIGNIFICANT SALARY CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO GET THAT COVERAGE. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GIVE IT UP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT. LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL, AS A MATTER OF LAW, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY PRIVATE INSURANCE. YOU HAVE TO GET , GIVE IT UP. BARACK PROMISED YOU COULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE RIGHT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN AS LONG AS YOUR COMPANY HAS THE PLAN. THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND SAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT ANYMORE. BEEN YOU CAN BUY INTO OBAMACARE, THEY OBAMA-BIDEN PLAN, THAT RELATES TO HAVING THIS PUBLIC OPTION. I DO NOT WANT TO KILL YOU, WHAT DOES IT COST? A LOT OF MONEY, $750 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. BUT IT DOESN'T COST $30 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS, AND IT LEAVES YOU WITH THE OPTION OF KEEPING WHAT YOU HAD IF YOU WANTED IT OR BUYING IN A FEW , BUYING IN IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. EVERYBODY IN MY STATE, LIKE YOURS, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, UNLESS , [INAUDIBLE] UNLESS YOU ALL , I KNOW HE IS A REPUBLICAN , HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT? I LAY OUT IN DETAIL HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THE PLAN AND EVERYTHING ELSE I CALL FOR, AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU THESE CHARTS. THESE ARE THE TAX INCREASES FOR THE VERY, VERY WEALTHY, BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE $1 TRILLION, $800 BILLION, $900 BILLION DEFICITS NOW. THEY TAKE CARE OF 1% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I TAKE CAPITAL GAINS AND TREAT THEM AS ORDINARY INCOME. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. IF YOU ARE IN , AND I WOULD RAISE THE TAX BRACKET UP TO 39.6% FOR THE WEALTHIEST. IF YOU ARE IN THAT TAX BRACKET, YOU PAY 39.6% ON THE CAPITAL GAINS INSTEAD OF 20%. THAT ALONE WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION. THAT ONE THING. I WOULD RAISE THE CORPORATE TAX RATES , I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF AMERICA. MORE CORPORATIONS ARE INCORPORATED IN MY STATE THAN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT IS NOT A JOKE. IT IS GIGANTIC. GUESS WHAT? BARACK AND I THOUGHT THESE CORPORATE TAX RATES SHOULD BE LOWERED FROM 38% TO 28%, BUT NOT 20%. IF YOU TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28%, WHICH IS A RATIONAL POSITION, THAT RAISES ABOUT $720 BILLION. I AM NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH IT ALL. AND ENDING THE FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION TAX BREAK, THAT RAISES ABOUT $25 BILLION RIGHT OFF THE BAT. I PAY FOR EVERYTHING I CALL FOR. EVERYTHING I CALL FOR. I STILL WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT IN THE PROCESS. BECAUSE YOU DO NOT NEED ALL THIS MONEY TO PAY FOR THE THINGS I CALL FOR IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ETC. THERE IS A LOT MORE TO SAY, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY. IF YOU HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN GALE INTRODUCED ME , LET ME SAY IT ANOTHER WAY. HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER YOUR HAVE TO, OBVIOUSLY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHTER, HUSBAND, WIFE, MOTHER, WERE FATHER TO CANCER REACT GO , MOTHER OR FATHER TO CANCER? THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE COVERAGE. AND IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE TO GET THE COVERAGE, HOW MANY HAVE , I WON'T GO THROUGH IT. ANYWAY, THERE IS A LOT WE CAN AFFORD TO DO, AND HERE IS THE BIGGEST DEAL. I ADMIRE THE INTENTION OF MY FRIENDS WHO FOUGHT FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL, BUT THE MINIMUM NUMBER IS $30 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS, MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS $40 TRILLION, BUT THAT IS $3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. THAT IS MORE MONEY THAN WE SPEND ON EVERY SINGLE THING THE GOVERNMENT DOES. YOU COULD WIPE OUT THE PENTAGON, SATELLITES IN THE SKY, EVERYTHING. YOU CAN WIPE OUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE ENTIRETY OF THE CIVIL SERVICE, WIPE IT ALL OUT. IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO $3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN RUNNING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE TO HAVE TRUTH IN LENDING HERE. THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO RUNNING AGAINST HIM IS ASSERT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ACCURATE OR SO PREPOSTEROUS TO GET DONE THAT HE IS ABLE TO HAVE A FIELD DAY. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS GUY. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HIM. HE BRAGS ABOUT AN ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING, AND IT IS GROWING. EXCEPT IF YOU ARE IN THE BOTTOM 96% OF THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BUT LOOK, THE STOCK MARKET IS AS HIGH AS IT HAS EVER BEEN. UNEMPLOYMENT IS INCREDIBLY LOW. IT IS REAL. IT HAS GROWN. BUT THERE IS NO RATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROWTH IN TERMS OF INCREASES IN INCOME AND OTHER THINGS. I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS SHORTER NOW IF YOU ASK ME LESS COCKADED QUESTIONS , LESS COMPLICATED QUESTIONS. [LAUGHTER] AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT BY A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS OF LATE, THEY ARGUE THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT OR PRESIDENT CLOSER THAN BRARARACK AND I. I GOT TO KNOW HIM. WHEN HE MOVED HIS FAMILY TO WASHINGTON AFTER SOME TIME, I SET HIM UP WITH MY SON HUNTER AND HIS FAMILY, AND THEY TALKED AND BECAME FRIENDS. THE SHELL BECAME FRIENDS WITH MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. OUR GRANDDAUGHTERS, MY GRANDD AUGHTERS AND HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BEST FRIENDS. MAYBE, WHO IS AT PENN, AND HIS DAUGHTER WHO PICKED MICHIGAN OVARY ALE , , OVER YALE, THEY HAVE BEEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WENT TO GRADE SCHOOL TOGETHER IN A SMALL SCHOOL OF WASHINGTON. THEY BECAME VERY CLOSE. BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE AGREED AT THE FRONT-END THAT WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS ASKED BY HIS FRIEND FROM CHICAGO, WHAT IS IT LIKE HAVING JOE AROUND, HE SAYS IT IS LIKE HAVING AN OLDER BROTHER. WHAT WE AGREED ON, WHEN HE FIRST ASKED ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, I SAY THIS BECAUSE IT IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE NOW, IS THAT I SAID I DID NOT WANT TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD HELP HIM MORE BEING A SENIOR SENATOR THAT HAD SOME INFLUENCE IN CONGRESS. I KNOW VICE PRESIDENTS ARE USUALLY STANDBY EQUIPMENT. THAT IS USUALLY ALL YOU ARE. I ASKED HIM, HE CAME BACK AND SAID TO MEET WITH MY FAMILY ABOUT IT, AND HE CAME BACK. TO MY SURPRISE, MY DECEASED SON AND MY SON HUNTER STRONGLY ARGUED I SHOULD DO IT, AND THE COUP DE GRACE WAS DELIVERED BY MY MOTHER, WHO WAS THEN 92 YEARS OLD. SHE WOULD NOT MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WITH US, BECAUSE WE WERE IN A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDPA. THERE IS A LITTLE GARAGE THAT WE TURNED INTO A NICE APARTMENT AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVEWAY, AND SHE SAID THAT WAS OK. BUT AFTER WE HAD THIS MEETING ON THE BACK PORCH, HE SAID GET BACK TO ME IN 48 HOURS, OK, ABOUT WHETHER I COULD BE VETTED AND CHECK ME OUT, WITH 10 LAWYERS LOOKING AT ME, AS SOMEONE VERY TACTFULLY SAID, LIKE A PUBLIC COLONOSCOPY. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE WENT THROUGH THIS MEETING FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR, AND MY MOM, YOU KNOW , I WON THE GENE POOL. I HAD A MOM THAT EVERYONE WISHED COULD BE THEIR MOM. MY MOM HEARD EVERYONE'S CONFESSIONAL ALL THE TIME, LET US OUT, YOU HAD TO BE IN BY 12, AND IF MY MOM WAS IN CONFESSION WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS, SHE WOULD GO LIKE THIS , DON'T STOP, KEEP MOVING. SHE SAID JODIE COMER REMEMBER WHEN I CALLED YOU A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ASKED YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOUSE, AND ASKED ABOUT BARACK, AND HE SAID HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY AND BRILLIANT? I SAID YEAH. SHE SAID, REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND THEY DESEGREGATED THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD AND SOLD A HOLM, A REAL ESTATE GUY SOLD A HOME TO AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN COUPLE, AND PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING AT NIGHT, IT WAS IN THE SUMMER, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE, YOU WENT DOWN AND GOT ARRESTED BY POLICE WERE STANDING ON THE PORCH WITH THE BLACK COUPLE? I SAID YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT. REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD A COUNTRY CLUB JOB, BUT WANTED TO WORK AT THE CITY POOL AND BE THE ONLY WHITE EMPLOYEE IN THE PROJECTS? YEAH, MOM. MEMBER WHEN YOU HAD THAT GOOD JOB AT A LAW FIRM AND YOU BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER BECAUSE THE CITY WAS OCCUPIED? THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN IN HISTORY WHO HAS THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OFFERED YOU TO WORK FOR HIM AND YOU TOLD HIM NO? [LAUGHTER] DAMMIT ALL, MOM. TRUE STORY. BEST DECISION MY MOTHER EVER MADE FOR ME. WE SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WHO TO PICK , THERE ARE SO MANY QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO BE PRESIDENT. NO MATTER IF YOU ARE 36 YEARS OLD, YOU SHOULD PICK SOMEONE WHO, IF GOD FOR BID SOMETHING HAPPENS, THEY CAN STEP IN AND BECOME PRESIDENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY QUALIFIED, BUT HERE IS THE COUP DE GRACE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. WITH BARACK AND I, WE KNEW WE WERE INTELLECTUALLY SIMPATICO ON THE ISSUES. WE DID NOT DISAGREE FUNDAMENTALLY ON ANY ISSUE, FOR REAL. WE DISAGREED ON TACTIC, NOT SUBSTANCE, AND WE WOULD ARGUE LIKE HELL WITH ONE ANOTHER PRIVATELY. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, EVERYBODY KNEW, HE IS PRESIDENT, HE DECIDES. BUT HE WANTED SOMEBODY WHO HAD A DIFFERING VIEW, WHO WOULD COMMAND, IN HIS PHRASE, ""NOT BE INTIMIDATED WHEN THEY WALKED IN THE OVER OFFICE."" IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO SHARES, IF I AM ELECTED, MY VALUE SET AND MY PRIORITIES. OTHERWISE IT MAKES IT VERY HARD, BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL. THE DAYS OF PICKING SOMEONE TO BALANCE THE TICKET ARE THE DAYS THAT ARE BASICALLY GONE BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENT IS SO IMMENSE, NO ONE WOMAN OR MAN CAN HANDLE THE JOB. THEY HAVE TO DELEGATE SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. NOT A JOKE. THE PRESIDENT DID THAT WITH ME, WHETHER IT WAS DEALING WITH IRAQ OR WORKING ON THE RECOVERY ACT, WHICH WAS $900 BILLION. WHEN HE GAVE ME AN ASSIGNMENT, HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORITY. I COULD HIRE AND FIRE, PICK PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CABINET, DO EXACTLY AS IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT. FOR REAL. IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE FOR A PRESIDENT, HE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT OR SHE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN GIVE SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY AND NOT HAVE THE PRESS SAY, SO AND SO IS DOING IT FOR HIM. BUT THEY NEVER QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS BRILLIANT, THEY NEVER QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY, IF I GET TO BE THE NOMINEE, WHO IS SOMEBODY SIMPATICO, COMFORTABLE WITH ME, WILL ARGUE AT ME AND HOLLER AT ME WHEN I DISAGREE, AND WE AGREED WE WOULD MEET FOR LUNCH ONCE A WEEK, AND EVERY SINGLE DAY, WHEN WE WERE IN SESSION AND BOTH IN THE COUNTRY, WE MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE MORNING, EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT IS THAT OLD EXPRESSION, YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LID. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, NOT A JOKE, OF SEVEN WOMEN , OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. NOT A JOKE. WHO ARE CAPABLE OF BEING PRESIDENT TOMORROW IF THEY STARTED OFF AS VICE PRESIDENT. I HAVE A COUPLE IN YOUR STATE THAT ARE NOT BAD, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, MALE AND FEMALE. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO, IN FACT, WITH THE PEOPLE BEING CONSIDERED BY ME AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BECOMES THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A GREAT CADRE OF PEOPLE TO PICK FROM, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE. AND IT IS NOT A BAD TRAINING GROUND, BEING VICE PRESIDENT. SO THAT IS AS HONEST AS I CAN BE WITH YOU. I'M GOING TO GO TO YES NO. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU, MR. NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE A COMMON AND VERY GOOD FRIEND IN GREG. HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. HE SAYS TO SAY HELLO. THANK YOU FOR COMING. THOSE CHILDREN UNDER 15, THEY ARE OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND CHILDREN. AND WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR 46TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TODAY, MY WIFE AND MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] AND HER NAME IS JILL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HOPE BACK TO THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE QUESTION I HAVE , LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT , [APPLAUSE] THE LEAST OF US WHO YOU HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE GREAT HOPE IN OUR HEARTS. SPEAK A MINUTE ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND HOW DEEPLY THEY NEED OUR HELP. THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS TO JILL. THAT IS WHAT I AM KNOWN AS IN WASHINGTON, JILL HUSBAND, AND I AM PROUD OF IT. YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY PATIENT WITH GRANDPOPS. WE ARE DIFFICULT TO RAISE. FIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE INDIAN NATIONS. OTHER THAN AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHO WERE BROUGHT OVER HERE IN CHAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF SLAVES SHIPS, MANY OF WHOM DIED BEFORE THEY GOT HERE , THAT IS THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THIS COUNTRY, THE STAIN ON OUR SOUL , WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER THE YEARS TO NATIVE AMERICANS HAS BEEN EQUALLY AS CONSEQUENTIAL. I LEARNED EARLY ON FROM A FELLOW WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND A WONDERFUL SENATOR WHO SUPPORTED ME WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND HELPED RAISE ME A LITTLE BIT WAS SENATOR DAN IN NO WAY , AND THEN SPARKY MATSANAGA. THEY WERE GIANT SUPPORTERS OF INDIAN NATIONS, AND ANY TIME SOMEONE WOULD SAY, INDIANS, NATIVE AMERICANS , NO, JOE, INDIAN NATIONS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM HAS BEEN DEVASTATING OVER THE YEARS. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOME STATES WHERE WE ARE, AND THAT IS MAYBE UP IN YOUR STATE A LITTLE BIT AND IN MY STATE, IN DELAWARE, COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HAVE BEEN WALKED AWAY FROM, A LOT OF THEM. WHEN I WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHAT I DID WAS CHANGE THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SAME PROCEDURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO WOMEN IN INDIAN NATIONS WHO ARE VICTIMIZED A LOT, BY THE WAY, WHERE IF A MAN WALKED ON AND ENGAGED IN A FORCED SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN, WHICH HAPPENS ABOUT 4% OF THE TIME, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRIED IN INDIAN COURT. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TRY AND THEIR COURTS, ON THEIR LAND, IF IT IS ON THE LAND OF AN INDIAN NATION. WE HAVE TO FINALLY BEGIN TO MAKE GOOD ON WHAT WE SAID WE BELIEVED , THAT IN FACT IT WAS A COMMITMENT MADE, IF WE MOVE DO AWAY AND DID ALL THESE THINGS LIKE JACKSON DID YEARS AGO, THAT WE WOULD BEGIN TO TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT REPARATIONS, I AM TALKING ABOUT DEALING WITH WHAT CONTINUES TO BE BASICALLY SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT EXISTS FOR NOT ONLY THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT ALSO FOR INDIAN AMERICANS. THANK YOU. YES MA'AM? BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TELL HE REALLY CARES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, BECAUSE I MENTION IT WHEN I START OFF, AND HE DOES NOT ASK A QUESTION, HE HOLDS UP A SIGN. WHAT IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT THAT EXISTS. THERE ARE THREE THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT I WOULD DO. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO WAS IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. [APPLAUSE] AND BY THE WAY, I HELPED WITH THAT TOGETHER. I AM THE GUY WHO CONVINCED OUR TEAM THAT CHINA WOULD JOIN BECAUSE I SPENT MORE TIME WITH XI JINPING THAN ANYONE HAD AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED AT HAVING TO BE PART OF IT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD TAKE THE MOST EGREGIOUS , THE DEAL W HEN WE DID THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, EVERY NATION THAT SIGNED UP WOULD IN FACT MOVED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AS SCIENCE DICTATED IT. THEY ALL SET STANDARDS, WE SET STANDARDS ACROSS THE BOARD, AND IN THE MEANTIME, WE LEARNED THINGS WERE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS. I WOULD CALL IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS A MEETING WITH ALL THE MAJOR POLLUTERS IN THE WORLD, IMAGERS, TO UP THE COMMITMENTS. THOSE WHO DID NOT, THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD EXACT ECONOMIC PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO DO THAT. LOOK AT WHAT THE CHINESE ARE DOING NOW. THEIR BELT AND ROAD PROPOSAL. THEY ARE EXPORTING MORE DIRTY COAL AROUND THE WORLD IN THE NAME OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS, BUT NOT DOING IT IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. THEY WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT UNDER THE ECONOMIC , RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE REASONS IT WORRIES ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WALKING AWAY FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REST ON CIVILITIES , RESPONSIBILITIES, THE LARGEST CARBON SINK IN THE WORLD IS THE AMAZON, IN THE WORLD. I AM ONE OF THE GUYS WHO CAME ALONG WITH THE PROPOSAL YEARS FOREST PRESERVATION. IN CASE YOU ARE MY BONA FIDES, YOU CAN CHECK POLITICAL ACT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL AND IT WAS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER AND I PUSHED ON IT. WHEN WE DID THE REPUBLIC , THE RECOVERY ACT OF $990 BILLION, WE PUT $100 BILLION IN BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF PRODUCING SOLAR AND WIND, WITH NO RATIONALE. THE POINT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, MORE CARBON FROM THE AIR, THE THING BREAKING THROUGH AND CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING, IS ABSORBED IN THE AMAZON THAN IS EMITTED BY EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE DRIVEN OF ANY TYPE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS BURNING. I HAVE BEEN PUSHING, NOT ALONE, BUT I HAVE BEEN PUSHING ALONG WITH JOHN KERRY, A BIG SUPPORTER AND FRIEND OF MINE, PUSHING THAT WE MISSING TO BRAZIL , WE HAVE BEEN SAYING TO BRAZIL, WE HAVE GOT TO FIX IT AND WE WILL HELP YOU, PAY YOU TO STOP IT. NOT TO BILLION DOLLARS. MORE LIKE $40 MILLION , BILLION . THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES. MAYBE YOU AND I CAN TALK ALONE, BUT TELL ME WHEN I'M GOING TO MUCH. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO IS RIGHT OFF THE BAT IMMEDIATELY, IN 2021, JANUARY, WHEN I SAY JOIN AND REJOIN THE PARIS ACCORD, I INTRODUCED THE PROPOSAL, WE GET TO ZERO MISSIONS BY 2050. SOME PEOPLE HAVE 2049 AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 2030. VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THERE. YOUR FOREST IS STILL GOING TO FIND INSECTS AND EVERGREENS THE SUMMER. YOUR WINTERS WILL GET WARMER. 85% OF THE PROBLEM IS OVER THERE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT REQUIRES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO BRING TOGETHER THE WORLD. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A FOREIGN-POLICY VISION THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN ARE TRUSTED SO ON DAY ONE, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE WORLD STAGE. THE WORLD WILL KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS AND NO THAT PERSON THOSE WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE. WHAT THEY ARE LIKE. WE CAN DO IT BUT WE HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE BUSINESS. WHEN WE SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE, AND WE ALREADY DEFORESTATION OUR LAND OVER THE LAST 300 YEARS AND HAVE DONE WELL BY IT, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SAYS YOU KEEP IT UP, COME ON. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE HARD. REALLY HARD. THE THIRD THING WE HAVE TO DO IS SET DOWN GUIDE RAILS NOW. BETWEEN THE YEARS 2021 AND 2030, IT IS IRREVERSIBLE THE PATH WE HAVE SET US ON. HOLDING THEM RELIABLE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WHEN THEY DO NOT, PUT THEM IN JAIL. I AM NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] MR.VIOCE PRES. BIDEN: , VICE THE CITY WOULD BE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY AND GET DIRECTED TO REPLACE ALL THE WINDOWS. AND DOORS AND INSTANTLY , INSULATION SO YOU ARE NOT EMITTING FROM THE BUILDING HEAT OR AIR CONDITIONING, COSTING MUCH MORE MONEY. IF WE TOOK EVERY PUBLIC AND FEDERAL BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH THEY STARTED OFF DOING BEFORE THEY TENTED, WE COULD , THIS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL TO BE CONSUMED EVERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER ENERGY CONSUMING IT. WE SHOULD TERM FARMER , TURN FARMERS INTO THE NET ZERO EMITTERS IN THE WORLD. SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATION PROPERTY, HAVING THEM PLANT DEEPER ROOTS TO ABSORB THE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. BIOFUELS IS THE NEAR-TERM TRANSITION. WE CAN DO SO MUCH. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS REESTABLISH MILE STANDARDS. IT BILLION GALLON BARRELS OF OIL. AUTO COMPANIES AGREED TO IT. I CALL FOR EVERY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO BE GREEN. SO WE DO NOT BUILD THE , TO WHAT IT IS BEFORE, BUT WHAT IT IS NOW. I WILL STOP WITH THIS. MAKE SURE THAT, I WANT TO INSTALL 550,000 CHARGING STATIONS ON ALL OF OUR HIGHWAYS. WE SHOULD OWN THE EV MARKET OF ELECTRONIC VEHICLES. EXPERTS POINT OUT ON MY PLAN THAT WE CAN CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. SERIOUS JOBS, NOT $15 AN HOUR. $45 AN HOUR BEFORE YOU START TALKING ABOUT , THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD HAS EVER TAKEN A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS GIGANTIC. I WILL GIVE YOU THE WHOLE PLAN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THIS IN A WAY THAT IT IS. IN EXIT CENTRAL THREAT , AND EXISTENTIAL THREAT, NOT A JOKE. WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE. THE PLANET IS IN TROUBLE. HUNDREDS OF SPECIES ARE GONE AND DO NOT COME BACK. MY STATE OF DELAWARE, GUESS WHAT, NOT A JOKE. IN 15 YEARS, A LOT OF THEM WILL BE GONE. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I GOT ELECTED, WHAT THEY SAY IT WAS, CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MILITARY, CLIMATE CHANGE YOU WILL HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE YOU SAW IT HAPPEN INDOOR FOR , IN DARFUR. KILLING PEOPLE, WHY? FOR LAND, FIGHTING WHAT IS LEFT IS NOT THAT AT ALL. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. THINK WHAT HAPPENED WITH AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND LIBYA. MORE PEOPLE MIGRATED IN EUROPE THAN ANY OTHER TIME INCLUDING WORLD WAR II. WHAT DID IT COST? IT CHANGES POLITICAL ATTITUDES. IS THE REASON WE HAVE THE NEW NATIVISM GOING ON IN HUNGRY, POLAND, AROUND THE WORLD. YOU ARE COMING HERE, YOU'RE NOT COMING HERE. REMEMBER ALL OF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS OF AFGHANI'S TRYING TO GET INTO HUNGRY? LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF GERMANY? THE MOST POWERFUL AND MOST ENLIGHTENED LEADER IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME, ANGELA MERKEL. HER PARTY GOT CLOBBERED. IT IS FEAR. A LOT IS AT STAKE. I WILL GIVE YOU A COPY OF THE WHOLE PLAN, AND THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GO. IF YOU ASK ME IN EASY QUESTION, IF YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING, I WILL TRY AND DO IT IN 25 WORDS OR LESS. YOU, MA'AM, GIVE HER THE MIC. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE? [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN I SAID THE SOUL OF THE NATION, THINK ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT OUR SOUL WHEN YOU SEND YOUR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD OFF IN FIRST OR SECOND OR THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE, AND THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. BUILDING NEW SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND THEM THE GENERATION THAT IS MOST UNEASY AND HAS THE GREATEST ANXIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA IS THE Z GENERATION, AGES 7-17. DO NOTE THE GREATEST FEAR IS? GETTING SHOT IN SCHOOL. TALK ABOUT A SICK SOUL. I AM THE ONLY GUY WHO HAS EVER BEATEN THE NRA NATIONALLY. I HAVE BEATEN THEM TWICE. I GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED. I AM THE GUY WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN PASSED. BECAUSE OF SOME HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA, ABLE , A GUY NAMED BUSH LET IT EXPIRE. YOUR STATE AND MINE, A LOT OF HUNTERS, THAT IS FINE. ANYBODY WHO NEEDS A MAGAZINE WITH 100 ROUNDS IN IT, YOU SHOULD NOT BE HUNTING. YOU ARE A DANGER TO YOURSELF. NOT A JOKE. NOT IDEAL WEARING A KEVLAR VEST. MY DECEASED SON AND MY SON WERE BIRD HUNTERS. YOU LOCK THEM UP. WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY, THE ONLY INDUSTRY IN THE NATION NOT ABLE TO BE SUED, THE ONLY ONE. HOW WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN THE CASE WHEN I WAS PUSHING TO GO AFTER THE PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTRIES FOR , COMPANIES FOR OPIOIDS? BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO SUE THEM FOR THE DAMAGE THEY WERE DOING, WE WERE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE THING AND IT IS STILL CHANGING. YOU CAN DO THAT WITH GUN MANUFACTURERS. ONE OF MY OBJECTIVES, I WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. DEMOCRATS VOTED TO GIVE EXEMPTIONS TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. BUT I WILL WORK LIKE HELL TO ELIMINATE THAT EXEMPTION. LASTLY, WE TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW. THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN PULL IT SUGAR ON ANY WEAPON WOULD BE ONE WHOSE BIOMETRIC MARKER MATCHED WHAT DONE , WITH THE GUN WAS SOLD TO. IT IS JAMES BOND STUFF BUT IT IS REAL AND IT EXISTS. OUT IN SILICON VALLEY, AND MET WITH THIS GROUP OF EXPERTS ON HOW THEY COULD DO THAT. IT CAME ALONG AND THEY CAME UP WITH SEVERAL PISTOLS THAT DO THAT. THEY STARTED TO SOLOMON ADVERTISED THAT WAY. YOU'RE NOT VIOLATING ANYONE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT. IF I'M ABLE TO BUY THE GUN ON A BACKGROUND CHECK, I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO FIRE THE GUN. BECAUSE LOOK WHAT HAPPENED UP IN CONNECTICUT. THE MOM HAD BEGUN IN THE KICK , THE KID PICKED IT UP. HE WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK. THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO SAY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE A GUN. CERTAIN GUNS, NOT EVERY GUN. SO THEY PUT THEM IN STORES AND THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS SAID IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THEM, WE WILL BOYCOTT YOUR STORES AND PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS. SO THEY'RE NOT ON THE SHELVES AT ALL NOW. WHAT IS GOING ON? THIS IS WRONG. THERE ARE SO MANY AVENUES WE CAN GO WITHOUT VIOLATING ANYONE'S BASIC RIGHT. TO OWN A GUN. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A GROUP WHO SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS, YOU NEED , IS WATERED BY THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS, YOU NEED A FIGHTER JET IF YOU WILL PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. YOU NEED SOMETHING A LOT MORE IF THAT IS THE RATIONALE. EXTREME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT THE REASON WHY THE SECOND AMENDMENT EXISTS IS SO WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. YOU NEED A COUPLE OF FLAMETHROWERS. ALL KIDDING ASIDE. THESE PEOPLE TELL ME YOU CANNOT LIMIT THE TYPE OF WEAPONS. CAN ANYONE HERE, LIKE THEY DID WITH A FORMER DUPONT GUY, WELL, YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THE GOVERNMENT, YOU BETTER GET A PERSONNEL CARRIER OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL NOT DO IT WITH AR-15. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE GUN AND THAT IS THE LAW. YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE GUN OR BAZOOKA. I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CANNOT SAY THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF WEAPONS YOU CANNOT OWN IS NOT AT ALL INCONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. FROM THE BEGINNING, FROM THE BEGINNING, EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION HAS AN EXCEPTION. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IF ANYONE NEW TO YELL FIRE, WE COULD PUT YOU IN JAIL WITH PEOPLE RUNNING OUT OF FEAR OF PEOPLE GETTING HURT AND THERE IS NO FIRE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO YELL FIRE. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM IF YOU ARE A CONVICTED FELON OR TERRORIST TO GO BUY A WEAPON. ONE REASON WHY, AND THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO CONCLUDE IT, I TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I WROTE THAT, I DID IT MYSELF. IT TOOK QUITE YEARS TO GET IT PASSED. IT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON CHANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA. EVERY SEVERAL YEARS IT HAS TO BE REAUTHORIZED. THE HOUSE PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY, SITTING IN THE SENATE. IT CUTS OUT WHAT THEY CALL THE BOYFRIEND EXCEPTION. THE BIGGEST FIGHT I HAD TO GET IT AUTHORIZED THE SECOND TIME WAS THAT IF YOU WERE THE SUBJECT OF ABUSE BY A HUSBAND OR SOMEONE YOU LIVE WITH, AND THAT PERSON WAS CONVICTED, THEY COULD NOT OWN A GUN, A WEAPON. WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY WORKED OUT AN EXEMPTION, THE BOYFRIEND EXEMPTION. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHILD WITH A PERSON BEATING YOU UP, OR YOU DO NOT LIVE WITH HIM, THAT PERSON CAN OWN A WEAPON. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN KILLED BY THEIR ABUSERS ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. THE UNIT KNOW WHAT THE GREATEST LOSS OF LIFE IS WITH A GUN? SUICIDE. OVER 20% OF ALL PEOPLE WHO DIE BECAUSE OF A BULLET OUR PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AND WE SAY WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE POLICE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT MAY BE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A WEAPON? IT IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY BUT THAT IS WHY WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ALONG THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT TO BE PASSED AND REAUTHORIZED AND WE WILL LOSE ENORMOUS PROTECTIONS IF CUT DOWN BY WELL OVER 60% OVER THE AGE OF 30. THE REPORTS ARE WAY UP. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD. THE NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURERS ARE MUCH TOO POWERFUL AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT A RATIONAL READING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I HAVE TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR 22 YEARS. I PROMISE YOU. THEY DON'T. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE IT.

I AM HERE T O ASK FOR YOU TO CAUCUS FOR ME ON T HAT DAY COMING IN FEBRUARY FO R THIS SIMPLE REASON , T O HELP ME CREATE AN A MERICAN EXPERIENCE THAT IS DEF INED NOT BY EXCLUSION B UT BY THE LONG ING FOR EVERYONE IN UNITED S TATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE REA DY FOR THAT. WHICH IS GOOD. BE CAUSE THE GREAT THING ABOUT THAT FUTURE IS W E CAN START BUILDING IT EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST VOTE IS CAS T. I'M GOING TO SHARE A LOT WITH YOU ABOUT HOW I ENVIS ION USING THE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY TO CHANGE T HE POLICY OF THIS COU NTRY TO MAKE OUR LIVES BETTE R, BUT THE FIRST T HING WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS UN IFY THIS COUNTRY ARO UND THAT SENSE OF BELONGING T HAT CALLS OUT T O EVERYBODY AND LETS THEM K NOW WHERE THEY FIT IN THE FUTURE. AND WE CAN DO THAT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN. THE FACT TH AT YOU ARE HERE ME ANS WE ARE ALREADY DOING IT. SO, THA NK YOU FOR WHAT YO U ARE BUI LDING FOR ALL OF US. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO NE ED THAT, NOT ONLY TO EARN A B IG WIN ON CAUCUS N IGHT, NOT ONLY TO EARN THE NOMINATION AND EARN THE EL ECTION AND THE PRESIDENCY ITSELF, BUT WE ARE GOING TO NEED IT MORE THAN EVER THAT NEXT DAY. T HAT FIRST DAY I ALWAY S TALK ABOUT I ASKED VOT ERS TO PICTURE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PICT URE IN HIS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN TO CLOSE YOUR EYES IF YOU WANT . THAT DAY THE SUN COMES U P OVER DES MOINES AND THE REST OF THIS COU NTRY AND DONALD TRUMP IS NO LONGE R THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STAT ES. [LOUD CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: THAT DAY WILL COME. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THAT DAY ABOUT AND M AKE SU RE IT COM ES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, RIGHT? BUT THEN WH AT? [LAUG HTER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: THEN COMES THE H ARD PA RT. THINK ABOUT HOW IT IS GOING TO FEEL THAT D AY. YES, WE WIL L BE GLA D TO HAVE THIS PRESIDENCY IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, NO QUESTION. N O MORE THE CORRUPTION, NO MORE TWE ETS EMANATING FROM THE OVAL OFFICE THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. PUTT ING IT AWAY WILL BE GOOD. BU T THEN TH INK ABOUT HOW IT IS GOING TO FEEL. OU R COUNTRY WILL BE DIVIDED. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE HURTING. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE EXHAUSTE D FROM FIGHTI NG EVEN MORE THAN WE ARE RIGHT N OW. YOU JUST TH INK ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEE N THROUGH IN EVERYTHING WE ARE ABOU T TO GO THROUGH IN THIS COU NTRY. WE ARE GOING TO NEED A PRES IDENT WHO CAN CALL THE AM ERICAN PEOPLE NOT TO AGREE ON EVERYTHI NG, THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, BUT WHO CAN CALL THE AMERICAN PE OPLE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AS ONE NATI ON. AND THINK A BOUT THE PROBLEMS WE ARE STIL L GOING TO HAVE ON THAT DAY. THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL BE UP AGAIN ST. THAT DAY THAT SUN CO MES UP, IT'LL B E CO MING U P OVER A CLIMATE THAT IS CHA NGING SO QUICKLY WE ARE JUST A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM THE POINT O F NOW WE TURN PART - - NO RETURN. IT WILL BE COMING UP OVER SCH OOLS WHERE KIDS ARE BE ING DRILLED IN ACTIVE S HOOTER TRAINING BEFORE THEY HAVE LEARNED HOW TO READ . IT'S GOING TO BE COMING UP OVER AN ECONOMY WHERE IT IS NO LO NGER P OSSIBLE ANYWHERE IN ANY COUNTY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR SOMEBODY WH O WORKS FULL-TIME AT MINIMUM WAGE TO AFFORD A TW O- BEDR OO M APARTMENT. SO, THINGS WILL STILL BE SO TROUBLED IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE WILL STILL BE SOMETHING V ERY WRONG IN THE HEART OF TH AT WOMAN BEHIND THE WHEEL W HO S AW A 14-YE AR-OLD GIRL AND A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY AND SAI D I AM GOING TO HURT THE M BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE ME. THAT IS THE WORK WE ARE GOIN G TO NEED THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO DO. TO R ISE TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES WITH BIG POLICY IDEAS AND DO IT I N A WAY THAT'S GOIN G TO SERVE TO UNIFY AND NOT DIV IDE THE AMERICA N PEOPLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THA T'S EXAC TLY THE KIND OF JOB THE PRESIDENCY IS FOR. IT IS NOT T O GLOR IFY THE PRESIDE NT. IS TO EMPOWER, UN IFY, AND HEAL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THA T IS WHA T I W ANT TO USE THAT OFFICE FOR WITH YO UR HELP. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: THAT IS WHA T A PRESIDENT CAN DO. TO CALL THIS COUNTR Y TO ITS HIGHEST VALUES, VAL UES THAT HAVE B EEN WITH U S ALL ALONG AND T HAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST WH EN WE LOOK TO AND ALLOW THOSE VALUE S TO GUIDE OUR STEPS. BUT WE GOT TO RECOGNIZ E WHAT THOSE VALUES REQUIRE OF US BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALWAYS OBVI OUS. TAKE PATRIOTISM. RESPECT FOR THE FLIGHT. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT REQUIR ES OF US. AND THEY ARE NOT BEI NG MET B Y A MILITARY PA RADE OR A PRESIDENT WHO THUMPS HIS CHEST. MOST CERTAI NLY NOT BEING HONORED BY THE DECISION TO OVERTHROW MILITARY JU STICE AND PARDON WAR CRIMINALS AS IF THERE 'S NO DIFFEREN CE BETWEEN A WAR CRIMI NAL AND IT HONORABL E SERVICE NUMBER OF UNITED STAT ES OF AMERICA. THAT'S NOT PATRIOT ISM. NOW, I'M HE RE TO TAL K ABOUT A DIFFERENT K IND OF PAT RIOTI SM, ONE THAT RE COGNIZES THE MOST IMPORT ANT THING WE CAN DO TO H ONOR THE FLAG IS TO HONOR THE V ALUES IT STANDS FOR. THAT TO REC OGNIZE THE PATRIOT ISM, FOR EXAMPLE , AND THE SPIRIT OF T HOSE WHO GO BEFORE CONG RESS AND PUT THEIR CAREERS ON THE LINE TO TES TIFY ABOUT WRONGDOING BECAUSE THAT IS AN ACTIVE LOYALTY TO THE REPUBLIC FO R WHICH IT STANDS. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: I'M TALKING ABOUT A PAT RIOTISM AND A LOVE OF COU NTRY THA T BEGINS WITH THE KN OWLEDGE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS MADE OF PEOPLE, AND YOU CAN'T L OVE OF PEOPLE IF Y OU HATE HA LF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN IT. SO, WHAT DO ES IT MEAN TO LIVE UP TO LOVE OF COUNTRY? WH AT DOES IT REQUIRE? IT CERTAINL Y REQUIRES WE KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE FROM A LL ENEMIES FOR EIGN AND DOMESTIC. IT REQUIRES MAKING SURE THAT ABROAD WE SEE TO IT THAT ANY ALLY OR WOU LD BE ALLY NEVER QUESTIONS WHETHER IT IS A GOOD I DEA TO BET YOUR LIFE ON THE CRED IBI LITY OF THE UNITED STATES, BEC AUSE WE WILL BE A COUNTRY THAT KEEPS ITS WORD TO ENEMIES AND ALLIES ALIKE. THAT IS HOW WE P ROTECT OUR COUNTRY ABROAD. [CH EERS] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: AND PROTECT ING OUR COUNTRY, THAT MEANS PROTE CTING EACH OTHER. THAT STARTS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IT IS AS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT WEW MU ST SEE TO IT T HAT THE SE COND AMENDMENT CAN NEVER BE CONFUSED FO R AN EXCUSE TO DO NOTHING AT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CHURCHES. AND OUR SHOPPING CE NTER SAFE FROM GUN VIOLENCE TH AT IS NATIONAL SECURITY. [ CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IF WE'RE SE RIOUS ABOUT PROTE CTING OUR COUNTRY AND SERIOUS ABO UT PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND OUR FUT URE, THAT IS LIKE SO MUCH DEPENDS , WHAT IS WHY SO M UCH DEPENDS ON US RISING TO MEET THE CHALLEN GE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS T HE GLOBAL SECURITY THREAT OF O UR TIME AND LE ADING THE WORLD AND DOING SOMET HING ABOUT IT, AND HOW PROUD W E WOULD BE IF WE DID BECAUSE THE WORLD NEEDS US RIGHT NOW TO TAKE ON CLIMATE CHANGE. SO THAT'S W HER E A VAL UE LIKE LOVE O F COU NTRY LEADS ME AND WILL BE MY PRESI DENCY. I'M TALKING ABOUT VALUES. I'M TALKING ABOUT VALUES THAT RIGHT NOW T HEY ARE USED TO PIT US AGAINST EACH OTHER, LIKE FAITH. FIRST OF AL L, THIS IS A C OUNTRY THAT WAS BUILT O N THE IDEA THAT OUR CONSTITUTIO N AND OUR GOVERNMENT BELONG TO P EOPLE OF EVERY RELIG ION AND OF NO RELIGION EQ UALLY. IT IS IN TH E CONSTITUTION. NOW, IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT WE CAN CALL OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE GUI DED BY FAITH TRADI TIONS AND OFFER A CHO ICE, AND THE CHO ICE IS IS , DO YO U WANT TO HAVE A W HIT E HOUSE THAT YOU CAN TUR N ON THE NEWS AND SE E WHAT THEY'RE UP TO AND NOT HAVE TO SCRATCH YOUR HEAD OR SHA KE YOUR HEAD AND SAY WHATEVER HA PPENED TO ""I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU FED ME? I W AS A STRAN GER AND YOU WELCOME D ME? TOWHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THE LEAST OF THESE YOU HAVE DONE F OR ME.:"""" GOD DOES NO T AL ONG TO POLITICA L PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES OF A MERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: VALUES LIKE DEMOCR ACY T HAT THAT FLAG H AS AL WAYS STOOD FOR WHEN WE HAVE BEE N OUT OUR BEST. BEING SERIOUS ABO UT DEMOCRACY , CAN WE GET SOME HE LP TO SOMEBODY WRITE THAT WAY? - - RIGHT THAT WAY? T HANK YOU. WHEN I T COM ES TO BEING A DEMOCRACY, THAT MEANS LIVIN G UP TO THE VALUES OF DEMOCRAC Y. NOT JUST DEMOCRACY A S A SYSTEM. BUT DEMOCRACY A S A WAY OF LIFE . TH AT MEANS SEEIN G TO IT THAT POW ER IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN THE HAND S O F THE PEOPLE, THA T OUR OF FICIA LS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR. THAT I S WHAT KEEPS OUR GOVERNM ENT WORKING FOR US RATHER T HAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND. YOUR VOTE I S WHA T KEE PS YOUR GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR YOU AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SO, LET'S SEE T O IT T HAT EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED AND EVERY V OTER COUNTS AND PASS A 21ST CENT URY VOT ING RIGHTS ACT TO MAKE SUR E VOTER SUPPRESSION OF ANY KIND IS NOT TOLERATED IN THE UNITED STAT ES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: LET'S DO SO METHIN G A BOUT DISTR ICTS B EING DRAWN AROUND THIS COUNTR Y BY POLITICIANS WHO GET TO PICK OUT VOTESRS , IN STEAD OF THE OTHER WAY ROUND. IF W HAT IT REQUIRES TWO AND CITIZENS UNITED IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, AND THEN TH AT IS EXACTLY WHY THEY TH OUGH T UP THE PROCESS . LET'S THINK BIG AND PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY. THINKING AB OUT VALUES LIKE FREEDOM AND THIS IS ALL ABOU T F REEDOM, BU T FREEDOM IS BIGGER AND MORE COMPLICATED THAN CUTTING EVE RY TAX A REGULATION. THAT IS NOT GOIN G TO MAKE US FREE. FREEDOM REQ UIRES A GREAT DEAL FROM US. AN D PART OF IT, YES, GE TTIN G GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN GOVERNMENT IS IN THE W RONG PLACES. WE NEED TO KEEP GOVERN MENT OUT OF THE BUSINES S OF, FOR EXAMPLE, COUNTY CLER K'S TELLING YOU WHO YOU OUGHT T O MA RRY. T HANK YOU, IOWA, FOR Y OUR HAND AND BRINGING MA RRIAGE EQUALITY TO THE UNIT ED STATES OF AMERICA. RE SPECTING AMERICAN FR EEDOM MEANS KEEPING GOV ERNMENT OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF DICTATING TO WOMEN WHAT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE CHOICES OUG HT TO BE. THAT FREEDO M BELONGS WITH YOU. B UT SOMETIM ES IT MEANS IN SISTING THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR STEP UP. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THAT IS WHY WE HAVE MAYORS. YOU ARE NOT FREE IF THERE IS NOT A CLEAN, SA FE, PLOWE D ROAD BETWEE N WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU NEED TO GET TO. IF YOU ARE NOT FRE E IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU'R E GOING TO GO GET A GLASS OF SA FE DRI NKING WA TER. I MAKING CE RTAIN THI NGS AVAILABLE. SECRETARY O F EDUCATIO N WHO BELIEVES IN PUBLIC EDUC ATION AND SUPPORT S AMERICA'S TEACHERS. I THINK THA T WE NEE D TO STEP UP IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND DELIVER HEALTH CARE, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FREE IF YOU DO N OT HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. T HAT IS THE IDEA OF MEDICARE FOR ALL WHO WANT IT . IF EVERYBODY , GIVE EVERYB ODY A PUBLIC OPTION BUT I TRUST YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANTED. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO SEE TO IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNINSURE D AMERICAN, AND THAT IS WHA T WE ARE GOING TO DO. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: SO, YOU SEE HOW THESE VALUES CAN LEAD US FORWARD AT THIS MOMENT THAT IS COMING U P W HERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOV E FAST. THERE'S A S ENSE OF URGENCY HER E. WE CAN'T 10 YE ARS, CAN' T WAIT FOUR YEARS. WE CANNOT W AIT TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS , CLIMATE CHANGE CAN'T WAIT. THE D EADLIN ES ARE NOT BEING SET BY CONG RESS. IT IS BEING SET BY EARTH. I T WILL COM E AND GO WITHOUT US IF WE DO NOT ACT. WE CANNOT W AIT TO TAKE STEPS TO SEE TO I T T HAT OURS I S A COUNTR Y WHERE YOUR RACE H AS NO BEARING ON YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR WEALTH ARE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW EN FORCEMENT. THAT IS WHA T THE PL AN IS ABO UT. WE CAN'T WA IT TO DO SOMET HING ABOUT THE CRISIS OF DEATHS F ROM DESPAI R IN THIS COUNTRY, AN D THAT MEANS THAT JUST AS MUC H ATT ENTION A ND JUST AS MUCH OPEN DISCUS SION AS WE GIVE TO PHYSICAL ME DICAL ISSUES MUST NOW BE THERE FOR M ENTAL HEALTH AN S UBSTANCE ISSUESD, TO O. LET'S BRING IT IN TO THE SUNLIGHT AND LET'S T ALK ABOUT IT AND LETFIX' S FIX IT. NOW. ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, WE CANT WAI T. WE GOT TO A CT NOW. AND, WHEN W E DO, WE H AVE THE OP PORTUNITY TO BRING TO GETHER THIS NEW AMERICA N MAJORITY MAKING SURE WE DO THE RIGHT THING. IT WE GOT TO D O IT TOGETHER. NOT THAT WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT THE PRESIDENCY IS SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO ALL OF U S, IN THIS CAMPAI GN IS DESIGNED TO CALL IN EVE RYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE THAT BETTER FUTURE. YES, WE ARE CALLING OUT TO PROGRESS IVES, WE ARE CALL ING OUT TO MODERATE SS. . I'M MEETING AN AWFUL LOT O F FUTURE FORMER REPUBLICANS YOU ARE READY TO BE PART OF THA T CHANGE. , WHO ARE REA DY TO BE PART OF THAT CHANGE. THAT'S HOW WE'RE G OING TO WI N. BUT MORE IM PORT ANTLY, THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO GOVERN. WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS TOGETHER. T HERE IS GOT A BE A FIGHT, WE W ILL HAVE A FIGH T. WE CAN'T BE FI GHTING SO MUCH THA T HE GETS TO WHERE FIGHT ING IS ALL WE H AVE GOT. THE POINT IS WHAT LIE S ON THE OTHE R S IDE OF THE FIGHT, AND THAT IS BETTER LIFE FOR ALL OF US. THAT IS WHA T I MEAN WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA N EXPERIENCE DEFINED BY BELONGING. BE READY TO HELP US BRING AB OUT THAT DAY. [CHEERING] >> [CHANTING ""PETE""] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: NOW IS OUR CHANCE. SO, OUR GAT HERI NGS HAVE GOTTEN SLIGHTLY LESS INTIMA TELY SINCE WE STARTED OUT WITH ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE IN A N OFFICE A BOU T THE SIZE OF THIS STAGE HERE. AND WE HAVE GROWN WITH YOUR HELP TO THE MOVE MENT WE ARE BECOMING TODAY. BUT I'VE NE VER SEEN A GROUP SO LARGE. WE HAVE AN EXC HANGE OF IDEAS. WE HAVE GATHERED QUESTIONS F ROM FOLKS AS THEY HAVE COME I N. I'D LIKE YO U TO WELC OME ANOTHER TEAM MEMBER WITH THE FAMOUS FISHBOWL. YOU ALREADY MET CLAUDIA. DON'T WE HA VE THE BEST OR GANI ZERS AND VOLUNTEERS ON THIS TEA M? NOW, TO BE YOUR VOICE, I WA NT YOU TO WELCOME ANOTHER, A FANTASTIC MEMBER OF THE PETE FOR AM ERICA TEAM, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE CHARLOTTE WHO IS GOING TO GUIDE OUR DISCUSS ION. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WEARING ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHIRTS, WHI CH CONTA INS THE VALUES OF OUR CAMP AIGN. LOOK AT THAT. WE YOU GOT F ANS. I F IT WAS Y OUR QU ESTION, G ET A HOLLER OR W AVE, SO I CAN LOOK AT YOU AS WE RESPO ND. >> SO, THIS QU ESTI ON IS FROM BOB L. AND HE ASKS , HO W ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE EC ONOMY STRONG? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: GREAT QUESTION. AGAIN, IF T HAT WAS YOU, GIVE A LITTLE HO LLER SO I CAN LOOK IN YOUR GENERA L DIR ECTION. HELLO, BOB. THANKS FOR COMING. SO, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE CONTINUED E CONOMIC GROWTH IN THIS COUNTR Y. AND IN ORDE R TO DO THAT, WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST IN THE THINGS THAT MAKE O UR ECONOMY COMPETITIVE. OUR ECONOMY IS NOT GOING TO GO JUST BECAUSE. IT'S GOING TO GROW BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST SCHOOL S OR ARE WORK ING TOWARDS HAV ING THE BEST SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT WORKFORCE - -NONE OF THAT HAPPENS ON ITS OWN. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE THO SE INVESTMENTS. THE ECONOMY CANNOT KEEP GROWIN G OF PEOPLE ARE NOT HEA LTHY OR IF WE REMAIN AS DIVIDED AS A ARE. THAT IS GOING TO CATCH UP TO US. S. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ON TOP OF THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT. R EMEMBER WHEN WE USE D TO HEAR FROM REPUBLICANS ABOUT THE DEFICIT IN THE DEBT. I T'S $1 TRILLION AN D GROWING. WE GOT A GE T A HANDLE ON THAT, AND WE CAN WITH RESPON SIBLE INVESTMENTS AND RESPONSIBLE TAXATION, BUT YES, AS K THE WEA LTHIEST INCORPORATI ONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE, BUT IT'S COMPLE TELY COMPATIBLE WITH GROWTH. ONE OTHER T HING I WANT TO POI NT OUT. I'M WORRIED WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ECONOMY WE ARE COUNTING TH E WRONG THINGS. BECAUSE A LOT OF CO MMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDWEST, ARE NOT SEE ING THE KIND OF BENEFITS WE SEE ON PAPER. IT'S GREAT THE D OW JON ES IS DOING WE LL. BUT SO MANY PEO PLE ARE BEING L EFT BEHIND. IT IS WHY W HEN I AM P RESIDENT WE WILL MEASURE THE PERFORM ANCE OF OUR ECONOMY NOT BY THE DOW JONES, NOT BY THE GDP, BUT BY THE INCOME GROW TH OF THE 90%. IF YOU ARE WOR KING AND YOUR INCOME IS GROWING, TH AT COUNTS TOWARDS A GOOD ECONOM Y IN MY BOOK. [CHEERING] >> THIS IS FRO M JULIE M. AN D SHE ASKS, WHAT CAN WE DO T O BE TTER C OUNTER THE POLARIZ ATION AND FRACTURES WHEN THE PA RTY AND NATION TO G ET TO A LEADER THAT IS REC OGNIZ ED AS FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: VERY GOOD. HI, JULIE. THAN KS FOR COMING. SO, THIS IS SO IMPOR TANT. LET'S START WITH THE PA RTY BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY IMPO RTANT, RIGHT? THE PRIMARY PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO HELP YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCES AMONG ALL O F US DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. THAT'S FINE . THAT IS HEALTHY. BU T WE'VE GOT TO REME MBER WE ARE ON THE SAME TEAM A T THE END OF THE DAY. WE'VE GOT T O BUILD EA CH OTHER UP. HOW MANY PE OPLE HAVE RUN FOR PRESIDE NT, 25? 24 DON'T GE T TO BE THE N OMI NEE. THE MOMENT WE IDENTIFY TH E ONE WHO IS EVERYBODY E LSE HAS TO RALLY AROUND THAT NOMINE E THE MATTER WHO IT IS. WE - - US CANDIDAT ES NEED TO MAKE SUR E OUR SUPPORTERS ARE FOCUSED ON THAT, TOO. LOOK I THINK IN A ROOM, EVE RYPLACE I HAVE BEEN TO, WE HAVE HAD HEALTHY , RESPECTFUL CONVERSATIO NS AMONG DIFFERENT C AMPS. ONLINE CAN BE A LITTLE , B IT OF A WEIRD PLA CE . TRY TO PUT A LI TTL E GOOD OUT ON LINE, TOO. BUT WE GOT TO REME MBER WE ARE ON T HE SAME TEAM. IF THERE WA S EVER A REAS ON TO U NIFY AN D GET OVE R THE 10% OR 20% OF T HE THINGS WE DO NOT AGREE O N IS LOOKING TO THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT U S ALL AGREEING. IT IS THE S AME THING WITH MY MESSAGE TO REPUBLICANS . I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK AN YBO DY INT O THINKING WE WILL ALL AGREE. LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN BUILD TOGETHER. EVERYONE HA S TO SEE WHERE THEY FIT IN THAT FUT URE. WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT HAVE , OH, W E GOT AIR COMING IN. ALL RIG HT. WE C ANNOT R EMA IN THIS DIVIDE D AND SUCCEED AS A COUNTRY. AND LET'S REMEM BER TH AT THE PEOPLE WE KNOW AND LO VE WHO VO TED D IFFERENTLY THAN WE DID, THAT D OESN'T MAK E THEM BAD PEOPLE ANYM ORE THEN VOTING WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE RIGHT WAY MADE US GOOD PEO PLE. WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT ALL OF US CAN H AVE BETTER THINGS AND WORST T HINGS AROUSED IN US BY LE ADE RSHIP. AND ONE OF THE REASON THE PRESIDENCY MATTER SO M UCH IS IS IT CA LLING OUT TO WHAT IS BEST IN US, OR CALL ING OUT TO WHAT IS WORST IN US? I BE LIEVE W E WILL BE A MORE UNIF IED COUNTRY WIT H THE PRESIDENT I AM DETERM INED TO BE WHO CALLS OUT TO WHAT IS BEST IN US AND ASKED U S TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP FOR THE COUNTRY. [CHEERING] >> THIS QUESTI ON IS FROM ANOTHER JUL IE. JULIE P. TH E QUESTIO N IS , PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTE D TO DO SO MA NY THINGS. HOW WILL YO U HA NDLE THIS? MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: YES. ALL RIGHT. SO, PRESIDE NT OBAMA EXPERIENCE THE CHALLEN GES OF BAD , RESISTANCE IN TODAY'S WASHINGTON. ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD PAUSE FOR A SECON D AN D REMEMBER THAT REVERS ING A GREAT DEPRESSION, BRINGING BA CK THE AUTO INDUSTRY, COVERING TE NS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS A ND CAPTURI NG AND KILLING OSAMA BIN LADEN, NOT TOO BAD FOR EIG HT Y EARS OF WORK. BU T, EVEN S O, WE SAW A RE SISTANCE RIGHT AND LEFT. BY RIGHT LE FT, I DO NOT ME AN POLITICALLY. ANYTIME YOU STEP INTO W ASHINGTON. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE HAV E GOING FOR US THAT IS TRUE EVE N M ORE THAN I T WAS 10 YEARS AG O, EVEN MORE T HAN WHAT PRESIDENT O BAMA HAD TO WORK WITH THAT I T IS THIS , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THESE CHANGES. EV EN IN MORE CONSER VATIV E STATES, WHAT WE TALK ABO UT ISSUES FROM MAKING SURE THAT P EOPLE GET PAID MORE AND RAISING WAG ES TO MA KING SURE THAT WE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODYGE T, ONE WAY OR THE OTHE R, TO D ELIVERI NG PAID FAMILY LEAVE, EVEN ISSUES WHERE MY PARTY HAS BEEN ON DEFENSE , IMMIGRATION , GUNS. RIGHT NOW 8 0% OF REPUBLICANS AND MOST GUN OW NERS THIN K WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE DOING BA CKGROUND CHECKS. WHAT WE HAVE RIG HT NOW I S A POWERFUL AM ERICAN MA JORITY THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE T O GET THE RIGHT THING DONE. AND T HAT WILL M EAN NOT ONLY TA KING THE PRESIDENCY. THAT IS THE BEGINNING. NOT ONLY SE EKING TO TAKE THE SE NATE, BECAUSE IT SURE WOULD BE NI CE TO HAVE MITCH MCCONNELL NO LONGER B E THE SENATE MAJORITY LE ADER. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WE GOT TO W ORK ON THAT. IT'S PART O F WHY HAVI NG A CA NDIDATE WITH COATTAILS WILL BE HEL PFUL. THE MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SENATE, ON THE FLOOR, REME MBERING THAT EACH OF THOSE MEMBERS, EA CH OF THOSE SENATORS HAVE TO ANS WER TO VOTERS. THE VOTERS ARE WITHE US US . THE BEST US E I CAN THINK OF THAT BIG BL UE AND WHITE A IRPL ANE IS TO FLY INTO THE HOME ST ATE OF ANYBODY GETTING AND THE WAY OF A CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED T HAT IS GOOD FOR AM ERICA, THAT, IS POPULAR AND MORE CONSERVATIVE STATES AND ASK THE IR VOTER S TO ASK THEIR SENATOR WHY THEY AR E BEING DEFIE D. I BELIEVE T HAT MIGHT BE WHAT IT TAKES TO REUNITE SOME OF THESE FOLKS WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE. >> THIS QUESTI ON IS FROM JULIE D. [LAUGHTER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: LOT OF JULI ES. >> WE'RE IN IO WA. MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: THAT LAND OF MANY JUL IES . [LAUGHTER] >> JULIE D ASK S, WHA T DO YOU THINK OF TH E SNL FOR TRA IL OF YOU , PORT RAYAL O F YOU? [LA UGHTER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: I DON'T SEE IT AT ALL. I D ON'T SEE THE RES EMBL ANCE. NO, I'LL AD MIT THAT I FEEL ALIT T LE BIT OF NERV OUSNESS WHEN SATURD AY NIGHT ROLLS AROUND. I H EARD IT' S SATURDAY AT 8:00 BUT I THINK IT IS A RERUN. WE'LL PROBABLY AL L RIGHT. I USED TO L OOK FORWAR D TO HAVING A GOOD LAUGH. NOT I GOT TO WOND ER IF I 'M GOING TO GET MADE FUN OF. IF THERE IS EVER GOO D PROBLEM TO HAVE, I GUESS THIS WOULD BE IT. [APP LAUSE] IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN. > > THI S NEXT Q UESTI ON IS FROM DUDNER NDER H. I HOPE I'M PR ONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY. MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] >> WHAT DO YOU THIN K THE E XTENT OF FOREIGN INV OLVEMENT SHOULD BE, MORE OR LES S? WHAT SPECIF IC ISSUES LONG OR SHO RT TERM? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: I IMAGINE Y OU ARE THINKING ABOUT U.S. INVOLV EMENT IN THE WORLD AND H OW WE ENGAGE IN THE WORLD AROUND US? SO, I BELIEVE I N A VERY ENGAGED AMERICA, BU T THAT DOESN' T MEAN YOU MARCH I N AND CHAN GE OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY AT GUNPOINT. WE'VE SEEN HOW TH AT WORKS OUT. AND ONE THI NG I BEL IEVE WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS RE PLACE THI S AUTHOR IZATION FOR THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE THAT WAS PA SSED TO DEAL WIT H 9/11 BUT NOW HAS FOLKS IN PLACES LIKE EAST A FRICA AND WE GOT FOLKS P ACKING THEIR BAGS FOR AF GHANISTAN THAT WEREN' T EVE N BORN ON 9/11. WE HAVE TO BRING AN END TO E NDLE SS WAR, AND IT STAR TS BY CHANGING THE AUTHORI ZATION PROCESS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A R ESPONSIBILITY IN FORCE. NOW, HAVING SAID THAT, EVEN WITH A HIGHER BAR FOR USE OF FORCE, W E SHOULD BE M UCH MORE ENGAGED USING OUR OTHER T OOLS OF THE TOOLKIT , IF A MEDIC AND ECONOMI C. I WOULD ARG UE THAT THE WORLD NEEDS AMERICA RIGHT NOW, BUT IT CAN' T JBE JUST AN Y AMERICA . IT CANNOT BE T HE AMERICA THIS PRESIDENT THAT HAS , THIS PRESID ENT HAS REDUCED US TO. ONE MORE CO UNTRY SCRAPPING T O ADVANTAGE. THAT HAS TO BE IN AMERI CA WHOSE POLIC IES ARE BASED ON OF VALUE S. AND THE FACT TH AT OUR VALUES, WHEN WE ARE BEING H ER BEST, OUR VALUES LINE UP WITH UNIVERSAL V ALUES AND THAT IS TRUE FOR OUR COM PETITORSLIKE LIKE THE WA Y THA T CH INA IS TR EATING A RELIGIOUS MINORITY OR THE PROTESTERS OF HONG KONG S TANDI NG UP FOR DEMO CRACY, THEY NEED TO KNOW THEY H AVE A FRIEND IN THE UNITED STAT ES. IT IS ALSO OUR ALLIES, SEE ING THE WAY THE SAUDI ARABI A AND TURKEY HAVE BEHAVED, BECAUSE THE Y KNOW THERE IS A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT CARE. WE HAVE TO SEND A M ESSAGE THAT WE DO CARE. AND W E WILL HAVE NOT TRIEDYING T O SINGLE-H AND EDLY CHANGE EVER Y COUNTRY AFTER OUR O WN IMAGE BUT TRYING TO MAKE SUR E T HERE IS MORE PEACE AND PROSPER ITY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IF T HERE WERE MORE PEACE AND PROSPER ITY AND STABILI TY IN CENTRAL AMERICA WE WOULD HA VE LESS OF A MIGRATION I SSUE. IF THERE WAS M ORE STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW THE ENTIRE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF. WE HAVE AN INTEREST HE AND BRING THAT ABOUT , INTEREST IN BRINGING THAT ABOUT AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT, NOT A LONE, BUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN INT ERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT WAS TO SEE THOSE SAME THINGS HAPPEN. [CH EERING] >> FROM CRAIG F. HOW WOULD Y OU A DDRESS THE FEDERAL DEF ICIT? MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. CRAIG? SO, MAYBE I T'S A GENE RATIONAL THING. I'M MUCH MO RE INCLIN ED TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAN MOST PEOPLE IN MY PARTY HA VE BEEN, WHICH IS IRONIC B ECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT IT MY PA RTY HAS G OTTEN MUCH BETTER TRAC K RECORD IN TERMS OF EVERY PRESI DENCY IN MY LIFETIME WHERE THE DEBT WE NT D OWN O R UP. TH LONGER Y OU'RE PLANNING TO BEE HERE, THE MORE THIS MIGHT CATCH UP TO US. W E HAVE TO LOO K AT THIS AS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS BETWEEN GEN ERATIONS BECAUSE SOMEBODY HA S TO PLAY THE BILL , P AAY THE B ILL. THE G OOD NE WS IS WE CAN GET THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTR OL WITH TWO THINGS ANDIN MIND. ONLY KEEP P ROMIS ES WE CAN KEEP , ONLY MAKE P ROMIS ES WE CAN KEEP. RIGHT NOW W E ARE WATCHING THE DOLLARS AND THE PENNIES. WHEN IT COM ES TO COLLEGE, I'M A BIG BELIE VE R IN MAKING S URE COST IS NO LONGER A BARRIER F OR ANYONE TO GO TO COLLEGE, BU T ALSO THINK IT I MATTERS HOW MUCH INCOME YOU MAKE IT IF YOU A RE IN THAT TOP 10%, I STILL WAN T YOU TO THRIVE, BUT I'M GOING T O ASK YOU TO PAY YOUR OWN TUITION SO WE CAN SAVE THOSE DOLLARS FOR OTHER THINGS AND TARGET THEM WHERE THEY MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. IT'S WHY WE 'VE W ORKED HARD TO CRE ATE A HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT S OLVES THAT PROBLEM, THAT MAKES SURE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNINSURED A MERICAN BUT INSTEAD OF $50 TRIL LION OV ER 50 YEARS, IT'S $1.5, BUT STILL A LOT OF MONEY BUT A N AMOUNT OF MONEY WE CAN OBTA IN BY TAKING RESPONSIBLE STEPS, LIKE ROLLING BAC K TRUMP TAX C UTS THAT BENEFIT CORPORATION S AND THE WEALTHY. I MEAN, IF YO U PAID A DOLL AR AND FEDERAL INCOME TAXE S LAST YEAR YOU PAID MORE THAN A MAZON DID. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE GOT CORP ORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. SOME OF THE M HAVE NEGATIVE TA X RATES. I'D LIKE TO GET IN O N THAT. NE GATIVE TA X RATE, FOR S OME OF THE MOST PR OFITABLE COMPANIES. WE GOT TO H AVE REAL E NFORCEMENT. REFORM THE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES SO THERE IS SOME KIN D OF COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WAY YOU GET TAXED ON A PAYCHECK AN D THE WAY YOU GET TAXED ON A HEDGE FUND. I'M NOT EVEN TA LKIN G ABOUT TAKIN G US BACK TO THE EISENHOWER YEARS. THIS IS NOT SOME LE VEL OF TAXATION THAT IS INCOMPAT IBLE WITH GROWTH. THIS IS RES PONSIBLY FUNDING OUR GOVERNMENT. IF WE DO TH AT, THEN WE ALSO CAN START REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SER VIC E DOLLARS THA T ARE GOING INTO DEBT S ERVIC E WHEN THEY C OULD BE GOING INTO PROGRAMS TH AT WILL MAKE US BETTER OFF. WE CAN DO T HIS IF WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO RESTRAIN WH AT WE ARE PROMISING ON THE FRON T END AND MAKE SU RE T HOSE WHO ARE BEST POSITIONED TO SUPPORT THIS COUNTRY ARE ACTUALL Y PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. [CHE ERING] >> SO, THIS IS OUR FINA L QUEST ION. I T COMES FROM DANIEL M. IT COMES FR OM DANIEL M. >> RIGHT HERE. MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] >> WHERE DO YO U STAND O N GUN RIGH TS? MAY OR BUTTIGIEG: SO, HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE. FIRST OF AL L, I AM WITH THE MAJORIT Y OF GUN OWNERS, REP UBLICANS , DEMOCRATS, AND AMERICANS WHO THINK THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE JUST COMMON SENSE. YOU KNOW, YOU N EED ONE TO GET A JOB. GOT TO HAVE ONE , AND, BY THE WAY, THERE IS THIS LOOPHO LE WHERE IF TH BACKG ROUND CHECK DOES NOT CO ME BACK THEY JUST GIVE YOU TH EE GU CAN YOU IMAGINEN IN . THE HIRING PROCESS IF THE BACKGROUND CHECK WAS LATE, H IRE THEM ANYWAY . OF COURSE NOT. ANOTHE R THI NG I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS RED FLAG LAWS. THIS IS WHE N SOMEBODY IDENTIFIES A LOVED ONE THAT COULD BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES , LET'S NOT O VERLOOK HOW MUCH SU ICIDE IS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM WE ARE FACING HERE . WE OUGHT TO HAVE A MEANS FOR MAKING SURE THAT W HEN SOMEBODY IS A DANGER , W HE THER IT IS DOMESTIC AB USE OR ONE OF THESE OTHER CHALL ENGES, THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DANGER. AND I ALSO BELI EVE THAT WE NEE D TO LOOK AT WHA T KIND OF WEAPONRY WE SOLD. WE GO T TO DRAW A LINE SOME WH ERE. SOME FOLKS WILL DISAGREE ON WHERE IT OUGHT TO GO. ANYT HING RE MOTELY RESEMBLING THE STUFF I WAS TRAIN ING ON TO GO OV ER IN AFGHANIS TAN HAS NO BUSINESS BEING SOLD FOR PR OFIT ANYWHERE NEAR A SCHOOL. [ CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WE JUST DON 'T NEED IT. ALL OF THIS IN MY VIEW IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SECOND AMEN DMENT. NONE OF THIS WILL B E A GUARAN TEE D WAY TO PREVENT EVERYTHING WILL TRAGEDY, BUT IT WILL SAV E THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSAN DS OF LIVES. AND I BELIE VE WE OWE IT TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN T HIS COUNTR Y TODAY, I HE ARD FRO M A 14 WORLD GIRL WHO WROTE ME SAYING SHE WAS SO AFRAID THAT HER DAY AT SCHOOL W OULD BE HER LAST TH AT SHE HAS WRITTEN OUT A WILL AT THE AGE OF 14. NO OTHER MO DERN COUN TRY HAS THIS HAPPENED AT THIS RAT E. AND I REFUS E TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT O UR COUNTRY IS SOMEHOW INFERIOR AN D JUST OUGHT TO PUT UP W ITH THI S. AMERICANS D ESERVE AS MUCH SAFETY IS ANYONE ELSE IS A WORLD AND WE CAN BE COMPLETELY CONSTITUTIO NAL AND COMPLET ELY RATIONAL AND DO SOME THING ABOUT THESE GUNS. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. WHOOPS. SOR RY ABOUT THAT. ONE MORE BI G TH ANK YOU TO CHAR LOTTE F OR BEING YOUR VOICE THIS EVENIN G. PLEI WANT T O THANK AL L OF YOU AGAIN F OR C ARING ABOUT WE AR E HEADED AS A COUNTRY AND FOR BEI NG INVOLVED. I WANT TO LEAVE YO U WITH THIS. I THINK A L OT OF US A RE WATCHIN G THE PROCESS IN WASHINGTON AND JUST FEELING EXH AUSTED BY IT, BECA USE WE KNOW WHA T IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN. IT GOES TO THE SENATE AND SOMETIM ES IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE GO ING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND THERE I S A SENSE OF EXHAUSTION. THAT IS HOW THEY GET US, THOUGH. WE CANNOT GIVE IN TO EXHAUSTI ON AND CYNICISM AND TURNED OFF THE PRO CESS COMPLETELY. WE CAN'T. W E HAVE GOT TO MAKE SUR E THAT WE TAKE CONTROL. AND THE GRE AT N EWS IS IN A FEW SHORT DAYS IT'LL BE 2002 AND , BE 2020 AND WH AT HAPPEN S IN 2020 IS IT IS IN OUR HAND S. NO MATTER W HAT GOES ON ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENA TE, IT IS U P TO US B RING AB OUT A BETTER FUTURE. THAT IS YOU R POWER. THAT IS MY SOURC E OF HOPE. IT TAKES HOPE TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS AT ANY LEVE L. ARE YOU READY TO SPREAD A SE NSE OF HOPE TO EVERYBODY OR YOU KNOW ? ARE YOU READY T O BRING ABOUT A BETTER FUTURE FOR US AND FOR THOSE WE LOVE?

SAAGAR HAS STUDIED EXTENSIVELY ACROSS THE GLOBE, SPEN DING THREE CONTINENTS AND HAS VIS ITED OVER 40 COUNTRIES. I'M PROUD T O IN TRODUCE TO YOU ONE OF OUR NEW COU NTY BLANKLEY FELLOWS AND THE PANEL, SAAGAR ENJETI WHO WILL INTRODUCE OUR PANEL. PLEA SE COME UP. [APPLAUSE] (music) SAAGAR: THA NK YOU, EVERYBODY. WE WILL TAK E A MOMENT WH ILE ONE OF OUR CO-P ANELIST S GETS MICED UP. IT HAS BEEN SOMETHING C ONSERVATISM HAS BEEN CO NCERNED A BOUT FOR A LONG TIME , THE IDEA OF UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGT ON MAKING DECI SIONS ABOUT IMPORTANT T HINGS THAT GOVERN ORDERLY LIVES. , GOVERN OUR DAILY L IVES. TIME, PEOPL E MAKI NG DECISIONS A BOUT OUR DAILY LIVES. HE GOES BAC K TO THE 1880'S. ONE OF THE FIRST R EGULATORY AGENCIES CR EATED WAS THE INT ERSTATE COMMERCE CO MMISSION, AND THAT WAS ON E MARKETS IN AMERICA WER E EXCHANGED , WERE CHANGING, T HERE WERE RAILRO ADS, GOODS BEING EXCHA NGED ACROSS STATE LINES . WOODROW WIL SON CREATED THE FEDERAL RES ERVE, TH E FEDERAL TRADE COMMI SSION, ONCE AGAIN GOVERNMENT INSERTING ITSELF INTO THE WAY WE CONDUCT COMMERCE WITH EACH OTHER. WE WERE A G ROW ING COUNTRY, EXCHANGING GOODS, AND THROUGH THE INDUSTR IAL REVOLUTION AND ALL THIS DY NAMISM, I T CAUSED PROBLEMS AND THE GOV ERNMENT STARTED TO INSERT I TSELF. WE SHOULD ALL BE CONC ERNED. THAT IS WHY WE H AVE OUR ILLUSTRIOUS PANELISTS. WE HAVE PET ER WALTO N, AME RICAN EN TERPRISE INSTITUTE, AUTHOR OF "" JUDICIAL FORTITUDE: THE LAST CHANCE TO REIGN IN THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE."" ILY A SHAPIR O'S D IRECTOR OF CONSTITUTIO NAL STUDIES AT THE CATO INSTIT UTE. PLEASE WELC OME OUR PANELISTS. [APPLAUSE] SAAGAR: I W ANT TO G IVE BOT H AN OPP ORTUNITY TO MAKE OPE NING REMARKS. PETER IS IN TERESTING , GOING OVER ARGUMENTS I N THE BOOK. I WANT TO MAK E SURE THEY B OTH GIVE YOU A FRAMEWORK FOR THE DIS CUSSION, BEFORE WE GET TO MY Q UESTIONS A ND YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL. PETER, WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU, OPENIN G REMARKS TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. PETER: THAN KS. I'M GOING TO OUTLINE KEY ARGUMENTS I N JUDICIAL FO RTITUDE, THAT IS THE BOOK PE ERED THE FIRST LINE IN THE BOOK IS PROBABLY THE MOST IM PORT ANT. ""WE WILL LOSE O UR DEMOCRACY UNLESS WE C AN GAIN CONTROL OF THE AGENCIES OF THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE."" THE BOOK IS ABOUT THE CONTINU OUS DRIFT TOWAR D GOVERNMENT BY UNELECTED O FFICIALS IN WASHINGT ON, WHICH WE CA LL GENERALLY THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, AND HOW WE CAN STOP THIS DRIFT. THE DRIFT I S HAPPENIN G BECAUSE, SI NCE THE NEW DEAL, C ONGRESS HA S BEEN GI VING THE AGENCY'S EXTRAORDINARY POWER, THE POWER A LMOS T TO MAKE LAW S THEMSE LVES. BUT CONGRESS WON'T STOP ON ITS OWN DOING THIS, BECAU SE IT IS EASIER FOR THEM. THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE DI FFICULT DECISIONS LEGISLATION REQUIRES. ALL THEY HA VE T O DO IS PASS TO THE AGENCY THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, AND THEN THEY ARE HOME FREE A ND NOT SUBJECT ANY ELECTIONS T O HAVE TO JUSTIFY DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. F OR EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE COMES UP TO A CONGRESSM AN AND ASKS WHY HI S FARM PO ND, THE PONTE U SES TO FEED HIS AN IMALS , IS GETTING REGULATED B Y THE EPA, THE CO NGRESSMAN SAYS, I DID N'T VOTE FOR THAT, THAT IS THIS OUT-OF-CONT ROL AGENCY. BUT IN FACT , THE CONGRES SMAN DID VOTE FOR TH AT BY GIVING THAT POWER TO REGULATE FARM PONDS TO THE AGENCY. SO IT IS A WAY CONGRESS CAN BE UNAC COUNTAB LE, BUT ALSO AV OID A LOT OF THE THINGS WE WANT CON GRESS TO BE INVOL VED IN, MAKING THE MAJOR DECISIONS FOR ALL THE LEGISLA TION THEY PASS. MORE IMPORT ANT, WHEN CONGRE SS DELEGATES B ROAD, LAWM AKING POWER TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, I T IS VIOLA TING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS I N THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTIT UTION VESTS ALL POWER TO MAKE LAW S I N CONGRESS . ARTICLE ONE OF THE CONS TITUTION SAYS CONGRESS SH ALL HAVE ALL POWER TO MAKE LAW S. ARTICLE II GIVES PO WER TO ENFORCE THE LAWS TO THE EXEC UTIVE BRANCH. AN ARTICLE III , AND ARTICLE III GIVES P OWER TO INTERPRET THE LAWS TO THE JUDI CIA RY. THE FRAMERS THOUGHT LIB ERTY WOULD BE ENDANGER ED IF THE SAME PERSON OR GROUP HA D T HE OPP ORTUNITY BOTH TO MAK E THE LAW AND TO ENFO RCE THE LAW. THEY LOOKED AROUND THE WORLD I N THE LATE 1700S WHEN THEY WERE DEVELOPING THE CONSTITUTIO N, AND THEY SAW WH ERE A KING COUL D MAKE THE LA W AND ENFORCE THE LAW, TI ERNEY WAS THE RESULT. FROM THEIR PERSP ECTIVE, THE MOST IM PORTANT THING IN THE CONS TITUTION WAS THE STR UCTURE, THE SEPARAT ION OF POWERS. AND THEY WA NTED TO MAINTAIN THAT AS OFTEN AND AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS EXA CTLY THE PROBLEM WE ARE HAVING TODAY, BECA USE THE POWERS ARE NO LONG ER SEPA RATED I F THE CONGRESS IS GIVING, DELEGATING ITS LEGAL A UTHORITY TO MAKE LAWS T O THE EXEC UTIVE B RANCH, PARTICULARLY TO THESE AG ENCIES MADE UP OF UNELE CTED OFFICIALS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS, HO W DO WE S TOP THIS CONSTANT DE LEGATION OF POWER TO UNELECTE D OFFICIALS W HO BASICALLY A LL LIVE AROUND WASHINGTON DC, REFLECT THE PRIORITIES OF THE PEOP LE AROUND WASHINGTON DC, AND NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO WOULD BE ORDINARI LY REPRESENTED BY THEIR CO NGRESS PEOPLE. AND THOSE V OTES BY CONGRESS PEOPLE WOULD BE TH E VOTES OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE. BUT WHEN TH EY H ANDED OVER TO EXECUTIVE AGENCIES, T HEY ARE GI VING UP THE RIGH TS OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS. THE SEPARAT IONS OF POWER , TH E SEPARATION OF POWERS WAS SO IMPO RTANT T O FRAMERS THAT THEY SET UP THE JUDI CIARY TO PROTECT IT. AND THIS WE KNO W FROM A FEDERALIST PAPER, 70 E IGHT, B Y ALEXANDER HAMILTON, WHO CALLED THE JUDICIA RY THE GUARDIANS OF THE CONSTIT UTION. HE SAID JUD GES WERE GIVEN LIFETIME APPOINTMENT S SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE FO RTITUDE, THE LANGUAGE I USE IN THE BOOK, THE F ORTITU DE T O STAND UP TO THE ELEC TED BRA NCHES, T HAT IS THE CONGRESS AN D THE PRESIDENT, IF THOSE BRANCHES WE RE DOING THINGS THAT CHANGE D THE WAY THE CON STITUTION WAS SUPPOSE D TO WORK. WE ARE EXAC TLY IN THAT SITUAT ION TODAY, BECA USE WHAT WE SEE HAPP ENING IS THE SYSTEM BEING CHANGED. INSTEAD OF CONGRESS MA KING THE LAWS, THEY ARE PA SSING THE LAWMAKI NG OVER TO THE EXEC UTIVE BRANCH. THIS WOULD HAVE APPALL ED OUR FRAMERS , AN D THE THING W E HAVE TO FIGURE O UT IS HOW WE CAN STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. THE BOOK AR GUES THAT THE WAY TO STOP THIS I S TO RESTO RE SOM ETHING C ALLED THE NONDELEGATI ON DOCTRINE. T HAT SOUNDS LEGA LISTIC. IT IS ACTUA LLY VERY SIMPLE. AND WHAT IT MEANS IS TH AT THE COURTS OF THE POWER, THEY WERE GIVEN THAT POWER BY TH E CONSTITUTIO N. THEY HAVE T HE POWER TO DECLARE WHEN AN ACT OF CONGRESS VI OLATES TH E CONSTITUTIO NAL STRUCTURE. THIS IS DIF FERENT F ROM VIOLAT ING THE CONSTIT UTION WITH A POLICY OF SOME KIN D. THE COURTS SHOULD OFTE N STAY OUT OF THAT SITUATION, BUT WHEN YO U WERE TALKIN G ABOUT CHANGING TH E CONSTITUTIO NAL STRUCTURE, THE WHOLE SEPARATION OF POWERS S TRUCTURE, AS WE HAVE TOD AY, THEIR CONGR ESS, T HE COURTS, THE SUPREME COURT IN PARTICUL AR, SHOULD STEP IN AND DECLARE A LAW THAT DELEGA TES POWER TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO B E UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT IS POS SIBLE NOW IN A PRACTICAL W AY, BECAUS E WE HAVE HAD TWO NEW JUSTICES AP POINTED TO THE SUPR EME COU RT, JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE CAV ANAUGH , KAVANAUGH. THEY JOIN T HREE OTHER JUSTICES ON THE SUPR EME COU RT WHO ALL CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONSTITUTIONALISTS. WHAT THAT M EANS IS TH AT THEY B ELIEVE THE CONSTIT UTION, THE STRUCTURE A T LEAST OF THE CONSTITUTION, SHOULD BE P RESERVED AT ALL COST S. SO I THINK AS WE APPROACH THE NEXT CO UPLE OF YEARS, WHEN CASES WILL START COME TO THE COURT W HERE THE I SSUE OF NONDELEGATI ON CAN BE CONSIDER ED BY THE JUST ICES, W E HAVE A GOOD SHOT HERE THAT T HE NONDELEGATI ON DOCTRINE WILL BE RESTORED. W HAT DOES T HAT DO? IT FORCES C ONG RESS, I F A LAW IS DECLARED IN VALID BECAUSE IT IS DELEGATING AUTHORITY TO THE EXEC UTIVE BRANCH, IT FORCES C ONGRESS TO GO BACK AND RECONSIDER THAT LAW, A ND MAKE TH E BIG DEC ISIONS IN THAT LAW ITSELF. THAT IS WHA T THIS BOOK IS ABOUT. SAAG AR: ILY A, OPENI NG REMARKS AND THEN WE WILL GET TO QUESTIONS. ILYA: I WAN T TO TAL K ABOUT TWO CASES FROM THIS PAST TERM OF THE SUPR EME COU RT THAT SHOW BOTH SIDES OF TH E SAME COIN, AND T HE PUS HBACK AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. I WA NT TO THANK THE STEAMBO AT INSTITUTE, JENNIFER SC HUBERT- A KIN AND TH E STA FF HERE. THIS IS A G REAT ORG ANIZATION AND I'M DEL IGHTED TO HAVE THE FI RST OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU FRESHLY OFF THE SKI SLOPE I N MY SWEATY SKI TOGS. W E WERE BOT H ON THE PROG RAM AT THE PROGRAM OF THE ROCK IES, PE TER AND I, EARLIER THIS YEAR, DELIGHTED T O DO THAT. THE T WO CASES I WANT TO MENTION OUR GUNBY A ND K AISER. GUNBY AT KA ISER I S A NON-DELEGAT ION CASE, ONLY EIGHT JUSTICES PARTICIPATI NG, BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIR ST WEEK OF THE TERM WHEN BRETT KAVAN AUGH WAS STILL A NSWE RING Q UESTIONS TO THE SENATE, AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS A LOSS, 5-3, THE COURT REJECTED A CHALLENGE T O A STATUT E, A FEDERAL SEX OFFENDER RE GISTRY STATUTE, AN D REJECTED THE IDEA TH AT IT GAV E TOO MUCH POWER TO TH E ATTORNEY GENERAL TO WRITE THE REGULAT IONS. BUT JUSTICE GOR SUCH WROTE A BLISTERING DISSENT, JOINED IN FULL BY JOH N ROBERT S, SO ME PEOPLE ESSA Y IS HE GOING WOBBLY ARCHERY ANG LE EATIN G, JOINED INFO , OR , GOING WOBBL Y OR T RIANGULATI NG, JOINED BY T HOMAS, ALITO DIDN' T AGRE E WITH THE REASONING O F THE LIBE RAL JUSTICES, AND SAID WH EN THERE IS A MAJORITY WILLING TO RECONSID ER NOT DELEGAT ION, HE MIGHT GO IN ON THAT. PR ESUMABLY THAT MEANS IN TH E NEXT CASE, WHEN KAVANA UGH I S PARTICIPATI NG, ALITO MIGHT GO THERE AND W E MIGHT HAVE FIVE VOTES TO FO RCE CONGRESS TO HOLD CONGRESS' F EET TO THE CONS TITUTIONAL FIRE AND TELL THEM Y OU CAN'T PASS THE TR UTH AND BEAUTY ACTIVE 2019 AND LET THE BUREAUCRACY FAILING WHA TEVER IT WANTS TO DO. THE FLI PSIDE IS THE KAIS ER CASE AND HOW MUC H DEFERENCE JUDGES GIVE ADMINI STRAT IVE AGENCIES. ON ONE SIDE IS CON GRESS GI VING BROAD DISCRETION TO AGENCIES. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS JUD GES NOT HOLDING AGENCIES' FEET TO THE FIRE. D OCTRINES H AVE DEVELO PED OF JUDICIAL DE FERENCE TO AGENCIES , THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE, W HERE AGENCIES IN TERPRET THE STATUTES THAT GIVE T HEM POWER. WHAT WAS AT ISSUE THIS YEAR, THE A UER DOCTRI NE, A GENCIES REINTERPRETING THEIR PAST REGULATIONS. THE COURT B Y A 5-4 VOTE DID NOT THR OW OUT THE AUER DO CTRI NE, BUT THE MAJORIT Y, THE LIBERALS PLUS JOHN R OBERTS, TR IED TO TIGHTEN THE STANDAR DS, SAID WE WIL L ONLY DEFER TO AG ENCIES IN THIS CONTEX T WHEN THEY SHOW EXPERT ISE, WHEN THEY ARE AC TING AS ECONOMIS TS OR SCIENTISTS, NOT SIMPLY AS L AWYERS, AGENCY LAWY ERS, WHEN THE IS SUE I S TR ULY TH AT THE RE GULATION IS AMBIGUOU S AND THEY CO ULD REINTERPRET IT. OTHER R EGUL ATIONS ARE TIGHTEN ING THAT SCRUTINY LAND WE WIL L SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN LOWER CO URTS IN THE NEXT FI VE YEARS. GORSUCH, BL ISTERING, THIS TIME CONCURRENT BECAUSE THE Y THROUGHOUT THE LOWER COURT DECIS ION, A DISSENT IN ALL BUT NAME, SAYIN G WE S HOULD THROW OUT T HIS DOCTRINE ALTOGETHER. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPEN S. THERE IS AN APPETITE ON THE COURT FOR REINING IN AGENCIES IN TERMS OF JUDGES PUSH ING BAC K ON THEM AND FO RCING CONGRESS TO BE MORE SPECIF IC AN D NARROWER IN TERMS OF AUTHORIT Y AGENCIES ARE GIVEN. SAAGAR: THE DEBATE AROUND THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE IS A DEBATE AR OUND POWER AND THE ROL E OF GOV ERNMENT, AND HOW CONSERV ATIVES SHOULD APPROACH IT . A CURR ENT D EBATE IS ROILING CONSERVATIS M. IT'S AS IF CORPORATION S AND THE MEDIA ARE A GAINST US, THAT TH EY ARE TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY OF LIFE ON THE UNITED STAT ES. THERE IS NO FORCE MORE POWERFUL THAN THEM B UT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND DEFECT OVER THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE TO STEP IN ON BEHALF OF THE CITI ZENS AND UPHOLD THEIR WAY O F LIFE. I WANT TO GET YOUR RESPONSE ON WHY THAT MAY BE THE WRONG TACTIC? PET ER: THE REAL DANGER IS T HE AMERICAN PE OPLE, IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS DRIFT OF POWER TO ADMINIST RATIVE AGENCIES, T HE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT REPR ESENTING THEM. THAT IS WHA T THIS GROUP IS SA YING. IF THAT HAP PENS, IT THREATEN S THE LEGITIMACY OF THE U.S. GOVERN MENT. AND IT ALSO THREAT ENS THE WILLINGNESS OF PEOPLE T O OBEY THE LAWS. THE AMERICA N PE OPLE ARE VERY LA W OBSERVING, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL OBEY THE LAWS, A ND THEY DO THAT BEC AUSE THEY BELIEVE THE 80Y HAV E MA DE , THEY BELIEVE THE Y HAVE M ADE THE LAWS THROUG H THE REPRESENTATIVES. BUT IF THEY COME TO BEL IEVE THE LAWS ARE BEING M ADE BY THI S FACELESS GR OUP OF BUREAUCRATS AROUND WASH INGTON DC, THAT TH ERE IS MUCH LESS REASON TO O BEY THE LAW, AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH I T I S A CASE FOR THEM NOT OBEYING THE LAW BECAUSE IT IS AN ILLEGITIMATE LAW. THE GO VERNM ENT IS NOT LEGI TIMATELY BEHAVING. WE HAVE SEE N THIS HAPPEN IN B REXIT IN EUROPE, BEC AUSE WHAT THE PE OPLE DATE IN THAT CASE W AS TO VOTE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU BECA USE THE REGULAT IONS OUT OF BRUS SELS, O UT OF THE EU G OVERNMENT IN BRUSSELS, W ERE NOT TH INGS THEY COULD CONTR OL IN ANY WAY. THEY D IDN'T FEEL THEY H AD A VOICE IN THAT. WE SEE THE SAME DANGERS IN THE U.S. , AND T HAT IS WHY IT I S IMPORTAN T FOR US TO STOP THIS DRIFT TOWAR D THE ADMINIS TRATIVE AGENCIES, A ND FORCE M ORE OF THE DECISIONS TO BE MADE IN CON GRESS. ILYA: THERE ARE S EPARATE ISSUES HERE. ONE I S THE PROCEDU RAL ONE, HOW A LOT OF REGU LATE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS OR OTHER DRIVERS OF CULTURE, YO U COULD D RAW UP A LAW BY TAKING I NTO ACCOUNT FIRST AMENDMENT C ONCERNS, I NTERSTATE COMMERCE, C ONSTITUTIONAL BELLS AND W HISTLES, A ND AVOID N ONDELEGATI ON PROBLEMS, NARROWLY DR AWN AND ALL THIS SORT OF THING. D OESN'T MEAN IT WOULD STILL BE A GOOD LAW. I 'M WARY WH EN M ARK ZUCKERBERG COMES TO CO NGRESS AND SAYS, PLEAS E REGULATE ME , THAT WE GIVE HIM THAT. THESE BIG C OMPANIES H AVE ACCOUN TANTS AND LAWYERS IN COMPLIANCE OFFICIALS T HAT DEAL WITH WHATEVER CONGRESS GI VES THEM. I WOULD RAT HER NOT GIVE THE FC C, CONGRE SS ITSELF, SOM E OTHER AGENCY, THE POWER TO TELL US WHAT IS A PROPER AM OUNT OF EVENHANDED WHAT HAVE Y OU. THE REAL IS SUE, THE FONT OF A LOT OF PUBLIC FRUSTRATION WITH BIG EVERYTH ING, GOVERNMENT, MEDIA, I.T., CORPORATION S OR ANYTHING, A S THE SERIOUS IMBALANCE OF POWER TH AT HAS CO ME ABOUT VERTI CALLY AND HORIZONTALL Y, MEANING SO MUCH POWER HAS S WEPT INTO WASHIN GTON FROM STATES AND LOCALITIES AND WE ARE THEN WA TCHING IT BE SWEPT TO THE EXEC UTIVE B RANCH, TO THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. THIS WAS TH E FOCUS OF BEN SASSE'S COM MENTS THAT THEY , COM MENTS AT THE KAVANAU GH H EARING, WH ERE HE SAID CON GRESS DOESN'T RES OLVE ANYTHING ANYMORE, CO NGRESS IS THE PLACE WHERE , WH ERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HASH OUT PO LICY VIEWS OR WH AT HAVE YOU, AND EV ERYTHING IS BEING SWEPT TO WASHINGTON AND THEN CO NGRESS ISN'T RESOLVING IT AND PUSH ING IT TO THE A DMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES EN DED ULTIMATELY GETS PUT INTO THE CO URTS BECA USE YOU CAN ONLY SU E THEM AND THAT IS WHY THERE A RE PROTESTS IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT INSTE AD OF CONGRESS. I 'M SKEPTIC AL OF NEW REGU LATORY TRENDS, BUT THAT IS SEPARATE TO WHETHER YOU CAN DRAW TH OSE KINDS OF LAWS IN A WAY THAT IS PROPER IN TERMS OF REGARD F OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. SAAG AR: SO MUCH OF THI S DEBATE ARGU MENT, W E TALKED A BOUT NONDELEGATION IN THE SUPREME COURT, AND IT SEEM S THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE IS ALMOST C ERTAINLY A FUNCTION OF THE JUDI CIARY. FROM THIS PERSPE CTIVE , IT MATTERS QUI TE A BIT WHO I S IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. HOW DO YOU THINK THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION HAS FARED I N RAINING IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? PETE R: AFTE R NOW, RAINING IN THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE IS DI FFICULT, BECAUSE WE JUST GOT FI VE, A MAJORITY OF JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COU RT WHO WOULD BE INCLINED TO REIN IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. LET' S BE CL EAR, THE LEFT WILL NOT WANT TO SEE ANY CHANGE. THEY LIKE W HAT T HE AD MINISTRATIVE STATE DOES. EVEN SOME PEOPLE NOT ON THE LEFT LIKE WHAT T HE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE DOES. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE O UR CONSTITUTION REQUIRES TH AT MOST OF THESE MA JOR DECISIONS BE MADE BY CONGRESS , A ND TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE MADE BY AGENCIES , THAT IS NO LONGE R O F A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC WE THOUGHT WE HAD. THA T IS MAD E UP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE APP OINT ED TO BE EXPER TS AND DON'T PAY A NY ATTENTI ON TO AND HAVE ANY DESIRE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK. AS F AR AS I AM CONCERNE D, THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON IS TO MAKE SURE THAT T HE GOVERNM ENT OF THE UNITED STATES REMA INS, AN D THE EYE S OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE, A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE THE Y ARE EL ECTING RE PRESENTATIVES WHO ARE MAKING THE LAWS FOR THEM, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS NOT THE WAY THINGS ARE WORKING , WE ARE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE OVE R TIME. I WOU LD ADD ONE OTHER THING ABOUT WHAT ILYA S AID A ND THAT IS, THERE I S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHEVRON CASE AND THE AUER CASE. IN THE AUER DE CISI ON, T HE DECISION BY THE SUPREME COU RT, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, DID GO ALON G WITH THE IDEA TH AT THE COURTS SHOU LD DIFF ER TO ADMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES, B UT THE LIBERALS ON THE COURT, TO GET THE VOT E THEY NEEDED , PUT SO MANY RESTRICTION S ON HOW THE AUER DOCTRI NE COULD BE IMPOSED, IF IT IS DE FERENCE AT ALL, A C OURT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROU GH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DETAIL T O B E ABLE TO SAY IT WILL GIVE DEFERENCE T O AN AGENC Y. THE CHEVRON CASE, ON TH E OTHER HAND, WHICH THE CHIEF J USTI CE SEPARATED F ROM THIS W HOLE AUER QUESTI ON, D EFERENCE TO ADMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES' R EGULATION, HE SAID, HOWEVER I AM VOTING O N THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY VOTE ON CHEVRON. AN D CHEVRON IS A CASE THAT IS REALLY TROU BLING, BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY GIVES THE P OWER TO AG ENCIES . I T TELLS LO WER COURTS THAT THEY SHOULD DEFE R TO TH E DECISIONS AGENCIES MA KE ABOUT THE POWERS THEY HAVE BEEN G IVEN BY CONGRESS . THAT MEANS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT, IF YOU ARE TRY ING TO OVERTURN A REGULATIO N BY AN AGENCY, BEC AUSE THE JUDGE WHO Y OU ARE ARGUING BEFORE HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE SUPREME COURT HE SHOULD DEFER TO TH E AGEN CY' S OPINION ABO UT ITS OWN POWERS. THA T HAS HAPPENE D AND IT HAS STRE NGTHENE D THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE TREME NDOUSLY. THAT IS SEP ARATED FROM THE AUER CA SE, AND T HOUGH IT LOOKS LI KE WE MAY HAVE LOST THE AUER CA SE I N THE SENS E THAT DEFERENCE H AS DOMAIN , T HAT DEFERE NCE H AS REMAINED, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN CHEVRON THE NEXT TI ME THE CASE CO MES BEFORE THE COURT. >> I DON'T KNO W IF THE RE WILL BE FIVE VOT ES TO THROW IT OUT ALTOGETHER, BECAUSE IT IS NOT S UPPOSED TO BE A POL ITICAL OR EDDY ILL OGICAL THING CHEVRON ITSELF , I DEOLOGICAL THING. CHEVRON ITS ELF WAS A DECISION OVERTURNING THE LEFT WING BENT OF THE D.C. CI RCUI T IN THE 1980'S THAT WAS THWARTI NG R ONALD REAGAN'S DE REGULATORY INITIATIVES . WHETHER YOU DEFER T O AN AGENC Y OR NOT MIGHT BE A CONSER VATIVE OR LIBERAL WIN , DEPEND ING ON THE DECISIO N THE AGENCY IS MAKING. THE RE WAS AN ODD MOMENT DURING THE GORSUCH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS WH EN SENATO RS WE RE CRITICIZING GORSUCH FOR HIS OPINIONS, T HAT IN TURN EXPRES SED SKEPTICISM ABOUT CHEVR ON. THEY WERE S AYING THAT THEY WANTED TO G IVE RIC K PERRY AND SCOTT PRUIT T AND BETSY DEVOS MORE POWER, BECA USE IF YOU HAVE STRONG CHEV RON DEF ERENCE, THAT MEANS AGENCIES HAVE MORE P OWER. IT IS BIZAR RE TO ARGUE, B UT THIS IS NOT SUPP OSED TO BE A LEF T-RIGHT THING. SAAGAR: HOW DO YOU THIN K THE TRUMP ADMIN ISTRATION IS DOING SO FAR? PET ER: THE INTERESTING REGULATION THAT SEEMS LIKE IT , ILYA: THE INTERES TING REGULATION THAT SEEMS LIKE A GIMM ICK BUT I THINK HAS B EEN SUCCESSFUL IS THE RULE THAT F OR EVERY NEW REGULATION PROMULGATED , TO HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN , TWO HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN. THAT HAS AC TUALLY WORKED. WE HAVE SEE N A SLOW DOWN IN THE PAGES O N TH E FEDERAL REGISTER. IF YOU GO TO S ENATOR MIKE LEE'S OFFICE, ON CAPITOL HIL L, HE HAS TWO STAFFS, ONE ON LEGISLAT ION , TWO STACKS, ONE OF LEGISLATION AND ONE OF REGULATI ONS. THE LEGISLA TION IS SHORT AN D THE REGULATIONS ARE SIX FEET TALL. IT AL L THE STRAITS THAT WE ARE NOT GOVERNE D BY CONGRESS, BUT BY THIS FOURTH BRANCH. JUDICIAL AP POINTMENTS ARE HELPING WITH THIS, NOT JUST, E VEN MORE IN THE LOWER COURTS THAN THE SU PREME COU RT, HAVING AN E FFECT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE D.C. CIRCUIT THA T HANDLES SO MANY OF THESE REGUL ATORY APPEALS IS STILL SKEWE D WITH OBAMA NOMINEES WHO ARE NOM INEES WH O WERE MUCH MORE DIFFERENTIA L TO ALL SORTS OF AGENCIES . S AAGAR: I W ANT TO T HROW IT TO THE A UDIENCE. PLEASE MAKE YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY A QUESTION. 10 TO 15 SE CONDS OR I WILL BE FORCED TO CUT YOU OFF. I THINK WE HAVE MICS C IRCUL ATING. I SEE THE F IRST HAND OVER HERE. >> I DON'T MEA N FOR THIS QUESTION TO COME ACROSS AS T OO LAWERLY , LAWYERLY, B UT I AM ONE. CAN YOU COM MENT ON WHETHER THI S ACT NEEDS TO BE REFORMED , THE ADMINIS TRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT NEEDS TO BE REFOR MED AND THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ST ANDARD IN TERMS OF REALLY R EINING IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? THAN KS. SAAGAR: GO AHEAD. ILYA : I CAN NOT SAY I CAN G O INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE P ROCEDURE ACT BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE CHEVRON CAS E IGNORES THE ADMINISTRAT IVE PROCEDURE ACT. THAT I S THE CENTRAL PROBLEM WITH CHEVRON. IT WAS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS T HE C OURT APPEARED TO BECOME U NDERSTANDING THAT WHAT THEY H AD DONE WAS FOR YEARS LEFT OUT OF CONSIDERATION, AN ACT OF C ONGRESS , ADMINISTRAT IVE PROCEDURE ACT ADOPTED IN 1946. THEY JUST IGNORED IT. IF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE A CT COMES BACK INTO EFFECT AND I THINK IT SHOULD, WHAT THE EF FECT OF T HAT WOULD BE, IF THE COURTS ENFO RCE IT IS THAT ALL DECISIONS B Y AGENCIES WO ULD HAVE TO BE REVIEWED FIRST BY TH E COURTS FOR THEIR A GREEMENT W ITH THE POWER THAT THE AGENCY HAS THE POWER TO MAKE THA T DECISI ON. T HAT IS THE KEY QUESTION IN THE CHEVRON CAS E. THEY PUSHED THAT COMPLE TELY ASIDE AND S AID THE COURTS HAVE TO DEF ER BUT THAT IS WRONG. UNDER THE C ONSTITUTION, COURTS SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST VIEW OF WHETHER CONGRESS HAS EMPOWERED A N AGENCY TO DO SOMETHING. SAAGAR: ILY A? ILYA: YOU K NOW, THERE IS ENOUGH LANG UAGE IN THE SUPREME COURT'S REC ENT HOLDINGS ON ENVIRONMENT AL REGULATION THAT A JUDG E COULD HOLD REGULATORS' FEET TO THE FIRE MORE WHETHER THR OUGH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE RE QUIREMENTS OR OTHERWIS E. CONGRESS COULD STREN GTHEN THAT A LITTLE. BUT I THINK THE P OLITICAL C APITAL REQUIRED TO DO SOMETHING L IKE THAT, IT WO ULD NOT BE THAT MUCH MORE, THERE WOULD BE SOMETHIN G LIKE THE RA INS ACT, WHICH WOULD BE TO REQUIRE CONGRESS TO APPROVE ANY MAJOR REGUL ATION PROMULGATED . BIGGER THIN GS LIKE THAT A RE PROBABLY A BETTER US E OF ACTIVIST S O R ACADEMIC RESOURCES T HAN TINKER ING WITH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. S AAGAR: ANO THER QUE STION? I SEE ANOTH ER IN THE BACK. >> HE LLO. WOUL D YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON THE FOLL OWING? I BELIEVE IT IS WRONG TO CA LL CONGRE SS AS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IN THE MIKE LEE EXAMPLE, 2004 , 200 0 PAGE A FFORDABLE CARE ACT , THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE UNITED STATES JUDICIARY WITH THE PR ESUMP TION THE ADMINISTRAT IVE RULES ARE CORRECT . IN EFFECT, THE PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE. SAAGAR: A B LEAK QUESTION. P ETER: I AG REE. IT I S WRONG FO R THE COURTS TO HAVE DEC IDED THE Y SHOULD DEFER TO TH E VIEWS O F THE AGENCIES AB OUT THEIR POWERS. THA T VIOLAT ED THE APA AND IT VIOLATES TH E WAY THE FRAMERS SAW THE COURTS OPER ATING IN THE CONSTIT UTIO NAL SYSTEM. FROM MY PER SPECTIVE, I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED. ILYA: AS SO MEONE WHO TENDS TO FIND MOST T HINGS THE GOVERNMENT DOES TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I FIND FAUL T WITH THE CO URTS IN A HOST OF W AYS. THE R EASON WHY CONGRES S PASSES THESE BROAD LAWS IS BEC AUSE THE COURTS LET THEM. THAT' S THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL . THAT IS A PROJECT THA T A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN TRYING TO P USH COURTS , YOU ARE ALLUDING TO THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITU TIONALITY, THERE SHOUL D BE A PRESUMPTION OF LIBERTY, TH AT IS GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A , HAVE T O JUS TIFY ITS RESTRICTION S AND REGULAT IONS, RATHER THAN PRESUMING THEIR VALUE S IF Y OU CAN POI NT TO AN EXACT TEXT IN THE CONSTITUTION OR SOMETHIN G LIKE THAT , THAT IS AN ACTIV E DEBATE WITHIN FEDERAL SOCIETY CIR CLES, LIBERTARIANS, CONSERVATIV ES, LEGALLY MINDED FOLKS. YOU RAISE A VALID POINT. SAAG AR: ANO THER QUE STION. >> OVER HERE. SAAGAR: GREAT. >> M R. WALLISO N, I APPRECIATE YOUR BOOK ON THE GREAT RECES SION, THE ORIGINS AND THE FIN ANCIAL CRISIS. HOW COULD REVER SING THIS DEFERENCE, HOW COULD W E HAVE , COU LD WE HA VE AVOIDED SOME OF THOSE CR ISES IN 2007-2008 AND HOW CAN WE AVOID FUTURE FINA NCIAL CRISES IF WE REVER SE THI S MOVEMENT TOWARD INCREASING DEFERENCE FROM CONGRE SS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? ILYA : NOT R EALLY INTERESTING , THAT'S A RE ALLY INTERESTING QUESTION. FOR EVERYON E'S INFO, I WROTE A BOO K ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2 008 AND BLAMED IT ON THE GOVERNM ENT'S HOUSING POLICIES AN D NOT ON THE INEFFECTIVE OR LACK OF REG ULATION OF THE BANKING IND USTRY. THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. THEY PARTIC IPATED BUT IT WAS THE GOVERNM ENT'S HOUSING POLICIES THAT CREATE D THIS ENORMOUS BUBBLE THAT ULTIMA TELY COLLAPSED AND CAUSED THE CRISIS. IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE IF THERE WA S MORE ATTENTION TO ADMINIST RATIVE AGENCIES, T HOSE THAT ARE REGULATING THE ECONOMY AND THEY WERE GIVEN LESS DEFERE NCE, WHICH MEANS THEY WOULD HAVE TO JUSTIFY THI NGS MUCH MORE CAREFULLY WHEN THEY M ADE A REGULATION, WE COULD HA VE PREVEN TED THE CRISIS IN 2008. GO ING BACK TO HISTORY AND REDOING IT IS FRUITLES S BUT IN THE FUTU RE WE OUGHT TO BE SURE THAT W HEN AN AGENCY IS M AKING A REGULATIO N, IT IS AUTHO RIZED BY CONGRESS TO DO THAT AND THERE IS , IF IS NO AU THORIZATION, THEY SHOULD NOT DO IT. PETE R: LUCK ILY MY FORMER , COLLEAGUE, THE HEAD OF CATO'S FINANCIAL REGULATORY CENTER, NOW HEADS UP TH E AGENCY. HOW IS HE DOING ? ILYA: I AM WORRIED ABOUT HIM. [LAUGHTER] I'M ACTUALL Y WORRIED BECAUSE OF WHAT THE TR UMP ADMINISTRATION IS COOKING UP. THEY SE EM T O BELIEVE THEY CAN KEEP FREDDI E AND FANNIE IN BEING, T HESE AGENCIES NOW UNDER THE C ONTROL OF THE REGULATOR, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL HOUSING AGE NCY, THEY ARE CONTROL OF THIS AGE NCY AND THEY ARE ALSO CONTRO LLED COMPLETELY AND SUPPORT ED FINANCIALLY BY THE FEDE RAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW AND THE IDE A IS THAT THEY CAN BE LET OUT INTO THE PUBLIC AGAIN AND A LLOWED TO FUNCTION AS THEY DID BEFORE 2008 WHEN THEY BECAME INSOLVENT. WE SHOULD CLOSE THEM DOWN. [APPLAUSE] IF YOUR AND MY FRIE ND, A GOOD CONSER VATIVE ECONOMIST H AD HIS WAY, I ASSUME, HE WOULD DO THAT. UNFOR TUNATELY, I SEE A LOT OF STATEMENTS BY HIM SUGG ESTING THE TRUMP A DMINISTRAT ION DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ON THE REAL ESTATE LOBB Y AND W ANTS TO ALLOW FANNIE MAE AND FRE DDIE MAC, CAUSING THE FINANCIAL C RISIS IN THE PAST TO COM E ALI VE AGAIN AND CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE HOUSING MARKET. THA T WOULD BE TOO BAD IF IT HAPPENS. SAAGAR: ANOTHER QUE STION. I SEE A HAN D HERE. >> IT SEEMS TO ME PART OF THE PROB LEM IS PEOPLE IN GOVERNME NT AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNME NT THINK GOVERNMENT IS THE SOLU TION WHEN GOVERNMENT IS SO SELDO M THE SOLUTIO N TO ANYTHING . FOR THAT REASON, I T HINK YOU HAVE GO T MARK CALABRO THI NKING WE CAN USE THESE A GENCIES TO SOLVE ISSUES. I W ONDER HOW WE CAN EFFECT A CHANGE OF HEART AND T AKE THE GOVERNM ENT OUT OF GOVE RNMENT AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE? I W ONDER IF Y OU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. PE TER : WE N EED A SIMPLE CO NSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ADD TO T HE END OF EVERY CLAUSE , ""AND WE MEAN IT. "" [LAUGHTER] SAAGAR: THA T GOES T O AN INTEREST ING QUESTION. HOW SHOULD CONS ERVATIVES WHEN THEY BECOME PART OF THE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE ACT WITHIN IT? PETER: YOU MEAN WHEN THEY ARE , SAAGAR: YES . PETER: I WA S IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRAT ION. RONALD REAGAN WAS EXTREME LY CLEAR ON WHAT HE WANTED. I W AS THE TREASURY DE PARTMENT IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE ADMI NISTRATION. WE KNEW EXACTLY WHA T HE WANTED. ILYA: HIS T WEETS WERE WRITTEN WEL L. [LAUGHTER] PETER: THAT IS AN INTERESTING ISSUE, WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TWEETING BUT ANYWAY, HE HAD MADE HIS POLICIES SO CLEAR TH AT WE HARDLY EVER HAVE TO GO , HAD T O GO T O THE WHITE HOUSE FOR C LARIFICATION ABOUT A DECISION BECAUSE REAGAN HAD LAID OUT PO LICIES HE WANTED U S TO FOLLOW. THA T IS NOT OFTEN THE CASE WITH PRESID ENTS. THEY COME I NTO OFFICE WITHOUT HAVING A CL EAR VIEW. HOWEV ER, IF A PRESIDENT COMES INTO OFFICE AND LAYS OUT THE KIND OF CON SERVATIVE OUTLOOK THA T PRESID ENT REAGAN HAD, I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RESPONSI VE TO THAT, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN VARIOUS AGENCIES WO ULD FEEL THEY CANNOT MAKE ALL TH ESE REGUL ATIONS, IN FACT THEY WOULD PROBABLY WITHDRAW SOME OF THE REGU LAT IONS AS THEY ARE , DOING IN THE CASE OF TRUMP NOW. I WOUL D ADD IN THE CASE OF TRUMP, I N HIS FIRST TWO Y EARS, WE H AVE NOT REALLY HAD A SUBSTANTI AL REDUCTION I N THE NUMBER OF REGULATI ONS EVERY YEAR. SINCE 1993, WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO , BEGAN TO CO UNT, THER E WERE MORE THAN 3000 R EGULATIONS EVERY YEAR FROM T HE AGENCIES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THAT WAS AL SO TRUE IN TRUMP'S FIR ST YEAR, 2017, AND VERY CLOSE TO 30 00 REGULATIONS IN TRUMP'S SECOND YEAR , 2019. , 20 18. I HAV E NOT SEEN WH AT HAPPENED IN 2019. I CAN IMAGINE THE RE ARE A LOT OF RULES AN D REGULATIONS COMING OUT BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO STOP THI S F LOW O NCE IT GETS STA RTED. TH E CABINET OFFICIALS ARE BUSY TESTIF YING AND MAKING SPEECHES AN D SO FORT H. THEY ALLOW THESE REGULATIONS TO GO THROUGH BEC AUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS I S WHAT THE AGENCY HAS BEEN WO RKING ON FOR 10 YEARS, SO WE DON'T WANT TO STOP IT NOW. SAAGAR : ILY A? ILYA: WELL, LOOK. THIS TIES BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE JUDICIA RY. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. I TRACE IT BA CK TO THE SUPREME COURT'S COD IFICATIO N OF PROGRESSIVE POLICY VIEWS ON THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE IN 19 37. IT WILL TAK E SOME TIME TO WIND THAT BACK. THAT IS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. SA AGAR: WE JUST HAV E A LAST FEW MINUTES. I WANT TO GIVE YOU BOTH A CHAN CE TO GIVE SOME C LOSIN G REM ARKS AND WHERE E VERY ONE'S FOCUS SHOUL D BE IN THE COMING YEARS ON TH E ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. PETER: MY VIEW IS CONSERVATIV ES CANNOT LOSE BY FORCING MORE OF THE LAWM AKING POLICY INTO CONGRE SS. N OT ONLY DOES THAT MEAN MORE A TTENT ION WILL BE PAID TO THE MAJOR QUESTIONS, WHICH MEANS WE CA N ALL GET INVOLVED IN DECISION S MADE, DEBATED ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS. M EMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL BE ACC OUNTA BLE TO US FOR D ECISIONS T HEY MAKE. IF IT IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ADOPT THE LAW, GOOD. WE WA NT FEWER LAWS, AS WE LL AS FEWER RE GULATIONS . THE LEFT ON THE OTHE R HAND WILL SEE TH INGS ENTIRELY DI FFERENTLY BECAUSE THE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE IS MA DE UP OF PEOPLE O N THE LEFT. W HEN WE HAVE SEEN T HE FEW COMMENTS THEY HAVE M ADE NOW ABOUT THE NEW CONSERV ATIVE SUPREME COU RT, THEY HAVE BEEN, WELL, THE REAL DA NGER HERE IS THAT THE Y WILL S TOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM PROTEC TING US AGAINST ABUSES OF I NDUSTRY. THAT KIND O F ATTITUDE, WHICH WAS EXPRESSED B Y A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIV ERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW SCHOOL, IS THE ATTITUDE THE LEFT WILL H AVE A BOUT ALL THESE CHANGES. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THE FEWER L AWS ARE MADE AND THE FEWER R EGULATIONS MADE, THE BETTER OFF THIS COUNTRY WILL BE. [A PPLAUSE] SAAGAR: ILY A? ILYA: A LOT OF THESE ISSUES COME UP IN HIGH-PROFILE CASES SWAMP ED WITH POLICY DEBATES. FO R EXAMPLE, THIS ISSUE OF TWO BROUGHT DELEGATIONS, COMES UP , TOO B ROAD D ELEGATIONS, COMES UP IN TARIF FS, IMMIGRATION POLICY, BOR DER WALL . THERE ARE SO MANY THI NGS STATUES ARE IN PLAY THAT A RE SO BROAD THAT MAYBE THE PRESIDE NT, WHETHER TRUMP OR OB AMA OR WHOEVER IS ACTING W ITHIN THE LAW. TH E PR OBLEM IS WITH THE LAW. WHEN WE WERE LAST AT THE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM IN COLORADO SPRINGS, TH AT WAS WHEN TR UMP GAVE HIS PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE EMERGENCY W ALL DECLARATION . I WAS WATCH ING THIS IN MY HOTEL, AT T HE BROADMOOR AND I PUT OUT A S TATEMENT O N MY PHONE WHILE WATCHING. T HE UPSHOT WAS, POSSIBLY OR PROBABLY LEGAL BUT UNCONST ITUT IONAL. WHICH WAS KIND OF ACUTE WA Y OF SAYING , Y OU CANNOT HAVE A LAW THAT IS LEGAL AND YET UNCONST ITUT IONAL. CONSTITUTION IS A LAW. B UT WH AT I MEANT WAS T HE RELATIVE STATUTES ABOUT MOVIN G MONEY AROUND ARE SO BROAD IT CO ULD BE SMART WHITE HOUSE LAWYE RS FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS, CR OSS THE T 'S, DOT TH E I'S. BUT IF THAT 'S THE CASE, THIS LAW IS IMPR OPER . I T'S CONGRESS GIVING AWAY ITS APPROPRIATION POWER. ONE OF THE DOCKET CASE S THAT WILL BE , DACA CASES THAT WILL BE ARGUED A T SUPREME COURT THIS TERM. IF PR ESIDENT OBAMA DID HAVE THE POWER U NDER THE IMMIGRATION STATUTES TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY STATUS AND WORK AUTHORIZATION TO PEOPLE BROU GHT HERE ILLEGALLY AS CHILDREN, W HICH POLICY I SUPPORT BY THE WAY, BUT IF HE HAD THAT POWER ALREA DY, THAT IMMIGRATION LAW IS TOO BROAD AND UNCONSTITUT IONAL. CATO IS FIL ING A BRIEF ON MONDAY ON B EHALF OF SUPPORTE RS OF DACA TYPE P OLICI ES, S UPPORTING IT AS A MAT TER OF POLICY BUT NOT AS LAW. BECAUSE THE EXECUTIVE P OWER SIMPLY IS NOT SO BROAD. THES E ISSUES CROP UP. SOMETIMES I T IS TECHNICAL. IF THE SUPR EME COU RT MAKES WAVES, IT W ILL PROBABLY BE ON A TECHNICAL T HING LIKE GANDHI WITH , GUN DY WITH SEX OFFENDERS. WERKHEISER WITH VETERA NS BENEFITS , OR KAISER W ITH VETERANS BENEFITS. THESE ISSUE S ARE ALL AROUND US. SAAGAR: THA NK YOU FOR PARTICI PATI NG.

WATCH THE P RESIDENTIA L CANDIDATES LIVE ON C-SPAN, ONLINE AT C -SPAN.ORG, OR LISTEN L IVE ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. HOST: FOR A SUNDA Y RO UNDTABLE, WE ARE JOINED BY A REPUBL ICAN STRATEGIST. , A REPUBLICA N STRATEGIST AND THAT FO R NOW, DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANT. DOUG STARTS BY LOOKING BAC K AT 201 9, WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT WHERE WE EN DED UP IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIA L PRIMARY? >> THE FIRST T HING THAT SURPRISED HE WAS KAMA LA HARRIS'S EX IT. I FELT LIKE SHE HAD ONE OF THE CLEARER PATHWAYS TO THE NOMI NATION AND I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT HER EARLY E XIT. THE OTHER T HING THAT MAY NOT BE THAT SURPRI SING IS THE REMA RKABLE STABILITY OF JOE BIDEN A ND BERNIE SANDERS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. BIDEN HAS R EMAINED CONSISTENT IN NATIONAL POLLING. DIFFERENT I N IOWA AND NE W HAMPSHIRE. BERNIE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT. THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MAYOR PE TE, EMERG ING AS A VERY VIAB LE CANDIDATE COMING OUT OF BASICALLY N OWHERE. THE MAYOR OF SOUTH BE ND AND NOW HE IS LEADI NG THE POLLS IN IOWA AND NE W HAMPSHIRE. HE HAS A RE AL GOOD CHANCE TO WIN BOTH OF THOSE STATES. THOSE ARE S OME THINGS THAT SURPRI SED ME THE MOST. HOST: WHO D O YOU THINK HAS THE EASIEST PATH RIGHT NOW? >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOMINATION I THINK IT IS BIDEN. I THINK BID EN HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE BROADEST CO ALITION O LDER AFRICAN-AME RICAN VOTERS, AFR ICAN-AME RICAN WORKING-CLA SS WHITE VOTER S, BLUE-COLLAR WHITE VOTER S. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HIS STRENGTH NA TIONALLY HE IS STILL TH E FRONT RUNNER NATIONALLY. >> IT MAY NOT BE THE CASE IN IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT I THINK THAT MAY NOT PREVENT HIM FROM WINNING THE NOMINATION. MOVING INTO SOUTH CAROLINA AND THOSE SUPER TUESDAY STA TES WHERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF A FRICAN AMERICANS WILL VOTE, THAT FAVORS BIDEN. HOST: I WAN T TO COM E BACK TO THAT. PHILIP, FRO M A REPU BLICAN PERSPECTIVE. YOU ARE SKE PTIC AL OF THE DEMO CRATIC FIELD, WHAT SURPRISED Y OU THE MOST? PHILLIP: I THINK ABO UT ALL O F OUR OPEN PRIMARIES FROM 2008 A ND TH E RISE AND FALL OF CANDIDAT ES, THE RISE OF WARREN AND KAMALA HARR IS EARLY IN THE SUMMER. I THINK THA T BIDEN AND BERNIE ARE STANDIN G IN THE SAME POSITI ON NATIONALLY THEY WERE A YEAR AGO TODAY WHICH IS CR AZY AFTER ALL THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN SPENT. THE ONLY OT HER WILD CARD MICHAEL BLOOMBERG'S ENTRY INTO THE RACE. WE SA W THIS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WITH G IULIANI WITH LESS MONEY. HE NEVER MA DE IT REALLY. BLOOMBERG H AS MORE MONEY AND CONFIDE NCE BECAUSE HE HAS DONE THIS B EFORE. THA T WILL BE AN INTERESTING PLAY. HOST: ON BL OOMBERG AND HOW HE IS IMPACTIN G THIS RACE. DOUG: RIGHT NOW H E IS SPEND ING AND CONCENTRATING HIS SPENDIN G ON THE SUPER TUESDAY THI NGS, HE IS BYPASSING THE FOUR EARLY CAUC US STATES. THERE IS A BIT OF AN UPTICK NATIONALLY FOR BLOOMBERG. HIS BUYS OU R NATIONAL CABLE BUYS SO THA T IS HELPING HIS NATIONA L POLLING. HE IS AROUN D 4% OR 5% WHICH IS PR ETTY GOOD. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHO HE IS HURTING IF HE IS HURTING ANYONE. EVERYONE TH OUGHT IT WOULD BE BI DEN WHEN HE CAME IN BUT THAT IS NOT CLEAR FROM ME , CLEAR TO ME . THE VOTERS FOR BIDEN W OULD BE DI FFERENT THAN THE VOTERS FOR BLOOMBE RG. I AM NOT SU RE IF THO SE OF TH E TYPE OF PEOPLE MICH AEL BLOOMBERG WILL BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER. I AM NOT SURE WHO HE IS HURTING. HOST: WHAT IS A COALIT ION THAT I DEMO CRATIC CANDIDATE PUTS TOGETHER TH AT YOU ARE MOST WORRIED ABOUT? DOUG : THE W ORKING -CLASS WHITE VOTERS IN THE MIDWEST . I THINK THE GENERAL ELECTION COMES DOWN TO WOR KING WHITE CLASS AMERICANS. , PHILLIP: I JUST SIMP LY DO. IN WISCONSI N, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, M AINE, NEW HAMPSHI RE, MINNESOTA, THEY ARE AL L OVER 50%. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CANDIDATE THAT CAN APPEAL TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. T HAT IS REA LLY THE FUNDAMENTAL PLACE OF WH ERE THIS RACE WILL COME DOWN T O. CAN HE SWIN G THOSE STATE S, IT WAS IN WISC ONSIN OR MICHIGAN OR PENNSYLVANI A, 28% OF TWO-TIME OBAMA VOTER S VOTE D FOR TRUMP IN 20 16. WHO WILL CO ME IN ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND TA KE THAT VOTE? >> WHAT ISSUE APPEALS TO THEM AND HOW DOE S LOOKING AHEAD TO THE IMPEACH MENT TRIAL IN THE SENATE, DO THOSE VOTER S , ARE THEY WATCHING THE IMPEACH MENT TRIAL? DOES THAT H ELP OR HURT? PHILLIP: I THINK IT IS THOSE VOTERS. IF YOU LOOK IN THOSE STATES YOU HAVE TH E HARD RIGHT AND THE HARD LEFT A ND THEY ARE NOT MOVING ANYBODY. TH ERE ARE I S A VE RY SMALL PERCENTAGE THAT WILL M OVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF I WAS FL IRT ING WITH THE LE FT ORAL MAP, H ILLARY GOT 232 ELECTORAL V OTES. RIGHT NOW T HE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL S ITTING AT 232, HOW CA N THEY GET WHATEVER COMBINATION IT IS? CONGRESSION AL DISTRICTS I N MAINE, MICHIGAN, W ISCONSIN, WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO TO GET THOSE VOTES? THAT 'S WHERE ALL T HE MONEY WILL BE SPENT. THERE WILL BE SECONDARY S TATES THAT COME INTO PLAY THAT T HAT IS WHERE IT SITS RIGHT NOW. WHEN IT COM ES DOWN TO IMP EACHMENT , WE ARE LOOK ING AT THE INTERNA L NUMBERS IN THE STATES RIGH T NOW. INDEPENDENT S IS WHAT WE ARE PAYING ATTE NTION TO. FOR THE MOS T PART T HE NATIONAL POLLS ARE S AYING INDE PENDENT S ARE 44% FOR IN THE IMPEACH MENT. I'M LOOKING AT THE LIKELY VOTERS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT THAT COULD BE SWUNG. FOR THE MOST PART - - WE SAW THIS 22 YEARS AG O WITH THE 1998 MI DTERM ELECTIONS DURING THE IMPEACH MENT. THE MORE DE MOCRATS PLAY THEIR HAND THE MORE TRUMP WILL BE LOOKED AT LIKE THE VICTIM TO T HE SWING VOTER S IN THE STATES. PHILLIP: ON THAT POINT PEOPL E , DOUG: PEOPLE LIKE TO REF ERENC E 9 8, WE HAD AL GORE RUNNIN G WITH A VERY STRONG ECONOMY THA T BILL CLINTON GAVE HIM AND HE LOST. A LOT OF TH AT HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO R UN SEPARAT E FROM BILL C LINTON AND HIS ACCOMPLISHM ENT ON THE ECONOMY BEC AUSE OF THE STAIN OF IMPEACHMENT AND SOME OF HIS PERSONAL ISSUES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHE N NIXON RESIGNED, G ERALD FORD RAN AND LOST TO JIMMY CARTER. THE EVIDENC E HE RE CAN BE SPUN BOTH WAYS. YOU C AN LOOK AT WHA T HAPPENED IN 98 WITH THE MI DTERMS BUT YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT WHA T HAPPENED IN 2000. I AM NOT SEEI NG A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT IMPEAC HMENT IS MOVING EITHER WAY. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A T RIAL IN THE SENATE AND WHAT TH AT LOOKS LIKE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE VULNERA BLE HOUSE DEMOC RATS, THEIR STAND INGS R EMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE IN THEIR DI STRICTS. THERE HAS N OT BEEN MUCH OF AN IMPACT. THEY ARE FA CING A TON OF ADVERTISING AGAINST THE M FROM A TRUMP SUPER PAC, FROM T RUMP, FROM AAN, F ROM S UPER REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATIO NS. IT HAS NOT HURT THEM. I HOPE TO S EE MORE OF A DEFENSE F ROM OTHER ORGAN IZATIO NS, BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEE WHAT TH E IMPEACHMENT WILL DO TO THIS A REDUCTION. , TO THIS ELE CTION. HOST: AS WE MOVE FORWAR D INTO 2020 WE ARE LOOK ING AHE AD TO TH E LANDSCAPE OF CAMPAIGN 2020. IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THE CONVERSATIO N REPUBLICANS (202) 748-8001. D EMOCRATS ( 202) 748-8000. I NDEPENDENT S (202) 748-8002. D OUG AND PH ILIP JOINING US THIS MOR NING. THIS IS A S EGMENT WE LIKE TO DO AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE HAD TO G EORGIA, GO OD MORNING. CALLER: JOH N, LOVE C-SPAN BEEN CALLING FOR 30 YEARS. HOST: I KNO W YOU HAVE. CALLER: I T HINK DONALD TRUMP IS TH E BEST LEADER IN HISTORY. I AM A STOC K MAR KET MAN AND MY STOCK PORTFOLIO IS UP. I HAVE NEVE R BEEN SO FIR ED UP AND ENERGIZED. I THINK HE IS IN THE B EST , I T HINK HE IS THE BEST IN HISTORY. WE HAVE GOO D CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS SO I THINK WE WILL TAKE OVER OUR HO USE AND INCREASE OUR MAJORIT Y TO THE SENATE AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL WIN T HE BIG GEST LANDSLIDE IN HISTORY. WE HAVE NEV ER HAD A N ECONOMY LIKE THIS. MY STOCK MA RKET HAD , MY S TOCKS HAVE HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. I WILL RUN TO THE POLL S A ND VOTE FO R DONALD TRUMP. YOU DO A GR EAT JOB O N C-SPAN, YOU AND STEVE, YOU HAVE A GREAT NETWORK. HOST: DIDN' T YOU HAVE A BIRTHDAY RECENTLY? CALLER: YES I WAS 8 0 YEARS OLD. I WALK AND WORK OU T EVERY D AY, I HAVE TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE TO HE LP DONALD TRUMP. HOST: HAPPY BIRTH DAY TO YOU. HAVE A GREA T DAY . HE THINKS R EPU BLICANS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE. PHIL LIP: I LOVE THE EXCITEMENT AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN CALLING IN, I DON'T THI NK IT WILL TAKE BACK THE HO USE. THEY NEED T O WIN 20 SEATS, THER E ARE FOUR TH AT ARE NOT OCCUPIED BY ANYONE RIGH T NOW. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR RE PUBLICANS. I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN CO MMITTEE, I SPENT , DOUG: THEY HAVE D ONE A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF RAISING MONEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR FUNDR AISING IN SEPTEMBER T HEY OUTRAISED THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THE RE PUBLICANS WERE TRUMPE TING HOW GREAT THE IMPEACH MENT WAS FOR THEIR FUNDRAISING . THE FRONT L INERS ARE THE CAN DIDATES IN THE MOST DIFFICULT DISTRICT. THERE ARE A BOUT 43 OF THEM. ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE ABOUT A MIL LION DOL LARS CASH ON HAND SO THEY ARE VE RY GOOD FINANCIALLY. THEY HAVE B EEN A BLE T O CARVE OUT S OME INDEPENDENT PROFILES IN THEIR DI STRICT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TWO WEEKS THE I RONY WITH IMPEACHMENT IS THAT THE PR ESIDENT WAS IMPEACH ED IN THE HOUSE BUT THEY AL SO PASSED A TRADE DEAL. THEY PASSED A PRESCRIPT ION DRUG DEAL AND AN END OF THE YIELD , AN D OF THE YEAR GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL. THEY PASSED A DEFENSE A UTHORIZATION BILL. THEY H >> COMIN G UP M ONDAY MORN ING, NATIONAL RE VIEW'S SENIOR EDIT OR DISCUSSING HIS BOOK, "" GIVE ME LI BERTY : A HI STORY O F AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONAL IDEA.""

AND WITH THE FIRST L INE OF QUESTIONING, STEPHEN DIN AN, ASSISTANT MANAGING ED ITOR OF ""THE WASHINGTON TIMES."" STE PHEN: BRANDON, BORDER APPR EHENSION NUMBERS ARE DOWN DRAMAT ICALLY FROM WHERE THEY WERE THE PE AK OF THE SURG E IN MAY AND JUNE. I'M W ONDERING, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY ARE THO SE NUMBERS DOWN AND MAYBE M OST IMPORTANTLY, WHO GETS CREDIT FOR THAT? MR. JUDD: Y OU FIRST HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT T HE DRIVING FACTOR THAT PULLS PEOPLE TO COME TO THE UNITED STAT ES ILLEGALLY, AND THE MAIN MAGNET THAT WE CALL IT IS THE CATCH A ND RELEASE PROGRAM. ANYTIME THAT PEOPLE CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY A ND KNOW THEY ARE JUST GOING TO BE RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES TO WAIT FOR AN ASYLUM OR DEPORTATION HEARING THE Y , PEOPLE TEND TO CROSS OU R BORDERS ILLEGALLY IN LARGE NUMBE RS. EV ER SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STARTED THE MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS, OR THE WAIT IN MEX ICO PROG RAM, THOSE NUMBERS HAVE DECREA SED DRAMATICALLY, BECAUSE PEO PLE DON'T WANT TO WAIT IN ANO THER COUNTRY PENDING THEIR ASYLU M OR DEPORTATION PROCEEDING. SO ONCE WE TURNED THAT MAGNET OFF, ONCE WE ENDED THAT MAGNET , THE NUMBERS DROPPED EXP ONENTIALLY. AND FRANKLY , THE ADMINISTRAT ION, THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES T HAT YOU CAN GIVE CREDIT TO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CUT THI S DEAL WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A DEAL THAT ANY ADMINIS TRATION PRIOR TO TH E TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD BECAUSE THI S IS WHA T IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO CONTROL THE BORDER, BUT YOU HAV E TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT D EAL COULD END AT ANY TIME IF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT STOPS IT. A ND THA T'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONGRESS STEP UP TO THE P LATE AND DO THEIR JOB. STEPHE N: WHAT WAS IT ABOU T THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION THAT, AS YO U SAID, ANY PREVIOUS AD MINISTRATION COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS DONE , WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRAT ION THAT MANAGE D TO BE THE ONES TO GET THIS DO NE? MR. JUDD: W ELL, I THINK THE MAIN TH ING IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRAT ION REFUSED TO ACCEPT NO FOR AN A NSWER. IF YOU LOOK AT ANY PREVIOUS AD MINISTRATION, THERE'S ALW AYS ROAD BLOCKS THAT GET THROWN IN, IN THE WAY OF TRYING T O ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING THAT'S DONE ADMINISTRAT IVELY. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION SAW A PROBLEM. PR ESIDENT TRUMP RAN O N A CAMPAIGN THAT HE WAS GOING TO SECURE THE BORDER, AND HE REFUSED TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, CONTINUED T O PUSH FORWARD, AND FRANKLY , WAS ABLE TO GET A HISTORIC DEAL DONE. >> LE T ME FOLL OW UP WITH THE BORDER FUND ING ISSUE WITH CONGRESS ALLOCATING WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. WH AT WILL T HE BORDER LOOK LIKE A YEAR FROM N OW? MR. JU DD: I THI NK THAT WHAT YOU'RE GOIN G TO SEE IS WHAT THE EXPERTS HAV E CONSTANTLY TOLD CONGRESS WE NEED. WE NE ED INFRAS TRUCT URE. WE NEED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TECHNOLO GY. WE NEED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MANPOWER. P ART OF THA T INFRASTRUCTURE, IF YOU WANT TO LOO K AT SOMETHING THAT IS GOI NG TO BE VISIBLE, IS GOING TO BE PHYSI CAL BARRIERS IN STRATEGIC L OCATIONS. WE'RE NOT T ALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL BA RRIERS FR OM CALIFORNIA TO TEXAS. WE'R E TALKI NG ABOUT PHYSICAL BA RRIERS IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS T HAT ALLOW US TO CONTROL SPE CIFIC PA RTS OF THE BORDER AND DICTATE WHE RE ILLEGAL BORDER CROS SINGS T AKE PLACE, AS WELL AS ILLEGAL NARCOTICS. IF WE CAN D ICTATE THAT, THEN WE CAN BE M UCH MORE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR JOBS . > > AN D WHAT RO LE IS THE PRESIDE NT'S SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHN ER, GOING TO HAVE IN ALL OF THIS, IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE SE LECT BORDER WALLS? MR. JUDD: I DON 'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO HAVE ANY , I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE ANY ROLE AS FAR AS CONSTRUCTING THE BORDER WALL . I DO KNOW T HAT JARED KUSHNER HAS PLAYED A HU GE ROLE IN ENSURING TH AT THESE DEALS HAVE GOTTEN DONE. NOT O NLY WI TH MEXICO BUT WITH GUATEM ALA A ND NOW HONDURAS AND EL SALV ADOR. H E'S PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN THAT. NO W, WHETHER HE PLAYS ANY ROLE WHATSO EVER IN THE CONSTRUCTIO N OF THE WALLS, I HAVEN'T A NY IDEA. STEVE : BECAUSE NBC NEWS IS REP ORTING HE'LL PLAY A BIG ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE CONSTRUCTIO N OF THE WALL. MR. J UDD: I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU LOOK AT HIS BUSI NESS BACKGROUND. I THINK ONE O F THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT, AS FAR AS T HIS ADMINISTRATION GOES, THE A MERICAN PUBLIC, AT LEAST TH E SEGMENT THAT VOTED FOR PRESIDE NT TRUMP, THEY WANTED A BUSINESS- MINDED INDIVIDUAL IN OFFICE. THEY DIDN'T WANT THE TYPICAL POLITICIAN THAT WE'VE SEEN TIME A ND TIME AGAIN AND JARED KUSHNER DOE S HAVE A HUGE EXPERTISE IN THE BUSI NESS WORLD, SO IT WOULD MA KE SENSE IF SOMEBODY WITH A BUSI NESS MIND RATHER THAN A POLITICAL MIND DID OVERSEE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE AGA IN, THAT IS A BUSINESS ASPECT. STE VE: LET'S TURN TO REB EKAH MORIN. REBE KAH: HI, IS THE NATI ONAL BOARD PATROL COUNCIL GOING TO EN DORSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 20 20? MR. JUDD: WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT D ECISION YET. WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE 'RE VERY PLEASE D , THE NATIONA L BORDER PATROL COUNCIL IS VERY PLE ASED WITH WHAT THE PRESIDE NT HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, WITH WHAT HE IS CURRENTLY ACCOMPLISHI NG. AND SO, YOU KNO W, WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AS WE SPEAK. REBE KAH: AND DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS ABOUT WHEN THAT W ILL COME OUT? O BVIOU SLY, THE PRESIDE NT HAS CALLED YOU A VERY GOOD FRIEND, SO YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PR ESIDENT. SO I WAS WONDERI NG IF THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE ON TO 2020? MR. J UDD: I HAVE TO T ELL YOU THAT MY OWN PERSONAL RE LATIONSHIP IS NOT GOIN G TO AFFECT W HAT MY ORGANIZA TION NEEDS DONE. I WIL L WORK FOR MY ORGANIZATIO N THE BEST TH AT I POSSIBLY CAN, AND I WILL DO THE BEST FOR THOSE THAT I REPRESENT, THE BEST THAT I POSSIBLY CAN. I WOUL D IMAGINE THA T A DECISION WI LL BE MADE ON WHOM WE'RE GOING TO EN DORSE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE EVEN GOING TO. I MEAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS T HE FIRST P ERSON THAT WE EVE R ENDORSED FOR PRESIDE NTIAL OFFICE BACK IN 2016. BU T I WOULD IMA GINE THAT THE DECISION WOULD BE MA DE IN FEBRUARY. R EBEKAH, YO U KNOW, TO BE COMPLETELY FRANK AND H ONEST WITH YOU, OBVIOUSLY W E'RE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT THE PR ESIDENT HAS DONE. WHAT HE CON TINUES TO TRY TO DO FOR BOTH AGENTS AND BORDER SECURITY AND THE AME RICAN PUBLIC AS F AR AS BORD ER SECURITY IS RELATED. SO , THAT SH OULD GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF WHE RE WE STAND ON WHAT THE AD MINISTRAT ION IS DOING. STEV E: SO, QUICK FOLLOW UP , IS THERE AN Y REASON WHY YOU WOULD NOT ENDORSE DON ALD TRUMP? MR. JUDD: T HERE'S A LOT OF, AGAIN, THER E ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT WE HAV E TO LOOK INTO. WE HAVE TO SPEAK WITH OUR MEMBERS. WE HAVE TO SPEAK WITH OUR LOCAL ELECTED REP RESENTAT IVES. WE HAVE TO SPEAK WITH ALL TH OSE INDIVIDUALS AND WE HAVEN'T DON E THAT YET. BUT AG AIN, DO I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY PUSHBACK? IF THAT IS THE DIRECTION WE THINK WE SHOULD G O? NO, I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY PUSHBACK. S TEPHEN: BRANDON, I KNOW A COUP LE OF YEARS AGO, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, THERE WAS SOME FR USTRATION AMONG AGENTS ABOU T THE PACE OF ACTIVITY ON THE ADMI NISTRATION'S PART. YOU A ND I HAVE ACTUALLY TALKED AT S OME POINTS ABOUT THINKING TH E ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE PUSHED HARDER FASTER, AFTER THAT INITIA L DROP IN NUMBERS WHEN THE PR ESIDE NT WAS INAUGURATED . WHAT IS THE CURRENT, I GUESS, SENTIMENT AMONG AGENTS? ARE THEY , IS THERE STILL A FRUSTRATI ON ? WHAT'S YOUR SENSE FOR T HE AGENTS AND THIS WHITE HOUSE AND THIS PRESIDENT TO THIS POINT? MR. JUDD: NO. RIGHT N OW A T THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NO FRUSTRAT ION BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THE PROGRAM S COME TO FRUITION. W HERE WE WERE VERY FRUSTR ATED IS IF YOU L OOKED AT THE LEADERS HIP THAT WE HAD AT DHS, THE MOVEMENT WA S VERY SLOW. WE KN EW WHAT NEEDED TO H APPEN. WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED T O START THE MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS VERY EARLY ON, AND, FR ANKLY, THE DHS KEP T PUSHING BACK, AND I T WASN'T T HE ADMINISTRAT ION. THE ADMINISTRAT ION CONTINUED TO PUSH FOR WAR D. BUT WHEN YOU HA VE SEGMENTS OF GOVERNME NT, AS WE'VE SE EN, YOU'VE GOT CAREER EMPL OYEES THAT PUSH B ACK ON POLITICALS, AND THAT'S JUST THE FACT OF THE GOVERNM ENT THAT WE CUR RENTLY HAVE. BUT W E HAVE SEEN THAT P RESIDENT TRUMP DID, IN FAC T, GET WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET DONE , AND SO THAT IS NOW GOING FORWA RD. ST EPHEN: AND CAN I - - ONE QUICK NOTE ON THE BORD ER WALL. THE COST OF THIS BORDER WALL IS COMING IN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE WALL BUILDING AT THE END OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRAT ION AND WHAT WALL WAS BUILT OR FE NCING WAS BUILT UNDER PRESIDENT O BAMA. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU MA KE OF THAT COS T SITUATION. AND THEN WE 'VE SEEN SOME REPORTING RECENTLY AB OUT EVEN THE NEW DESIGN, THE CURRENT DESIGN, BEING ABLE TO BE BREACHED. A ND I KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY VIEWERS OUT THERE WHO ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE E FFICACY OF A WALL SYST EM THAT CAN STILL BE BREACHED. I 'D BE CURI OUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO BREACH T HIS FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE, AND SORT OF HOW IT PLAYS IN TO THE WALL SYSTEM? MR. JUDD: O K, SO I'M GOING TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION FIRST. SO, YES, TH ERE WAS A REPORT OUT THERE THAT NEW SEGMENTS OF THE WALL HA D BE EN BREACHED, YET WE HAVE GON E OUT AND LOOKED AT ALL OF THE NEW SECTIONS OF THE WALL AND I HAVE YET TO FIND ANY NEW SECTIONS OF THE WALL THAT HAVE BEEN B REACHED. O LD SECTION S OF THE WALL, YES, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY BREACHES AND HAD THE ADMINISTRAT ION CONTINUED TO BUILD SECTIONS OF WALL LIKE WHAT WAS BUILT UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THOSE WALLS WERE BREACHABLE, BUT THERE ' S BE EN A LOT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT THAT'S GONE INTO T HE NEW WALLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY B EING BUILT. THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE MUCH, M UCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BREACH, AND AGAIN, WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BR EACHES. N OW, THAT REPORT THAT WAS DO NE, THERE WAS A COMPLETE DIAGRAM THA T WAS GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THESE B OLLA RDS STYLE FENCES COULD BE MO VED. THERE WAS A LOT OF DI FFERENT S TUFF , ALL OF THAT WAS BA SED UPON THE OLD MODEL. THE NEW MODEL, AGAIN, WE JUST HAV EN'T SEEN ANY BREACHES IN THAT. STEVE : REBEKAH MORIN. REBE KAH: HI, YES, SO THERE HA S BEEN AN INCREASE, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS - - GOT INTO OF FICE, HE ASKED FOR A N INCREASE OF BORDER PATROL AGEN TS ALONG THE BORDER, UP TO 5,000 . AND THERE HAS BEEN A STRU GGLE WITH THAT, OF COURSE, DUE TO FUNDING FROM CONGRESS, BUT I WANT TO K NOW FROM YOU, WHAT K IND OF FUNDING IS NEEDED TO T RAIN AND HELP KEEP ETHICAL TRA INING AL ONG THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, ESP ECIALLY WITH NEWER, YOUNGER AGENTS COMING IN. MR. JUD D: YES, I ACTUALLY STOOD WITH RESPECT TO TRUMP ON JANUARY , WITH PRESIDENT T RUMP ON JANUARY 25 OF 2017 WHEN HE SIGNED THE BORDER SECURITY EX ECUTIVE ORDER CALLING FOR 5,000 N EW BORDER PATROL AGENTS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADD TO OUR RANKS VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST ATTRITION R ATES IN THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE A LOT O F FACTORS THAT GO INTO WHY OU R ATTRITION RATES ARE SO HIGH. BU T ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IS THE CONS TANT DEMONIZING OF OUR AGEN TS FOR DOING THE JOB CONGRESS SE T US UP TO DO. I MEAN, ALL YOU HAV E TO DO IS LOOK , THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC CONGRESSMEN, CONGRESSWOM EN WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR SHOTS AT US AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS EN FORCING THE LAW THAT CONGRESS PU T INTO PLACE, THAT THAT B ODY, THAT THEY ARE NO W A PART OF, PU T INTO PLACE. AND WHEN WE 'RE DEMONIZED BY BOTH THE ME DIA, BY CONGRESS, AND BY OUTSIDE ENTITIES, IT'S NOT , IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR A CONDUCIVE P LACE TO WORK THA T PEOPLE FEEL COMFOR TABLE WITH THEY'RE DOING. AND SO WE'V E GOT TO GET RID OF THAT. WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE SIMPLY OUT THERE DOING, ENFORCING THE LAWS TH AT CONGRESS ENACTED. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYIN G TO SECURE THE BORDER FOR THE AME RICAN PEOPLE. WE GET CALL ED RACIST. WE GET CALL ED NAZIS. AND AGAIN, IT'S RIDICULOUS WHEN YOU CO NSIDER THE WHOLE RACIST THIN G, BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW , WE 'R E THE O NLY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCE MENT AGENCY IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT HAS MORE MINORITIES THAN WE DO WHITES, YET WE'RE CALLE D RACISTS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE' RE ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT CONGRE SS ENACTED. ST EVE: STEPHEN. ST EPHEN: I ACTUALLY WANTED TO F OLLOW UP. SOME OF THAT CRITICISM, THERE WAS O NE IN PARTICULAR THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION OVER THE SUMMER, THE ALLEGATION THAT, I GUE SS, AG ENTS IN A FACILITY IN TEXAS HA D TOLD A MIGRANT WOMAN TO DR INK WATER OUT OF A TOILET. A ND I'M WONDERING, SORT OF THA T SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THAT ALLEGATION AND THEN MO RE BROADLY, I KNOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS DONE SE VERA L REPORTS ON THE CONDITI ONS AT THOSE BORDER FACI LITIES. MONEY WAS PUMPED INTO THOSE BORDE R FACILITIES IN AN EMERG ENCY SUPPLEMENTAL EARLIER THI S YEAR TO TRY AND EAS E THE OVERCROWDIN G. I'M CURIOUS ABO UT, FIRST OF ALL, YOU R THOUGHTS ON THE OVERALL SITUATION AT THOSE BO RDER FACILITIES, AND THEN THE BR OADER SENSE OF SOME OF THESE CO MPLAINTS OF TREATMENT. MR. JUDD: S O THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE M ADE THAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS TOLD INDIVIDUALS TO DRINK OUT OF A TO ILET, I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ALLEG ATIONS ARE GOING TO BE PROVEN C OMPLETELY AND TOTALLY FALSE. WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS TO UNDE RSTAND IS THAT WE DO HAVE CAMERA S THAT ARE IN THESE FACILITIES. NOW, WE OBVIOUSLY CANNOT SEE INTO TH E RESTROOM PORTION OF THE FACI LITIES. THAT'S OPEN TO EVERYBOD Y. BUT WE HAVE CAMERAS THROUGHOUT THESE FACIL ITIES AND THESE C AMERAS CAN SEE WHA T IS TAKING PLACE IN THERE. I DO NOT BE LIEVE THAT THAT EVER HAPPENED. I WILL DISP UTE THAT 100%. I HAV E SPOKEN WITH AGENTS MULT IPLE TI MES, AND IT'S JUST A FALSE NARRATIVE. BUT IT'S VE RY EASY, IF YOU'RE IN CUSTODY, TO MAKE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BOR DER PATROL AGENTS, AND AGAIN, THOSE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE INV ESTIGATED AND THEY WILL B E INVESTIG ATED IN FULL, BUT T HAT AL LEGATION, I AM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE WILL COME OUT TO BE A FAL SE ALLEGATION. THESE FACIL ITIES, THERE IS AN ISSUE TH AT I WILL ABSOLUTELY 100% AGREE WITH CONGRESS ON. OUR FAC ILIT IES WERE NOT MADE TO HOLD IND IVI DUALS FOR EXTENDED HO LD INDIVI DUALS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. IN FACT, WE'RE ONLY SUPPOS ED TO HOLD PEOPLE FOR 72 HOUR S. YET WE ENDED UP HOLDING PEOPLE FOR DAYS ON END. I MEAN, IN SO ME CASES, WE WERE HOLDING PEOPLE FOR 30 DAYS IN THESE FACILITIES THAT WERE ONLY MADE TO HOUSE AN D HOLD PEOPLE FOR 72 HOUR S. AND THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAD NOWHERE TO TURN THEM OVER TO. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DIDN'T HAVE ANY RO OM FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS . ICRO DIDN'T HAVE ROOM FOR THESE I NDIV IDUALS , AND SO WE HAD TO HOLD ON TO THEM UNTIL HHS, WHICH AGAIN IS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVI CES, COULD MAKE ROOM FOR THESE P EOPLE. OR ICRO COULD MAKE ROOM FOR THESE PEOPLE. SO, WE WERE PUTTING INTO A NO-WIN SI TUATION. CONGRESS WASN'T GIVING US THE FUND ING THAT WE NEEDED. THE Y WEREN'T GIVING US THE FACI LITIES AND YET THEY TURNED AROUND AND BLAMED US FOR DOING T HE NECESSARY JOB THAT WE HAD TO D O UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY P UT US UNDER. THAT WAS , AGAIN, THAT WAS DEMORALIZING AND COMPLET ELY WRONG. STEP HEN: I'M CURIOUS, WHAT YOU JU ST DE SCRIBED IS SO DIAME TRICALLY OPPOSED TO WHAT WE DID HERE OUT OF SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO VISITED THESE FACIL ITIES. I'M STRUCK BY THE DIFFERENCE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BORDER WALL. THERE ARE FOLKS ON CAPITOL HILL WHO SA Y THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND FELLOW AGEN TS SAY THAT IT DOES MAKE A DIFF ERENCE. WHERE DID WE GET TO THIS POINT OF THIS DISCONNECT? AND HOW ARE VIEWERS SUPPOSED TO SORT THR OUGH THESE COMPETING CLAIMS? MR. JUDD: THIS IS STR ICTLY POLITICS. Y OU'VE GOT , AND AGAIN, IT HAPPENS ON BOTH THE RI GHT AND THE LEF T, SO LET'S NOT J UST BLAME ONE SIDE. BUT P OLITICS BEING WHAT THEY ARE, YOU'VE GOT THE LEF T THAT ARE SAYING THAT THE BO RDER WALL JUST ABSOLUTELY DOESN'T WOR K. NOW, I WILL REFUTE THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I SPEN T A LARGE MAJOR ITY, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS , I'M SPEAKIN G FOR AND ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL BO ARD PATROL COUNCIL RIGHT NOW, BUT I CAN BRING I N SPECIFIC CA SES OF WHEN I WAS A BORDER PATR OL AGENT. BUT WHEN I WAS A BOR DER PATROL AGEN T IN ARIZONA, I WORKED THERE PRE-W ALL, AND THE NUM BERS WERE ABSOLUTELY ASTRONOMICA L. A SMALL STR ETCH OF BORDER THAT WAS AB OUT 56 MILES IS WE COVERED AT THAT PARTIC ULAR BORDER PATROL STATION , WE WERE ARR ESTING OVER 100,000 PEO PLE A YEAR IN THAT SMALL LITTL E STRETCH. THAT WAS PRE-WALL. W E THEN BUI LT THOSE WALLS IN THE STRATEG IC LOCATIONS I N THAT AREA, AND THOSE N UMBERS DROPPED TO LESS THAN 2 0,000 PER YEAR. SO YO U CAN ABS OLUTELY SEE THAT WALLS IN STRATEGI C LOCATIONS W ORK. AND T HEY WORK V ERY, VERY WELL. BUT A GAIN, POLI TICS BEING WHAT THEY A RE, POLITI CIANS PANDERING T O THEIR BA SES INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT'S RIGH T FOR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE, THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THIS ARGUME NT COMING IN, INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING, THIS IS WHA T WE NEED FOR BORDER SECU RITY. T HIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GET T HE JOB DONE, AND WE JUST HAVEN' T BEEN ABLE TO COME TO A HAVEN' T B EEN ABLE T O COME TO A CONSENSUS YET. STEVE: MR. JUDD, LET ME ASK YOU ABO UT MEDICAL WAIVERS. WH AT IS THE PROCESS AND HAS IT CHAN GED IN ANY WAY IN THE LAST YEAR O R SO, WITH REGARD TO THOSE WH O WANT A MEDICAL WAIVER , ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN? M R. JUDD: SO, THE BORDER PATROL DOES N'T DEAL WITH MEDICAL WAI VERS, SO I CAN'T INTELLIGENTLY SPEAK TO TH AT. THAT IS GOING TO GO TO ICRO THAT D EALS WITH THAT. WHAT BORDER PATR OL AGENTS DO, THEY TAKE INDIVIDUALS INTO CUSTOD Y THAT CROSS THE BORDER ILLE GALLY. WE THEN PROCESS THE M ACCORDINGLY AND THEN TURN THEM OVER TO EIT HER CITIZENS AND IMMIGRATION SERVICE, HE ALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, O R ICRO, AND THAT'S WHERE THOSE DETERMINATIONS ARE BEING M ADE. BUT W HAT I CAN TELL YOU , AND AGAIN, WHEN I SAID I CAN'T SPEAK COMPL ETELY TO THIS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT MEDICAL WAIVERS CONTINUE AS FAR AS I'M AWARE. THEY CAN CO NTINUE TO ASK FOR MEDICAL WAI VERS. PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO ASK FOR ASYLUM. ALL OF THESE THING S STILL EXIST, BUT THE WAY WE'RE I MPLEMENTING THESE POLICIES ARE DIFFERE NT T HAN WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE T HAN WH AT HAPPENED UNDER THE O BAMA ADMINISTRATION, SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOL ES THAT HAVE DRAWN SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY. STEPHEN: SO, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW THAT YOUR AGENTS ARE DOING MORE OF IS INVOLVEM ENT AT THE FRONT END OF THAT ASY LUM PROCESS, WITH AGENTS BEING TRAIN ED TO HANDLE WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED CREDIBLE FEAR CLAIMS , HAVING A FEAR OF BEING RETURNED TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY. I' M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW B IG THAT PROGRAM IS, HOW MANY AG ENTS ARE INVOLVED, IF YOU HAVE A SENSE FOR THE EARLY OUTCOMES FO R THAT, WHETH ER IT'S CHANGING TH E NUMBERS OR THE PERCENTAGES WHO ARE CRO SSING THAT INITIAL THRESHOLD, AND THEN, OBVIOUSLY, ALONG WITH THAT, THIS IS TRADITIONAL LY A DUTY THAT U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRA TION SERVICES HAS DONE, A ND I KNOW THAT GOING INTO THIS, THERE WAS A NUMBE R , THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OR SPECULAT ION THAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS WOUL D BE TOO HARSH IN HANDLING TH ESE CLAIMS. I W OULD BE CURIOUS AS TO YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW I T'S PLAYING. MR . JUDD: SO, THE PRO GRAM IS ACTUALLY VERY SMALL, COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING. W HAT BORDER PATR OL AGENTS ARE DOING I S THEY'RE FIL LING IN FOR CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRA TION SERVICE, CI S, WHERE THEY NEED HELP. THE R EASON THAT CIS DETERMINED THIS WAS TH E PATHWAY FORWARD IS BECAUSE THI S PUTS PEOPLE INTO THE ASYLUM PROCEEDINGS IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN WAITING FOR A COUPL E OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD BE FORE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO BE PUT INTO TH E ASYLUM PROCEEDING. ONCE SOMEBODY IS GIVEN A CREDIBLE FEAR INTERVIEW, IF THEY FAI L THAT CREDIBLE FEAR INTERV IEW A ND THEY ASK FOR REDETER MINA TION, WHICH IS THEIR RIGHT TO DO, THEN AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE, BY R EGULATION, MUST HEAR THE CA SE WITHIN 10 DAYS. SO, T HERE I S A MUCH QUICKER CLO SURE TO THE PROCESS WHICH ALLEV IATES THE IMMIGRATION JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IT ALSO ALL OWS THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROSSIN G THE BORDER AND CLAIMING AS YLUM, IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM CLOSUR E MUCH QUICKER, RATHER THAN HAVING TO WAIT IN LIMBO ON WH AT'S GOING TO HAPPEN DOWN THE RO AD. I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ASSET. IT'S WORKED EXACTLY AS INTENDED . - - I THINK THA T IT'S WORKED EXACTLY AS INTENDED. EVEN, YOU KNOW, THE C RITICISM THAT BORDER PATROL AGEN TS WOULD BE TOO HARSH, THERE IS AN OVERSIGHT PROCESS TO THIS, TO ENSURE THAT BORDER PATROL AGEN TS AREN 'T TOO HARSH. BUT THAT CR ITICISM, AGAIN, STEP HEN, THOSE ARE THE TYP ES OF CRITICISMS, THAT, AGAIN, TAKE S US RIGHT BACK TO THE POLITIC S OF THIS ISSUE. THAT CRITICISM, THE LAW SPE CIFICALLY SAYS THE IM MIGRA TION OFFICERS AR E THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN GIVE CREDIB LE FEAR INTERVIEWS. BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE IMMIGRA TION OFFICERS. T HEREFORE, BY THE LAW, THEY CAN CO NDUCT THESE CREDIBLE FE AR INTERVIEWS. IF THE PUBLIC WANTS TO SAY, OR THE MEDIA, WHICH WAS T HE OUTCRY, AND CERTAIN POL ITICIANS, IF THEY WANT TO PROVE TH AT BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE CORRUPT OR THAT THEY REFUSE TO DO THEIR JOB CORRECTLY, THEN THEY N EED TO DEAL WITH THOSE SPECI FIC BORDER PATROL AGENTS. BUT THE BORDER PATROL, AS A WHOLE, THEY DO THE IR JOB, THEY DO IT HONORABLY, AND THAT CR ITICISM JUST ISN'T JUSTIFIED, AND THE NUMBERS HAVE BORNE IT OUT, AND THE PRO GRAM IS WORKING VERY WELL. STEVE : AS YOU KNOW , LAST MONTH, NINE AMERICAN CI TIZENS WERE KILLED IN A HORRIFIC SHOOTOUT BY AT LEAST ONE MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL. JUS T HOW BAD OF A PROBLEM IS IT? HOW WID ESPREAD ARE THESE C ARTELS ALONG THE BORDER? MR. JUDD: NOTHI NG CROSSES THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. THAT DOES N OT MATTER IF IT'S INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CO MING ACROSS THE BORDER TO CLAIM ASYLUM. IT DOESN'T MAT TER IF IT'S NARCOTICS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S COUNTERFEIT GOODS. NOTHING CROSSES THE SOUTHWEST B ORDER ILLE GALLY WITHOUT THE SAY SO OF C RIMINAL CA RTELS. TH EY CONTRO L EVERY SINGLE FACET OF IL LEGAL CRI ME ON THE BORDER. THE SE CRIMI NAL CARTELS OPERATE IN EVERY SI NGLE TOWN ON THE SOUTHWE ST B ORDER AND THEY ARE VERY VIOLENT. TH EY ARE VERY DANGEROUS. ALL YOU HAV E TO DO IS LOOK AT THE MURD ER RATE IN MEXICO TO UNDERSTA ND JUST HOW BAD IT IS. THE UNI TED STAT ES INTELLIGENC E COMMUNITY H AS ESTIMATED THAT CRIMIN AL CA RTELS CONTROL SOM EWHERE A ROUND 80% OF THE COUNTRY IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW. NOW, THAT A GAIN IS ON THE HIGH END. THERE ARE L OWER ESTIMATES, BUT EVEN IF YOU GO LOWER, THE FACT THAT C RIMIN AL CARTELS ARE CONTROL LING ANY PART OF MEXICO SHOU LD BE C ONCERNING, AND IT MAKES EV ERY THING VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BORDER PATROL AGENTS GET SO FRUSTRAT ED WITH POLITICIANS THAT SAY IT 'S OK FOR PEOPLE TO CROSS THE B ORDER ILLEGALLY. THEY ARE ENCOURAGING , POLITICIANS ARE ENCOURAGING A VERY VULN ERABLE SEGMENT OF POPULATI ON IN SOUTH AMERICA TO PUT THEM SELVES IN THE HANDS OF CR IMINAL CARTELS. TH ESE INDIVIDUALS AT TIMES AR E RAPED. THEY 'RE ENSLAVED. T HEY'RE EVEN MURDERED BY THE CRIMINA L CARTELS AND IT'S AL L BECAUSE WE DO NOT ENFORCE OUR LAWS TH E WAY THE LAWS ARE WR ITTEN AND WE GLAMORIZE ILLEGAL ACT IVITY RATHER THAN, AND I 'M SORRY, WE GLAMORIZE ILLEGAL ACT IVITY AND WE VILIFY O UR BORDER PATROL AGENTS RATHER THAN PROPPI NG UP OUR BORDER PATR OL AGENTS AND GOING AFTER THE CARTELS AND TRYING TO S HUT DOWN THIS I LLEGAL SYSTEM THAT EXISTS FOR A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. I H AVE NOT HEARD ONE P OLITICIAN, WHETHER IT'S REPUBL ICAN OR DEMOCRAT , THAT IS AGA INST A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. I H AVE HEARD AN AWFUL LO T THAT ARE AGAINST AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. STE VE: FINAL QUESTION, B ACK TO STEPHEN DINAN. STEP HEN: YOU MENTION ED THE CARTELS CONTROLLING THAT TRAFFI C AND ONE OF THE THIN GS THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE SEEIN G, NOW THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SU RGE HAS DISSIPATED, IS A GROWTH IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO ITSELF. AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHETHER THA T TIES INTO THE CA RTELS, WHY THAT'S HAPPENING, AND SORT OF THE TRAJ ECTORIE S. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE EARLY NEXT YEAR O N THOSE BORDER NUMBERS? MR. JUDD: T HIS SHOULD BE PROOF POSITIVE TH AT CRIMINAL CARTELS CON TROL EVERYTHING THAT IS ILLEGAL. CR IMINAL CA RTELS, THEY KNEW THAT A LOOPHOLE EXISTED AS FAR AS OUR ASYLUM CLAI MS. PUT ONE FOOT IN TO THE UNITED STATES, CLAIM ASYLU M, GET RELEASE D UN DER THE CATCH AND RELEASE PROGRAM. ON ES THAT SHUT DOWN, NOW CRIMINA L CA RTELS ARE , THEY'RE SELLING THE IR SERVICE TO THE MEXICAN CIT IZENS, THE MEXICAN POPULATION, INSTEAD OF IN THE CENTRAL AME RICAN COUNTRIES. AND SO WE'R E SEEING A HUGE INCREA SE IN PEOPLE FROM MEXICO THAT ARE CR OSSING OUR BORDER ILLEGALLY, WHEREAS WHEN THE CRIMINAL CA RTELS WERE SELLING IT , SELLI NG THE IR SERVICES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICANS, WE SAW VERY FEW MEXICAN CITIZENS CROSSING THE BORDER. NOW , IT'S B ASICALLY THE CRIMINAL CARTELS ARE NOW SELLING THEIR SERVI CES TO THE MEXICAN CITIZENS AN D THAT'S THE MAIN POPULATION THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. STEVE: QUICK FOLLO W-UP. STEPHEN: DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE ? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT EARLY NEXT YEAR AND DO WE EXPEC T ANOTHER RESURGENCE OF CENTRAL AMERICANS NEXT YEAR, OR DO YOU B ELIEVE THAT'S BEEN SOLVED? MR. JUDD: A S LONG AS THE PROGRAMS CONTINUE IN PLACE, AS LONG AS THESE AG REEMENTS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, GUATEMALA, AS LONG AS THESE PROGRAMS CO NTINUE TO EXIST, N O, I DO NOT FORESEE A R ESURGENC E OF CENTRAL AMERICANS. AS LONG AS THE CARTELS CAN CONTINU E TO LOOK FOR LOOPHOL ES T O EXPLOIT, THEY'RE GOING TO BR ING ACROSS WHOMEVER THEY NEED T O. THEY AR E IN THE BUSINESS OF CREATING A PROFIT, AND YES, IT 'S AN ILLICIT BUSINESS, BUT IT'S A BUSINESS. T HEY CREATE AND GENERAT E PROFIT, AND SO THEY'RE ALWAYS GOIN G TO LOOK FOR THOSE THAT CAN GE T THEM PROFIT S AND THEY'RE GOI NG TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO THEM. ST EVE : BRANDON JUDD, JOINI NG US FROM MONTANA ON THIS HOL IDAY WEEK, THE PRESIDE NT OF THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUN CIL. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. HAPPY NEW YEAR. MR. J UDD: MERRY CHRIS TMAS, HAPPY NEW YEAR TO BOTH OF YOU, REBEKAH AND STEPHEN, TH ANK YOU VERY MUCH. STEVE : LET' S RETURN TO R EBEKAH MORIN. IF Y OU READ THE POLITIC AL TEA LEAVES, IT SEEMS TH AT AN ENDORSEMENT IS IN THE O FFING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. REBE KAH: YES, DEFINI TELY. HE SAID ARO UND FEBRUARY, I BELIEVE, SO HE'S, AG AIN, THAT'S THE FIRST PRESI DENT THAT THE NATIONAL BORDER PATR OL COUNCIL HAS EVER ENDORSED. I T SOUNDS L IKE THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN . I EXPECT TO HEAR IT SOON, AND M AYBE POSSIBLY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP BY HI S SIDE. STEVE : STEPHEN, LE T ME FOLLOW UP ON THAT POI NT. YOU BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF TH E DRUG CARTELS AND JUST HOW PREVALE NT THEY ARE ALONG THE BORDER, AND A PROBLEM THAT IS NOT GOIN G AWAY. STEPHEN: IT 'S INTERESTING. I'VE SEEN A HOME LAND SECURITY OFFICIAL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HA D E STIMATED THAT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF CENTRAL AMERICANS COMING IN H AS LITERALLY TAKEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF THE CARTELS' PR OFITS, WHICH IS WHY YOU HEA RD B RANDON JUDD SAY THAT THE CARTELS ARE NOW LOOKING INT ERNALLY TO MEXICO, REC RUITING. THEY LITERA LLY A DVERTISE FOR PEOPLE THRO UGH SOC IAL MEDIA, IN PARTICULAR, ADVERTISE AND SAY, HEY, W E CAN GET YOU TO THE U.S., HERE' S THE PATH THAT WE'LL TAKE AND HE RE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. PAY US OUR MONEY AND WE'LL TAKE YOU AN D HERE'S THE LOOPHOLES T HAT YOU EXPLOIT, BECAUSE THE Y'VE LOST THAT CUSTOMER BASE IN CEN TRAL AMERICA. TH EY'RE NOW TURNING TO MEXICO AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY TURNING TO FURTHER AFIELD. EXT RACONTINENTAL IS THE WORD TH AT HOMELAND SECURITY IS USING NO W, LOOKING AT AFRICA, ASIA, AND O THER PLACES TO REPLACE THE CUSTOME RS THAT THEY'VE LOST FROM T HE CENTRAL AMERICA. ST EVE: VERY QUICKLY FOR EACH OF YOU, THE FUNDING ISSUE THAT CONGRE SS PUT INTO PLACE, WHERE DOES THAT STAND RIGHT NOW? WHAT I S THE NEXT STEP? STEPH EN: SO THE MONEY, $1.375 BILLION INC LUDED IN THE APPROPR IATIONS BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT H AS SIGNED, SO HE HAS ACCESS TO T HAT MONEY FOR WALL BUILDING. W HAT IS UNKNOWN IS WHETHER HE'LL DO WH AT HE DID LAST YEAR AND ATTEMPT TO SLICE IN MONEY FROM THE PE NTAGON AGAIN INTO MORE WALL B UILDING. I 'VE BEEN TOLD BY WHITE HOUSE OFFIC IALS THAT THEY ARE , THE PRESIDE NT HAS ASKED FOR $5 BILL ION. WHITE HOUSE OFFIC IALS TELL ME THAT THE $1.375 BILLION IS ACTUALLY ALL , GIVEN ALL THE MON EY T HEY DID SIPHON LAST YEAR, THEY' RE BAS ICALLY BUMPING UP AGAINST THEIR CAPACITY FOR WALL BU ILDING RIGHT NOW. SO, TH EY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED MORE T HAN $1.375 BILLION FRO M CONGRE SS, BUT THERE'S A VERY BIG SYMBOL HERE TO THE PRES IDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HE T ALKS ABOUT, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 400-45 0 MILES OF WALL COM PLETED BY THE END OF 2020 . BASICALLY, AS I GO TO FACE THE VOTERS, AND SO HE'S , HOMELAND SECURITY IS VERY AWA RE THAT HE'S SET TH AT GOAL FOR TH EM, AND THE MOST RECENT WE HEARD OU T OF HOMELAND SECURITY WA S THAT THEY , THE Y , THEY'LL COM E CLOSE. THEY 'RE NOT SURE TH EY WILL ACTUAL LY MEET HIS GO AL, BUT THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL B E VERY CLOSE TO IT. STEVE: AND WE CAN CONCLUDE ON THIS POINT. IS T HIS ALL ABOUT 2 020, SOMETHING THAT THE PR ESIDENT CAN TELL VOTERS? BEC AUSE HE CLEARLY RAN ON THIS IN 2016 ALTHOUGH HE DID SAY MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL. REBEK AH: YES, THIS I S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A LARGE POINT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 20 20. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. I T IS SOMETHING THAT HE CAN TURN TO AND SAY, HEY, L OOKIT, THERE'S ACTUAL STAT ISTICS SHOWING THAT THE NUMBER OF A SYLUM SEEKERS IS GOING DO WN DUE TO HIS PROGRAMS. HE HAS THIN GS THAT HE CAN SHOW VOTERS LIKE HEY, T HIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING. AND THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING H E'S GOING TO TOUT ON THE TRAIL.

I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REPRESE NTED THIS STATE. AND SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SA Y IT BEFORE. IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT , EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATT ER OF FACT, FI RST TIME I RAN FOR THE UNITED DATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YE AR S OLD, WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. J UDGE BRODE RICK, I HAVE TO B E VERY CAREFU L IN FRONT OF HIM. I MAY BE CA LLED B EFORE THE COURT. A GREAT FRI END FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN I RAN, MY S TATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS, DOWN AROUND THE MASSACHUSETTS BORDER, A L ITTLE COMPETITION. BUT I REMEM BER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMP AIGN IN THE SOUT HERN PART OF THE STATE O F DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. W E WE RE A B ORDER STATE, WASN'T SURE WHAT SIDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE S OUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VE RY SOUTHERN. T HEY TALK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE A GO OD OLD FELLA. SO T HE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YO UR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. T HEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SA Y BEC AUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOW N HERE. I REM EMBER THERE WAS A GUY CALLE D EDGAR C. BENNETT , YOU COULDN' T CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU'R E NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOM E. EDGAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CONSER VATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HA PPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. S O WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN A TOWN C ALLED SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BE AUTIFUL OLD CHURCH, MET HODIST CHURCH, AND IT HAD THE GRAVEYA RD IN THE FRON T LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BE LONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, S T. JOSEPH'S. YOU WALK TH ROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENT RANCE TO GO UP. AND THE MINISTER WAS VERY KI ND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. AND HE SAID WE HAV E WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HOP EFULLY, HE WILL GRE ET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WAL K OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT , BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTE R SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR C. WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER WARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HO RSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE S AID OH, TH AT'S MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. [LAU GHTER] MR. BIDEN: TRUE STORY. SO I GUESS IT'S LIKE THAT I N NEW HAMPSHIRE, ANYWAY. LOO K, THERE 'S A LOT TO TA LK ABOUT SO I WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMB ER ONE, THERE' S AN OVERWHELMIN G AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAV E TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SIN GLE MOST CONSEQ UENTI AL ISSUE, AS Y OU KNOW, MR. M AYOR, IF W E GET FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD T RUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACT ER OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. SO, I T MATT ERS A LOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE'RE GOING TO PI CK. AND S O, WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SEN ATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE CLEAR LY WHY I WAS R UNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND THERE'S THREE REASONS. ON E WAS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THI S COU NTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT' S HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGI NG, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY AS KED THE PRESIDENT WHAT HE THO UGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SID ES. NO P RESIDENT'S NEVER SAID ANYTHI NG LIKE THAT, I MEAN FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAI D SOMETH ING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT H AS EVER SA ID SOMETH ING LIKE THAT. THAT' S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M RUNNING, TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THO SE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDEN T. WE'VE NEVER WALKE D AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS AD MINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVE RY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED T HE ARC OF INCLUSION WIDER AND W IDER AND I T'S BEING SHUT DOWN N OW. I THIN K IT'S BEING CORRO SIVE FOR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING WAS TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS T AKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN TH E WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHI EST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORL D. AND ALMOST ALL THE DAT A SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE ST ANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. W E'VE NEVER THOUG HT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CENTURY. WE 'VE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED . THIS TIME WHEN W E REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE'V E GOT TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVER YBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE O F COLOR, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKIN G PEOPLE WHO JUST , MY DAD WOUL D SAY, I'M NO T LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, JO EY. I JUST WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE M E A SHOT. THE THIRD REASO N I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. AN D I WAS P RETTY ROUNDLY CRI TICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGU ES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM , OF FOR THE PRIMARY , NO, THERE A RE A CTUALLY SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE . THEY REALLY ARE. THEY'R E GOO D PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BE FORE, REMEMBER? H E DID THE ARMS CONTROL TRE ATIES. H E DID , AND THEY WO ULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. AND T HIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFEREN T. IT'S DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LO T OF THESE THINGS. I T HINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTE LY CRITICAL. I DON'T THINK IT'S NAIVE , I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY W ELL. I'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONA LD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ON LY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FA MILY, GOING AFTER ME , I UND ERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT I T'S NO T ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S A BOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. AN D PRESIDE NTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGE S. PR ESIDENT SHOULD RUN AND REP RESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. JOHN KNOWS ME WELL. I MEAN IT. ALL THE PEO PLE. IMM IGRANTS, REPUBLICANS , AND , DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPEN DENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO - - CAN'T DO ANYTHING. T HIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NO THING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESID ENT W HO SAYS I CAN'T GET IT DONE SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AN D DO IT. SO I DO N'T THINK IT'S NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITI NG THE COUNTRY AND THE NEE D TO DO IT. I BELIE VE WE CAN BECA USE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT T HE PROPOSITION , SOME OF THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING WITH IN THI S NOMINATION SAY TO ACCE PT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOR EVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT'S NOT WH O WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: SO WE HAVE TO. WE CAN' T SURRE NDER THE NOTION. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I 'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE . DOE SN'T MEA N IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HARD THI S TIME. HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUS E AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, A ND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DON'T MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSO NALITIES. I DON'T MEAN THE DI RTY POLITICS OF GOING AF TER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK WHAT'S HAPP ENED IN AMERICAN PO LITICS. E VEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CL OSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPENS? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THI NK YOU 'R E IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSI NESS. I THINK YOU'RE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU'RE THIS , BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE'R E GOING TO WORKOUT CLI MATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I L EARNED A LONG TIME AGO FR OM A GUY NAMED M IKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORIT Y LEADER FROM MONTAN A, HE WAS CALL ED IRON MIKE, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST P EOPLE HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID JOE , IT'S NOT ALWAYS APPR OPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT'S AL WAYS APPR OPRIATE TO QUESTION TH EIR JUDGMENT. Y OU DON'T KNOW THEIR MOTIV ES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGM ENT. THEN YOU CAN GET SOM ETHING PASSED. WHE N IN FACT A LOT HAS C HANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIN D OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UND ER THE THREE S HELLS, YOU USUALLY DON'T BET ON HIM A SE COND TIME. HE WAS GOIN G TO TAKE CARE OF THE FORG OTTEN P EOPLE AND THEN HE FORGOT T HAT THEY FORGET. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN, IN FACT, SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRON MENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLIC ANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN OWN THE 21ST CE NTURY. WE HAVE WHAT IT TAK ES. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMI STIC IN MY LIFE ABO UT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTR Y. FOLKS, LOOK. IF YO U THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE IN A SITUAT ION WHERE WE'VE GOT TO GIVE , WHEN THE RE PUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, WH EN I'M YOUR PRESID ENT, IF I'M YOUR PRESID ENT, HERE'S THE DEAL. WE TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DI STRICTS. CAMPAIGN. F OR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FO R 67, 69 , I'M NOT SURE THE NU MBER OF CANDIDATES , LAST TIME O UT IN 2018. I'M T HE ONLY GU Y INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FRO M ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANI A, STATE THAT WE LOST AND/OR WERE CLOSE. AND GUESS W HAT WE DID? WE DID N'T G O AFTER THE PERSONALITI ES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAI NST . WE SAID WE' RE GOING TO WIN 41 SEATS AN D W E'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK THE HO USE. WE WON 41 S EATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEM Y GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PIL OT, DROPPING BOMBS. YOU KNOW, T HIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. BUT WHAT'D WE DO? WE SAID, AL L OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REAL IZED, REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED OBAM ACARE. EVERYBODY S AID YOU LO ST BECAUSE IT' S NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPEN ED? THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLI CANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, W E'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMAC ARE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-E XISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YO U CAN'T KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YO UR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL HE'S 26 ANYMORE, ETC. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY SAID WHOA, WHAT? BECAUSE PEO PLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT - - I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BU T JOHN KNOWS , MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 'VE GOT TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. Y OU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. REMEMBE R, I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRE SIDE CHAT , REMEMBER THAT? BUT T HE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HA VE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY L AP. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STAR TED TO TAKE IT AWAY THA T PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. SO AL L WE DID WAS GO OUT AND SAY LOOK, YOUR STATE REP, GOVERNOR, Y OUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRE SSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWA Y THIS THING YOU H AVE. PEOPL E SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN Y OU CAN'T CONVI NCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CA SE. AND S O PEOPLE KNOW , I'M CONCLUD ING WITH THIS A ND I'LL GO TO QUEST IONS, BECAUSE THE RE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WA NT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A W HOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENC E AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY 'RE TRYING TO K ILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF TH INGS. EVE RYBODY W HO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL. THIS IS REALITY. EVEN THE SU PPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KN OW W HO YEARS. PEOPLE LIKE HIM. T HEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THE M ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARAC TER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR BECAUSE OF THINGS D EMO CRATS DIDN'T DO OR WHATEVER. W E'VE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW THAT , WHO WE ARE, HOWEVER. WE'VE GOT T O LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHO OSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAU SE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEA R TO PEOPLE. FEA R. WE HAVE TO CHOOSE T RUTH OVERL IES. , OVER LIES. THAT'S HIS THEORY, EVENTUALLY IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT . WE CHO OSE T RUTH OVER LIES. WE CHOOSE S CIENCE OVER FICTION. OV ER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: FOR REAL. WE GO T A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. AND I W ANT TO START OFF BY THAN KING EVERYBODY UNDER THE A GE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KI DDO. I DO N'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE, BUT T HANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. BUT AFTER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBO DY UNDER 15, Y OU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TOD AY, BECAUSE THI S HAS GOT TO BE B ORING, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: ANYWAY, MY MOTHER W OULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, H USH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. SO FIRE AWAY. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE, GIVE THE MICROPH ONE TO THEM , >> HELLO, THAN K YOU S O MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I JU ST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE ACA. MY CHILD WAS BORN SUPER SICK AND BEFORE THE ACA LIF TED LIFETIME IN SURANCE CAPS, AND S O I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M JUS T WONDER ING WITH ALL TH ESE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ACA, WHAT ARE YO U GOING TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDRE N RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT T HEY NEED AND CA N ACCESS ALL THE MEDICAL SERVICES THEY REQUIR E? MR . BIDEN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST NAME? >> SA RAH. MR. BIDEN: SARAH. YOU KNOW, Y OU COULD HEAR A CRACK IN SARAH'S VOICE THERE, BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TH ING SARAH HAS. I ALSO WAS A SIGNI FICANT USER OF HEA LTH CARE . WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED, BE FORE I GOT SWORN IN, I WAS IN WASHINGTON AND A TRACT OR-TRAILER BLINDSIDED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, A ND KILLED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTE R. B UT MY SONS SURVIVED. A NYWAY. BUT WHAT HA PPENED WAS, I HAVE INSURANCE. I HAD THE PEACE OF MIND THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM GOOD DOCTOR S. AN D THEN, YOU KNOW, I GOT HOSPITA LIZED YEARS AGO WITH A CRAN IAL A NEURYSM. I WAS HOSPITALIZED A COUPLE OF TIMES. THEY TOOK THE TOP OF MY HEAD OFF THE SEC OND TIME, SAID THEY COULD N'T F IND MY BRA IN THE FIRST TIME. [LAUG HTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT IT WAS MY NURSES THAT GAVE ME HOPE. AN D MY SON, BEAU, ATTOR NEY GENERAL, A DECORATED WAR HERO , FOR REAL. A YEAR IN I RAQ, SIX MONTHS IN COZUMEL BEFORE THAT . HE CAME HOME AND WA S DIAGNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOM A, GIVEN MONTHS. IT WASN'T COULD HE - - WOULD HE LIVE, IT WAS WHEN. R UN OUT OF COVERAGE. S UFFER IN PEACE. Y OU' RE ON Y OUR OWN. ONE OF THE THIN GS MY DAD USED TO SAY IS T HAT EVE RYONE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREAT ED WITH DIGNITY. HO W CAN A P ARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHE N THEY HAVE A DYING CHILD AND T HERE'S NOT A DAMN THING YOU C AN DO ABOUT IT? HOW CAN A P ARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHEN THEY'R E IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE A TALE NTED CH ILD IN SCHOOL AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY TO GET THEM THERE. HEAL TH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NO T A PRIVILEGE. SO HERE'S WHAT I SUPPOSE. AN D I WON'T GO INTO EXCRUCIATIN G DETAIL, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO DO MORE, LET ME KNOW. NUMBE R ONE, I TAKE OBAMACARE AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZE IT SO IT CO STS LESS TO GET INTO OBAMACARE F OR EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR I NCOME IS, SO YOU CAN GET WHA T YOU CA LL A GOLD PLAN, AND I F YOU CAN AFF ORD, THAT IS, IF YOU HAVE GOOD INCOME, YOU CAN BUY INTO IT AND IN FACT , YOU'LL NOT HAVE A DEDUCTIBL E MORE THAN $ 1000 EVER. THAT' S THE GOLD PL AN. YOU D ON'T HAVE TO BUY THAT PLAN. YOU CAN BUY A CHEAPER P LAN IF YOU'D LI KE. FOR T HOSE WHO CAN'T A FFORD HEALTH CARE PLAN, I PRO VIDE WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED , ARE , I US UALLY W OULD CALL HIM PR ESIDENT, BUT I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH TH E OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: I MEAN IT. I DON'T WANT TO GET THEM MIXED UP. WE TALKED A BOUT THE NEED TO ADD A PUBLIC OP TION, A PUBLIC OPTION THAT PROVIDED ME DICARE, A MEDICARE-LI KE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO IN FACT WAN TED TO BUY INTO A MEDICARE OPTION IF T HEY WANTED TO DO IT. A ND IF THEY WANTED TO D O IT, AND IF THEY COU LDN'T AF FORD IT, IF THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, THEY WOULD AUTOMATICAL LY BE ENROLLED IN THIS MED ICARE OPTION. IT'S MEDICA RE FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT, BECAUSE WE HAVE 160 MILLION PEO PLE NATI ONWIDE WHO IN FACT LIKE THE HE ALTH CARE PLANS THEY HAVE NEGOTI ATED, MANY OF THEM WITH THE UN IONS AND COMPANIES, THAT ARE VE RY EXPENSIVE PLANS THAT THEY LIKE. AND, IN FAC T, THEY GAVE UP SIGNIFICANT SALARY CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO GET THAT COVERAGE. A ND YOU SHO ULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP IF YO U WANT TO KEEP IT. LIKE ME DICA RE FOR ALL, YOU MUST, AS A MATTER OF LAW, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY PR IVATE INSURANCE. YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. BARACK PROM ISED YOU COULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE R IGHT. YOU CAN KEE P YOUR PLAN AS LONG AS YOUR COM PANY HAS THE PLAN. THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND SAY, WE'RE NOT G OING TO DO IT ANYMORE. TH EN YOU'RE ABLE TO BUY INTO OBAMAC ARE, THE OBAMA-BIDEN PLAN, THAT RELATES TO HAVING THIS PUBLIC OPTION. AND MY PLAN , I D ON'T WAN T TO KILL YOU , WHAT DOES IT COST? COST A LOT OF MONEY, $750 BILLION OVE R 10 YEARS. BUT IT DOES N'T COST $30 TRILLION OV ER 10 YEARS, AND IT LEAVES Y OU WITH THE OPTION OF KEEPING WHA T YOU HA VE IF YOU WANT IT OR BUYIN G I N IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. EV ERYBO DY IN MY STATE, LIKE YOURS, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, U NLESS GOD BLESS H IS MEMORY. UNLESS YOU ALL , I KNOW HE'S A REPU BLICA N , HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT? I LAY OUT IN DETAIL HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THE PLAN AND EVERYTH ING ELSE I CALL FOR, AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU THESE CHARTS. AND THESE ARE THE TAX INC REASES FOR THE VERY, VERY WEALTH Y, BE CAUSE WE NOW HAVE $1 TRILLION, $800 BILLION, $900 BILLION ADD ITIONAL DEFICIT BECAUSE OF THE TAX PROPOSA LS T HE PRESIDENT PUT FORWARD , TRUMP, THAT OVERWHELMIN GLY TAKES CARE OF THE TOP 1% OF THE AMERICAN PE OPLE. FOR EXAMPLE , WHAT I DO IS I T AK E CAPITA L GAI NS AND I TREAT THEM AS ORDINARY INCOME. NOT HING WRONG WITH THAT. IF YO U WANT TO DO THAT. BU T IF YOU' RE IN , AND I'D RAI SE T HE TAX BRACKET BAC K UP TO 39.6% FOR THE WEALTHIEST. IF YOU'RE IN T HAT TAX BRACKET, YOU PAY 39.6% ON TH E CAPITAL GAINS INSTEAD OF 20%. THA T ALONE WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION, TH AT ONE TH ING. I'D RAISE THE C ORPORATE TAX RATE. I COM E FROM THE CORPORATE S TATE OF AMERICA. MO RE CORPORATIONS ARE INCORPORATE D IN MY STATE THAN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT'S NOT A JOKE. IT'S GIGANT IC. GUESS WHAT? BARACK AND I THOUG HT THESE CORPORATE TAX RATES S HOULD BE LOWERED FROM 38% TO 28%, BUT NOT TO 20%. SO IF YOU TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28%, WHI CH IS A RATIONAL PO SITION, T HAT RAISES ABOUT $720 BILLION. I' M NOT GOI NG TO GO THROUGH IT ALL. AND ENDING THE FOSSIL FUEL PRODUC TION TAX BREAK, THAT RAISES ABOUT $25 BILLION RIGHT OFF T HE BAT. THERE' S A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. SO I PAY FOR E VERYTHING I CALL FOR, EVERYT HING I CALL FOR. AND ST ILL WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT IN THE PROCESS. BE CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED ALL THIS MO NEY TO PAY FOR THE THINGS I CA LL FOR IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ETC. SO THAT'S P ROBABLY MORE THAN YOU WA NTED TO KNOW. THERE'S A L OT MORE TO SAY, BUT YOU SHO ULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY. IF Y OU HAVE , FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN GALE I NTRODUCED ME , YOU KNOW, L ET ME SAY IT ANOTHER WAY. HOW MA NY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, IF YO U DON' T WANT TO ANSWER YOUR , YOU DON'T HAVE TO, OB VIOUS LY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHT ER, HUSBAND, WIFE, MOTHER, OR FATHER T O CANCER ?WERE FATHER , T O CANCER? RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T H AVE COVERAGE. A ND IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOU R HOUSE TO GET THE COVERAGE, H OW MANY HAVE , I WON'T GO THROUGH IT. ANYWAY, SO THERE'S A LOT WE CA N DO, AFF ORD TO D O, AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST DEAL. I ADMIRE TH E INTENTION OF MY FRIENDS WHO FOUGHT FOR MEDICARE FO R ALL, BUT THE MINIMUM NUMBER IS $ 30 TRILLION OVER 10, MO ST PEOPLE THINK IT'S $40 TRILLION, B UT THAT'S $3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. THAT'S MORE MONEY THAN WE SPEND ON EVERY SINGLE THING THE G OVERNMENT DOES. YOU C OULD WIPE OUT THE PENTAGON, SATELLITES IN THE SKY, EVERYTHING. YOU CAN WIP E OUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIO N. YOU CAN WIP E OUT TH E ENTIRETY OF THE CIVI L SERVICE, WIPE IT ALL OUT. IT DOE SN'T ADD UP TO $ 3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. AND I THINK THE MOST IM PORTANT THING IN RUNNING AGA INST DONALD TRUM P IS WE HAVE TO HAV E TRUTH IN LENDING HERE. NO, N O, THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO AGAI NST THI S GUY, RUNNIN G AGAINST HIM, IS ASS ERT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ACCURATE OR SO PREPO STE ROUS TO GET DONE THAT HE'S ABLE TO HAV E A FIELD DAY. DON'T UNDERESTIMA TE. DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE THIS GUY. DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE HIM. HE BRAGS ABOUT AN EC ONOMY THAT IS GRO WING, AND IT IS G ROWING. EX CEPT IF Y OU'RE IN THE BOTTOM 96% OF THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: NO, NO, BUT LOOK, THE STOCK M ARKET IS AS HIGH AS IT HAS EVER BEEN. UNEMPLOYMEN T IS INCREDIBLY LOW. IT'S REAL. IT HA S GROW N. BUT THERE'S NO RATIONAL DISTRIBUTIO N OF THE GROWTH IN TERMS OF INCREASES IN INCOME AND OTHER T HINGS. I W ILL ANSWER QUESTIONS SHORTER NOW IF YOU ASK ME LESS COMPLI CATED QUESTIONS. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: I LI KE THE PLAID CAP. >> WHA T ARE YO U LOOKING FOR IN QUALITIE S FOR A RUNNING MATE? MR. B IDEN: YOU AVAILABLE, SIR? [LAUGH TER] MR. BIDEN: LOOK, THE ONLY TH ING I KNO W A LOT ABOUT IS THE VICE PR ESIDENCY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT BY A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PR ESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS OF LATE, IS TH AT THEY ARGUE THAT THERE HAS N EVER BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT O R PRESIDENT CLOSER THAN BARACK AND I. NOW, THA T D IDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. W E DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER THAT WELL WHEN I T STARTED. I GOT TO KN OW HIM. AND WH EN HE MOVED HIS FAMILY TO WASHINGTON AFTER SOME TIME, I SET HIM U P WITH MY SON HUNT ER AND HIS FAMILY, AND THEY TA LKED AND BECAME FRIENDS. MI CHELLE BE CAME FRIENDS WIT H MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. OUR GRANDDA UGHTERS, MY GRANDDAU GHTERS AND HIS DAU GHTERS A RE EACH OTHER' S BEST FRIENDS. MA ISIE, WHO IS A FRESHMAN AT PENN, AN D H IS DAUGHTER, S AME ONE WHO PIC KED MICHIGAN OV ER YALE, THEY' VE BEE N BEST FRIENDS SINCE GRADE SCHOO L BECAUSE THEY WENT TO GRADE SC HOOL TOGETHER IN A SMALL SCHOOL OF W ASHINGTON. SO, THEY BE CAME VERY CLOSE. BUT IT DIDN'T H APPEN ACCIDENTALL Y. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE AGREED A T THE FRONT-END T HAT WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER . AN D WHEN THE PRESIDE NT IS ASKED BY HIS FRIEND FROM CHICAGO, WHAT IS IT LIKE HAV ING JOE AROUND, HE SAYS IT' S L IKE HAVING AN OLDER BROTHER. LI KE HAVING AN O LDER BROTHER WITH HIM. WHAT W E AGREED ON, WHEN HE FIRST ASKED ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, I SAY THIS BECAUS E IT'S PUBLIC KNOW LEDGE NOW, IS THAT I SAID I DIDN 'T WA NT TO BE VICE PRESID ENT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD HEL P HIM MORE BEING A SENIOR SE NATOR THAT HAD SOME INFLUE NCE IN CONGRESS. A ND I KNOW VICE PRESIDENTS ARE USUALLY STANDBY EQUIPMENT. I ASKED HIM , HE CAME BACK AND SAID TO MEE T WITH MY FAMILY ABOU T IT, A ND HE CAME BACK. HE KN OWS MY FAMILY WELL. TO MY SURPR ISE, M Y DECEASED SON AND MY SON HUNTER STRONGLY AR GUED I SH OULD DO IT, AND THE COUP DE GRA CE WAS DELIVERED BY MY MOTHE R, WHO WAS THEN 92 YEARS OLD. SHE WO ULD N OT MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WITH US, BECAUSE WE WERE IN A F OUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDPA. SH E WAS NOT GOING TO MO VE AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A RO OM FOR HER. THERE IS A LITTLE GA RAGE THAT WE TURNED INTO A NICE APAR TMENT AT THE TOP OF THE DRIV EWAY, AND SHE SAID THAT WAS OK. BUT AFT ER WE HAD THIS MEETIN G ON THE BACK PORCH, HE SAID GET BA CK TO ME IN 48 HOURS, OK, ABOUT W HETH ER I COULD BE VE TTED AND CHECK ME OUT, WITH 10 LAW YERS LOO KING AT ME, AS SOME ONE VERY TACTFU LLY SAID, LIKE A PUBLIC COLONOSCOPY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: SO W HAT HAPPENED WAS, WE WEN T THROUGH THIS MEETIN G FOR ABOUT O NE HOUR, A ND MY MOM , I WON THE GENE PO OL. I HAD A MOM T HAT EVERYONE WISHED COULD BE THEIR MO M. MY MOM HEARD EVERYONE'S CONFESSIONA L ALL THE TIME, LET US OUT, YOU HA D TO BE IN BY 12:00, AND IF MY MOM WAS IN CONFESSION WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS, SH E WOULD GO LIKE THIS , DON'T STOP, KEEP MOVING. SHO ULD I SI T, YOU HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING. SHE SAID JO EY, REMEMBER WHEN I CALLED YOU A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ASKED Y OU TO COME UP TO THE HOUSE, AND ASKED ABOUT BARACK, AND HE SAID HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY A ND BRILLIANT? I SAID, YEA H. SHE SAID, R EMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND T HEY DESEGREGATED THE ADJACEN T NE IGHBORHOOD AND SOLD A HOME, A R EA L ESTATE GUY SOLD A HOME TO A N AFRICAN-AMERICAN COUPLE, AND PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING AT NIGHT, IT WAS IN THE SUMMER, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE, YOU WENT DOWN AND GOT ARRESTE D BY POLICE WERE STANDING ON THE PORC H WITH THE BLACK COUPLE? I S AID, YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT. SHE S AID, R EMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD A COUNT RY CLUB JOB, BUT WANTED TO WORK AT THE CITY POOL AND BE THE ONLY WHITE EMPLOYEE IN THE PROJ ECT S? Y EAH, MOM. SHE SA ID, REMEM BER WHEN YOU HAD THAT GOOD J OB AT A LAW FIRM AND YOU BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER BE CAUSE THE CITY WAS OCCUPIE D? I SAID, YEA H, WHAT IS THE POINT? SHE SAID, L ET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, T HE FIRST AFRICAN-AME RICAN MAN IN HISTORY WHO HAS THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OFFERED YOU TO WORK FOR HIM AND YOU TOL D HIM NO? [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: DAMMIT ALL, MOM. TRUE STORY. [APP LAUSE] MR. BIDEN: BEST DECISION MY MOTHER E VER MADE F OR ME. THE POI NT WAS THIS. W E SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WHO TO PICK , THERE ARE S O MANY QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO BE PRESI DENT. WHO YOU PIC K AS A VICE PRESIDENT, NO MATTER I F YOU ARE 36 YEARS OLD, YOU SH OULD PICK SOMEONE WHO, IF GOD FOR BID SOMETHING HAPPENS, TH EY CAN STEP IN AND BECOME PRESIDENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VER Y QUALIF IED, BUT HERE IS THE COUP DE GRA CE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. WITH B ARACK AND I, WE KNEW WE WERE INT ELLECTUA LLY SIMPATICO ON THE ISSUES. WE DID NOT DISAGREE FU NDAMENTAL LY ON ANY ISSUE, FOR REAL. WE DI SAGREED O N TACTIC, NOT SUBSTAN CE, AND WE WOULD ARGUE LIKE HELL WITH O NE ANOTHER PRIVATELY. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, EVERYBODY KNEW, HE IS PRESIDENT, HE DECIDES. BU T HE WANT ED SOMEBODY WHO HAD A DIFFERING V IEW, WHO WOULD , IN , WHO W OULD C OME IN, IN HIS PHRA SE, ""NOT BE INTIMIDATED WHEN THEY W ALKED IN THE OVER OFFICE."" IT HAS TO B E SOMEONE WHO SHARES, IF I AM ELECTED, MY VALUE SET AND MY PRIORITIES. OTHERWISE IT MAKES IT VERY HARD, BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL. THE D AYS OF PICKING SOMEONE TO BALANCE THE TICKET ARE THE DAYS TH AT ARE BASICALLY GONE BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PRESID ENT IS SO IMMENSE, NO ONE WOMA N O R MAN CAN HANDLE THE JOB. TH EY H AVE TO DELEGATE SI GNIFICANT RESPONSIBIL ITY. NOT A JOKE. THE P RESIDENT DID THAT WITH ME, WH ETHER IT WAS DEALING WITH IRAQ O R WOR KING ON THE RECOVERY AC T, WHICH WAS $900 BILLION. WH EN HE GAVE ME AN ASSIG NMENT, HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORI TY. I COULD HIRE AND FI RE, PICK PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CABINET , DO EXACTLY AS IF I WER E THE PRESIDE NT. FOR REAL. IT TA KES A LOT OF COUR AGE FOR A PRESIDENT , HE HAS TO B E CONFIDEN T OR SHE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN GIVE SI GNIFICANT AUTHORITY A ND NOT HAV E THE PRESS SAY, SO AND SO IS DOING IT FOR HIM. BUT NO ONE EVER QU ESTI ONED WHETHER HE WAS BRILLIANT, THEY NEVER QUEST ION WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY, IF I GET TO BE THE NOMI NEE, WHO IS SOMEBODY SIMPATICO, COMFORTABLE WITH ME, WI LL ARGUE AT ME AND HOLLER AT M E WHEN I DISAGREE, F OR REAL. T HE OTHER THING IS, W E AGREED WE W OULD MEET FOR LU NCH ONCE A WEEK, AND EVERY S INGLE DAY, WHEN WE WERE IN SES SION AND BOTH IN THE COUNTRY, WE MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN T HE MORNING, EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT HAS TO BE S OMEONE, TH AT OLD EX PRESSION, YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING BE TWEEN THE CUP AND THE LID. TH ERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, NO T A JOKE, OF SEVEN WOMEN , OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. NOT A JOKE. WHO A RE CAP ABLE OF BEING PRESI DENT T OMORROW IF THEY STARTED OFF AS VICE PRESIDENT. I HAVE A CO UPLE IN YOUR STATE THAT ARE NOT BAD, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AFRICAN- AMERICANS, MALE AND FEMALE. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE OVERWHELMIN G SUPPORT IN THE AFRICAN-AME RICAN COMMUNITY, BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF A FRICAN-AMERICANS WHO, IN COU LD AN D IT WOULD BE PE OPLE B EIN G CONSIDERED BY ME AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BECOMES THE PRESIDE NT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A GREAT CADRE OF PEOPLE TO P ICK FROM, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF REAL LY GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE. AND IT IS NOT A BAD TRAINING GR OUND, BEING VICE PRESIDENT. SO THAT IS AS HONEST AS I CAN BE WITH YOU. I'M GO ING TO GO TO YES/NO. [LA UGHTER] >> THANK YOU, MR. NEXT PR ESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [AP PLAUSE] >> WE HAVE A C OMMON AND VERY GOOD F RIEND IN GREG. HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF M INE. HE SA YS TO SAY HELLO. THAN K YOU FOR COMING. THO SE CHILDREN UNDER 15, T HEY ARE OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND CHILDRE N. MR. BIDEN: THEY ARE YO URS? OH. >> AND WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR 46TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TODAY, MY WIFE AND MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] >> AND HER NAM E IS JILL. TH ANK YOU, AND TH ANK YOU FOR BRINGING HOPE BACK T O THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE QUESTIO N I HAVE , LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT , [APPLAUSE] >> THE LEAST O F US WHO Y OU HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FO R IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE GREA T HOPE IN OUR HEARTS. SPE AK A MIN UTE ABOUT THE NATIVE AMER ICANS A ND HOW DEEPLY THEY NEED OUR HE LP. MR. B IDEN: BY THE WAY, FIRST OF ALL, MY SYM PATHIES. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY S AYS TO JILL. EVERY BODY K NOWS, I AM KNOWN AS IN WASHINGTON, JILL HUSBAND, AND I AM PR OUD OF IT. YOU HAV E TO BE REALLY PATIENT WITH GRANDP OPS. WE ARE DIFFICULT TO RAISE. F IRS T OF ALL, THEY ARE INDIAN NATI ONS. OT HER THAN AFRICAN-AME RICANS, WHO WERE BROUGHT OVER HERE I N CHAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF SLAVES S HIP S, MANY OF WHOM DIED BEFORE THEY GOT HERE , THAT IS THE ORIGINA L SIN OF THIS COUNTRY, THE STAIN O N OUR SOUL , WHAT WE HAVE DON E OVER THE YEARS TO THEY GOT HE RE , THAT IS THE NATIVE AMERICANS H AS BEEN EQUALLY AS CONSEQUENTI AL. I LEARNED EARLY ON FROM A F ELLOW WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND A WONDERFUL SENATOR WHO SUPPORT ED ME WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND HELPED RAISE ME A LITTLE BI T WAS A SENAT OR FROM HAWAII. AND SENATOR WHEN HE LEFT. THEY WERE G IANT SUPPORTERS OF INDIAN N ATI ONS, AND ANY TIME SOMEON E WOULD SAY, INDIAN S, NA TIVE AMERICANS , NO, JOE, IN DIAN NATIONS. WH AT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM HAS BEEN DE VASTATING OVER THE YE ARS. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOME STA TES WHER E WE ARE, AND TH AT IS MAYBE UP IN YOUR STATE A LIT TLE BIT AND IN MY STATE, IN D ELAWARE, I S THAT THE COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE B EEN MADE HAVE BEEN W ALKED AWAY FROM, A LOT OF THEM. ONE O F THE THIN GS I HAVE DONE IT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, WHEN I WROT E THE VIOLENCE AG AINST WOMEN ACT, WHAT I DID WAS C HANGED THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SAME PR OCEDURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE T O WOMEN IN INDIAN NATI ONS WHO ARE VICTIMIZED A LOT, BY T HE WAY, WHERE IF A MAN WALKED ON A ND ENGAGED IN A FORCED SE X WITH ANOTHER MAN, WHICH HAPPE NS ABOUT 4% OF THE TIME, T HEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRIED IN IN DIAN COURT. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY T O TRY IN THEIR COURTS, ON THEIR LA ND, IF IT IS ON THE LAND OF AN INDIAN NATION. WE HAVE TO FINALLY BEGIN TO MA KE GOOD O N WHAT WE SAID WE BELIEVED , THAT IN FACT IT WAS A CO MMITMEN T MADE, IF WE MOVED YOU AWAY AND DID ALL THESE THING S LIKE JACKSON DID YEARS AGO, THAT WE WOULD BEGIN TO TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I'M NOT TALKING ABO UT REPARATIONS, I AM TALKING ABO UT DEALING WITH WHAT CONTINUES T O BE BASICALLY SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT EXISTS FOR NOT ONLY TH E AFRICAN -AMERICANS, BUT ALSO FO R INDIAN AMERICANS. THANK YOU. YES, M A'AM? >> D O WE HAVE TIME FOR ON E MORE QUESTION? M R. BIDEN: CAN I TAKE A COUPLE MORE ? ASK ME ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, MAN . IT IS THE N UMBER ONE ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] >> [INAUDIBLE] IF WE DO NO T STOP USING FOSSI L FUEL , MR. BIDEN: WE A RE ALL DEAD. >> WE ARE ALL DEA D. ANY OTHER I SSUE IS SE CONDARY TO THAT. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHA NGE? MR. BIDEN: BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TELL HE REA LLY CARES ABOUT CLIMATE CHA NGE, BECAUSE I MENTION I T WHEN I START OFF, AND HE DOES NOT ASK A QUESTION, HE HOLDS UP A SIGN. IT IS THE E XIS TENTIAL THREAT THAT EXISTS. THERE ARE THREE T HINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT I WOULD DO. THE FIR ST THING I WOULD DO IS IMMEDIAT ELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMA TE ACCORD. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: AND BY THE WAY, I HELPED WITH THAT TOGETHER. I AM THE GUY WHO CONVINCED OUR TEAM TH AT CHINA WOULD JOIN BECAUS E I SPENT MORE TIME WITH XI JIN PING THAN ANYONE HAD AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED AT HAVING TO BE PART OF IT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD TAKE THE MOST EG REGIOUS , THE DEAL WHEN W E DID THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, EVE RY NATION THAT SIGNED UP W OULD IN FACT MOVE TO DEAL WIT H CLIMAT E CHANGE AS SCIENCE DIC TATED IT. THEY AL L SET STANDARDS, WE SET STAN DAR DS ACROSS THE BOARD, AND IN THE MEANTIME, WE LEARNED THINGS WERE EVEN MORE DANGER OUS. I WOULD CALL IN THE FIRS T 100 DAYS A MEETING WITH ALL TH E MAJOR P OLLUTERS IN THE WORL D, TO W ASHINGTON, D.C. TO UP THE COMM ITMENTS. THOSE WHO D ID NOT, THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITI ON WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD EXACT ECONO MIC PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO DO THAT. LOOK AT WHAT THE CH INESE ARE DOING NOW. THEIR BELT AND RO AD PROPOSAL. T HEY ARE EXPORTI NG MORE DIRTY COAL AROUND THE WORLD I N THE NAME OF THEIR OWN I NTERESTS, BUT NOT DOING IT IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. TH EY WOULD BE HE LD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT UN DER THE ECONOMIC , RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE REAS ONS IT WORRIES ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE P RESIDENT WALKING AWAY FROM OUR IN TERNATION AL RESPONSIBIL ITIES, YOU KNOW BE CAUSE YOU KNOW TH IS AREA THE , LARGE ST CARBON SINK IN THE WORLD IS TH E AMAZON, IN THE WORLD. I AM ONE OF THE GUYS WHO CAME ALONG WITH THE PR OPOSAL YEARS AGO, DEBT F OR FOREST PRESERVATIO N. IN CASE YOU ARE MY BONA FIDES, YOU CAN CHE CK LATER FACT. I INTRODUCE D THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL AND IT WAS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER AND I PUSHED ON IT. WHEN WE DID THE RECOVERY ACT OF $990 BIL LION, WE PUT $100 BILLION IN BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF PRO DUCING SOLAR AND WIND, S O TH ERE IS NO RATIO NAL E T O BUILD COAL. THE POINT I S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, MORE CARBON FROM THE AI R, THE THING BREAK ING THROUGH AND CAUSING GLO BAL WARMING, IS ABSORBED IN THE AMAZON THAN IS EMITTED BY EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE DRI VEN OF ANY TYPE IN THE UNITED STAT ES OF AMERICA. IT IS BURNING. I HAVE BEEN PUSHING, NOT ALONE, BUT I HAVE BEEN PUSHING ALONG WITH JOHN KERRY, A BIG SUPPORTER A ND FRIEND OF MINE, PUSHING THA T WE SHO ULD BE SAYING T O BRAZIL, YOU HAVE GO T TO FIX IT AND WE WILL HEL P Y OU, PAY YOU TO STOP IT. NO T $2 BILLION. MO RE LIKE $40 BILLION. IF YOU DO NOT, YOU PAY ECONOMIC PRICE OR EV ERY OTHER EXPORT YOU HAVE, NO MATTER W HAT. THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUE NCES. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO , MA YBE WE CAN TALK , TELL ME WHE N I'M GOING TO MU CH. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO, RIGH T O FF THE BAT IMMEDIATELY, IN 2021, JA NUARY, WHEN I SAY JOIN AN D REJOIN THE PARIS ACCOR D, I INTRODUCE D THE PROPOSA L, WE GET TO Z ERO MISSIONS BY 2050. SOME PEOPLE HAVE 2049 AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 2030. IF YO U ARE A S CIENTIST, YOU KNOW IT IS VIRTU ALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THERE I N 20 30. WE ONLY MAK E UP 15% OF THE PROB LEM. YOUR FOREST IS STILL GO ING TO FIND INSECT S AND EVERGREENS THE SUMMER. YOU R WINTER S WILL GET WARMER. YOU WILL SE E POLLUTION AND THE WATER SUPPL Y. THE SHORE TAKING OUT A LAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING. YOUR WINTER S WILL GET WARMER.85% OF THE PROB LEM IS OVER THERE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT R EQUIRES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW T O BRIN G TOGETHER THE WORLD. NOT A JOKE. BE ABLE TO HAV E A FOREIGN-POLICY VISION THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN ARE T RUSTED SO ON DAY ONE, THE NEXT PRESID ENT WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE WORLD STAGE . WHEN HE OR SHE SPEAKS, THE WORLD WILL KNOW WHO THAT PE RSON IS AND KNOW THAT P ERSON THOSE WHO THEY ARE, W HAT THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE. WHAT T HEY ARE LIKE. SO YO U CAN DEMAND CERT AIN STANDARDS ARE KEPT. WE CA N DO I T BUT WE HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE BUSINESS. W E ARE THE LEADER NOT ONLY OF THE FREE WORLD, THE LEADER OF THE WORLD. IN THIS EFF ORT. WHEN WE SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CL IMATE CHANGE, AND WE ALRE ADY DEFORESTED OUR LAND OV ER THE LAST 300 YEARS AND H AVE DONE WELL BY IT, AND THE RES T OF THE WORLD SAYS YOU KEEP IT UP, COME ON. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE HARD. REALL Y HARD. THE T HIRD THING WE HA VE TO DO IS SET DOWN GUIDE RAILS NOW. BETWEE N THE YEARS 2021 AND 2030, IT IS IRREVERSIBLE THE PATH WE HAVE SET OURSELVES ON. GETTING RID OF SUBSIDIE S FOR FOSSIL FUEL . NUMBER TWO, HOLDING THEM RELIAB LE FOR WHAT TH EY HAVE DONE, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSER VED NEIGHBORHOO DS. AND WHEN TH EY DO NOT, PUT THEM IN JAI L. I AM NOT JOKI NG ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: RIGH T NOW, WE HAD A PROGRAM WHE RE WE GIVE A TAX CREDIT FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING . FOR EXAMPLE , TH IS BUILDI NG , THIS CITY-OWNED BUILDING I ASSUME? THE CITY WO ULD BE ABLE TO BORROW MONE Y AND GET DIRECTED TO , DIREC T AID TO REPLACE ALL THE WINDOWS. AN D THE DOORS AND INSULAT ION SO YOU ARE NOT EMITTING FROM THE BUILDIN G HEAT OR AIR CONDITI ONING, COSTING MUCH MORE M ONEY. IF W E TOOK EVERY PUBLIC AND FEDERAL BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY , WH ICH THE PLAN ST ARTED OFF DOING BEFOR E THEY TANKED IT, WE COU LD REDUCE THIS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL TO BE CONSUMED EV ERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER ENERGY CONS UMING IT. WE SHOULD TERM FARMER , TURN FARMERS INTO THE NET ZER O EMITTERS IN THE WORLD. SIGN IFICANT CONSERVATIO N PROPERTY, HAVING THEM PLANT DEEPE R ROOTS TO ABSORB T HE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. BIOFUE LS IS THE NEAR-TE RM TRANSITION. WE CAN DO SO MUCH. THE F IRST THING I WOULD DO IS REESTABL ISH MILE STANDA RDS. EIGHT BILLION GAL LON BARRELS OF OIL. AUTO C OMPANIES AGREED TO I T. I CALL FOR EVERY N EW INFRAST RUCT URE HAS TO BE GREEN. SO W E DO NOT B UILD TO WHAT IT IS BEFORE, BUT WHAT IT IS NOW. I MEAN THIS SINCER ELY. I HAVE GONE ON TOO MUCH . I WILL STOP WITH THIS. MAKE SURE T HAT, I WANT TO INSTALL 550 ,000 CHARGING STATIONS ON ALL OF OUR HIGHWAYS. W E SHOULD O WN THE EV MARKET OF ELECTRON IC VEHICLES. E XPERTS POI NT OUT ON MY PLAN THAT WE CAN CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. S ERIO US JOB S, NOT $15 AN HOUR. $45 A N HOUR BEF ORE YOU START TALKI NG ABO UT BENEFITS. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD HAS E VER TA KEN A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY . THIS OPPORT UNITY IS GIGANTIC. T HE LAST TH ING I WILL SAY , I WI LL TALK AND GIVE YOU THE WHO LE PLAN IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. WHAT WE SHOULD B E DOING IS DE ALING WITH THIS IN A WAY THAT IT IS. IT IS AND EXI STE NTIAL THREAT, NOT A JOKE. IF WE DO NOT M AKE CHANGE , WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE. THE PLANET IS I N TROUBLE. IT IS REAL. HUNDREDS OF SPECIES ARE GONE AND WILL NO T CO ME BACK. DELAW ARE IS THREE FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. NOT A JOKE. IN 15 YEARS, A LOT OF THEM WILL B E GONE. THE L AST THING I WILL SAY, WHEN P RESIDENT OBAMA AND I GOT ELECT ED , TH E FIRST WEEK OR 10 DAYS, WE WE RE INVITE D TO THE PENTAGON TO THE MOST SECRETIVE PLACE IN TH E PENTAGO N, BELOW GROUND, COM PLETELY SECURE, AND THE JOINT CHIEF S WANTED TO TELL US WHAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR SECURIT Y WAS. YOU KNOW WH AT THEY SAID? CLIMATE CHA NGE. THE MILITAR Y, CLIMATE CHANGE. THE Y PUT TH E MAPS ON THE WALL. I F WE DO NO THING AND THE SEA LEVEL R ISES TWO F EET, Y OU WILL HAVE MILLIO NS OF PEOPLE MIGRATING F ROM ALL THE ISLANDS IN THE SOUT H PACIF IC, ACROSS THE WORLD. YOU SAW WHA T HAPPEN ED IN DARFUR. MUS LIMS, AF RICAN-AMERICAN AND ARAB MU SLIM S GOING TO WAR WITH EA CH OTHER. KILLING PEO PLE. WHY? FOR LA ND, F IGHTING OVER WHAT I S LEFT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT, I LIKE IT W ARMER IN NEW HATC HER IN THE WINTER , IT IS NOT LIKE TH AT AT ALL. FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. TH INK WHAT HAPPENED WI TH AFGHAN ISTAN AND IRAQ AND LIBYA. WITH THE MI GRATION OF MORE PEOPLE IN E UROPE T HAN ANY OTHER TIME INCLUDING W ORLD WAR II. WHAT DI D IT COST? IT CH ANGES POLITICAL ATTITUDES. IT IS THE R EASON WE HAVE BRAGS IT , WE HAVE BRE XIT , TH IS NEW NA TIVISM GO ING ON IN HUNGRY, POL AND, AROUND THE WORLD. YOU ARE COMING HERE, YOU'RE NOT COMING HERE. REMEM BER ALL OF THOSE PHOTO GRAPHS OF AFGHANIS TRYING TO G ET INTO HUNGARY? LO OK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEMO CRA TIC REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. TH E MOST POWERFUL AND MOST EN LIGHTENED LEADER IN T HE WORLD AT TH E TIME, ANGELA MERKEL. HER PARTY GOT CLOBBERED. IT IS FEAR. A LOT IS AT STAKE. I WI LL GIVE YOU A COPY OF THE WHOLE P LAN, AND THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: I KN OW YOU HAVE TO GO AND I 'M SUPPOSED TO GO. IF Y OU ASK ME AN EASY QUESTION, IF YOU GIVE ME SOM ETHING, I WILL TRY AND DO IT I N 25 WORDS OR LESS. YOU, MA'AM, GIVE HER TH E MIC. >> WHA T IS YOUR PLA N FOR ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE? [ APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: THAT IS REALLY I MPORTANT. WHEN I SAID THE SOUL OF THE NATION, THI NK ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT OUR SOUL WH EN YOU SEND YOUR C HILD OR GR ANDCHILD OFF IN FIRST OR SECOND O R THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE, AND THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. BUIL DING NE W SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN HIDE BE HIND THEM IN CAS E A SHOOTER S HOWS UP. THE GENERAT ION THAT IS MOS T UNEASY AND HAS THE GRE ATEST AN XIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA IS THE Z GENERATION, AGES 7-17. KNOW WHAT T HE GREATEST FEAR IS? GETTING SHO T IN SCHOOL. TAL K ABOUT A SICK SOUL. I AM THE ON LY GUY WHO HAS EVER BEATEN THE NRA NATIONALLY. I HAVE BEAT EN THEM TWICE. I GO T THE B RADY BILL PASSED. BAC KGROUND CHECKS. I AM THE GU Y WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEA PONS BAN PASSED. I C OULD ONLY GET IT FOR 10 YEARS AN D IT HAD TO BE RENEWED. BE CAUSE OF SOME HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA, A GUY NAMED BUSH LET IT EXPI RE. YOUR STATE AND MINE, A LOT OF HUNTERS, THAT IS FINE. BU T A NYBODY WHO NEEDS A MAGAZINE WI TH 100 RO UNDS IN IT, YOU SHOULD NOT BE HUNTING. YO U ARE A DANGER TO YOURSELF . N OT A JOKE. ANYBO DY THAT NEEDS AN AR-15, T HERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DE ER WEARING A KEVLAR VEST. MY DE CEASED SON AND MY SON WERE BIRD H UNTERS. TH ERE IS BIG BIRD HUNTIN G IN THE DELAWARE PENINSULA. I HAVE A 12 GAUGE SHOTGUN. THEY ARE LO CKED UP. YOU LOCK TH EM UP. WE'RE T HE ONLY COUNTRY, TH E ONLY INDUST RY IN THE NATION NOT ABLE TO BE SUED, THE GUN MANUFACTURE RS. HOW WOULD T HAT HAVE BEEN THE CASE WH EN I WAS PUSHING TO GO AFTER THE PHARMACEUTI CAL COMPANIES F OR OPIOIDS? BE CAUSE WE WERE ABL E TO SUE THEM FOR TH E DAMAGE THEY WERE D OING, WE W ERE ABLE TO CHA NGE THE WHOLE THING AND IT IS STILL CHANGING. Y OU CAN'T DO TH AT WITH GUN MANUFACTURE RS. ONE OF MY O BJECTIVES, I WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. THERE ARE EVEN DE MOCRATS VOTED TO GI VE EXEMPTIONS TO GUN MANUFACTURE RS. BUT I WILL WORK LIKE HELL TO TRY TO E LIM INATE THAT EXEMPT ION. LASTLY, WE TALK ABO UT TECHNOLOGY. THE FACT IS WE HAVE THE , TECHN OLOGY NOW. THAT T HE ON LY PERSON WHO CAN PULL TH E TRIGGER ON ANY WEAPON WOULD BE ON E WHOSE BIOMETRIC M ARKER MATC HED WHAT THE GUN WAS SOLD TO . IT IS JAMES BOND STUFF BUT IT IS R EAL AND IT EXISTS. OUT IN SILI CON VALLEY, AND MET WITH THIS G ROUP OF EXPERTS ON HOW THEY CO ULD DO THAT. IT CA ME ALO NG AND THEY CAME UP WITH SEVERA L PISTOLS THAT DO THAT. THEY STARTED TO SELL THEM AND ADVERTI SED THAT WAY. YOU'RE NOT VIOLATING ANYONE'S SE COND AMENDMENT RIGHT. IF I 'M ABLE TO BUY THE GUN ON A BACKGR OUND CHECK, I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO FIRE THE GUN. BE CAUS E LOOK WHAT HAPPENED UP IN CONNE CTICUT . THE MOM HAD THE GUN AND THE KID PICKED IT UP. HE WOUL D NOT HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUN D CHECK. THERE IS NO VIOLATION O F THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO SAY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE A GUN. CERTAIN GUN S, NOT EVERY GUN. WHAT H APPENS? THEY PUT TH EM IN STORES AND THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURE RS SAID IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THEM, WE WILL BOYCOTT YOUR STORES AND PUT YOU OUT OF BUSI NESS. S O THEY'RE NOT ON THE SHEL VES AT ALL NOW. WHAT I S GOING ON? THIS IS WRONG. THER E ARE SO MANY AVENUES WE CAN GO WITH OUT VIOLATING ANYONE'S BA SIC RIGHT. TO O WN A GUN. FOR TH OSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A GROUP WHO SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD O F PATRIOTS, YOU NEED A FIGHTER JET IF YOU WILL PROTEC T YOURSELF AGAINST THE GOVERNM ENT. YOU NEED SOMETHING A LOT MORE IF THAT IS THE RATIONA LE. EXTREME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT THE REASON WHY THE SECOND AMEN DMENT E XISTS IS SO WE CAN DEFE ND OURSELVES AGAINST THE GOVERNM ENT. YOU NEED A COUPLE OF FLAMETHROWE RS. ALL KIDDING ASI DE. THESE PEOPLE TELL ME YOU CANNOT LIMI T THE TYPE OF WEA PONS. CA N ANYONE HERE, LIKE THEY DID WITH A FORMER DUPONT GUY, WELL, YOU W ANT TO TAKE ON THE GOVERNMENT, YOU BETTER GET A PERSONNEL CARRIER OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL NOT DO IT WITH AR-15. WE H AVE BEEN ABLE T O SAY YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE G UN AND THAT IS THE LAW. YOU CA NNOT OWN A MACHI NE GUN OR BAZOOKA. I KNOW IT SOUNDS S ILLY, BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CA NNOT SAY THERE ARE C ERTAIN TYPES OF WE APONS YOU CANNOT OWN IS NOT AT ALL INCONSI STENT WITH THE SE COND AMEN DMENT. FROM THE BEGINNI NG, FROM THE BEGINNI NG, EVERY SINGL E AMEN DMENT OF THE CONS TITUTION HAS AN EXCE PTION. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IF ANYONE S TOOD UP AND YELLED FIRE, WE CO ULD PUT YOU IN JAIL WITH PEOPLE RUNNING OUT OF FEAR OF PEOPLE G ETTING HURT AND THERE IS NO FIRE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH T O YELL FIRE. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM IF YOU ARE A C ONVICTED FELON OR TERRORIS T T O GO BUY A WEAPON. PER IOD. ONE REASONS WHY , AND THIS IS THE BEST WA Y TO CONCLUDE IT, I TALK ABOUT THE V IOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I WROT E THAT, I DID IT MYSELF. IT TOOK FOUR YEARS TO GET IT PASSED. IT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON C HANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. EVERY S EVERAL YEARS IT HAS TO BE REAUT HORIZED. THE HOUSE P ASSED OVERWHELMIN GLY, IT IS SITTI NG IN THE SENATE. WHY ? IT CUT S OUT WHAT THEY CALL THE BOYFRIE ND EXCEPTION. THE BIGGEST FIGHT I HAD TO GE T IT REAU THORIZED THE SECOND TIME WAS TH AT IF YOU WERE THE SUBJECT OF ABUSE BY A HUSBAND OR SOMEONE YOU LIVE WITH, AND THAT PERSON WAS CONVICTED, THEY COULD NOT O WN A G UN, A WEAPON. WHA T HAPPENED WAS THEY WO RKED OUT AN EXEMPTION, THE BOYFRIE ND EXEMPTION. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHILD WITH A PERS ON BEATING YOU UP, OR YOU DO NOT LIVE WITH HIM, THAT P ERSON CAN OWN A WEAPON. T HE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO A RE KIL LED BY THEIR ABUSERS ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. KNOW W HAT THE GREATEST LO SS OF LIFE IS WITH A GUN? SUIC IDE. OV ER 20% OF ALL PEOP LE WHO DIE BECAUSE OF A BULLET ARE PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AN D WE SAY WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE POLICE TO KNOW WHETHE R OR NOT SOMEONE HAS A SERIO US MENTAL ILLN ESS THAT MAYBE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A WEAPON? IT IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE RIGH T OF PRIVACY, BUT THAT IS WHY WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ALONG THE V IOLENCE AG AINST WOMEN ACT TO BE P ASSED AND REAUTHORIZED AND WE WILL LOSE ENORMOUS PR OTECTIONS , IT HAS CUT DOWN BY WELL OVE R 60% OVER THE AGE OF 30. THE REP ORTS ARE WAY UP. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD. TH E NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURE RS ARE MUCH TOO POWERFUL AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT A RATIONAL RE ADING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR 22 YEARS. I PR OMISE YOU. THEY D ON'T. THANK YOU FOR BEING H ERE. I APPRECIATE IT. [APPLAU SE] [INDISCERNIBLE] MR. BIDEN: THAN K YOU, MAN.

W HAT IS THE STATE OF TH E RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIG TECH AND THE GOVERNMENT TODAY? PROF ESSOR O'MARA: IT IS PRETT Y ROCKY. IT I S REALLY INTERESTING . IT IS SUCH A CONT RAST. H ERE WE ARE TALKING IN 2019. FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I STARTED WOR K ON THIS BOOK, THE MOOD WAS SO DIFFERENT. THERE WAS A LOT O F TECH OPTIMISM IN SILICON VALLEY AND IT WAS SHARED BY A LOT OF LEADERS IN WASHINGTON. ON BOTH SID ES OF THE AISLE. THE IDEA THAT T HESE PRIVATE COMPANIES HAD DONE TH IS EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, THAT THERE , TH EIR PRODU CTS COULD BE BENEFICIAL. THINK ABOUT HOW BARACK OBAM A'S CAMPAIGN USED FACEBOOK TO MARSHALL SU PPORT. IT WAS SEEN AS THE FUTURE OF CAMPAIGN ING AND ALSO GOVERNING. NOW THE MOOD IS DIFFERENT. 2016 IS AND WAS A TURNING POINT, IN THE RECOGNITION OF HOW SOC IAL MEDIA PLATFORMS H AVE FUNCTIONED AS DISRUPTORS TO THE ELEC TORAL PROCESS. TH AT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF A VERY R EAL REALITY, THAT OUTSIDE ACT ORS HAD BEEN USING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATF ORMS TO MESS WITH THE EL ECTIO N, THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD A CONSEQUENTIAL EFFECT ON O UTCOMES. A ND THE VERY RE AL FEELING THAT COULD CONTINUE GOING FORWARD. TH AT, COMBI NED WITH THE PERMEATION OF THESE TE CHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS IN OUR LIVE S. THINK ABOUT THE PRODUCT S OF THE BIGGEST FIVE AMERICAN TE CHNOLOGY COMPANIES. MICROSOFT, APPLE, GOOGLE, AMAZON, FACEBOOK. I F YOU SAY, I WILL NOT BE ON ANY OF THES E THINGS, IT IS REALLY HARD TO GO THROUGH YOUR LIFE FROM D AWN TO DUSK IN MODERN AMERICA WIT HOUT IT SOME WAY HAVING BEING AFFEC TED BY A PRODUCT M ADE BY ONE OF THOSE CO MPANIES. THIS IS DRIVING THE CONVERS ATION IN WASHINGTON. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE SE COMPANIES IN SHAPING THE POLITIC AL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF MODERN A MERICA? SUSAN: WHAT ARE THE CHA RACTERISTICS OF THESE CO MPANIES? WAS IT, HUBRIS? NAI VETE? IN ATTENTION TO CERTAIN DETAILS? WHAT DO YOU THIN K ARE THE FACTORS? PROFESSOR O'MARA: IT IS HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY ITSE LF. THESE COMPANIES ARE THE PRODUCT OF A BUSINESS CULTURE, A BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM. I CALL IT A GALAPA GOS, A VERY DISTIN CTIVE COMMUNITY THAT GREW FOR A LONG TIME IN RELATIVE ISOLATION F ROM WASHINGTON. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THEM FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU HAVE HI GH TECH VENTURE CAPITALISTS . THEY ARE FUNDERS, ADVISORS, M ENTORS. CARRYING ON THIS DIS TINCTIVE CULTURE FROM ONE GE NERATION TO THE NEXT. IT IS A CULTURE FOCUSED ON GROWTH, MAK ING TECHNOLOGY BETTER, FASTER. IT IS , FACEBOOK HAD POSTERS IN THEIR HEADQUARTERS THAT SAID M OVE FASTER, BREAK THINGS. IT WAS THIS NOTION , T HIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS FA CEBOOK, Y OU CAN LOO K AT INTEL OR SEATTLE-BAS ED COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT. YOU NEEDED TO DOMINATE YOUR MARKET QUICKLY OTHERWISE YOUR COMPET ITORS WOULD EAT YOU ALIVE. YOU HAD TO MOVE VERY FAST. IF SO METHIN G GOT BROKEN ALONG THE WAY THA T WAS THE COST OF , DOING BUSIN ESS. T HAT IS PAR T OF HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE. THE SE LEADERS DID NOT SET UP TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE THIS DISRUPTIVE FORCE IN THIS WAY. I LIKE N IT TO A RUNAWAY TRAIN, THIS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY WAS SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY SET OU T TO DO. IT HAD ALL OF THESE UN INTENDED CONSEQUENCE S. SUSAN: YOURS IS THE STORY O F 75 YEARS OF EVOLUTION. I WANT TO GO INTO THESE STORI ES BEC AUSE THEY ALL HAVE CHARAC TERS. THERE ARE THEMES AND YOU REF EREN CED THE GOVERNM ENT INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THIS. AL SO, LIGHT REGUL ATION, WHICH MAY BE CHANGING. W E CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. HIGH TECH H AS BEEN AND MAYBE CONTINUES T O BE THE , TO BE COMPRISED O F MOSTLY WHITE MALES. ONE CHARACT ER IN YOUR BOOK IS SOMEONE WHO WORKS THEIR WAY UP. HER NAM E IS ANN HARDY. PROF ESSOR O 'MARA: ANN HARDY IS ONE OF T HOSE HIDDEN FIGURES OF SILICON VALLEY. IN 1956 SHE WALKS INTO IBM HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK CI TY A FEW YEARS OUT OF COLLEGE. SH E HEARD THERE ARE PROGRAMMING JOBS TO BE HAD. SHE KN OWS NOTHING ABOUT A FRI END TOLD HER ABOUT THIS JOB. THEY SAID THEY ARE HIRING PEOPLE AND IT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE JOB. SHE GETS THE JOB AS AN E NTRY-LEVEL PROGRAMMER. SHE BECOMES A MANAGER. SHE IS MANAGING A TEAM FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE . SHE IS COMBATING SEXISM EVER Y SINGLE RUN UP THE LETTER. , RUNG OF THE LADDER. SHE FINDS OUT THAT EVERY MAN I S MAKING MORE MONEY THAN HER. SHE DE MANDS A RAISE AND GETS A RAISE. AND TO RELE T THE SUM OF THE PEOPLE SHE IS SUPE RVISING ARE STILL MAKING MORE THAN SHE IS, SO SHE LEFT. S HE ENDS UP IN CALIFORNIA BY THE PART OF THE 1960'S AND SHE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT THE T ECHNOLOGY. SHE IS REAL LY INTERESTED IN PROGRAMM ING AND USING COMPUTERS. SHE ENDS UP AT A SMALL START UP IN PALO ALTO, IN THIS NEW BUSINESS CALLED TIME SHARING. THE INTERNE T BEFORE THE INTERNE T, IT IS NETWORKED C OMPUTERS. THIS IS A T IME WHEN COMPUTERS WERE EITHER GIANT MAINF RAMES OR MINICOMPUTERS. BUT THERE W AS NOTHING MANY ABOUT A MIN ICOMPUTER, IT WAS REFRIGE RATOR SIZED. THEY WERE V ERY EXPENS ES AND USUALLY HOU SED IN CORPORATE OFFICES OR GOVERNMENT LABS. YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE IN A SM ALL OFFICE OR I N YOUR HOME. TIME-SHARING WAS A WAY F OR PEOPLE TO REMOTELY CO NNECT THROUGH TELEPHONE CABLE AND C ONNECT TO A COMPUTER POWER. SO A NN HARD Y BUILT THIS OPERAT ING S YSTEM FOR THIS CO MPANY TO BUILD THIS TIMESH ARING NETWORK. WHEN SHE WA S HIRED, SHE WAS HIRED ACCIDENTALL Y. SHE WALKS I N AND SAYS, I CAN DO THIS. LATER HER B OSS, THE C EO THE COMPANY SAID IF I HAD KN OWN HOW , CENTRAL THIS OPERAT ING SYSTEM WAS TO OUR BUSINESS, I NEVER WOULD HAVE HIRED A WOMAN TO DO IT. THE IDE A YO U WOULD BE A TECHNICAL W OMAN AND AN EXECUTIVE, SOMEONE WITH AUTHORITY W AS SO ALIEN. IT W AS THE 1960'S. THE RE WERE VERY FEW WOMEN A ND T HIS WA S A DIFFERENT TIME IN CORPORATE AMERICA. WH AT HAPPEN S IN TECH AND BUT PARTICU LARLY IN THE VALLEY , N ETWORKS AR E WHERE PEOPLE CHOO SE TO WORK WITH THE SAME PEOPLE FOR FROM ON E COVERAGE OF , , ON E COMPANY TO ANOTHER. THEY USE TH EIR NETWO RK TO HIRE AND CHOOSE WHO THEY ARE GOING T O INVEST IN. THE VERY OV ERWHELMINGLY MALE NETWOR K OF THE 1960'S KIND OF GETS TRA PPED IN THE AMBER. IT GETS HAR DER FOR NEW VOICES TO BREAK IN. T HE OTH ER THING A CHALLENGE FOR A CHALL ENGE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ANN , HARDY BESIDES THE EVERYDAY SE XISM OF CORPORATE R ETREATS , WORK, PEOPL E WOULD SAY, YOU CA NNOT COME BECAUS E IF THE WOMEN COME, THEN WE HAV E TO INVITE OUR WIVES, THEN WE CAN 'T HAVE DALLIA NCES ON THE SIDE AT THI S CORPORATE RETREAT. AS IDE FROM THAT, THE WORK HABITS OF TECHNOLO GY WORK HARD, PLAY , HARD CONTINUES TODAY. WORK ING IN TECH IS A FULL I MMERSION ACTIVITY. Y OU'RE SUPP OSED TO BE ALL I N. PART OF WHAT MAKES SILIC ON VALLEY GO WAS THE FACT THAT THESE MALE EXECUT IVES AND MALE ENGINE ERS C OULD GO COMPLETELY HEADS DOWN, BUILDING THEIR SEMICONDUCT ORS AND COMPUTERS AND WORKING ON THEIR SOFTWARE AND THEY HAD WIVES A T HOME TAKING CARE OF THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THOSE WOMEN ARE REALLY IMPORTANT P ART OF SILKEN VALLEYS STO RY TOO. SUSAN: AS WE GO TH ROUGH THIS WE HEA R THE WORD SI LICON VALLEY AND ALSO ANOTHER WOR D, CODING. WHERE DID T HOSE WORDS COME FROM? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: THE EARLY D AYS OF DIGITAL COMPUTING. THE FIRST DIGITAL COMPUTERS, THE ART AND THE SCIENCE OF COMPUTIN G WAS CONSIDERED TO REST IN HAR DWARE , I N THE MACHINE ITSELF. THE ORIGINS OF THE FIRST ALL-D IGITAL COMPUTER CO MES OUT IN WORLD WAR II. IT IS A N ARMY FUNDED PROJECT. BA SED AT THE UNIVERS ITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS CALLE D THE ANY ACT. , ENIAC. IT I S LATER COMMERCIALIZED AS THE UNIV AC. IN THE EARL Y DAYS OF COMPUTING U NIVAC WAS A BRAND , LIKE KLEENE X OR GOOGLE. THERE IS A GREAT POLITICAL S TORY INVOL VING A UNIVAC. T HE FIRST APPEA RANCE ON TELEVISION WAS IN THE 1952 ELECTION EVE OF THE ELECTION. W ALTER CRON KITE, NEWLY HIRED ANCHOR, IS MANAGING THE ELECTION NIGHT COVER AGE. T HEY HAVE A UNIT OF OUR , A UNIVAC CO MPUTER THAT IS SUPPOSED AF FECT THE OUTCOME. THIS IS EIS ENHOW ER VERSUS STEVENSON. THE UNIVAC PREDICTS CORRECTLY A N OVERWHELMING VICTORY FOR EISENHO WER. IT WAS SO DECISIVE IN ITS PROD UCTION THAT ALL OF THE PROG RAMMERS WERE LIKE I THINK THE Y GOT IT WRONG. CODI NG, IT IS A TIME WHEN THE HA RDWARE IS CONSIDERED TO BE SO IM PORTANT. THE SOFTWARE IS LIKE BEING A TELEPHONE OPERATOR. T O PROGRAM A COMPUTER YOU'RE , JU ST PLUGGING IN DIFFERENT W IRES IN DIFFERENT PLACES. IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN ART OR S CIENCE, JUST VERY ROUTIN E. TH AT CODING SOMETHING W AS LIKE DATA ENTRY. SO A CODER WAS KIND OF A DRONE. UNSURPRISIN GLY THIS WAS SE EN AS WOMEN'S WORK. SECRE TARIES, TELEPHONE O PERATORS, IT IS KIND OF BASIC, A WOMAN CAN D O IT. TURNS O UT IS THAT PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPLICATED . IF, FOR SOM E REASON, THERE IS SOME MIS FIRE IN THE PROGRAM, THERE IS A BUG IN TH E PROGRAM, YOU HAVE TO DO A WOR KAROUND. IT IS A VERY C REATIVE PROCESS. WHAT COMPUT ER SPECIALISTS AND TECHNOL OGISTS REALIZE IS PROGRAMMING THE SOFTWARE IS REALLY W HERE IT IS AT. AS THAT BECOMES MORE AND SO PROFESSI ONALIZED, THE , DISCIPLINE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IS CREATED. BY THE LATE YOU HAVE WOMEN 1960'S, NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STAT ES BUT OTHER S CHOLARS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WHO HAVE WRITTE N ABO UT HOW WOMEN ARE PUSHED OUT OF PROG RAMMING . BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A MO RE HIGH PRESTIGE ACTIVITY. T HE CODERS SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME MEN. SUSAN: THE NAME CO DE ITSELF CAME FROM , IS IT A PRO DUCT? PR OFESSOR O'MARA: YE S, THERE IS SOFTWARE CODE. THE I DEA THAT A CODE , IT IS COMING O UT OF WORL D WAR II , CODE CRACKI NG. T HERE IS TH E ROUTINIZATION OF IT. IT IS S OMET HING WHERE THERE IS A PATTERN. SU SAN: LIK E MORSE CODE. PROFESSOR O 'MARA: IT IS NOT A CREAT IVE PROCESS. SU SAN: CODI NG IS. IT IS S OMETHIN G WHERE THE BEST CODERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS THINKING AB OUT , THINKING IN RATHER C OMPLEX WAYS. PROFE SSOR O 'MARA: PARTICULARL Y NOW PROGRAMMING IS MUCH MORE , COMPLEX. BU T EVEN THEN PROGRA MMING IS , EVEN TOUGHE R WHEN YOU HAD LESS MEMORY AND YOU HAD TO BE BRUTALLY EFFICIENT I N GETTING THE COMMANDS TO BE AS SH ORT AS POSSIBLE , TO USE AS LITTLE MEMO RY AS POSSIBLE. NOW WE HAVE INCRED IBLY POWERFUL MACHINES WHERE YOU H AVE A LOT MORE LATITUDE. SUSAN: HOW DID SILICON VALLEY GET ITS NAM E? PROFESSOR O'MARA: GREAT STORY . IT W AS NOT CALLED THAT UNTIL 1971. BEFOR E THAT IT WAS SANTA CLARA , VAL LEY. A F RUIT GRO WING VALLEY IN CALIFORN IA. IT GETS ITS NAME , WHAT IS HAPPENIN G IN 1971 IS THE MAJO R INDUS TRY THERE IS SILICON SEMICONDUCT ORS. AT THE TIME THE MAIN CUSTOMERS , FOR THE SEM ICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, WERE NOT PE OPLE LIKE YOU AN D ME, THEY WERE OTHER COMPANIES. THEY WERE C OMPUTER MAKERS. THE BIG COMPUTE R MAKERS LIKE IBM AND HONEYWELL WERE MOSTLY BASED ELSEWHERE. SO, THE SAL ES GUYS FOR THESE THE COMPUTER COMPANIES W OULD COME OUT AND THEY STARTE D COLLOQUIALLY REFERRING TO THE VALL EY AS SILICON VALLEY. BEC AUSE THAT WAS THE MAIN ACTION. THE RE IS A REPORTER FOR A TRADE PAPER. THIS IS BASED IN PALO ALTO. ELECT RONICS NEWS. A GUY NAMED DON HOFFLER. HE WRITES ABOUT THE SEMICON DUCTOR INDUSTRY IN SILICON VALLEY. HE GETS WIND THAT SILICO N VALLEY IS THE COLLOQUIAL NAME AND HE HE THINK S THAT IS A GOOD T HING TO TIE IT. SO HE H EADL INE S THE STORY, SILI CON VAL LEY USA. THAT N AME STUCK. ALTH OUGH IT WAS SOME THING THAT WAS BANDIED ABOUT IN TH E VALLEY FOR A WHILE WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. I S NOT TO T HE LATE WHEN IT 1970'S S TARTS BECOMING , STARTS DISS EMINATING OUT. I FOUND MY RE FERENCES IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND NEW YORK TIMES. AND FORTUNE MAGAZINE ST ART , TALKING ABOUT THE S ANTA CLARA VALLEY AND THEN OCCASIONALL Y THEY WILL SAY SILICON VAL LEY. AND QUOTATI ON MARKS. THE POST IS REF ERRING TO SILICON VAL LEY IN QUOTATION MARKS UNTIL 1979. THEN IT BECOMES A MORE FAMILIAR LE XICON. IT WAS AN OUT-OF-THE- WAY PLACE, SEEN AS OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE MAIN ACTION FOR SO LONG. SUSAN : WERE GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME TO TELL THE STORY A S YOU DO IN Y OUR BOOK. BEFORE THAT I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT Y OU. HOW DID YOU GET INTERESTED IN THIS? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: I WAS IN GR ADUATE SCHOOL, I KNEW I WA NTED TO W RITE , I WORKED IN POLITICS BE FORE I WENT TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. I C AME TO GRADUATE SC HOOL TO STUDY POLITICAL HISTORY AND I WAS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE EISENHOWER YEARS AND THE DOM ESTIC IMPACT OF THE COLD WAR. F UNNIL Y ENOUGH, I W AS BECOMING A POLITICAL JUNKIE. I W AS INTERESTED IN WHAT THE EISENHOWER WHITE HOUSE WAS DOING AND W HAT LAWMAKERS I N CONGRESS WE RE DOING IN THE 1950'S. AND THEN, O F COURSE, ONE OF THE GREA TEST DOMESTIC IMPACTS OF THE COLD WAR WAS WHAT THE MI LITAR Y IN DUSTRIAL COMP LEX DID TO SEED THE ELECTRO NICS INDUSTRY, THE COMPUTER IN DUSTRY. I REALIZED THAT THIS I S THE THEN, II REALIZED THAT THIS I S THE STORY. THIS IS THE STOR Y OF HOW THIS WHOLE NEW ECONOMY WAS BUILT. I WA S ALWAYS REALLY INTERESTED EVER SINCE I WAS WORKING IN WASHINGT ON, WITH HOW BUSINES S AN D GOVERNMENT INTERACT WI TH ONE ANOTHER. THEY HAVE A N ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHI P BUT THEY ALSO H AVE A COLLABORA TIVE RELATIONSHI P. THE REAL STORY IN AMERICAN HI STORY IS ONE OF PUBLIC-P ART , PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN MANY WAYS, THAT ARE SOMETIMES UNSEEN. I T HINK THIS STORY IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO GET INTO THAT. TO UN DERSTAND HOW GOVERNM ENT CAN SUPPORT BUSINESS AN D VICE VERSA. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THE COLD WAR, I F YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST OF BIG GOVE RNMENT PROGRAMS, THE SPACE R ACE, YOU H AVE WHAT EISENH OWER LABELS THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. TH AT BECOME S THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS EN TREPRENEURIAL FLYWHEEL OF INCREDIB LE CREATION AND INNOVAT ION AND PRIVATE WEALTH CREA TION. I T IS AN INDUSTRY THAT CONSIDERS I TSELF AN INDUSTRY THAT BUILT ITSELF ON ITS OWN. GOVERN MENT HAS BECOME ALMOST INVI SIBLE TO MANY OF THE PEOP LE WHO ARE IN SILICON VALLEY. WHO ARE THE CRE ATORS OF THESE COMPANIES A ND THESE TECHNOLOGIES. THE CREATOR S THINK THERE IS NOT A ROLE BUT THERE IS. THAT IS PART OF THE MAGIC. IT IS A GOVERNMENT OUT OF SIGH T. SUSA N: WHAT DID YOU DO IN W ASHINGTON? PROFESSOR O'MARA: LIK E A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME TO WASHINGTON, I CAME FOR A PRESI DENTIAL I WORKED ON CAMPAIGN . I WORKED ON THE 1992 PRESIDENTIA L RUN OF THE CLINTON. I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE IN ARKANSAS. L IKE ANY GOOD HI STORY MAJOR, I DID NOT HAVE A JOB. [LAUGH TER] HISTORY MAJ ORS GET LOTS OF JOBS. BUT I CAME HOME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP. I FIGURED I WOULD VOLUNTEER O N THE CAMPAIGN. THAT POSITI ON TURNED INTO AN ENTRY-LEVEL JOB. I STAR TED I N THE CORRESPONDENCE OFFICE AS M ANY GRE AT BLUE GHOST AT START. ONE THING L ED TO ANOTHER AND THEN WH EN YOUR CANDIDATE WINS, , EVERYTHING CHANGES. SO I SPENT THE FIRST CLINTON TER M AND A LITTLE EXTRA IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND ADD DHHS EA RED WORKING FOR BOTH PRESIDENT C LINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT G ORE. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINA RY EDUCATION. I CALL IT MY FIRST GR ADUATE SCHOOL. ASIDE FROM JUST W ITNESSING THINGS AS O NE DOES WHEN YOU ARE A Y OUNG STAFFER ON THE PERI METER O F THE ROOM OR IN THE R OOM WHERE IT HAPPENS, NOT MAKING THE DECISIO NS BUT WATCHING VE RY POWERFUL PEOPLE STRUGGLE WI TH THE DECISIONS THEY HAVE T O MAKE, IT GA VE ME THIS APPREC IATION FOR THE HUMANITY OF POLITICS . P ARTICULARLY, EVEN THE PE OPLE AT THE HIGHEST LEV ELS OF POWER. WEAT HERBY AND GOVERNM ENT OR A BUSINESS, THEY ARE JU ST HUMAN BEING S WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE I T OUT. THEY ARE VERY SMART, TALE NTED BUT THEY AR E DOING THEIR BEST AND TR YING TO I MPLEMENT THE VISION THEY SEE. I T GAV E ME AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POWE R WORKS AND EMPATHY FOR WHERE DIFFE RENT PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM . I THI NK BEING A HISTORIAN HAS GIVEN M E MORE EMPATHY. I SPENT 20 YEARS ON THE OTHERS OF THE FENC E, LOOK ING AT POLITICS AND BUSINES S FROM THE VIEW OF SOMEONE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DO. LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF SILICON VAL LEY OR AMERICAN HI STORY WRIT LARGE, IT I S A WAY OF NOT ONLY BETTER UNDERSTANDI NG OUR PRESENT - T HAT IS ONE THING THAT I HOPE THIS BOOK WILL HELP READERS DO, UNDERST AND HOW WE GET TO THIS BIG TECH NOW AND WHERE DO WE GO? YOU NEED THE BACK ST ORY. IT HELPS YOU GET BAC K FROM ALL OF THE NOISE AND T HE FIGHTING OF RIGHT NOW. OF WHO IS RIGHT AN D WHO IS WRONG AN D DRAW BA CK A ND SAY WHY DID WE MAKE THE SE CHOIC ES AND WHAT WERE THEY H OPING TO DO. AND WHAT DID NO T WORK OUT? THEN YOU HA VE A RICH ER UNDERSTANDI NG AND PERHAPS MORE EMPATH Y FOR WHY DIFFERENT ACTORS DO W HAT THEY DO. SUSAN: HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THIS BOOK? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: I W ORKED ON THIS FOR THE BETTER PART OF SIX YEARS FROM IDEA TO EXECUTION. I LIVE IN S EA TTLE. MY FAMILY AND I MOVED DOW N TO PALO ALT O F OR TWO YEARS. I WA S REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SAB BATICAL FELLOWSHIPS . I HAD A WAY TO BE DOWN THE RE. AND I INTER VIEWED A LOT OF PEOPLE. I H AD TO BUILD MY OWN ARCHIVE . HISTORIANS LIKE TO GO TO AR CHIVES, TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, TO THE NATI ONAL ARCHIVES AND GET IN THE DUST Y BOXES AND DO OUR THING. THIS HISTOR Y THERE ISN'T A , LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OR NATIONAL AR CHIVES IN THIS INDUST RY. A LTHOUGH GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES WERE VERY IMPORTANT T O ME. AND ARCHIVE S LIKE THE C-SPAN ARCH IVES AND THE GOV ERNMENTAL ARCHIVES WERE REALLY IMPO RTANT TO ME. BUT I HAD TO DRAW IN DIFFERENT T HINGS AND TALK TO PEOPLE WHO WERE TH ERE WHEN IT HAPPENED. AND DRAW IN ORAL HISTOR IES F ROM PEOPLE WHO ARE LONGER WITH US. NO CORP ORAT E RECORDS. SO METIMES PEOPLE WOULD GIVE ME FILE FOLDERS THAT THEY KEPT I N THEIR ATTICS FOR THE LAST 30 YEA RS. ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT T HINGS GOIN G FORWARD IS HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THIS HISTORY THAT IS IN THE MAKING, WILL BE PRESERVE D? IT REALLY M ATT ERS. NOT ONLY TH E TECHNOLOGY , UNDERSTANDI NG THE TECHNOL OGY BUT WHAT WERE THE BUSINESS DE CISIONS SURROUNDING THOSE TECHN OLOGIES? WHO WERE THE PEOPLE? THI S IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT T O HISTORIANS GOING FORWA RD. SU SAN: RIGHT AFTER THE WAR, YOU WRITE ABOUT FACT THAT WAS A COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS - BOSTON AND PALO ALTO. WHO ARE THE PATRONS? WH Y WAS IT BOST ON AND PALO ALTO? WHY DID SILICON VALLEY TRIUMPH IN THIS? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: COM ING OUT OF WORLD WA R II, BOS TON WAS , AS THE U.S. GOVERN MENT DECIDED TO GET INTO THE SC IENCE BUSINESS, I N A BIG WA Y THE NATIONAL , SCIENCE FOU NDATION WAS CREATED IN 1949. TH ERE IS A DECISI ON TO GO BIG ON PUBLIC I NVE STMENT IN PEACE TIME RESEARCH AN D DEVELOPMENT . IT WAS PEACETIME ONLY IN TECHNICA LITY. IT WAS THE COL D WAR. IT WAS VERY MUCH AN INVESTME NT MADE FROM THE COLD WAR STRUGGL E. T O COMPETE IN SCIENCE AND EDUCATI ON W ITH THE SOVIETS. NOT ONLY A MATTER OF PRESTIGE BUT DEVELOP ING THE NUCLEAR REALITIES OF THE NUCL EAR AGE, WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAD ENTERED INTO THIS. BOSTON WAS THE 800 POU ND GORILLA. WHAT WAS IN BOSTON QUESTION , WHAT WAS IN BOSTON? HAR VARD AND M.I.T.. YES THERE IS THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLV ANIA AND ITS SCHOOL OF ENGINEER ING THAT WERE ALSO IMPORTANT B UT THE LEADERS , WHAT GAVE T HEM A N ADVANTAGE, WAS THAT THEY WERE THE CENTER OF G OVERNMENT-SPONSORED BUSINESS RE SEARCH DURING THE WAR. THE LEADERS WERE FROM HARVARD AND M.I.T., INC LUDING ONE OF THE PEOPLE I TALK ABOU T IN THE BOOK, VANNE VAR BU SH, WHO I S THE ORIGINAL ENTREPRENEU R PROFESSOR. HE HAS THIS EX TRAORDINARY CAREER, CROSSING OV ER ACADEM IA, GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTR Y. HE IS THE FOUNDER OF RAYTHEON. WHILE HE IS AN ELECTORA L ENGINEERING PROFESSOR A ND M.I.T.. HE GOES ON IN WORLD WAR II TO LEAD THE WA RTIME RESEARCH AND ABOUT M EANT OFFICE UNDER FRANKLIN RO OSEVELT. HE IS KNOWN AS RO OSEVELT'S GENERAL OF PHYSICS. HE HAS A VE RY HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE THE N. HE IS THE P ERSON WHO KIND OF CONCEIVES OF THIS POS TWAR RESEARCH NETWORK THA T IS BASED IN A LOT OF UNIVERSI TIE S. AND SO THAT EXPLAINS BOSTON. ,BOSTON IS, A LOT O F MONEY IS FINALLY IN AFTER WORLD WAR II. AND THE RE'S THE ELECTRO NICS , INDUSTRY IS BASED ON THE EAST COAST. THERE IS A LOT OF EX ISTING INDUSTRY. WHAT EXPLAI NS SILICON VALLEY? SAN TA CLARA VALLEY WAS KNOWN FOR IT'S BI GGES T EXP ORT IS P RUNES AT THE TIME BEING THE P RUNE CAPITAL . IS KNOWN FO R BEING THE PRUNE CAPITAL OF AMERICA. IT HAD TWO ASSETS. IT WAS ON T HE PACIFIC COAST WHERE A LOT OF WARTIME MILITARY AC TIVITY HAD GONE ON AND CONTINU ES TO GO ON. SO MILI TARY IN STALLATIONS IN THE BAY ARE A. AND, IT HAD STANFORD. S TANFORD UN IVERSITY WAS A RESPECTABLE INSTITUTION BUT WAS BET TER KNOWN FOR ITS FOOTBALL TEAM THAT B EING A HARVARD OF THE WEST. IT WANTED T O BE A HARVARD OF THE WEST . BUT IT HAS A GR EAT ASSET IN THIS GUY NA MED FRED TURMAN WHO HAD GON E TO M.I.T. FOR GRADUAT E SCHOOL AND WAS A S TUDENT OF VANNEVAR BUSH. DURING WORL D WAR II, HE HAD GONE TO BOSTON TO WORK UNDER BUSH IN THI S RESEARCH EFFORT. HE IS SITTING IN CAMBRIDGE AND LOOKING AT WHAT IS GOING ON AND HE KNOWS AFTER THE W AR, BUSH AND OTHERS ARE BUILDING TH IS INFRASTRUCT URE TO CONTINUE FORWARD. AN D RESEARCHING DIVERSITY L IKE HARVARD AND M.I.T. ARE GET A GOING TO GET A BI G PIECE OF THIS ACTION. HE WRITES T O A COLLEAGUE IN THE MIDD LE OF THE WAR THAT THERE IS AN OPPOR TUNITY THAT IS ABOUT TO BLOSSOM. ST ANFORD HA S A POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING A NATIONALLY INFLUENTIAL INSTITUTION LIKE HARVAR D OR COULD STATE LIKE DARTMOUTH. GOOD BUT NO T HAV ING A REAL EFFECT ON THE NATIONAL CONVERSATIO N. NOW, I DO N OT KN OW WHAT D ARTMOUTH ADMINISTRATORS THEN OR NOW WHAT THEY CAN THAT AS SESSMENT. IT IS A LITTLE BIT UNCHARI TABLE. NOT WITH HA S ITS OWN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING. NONETHELESS , HE GOES BACK TO PALO ALT O AND TALKS TO THE INCO MING PR ESIDENT O F THE UNIVERSITY. A GUY NAMED WALLACE STE RLING, HISTORIAN H E JOINED HIM IN SAYING T HAT WE WILL TURN STANFORD INTO THE PR EMIER COLD WAR UNIVERS ITY. WE WILL REORGANIZE THE CURRICULUM AND BUILD U P THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT, WE WILL BUI LD UP SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS. A ND ENGINEE RING, AND LABORAT ORIE S THAT REALLY MEET EXACTLY WHAT THE CO LD WAR MILITARY WANTS US TO DO. AND NO OTHER UNIVE RSITY IN THE WORLD DID T HAT. THE ARCHITE CTURE DEPARTMENT EVAPORATED. THEY DID AWAY WI TH OTHER THINGS TO BUILD UP SC IENCE AND ENGINEERING . AND THEY FO RMED THESE CLOSE ALLIANCES WITH INDUST RY AND ENCOURA GED STUDENTS LI KE DAVID PACKARD AND BILL HEWLET T TO START CO MPANIES NEARBY. THEY ENCOUR AGED TECHNOLOGIS TS FROM ELSEWHERE, A GUY NAMED E L SH OCKLEY , COINVENTOR OF THE TRANSISTOR, TO COME TO PAL O ALT O AND SET UP SHOP. , BILL SHOCKL EY. IN OTHER CO MPA NIES A ND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FOLLOWED. S O STANFORD WITH THIS H UB OF, NOT THE ONLY FACTOR , BUT WASN'T INCREDIBLE CRITICAL. S USAN: ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE OUTSIDE SILICON VALLEY ASSO CIATE W ITH TELIK AND BALLY'S STOCK OPTIONS THAT MAY SO WEALTHY. YOU WRITE T HAT THAT BEGAN IN 19 57 WITH HEWLETT-PAC KARD. PROFESSOR O'MARA: HP WAS FOUN DED IN 1939 A G OES PUBLIC IN 1 957. FROM ITS FO UNDIN G, I T'S TWO FOUNDERS, HEWLETT AND PACKARD SET OUT TO FORM A DIFFERENT SORT OF COMPANY. ONE THAT WA S-TH ING ABOUT THE BIG BUS INESSES OF THE 1940'S AND 1950'S. THE BIG COR PORATIONS, THE TRITE A UTOMAKERS. THEY WANTED SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THEY WANTED A NONHIERARCHICAL COMPANY. NO CORNER O FFICES, NO MANAGERIAL SUITS AND T IES. NO UN IONS B ECA USE THAT SIGNAL S SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MANAGE MENT EMPLOYEE RE LATIONS I F YOU HAVE TO BE UNION , THEY ARE NOT GETTING ALONG. INST EAD, THEY WANTED TO CREATE S OMETHING THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE A S CIENTIFIC LABORATORY. THAT WAS MU CH MORE EGALIT ARIAN , WHERE PEOPLE FELT FREE TO-DID NOT FEEL HEMMED IN BY THEIR JO B DESCRIPTION . THAT THERE IS NOT AS MUCH OF A LADDER. WHERE PEOPLE WORK SHORT- SLEEVED AND WANDERE D, W HAT HEWLETT AND PACKER CALL ED IT WAS MANAGEMENT BY WALKING AROUND. RATHER THAN CALL PEOPLE IN AND SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING, THEY WOULD BE ON THE SHOP FLOOR AND SEE WHAT WAS GO ING ON. SO THIS MER ITO CRATIC IDEA, AND T HEN EVERYONE GOT STOCK OPTIONS. NO T EVERYONE. N OT SOME OF THE PEOP LE ON THE MANUFAC TURING ASSEMBLY LI NES. BUT THE WHITE-COLLA R EMPLOYEES DID. EVERYONE HAD STAKE I N THE COMPANY'S F INANCIAL SUCCESS. THIS BECOMES THE MODEL THAT COMPANY AFTER COMPA NY AFTER COMPANY IN THE VALLEY FOLL OWS. SU SAN: WE T ALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPAC E RACE SPUTNIK LAUNCHED IN 1967. ,A LL THE MONEY F LOWING IN. I WANT TO FAST-FORWAR D TO THE 1960 'S AND TALK ABOUT ONE GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT CHANGED IN A BIG WA Y. LBJ SIGNING AN IMMIGRAT ION LAW. WE ARE HAVI NG A BIG IMMIGRATION DEBATE RIGH T NOW. HOW DO ES TH IS 1 965 IMMIGR ATION BILL FIGURE INTO THE HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I THINK THE 1965 IM MIGRATION REFORM ACT IS POSS IBLY ON E OF THE MOST CONSEQ UENTIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE LATTER HALF OF THE 20TH CE NTURY. THE FUNNY THING IS IT WAS N OT INTENDED TO BE THAT AT ALL. IN FAC T AS LYNDON JOHNSON IS , SIGNIN G IT ON LIBER TY ISLAND IN O CTOBER, 1955, , 19 65, HE SA ID IN HIS REMARKS THAT THIS IS NOT A REVOLUTIONARY BILL. IT WA S SEEN AS CROSSING TH E T'S AND DOTTING THE EYES ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN SOME WAYS. , DOTTING THE I'S ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN SOME WAYS. IT HA D BEEN A RACIALLY DISCRIMINAT ORY QUOTA SYSTE M FOR IMMIGRANTS THE 1920'S AT A TIME ESTABLISHED OF FIERCE ANTI -IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT. THAT WAS RA Y MUCH DRIVEN BY P REJUDICE AGAINST SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPEANS, CATHOLICS AND JEWS. P EOPL E WHO WERE SE EN AS OTHER AT THE TIME . THAT WAS HO LDING FAS T UNTIL THE MID-1960'S. SO JOHNSON AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS P USHED THROUGH THIS IMMIGRATION REFORM. THAT WAS RE ALLY JUST ABOUT SUPPOSED TO SET THINGS RIGH T. THE ASSURANCE THAT JOHNSON GAV E SOME OF HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS I NCLUDING SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS WHO WERE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THIS L IBERALIZATION OF IMMIGRAT ION MIGHT BRING HE , SAID THIS I S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYT HING. I T TURNS OUT IT DID. IT OPE NED UP AMERICA'S DOORS TO IM MIGRANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. INCL UDING HUGE CHAINS OF IMMIGRAT ION FROM SOUTH AND E AST ASIA. MANY OF THESE IMMIGRANTS FROM TAIWAN , HON G KONG INDIA AND , CHINA ENDED UP IN SANTA CL ARA AND SILICON VAL LEY. THEY BECAME THE ENGINEERING BACKBONE OF THE VALL EY. THE Y GO ON TO FOUND CO MPANIES IN DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS. BY THE 1980'S, ONE THIRD O F THE COMPANI ES IN THE VALL EY ARE FOUNDED BY PEOPLE W HO WERE BORN FROM E ITHER INDIA OR CH INA. ON T OP OF THAT, TH ERE ARE PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES. YOU HAVE REFUGE E PROGRAMS, R EFUGEES FROM THE FO RMER SOVIET YOU HAVE UNION. THEY AND THEIR C HILDREN GO ON TO FOUND COMPA NIES. GOOGLE IS C OFOUNDED BY THE CHILD O F A SOVIET REFUGEE. YOU HAVE OTHER REFUGEES TH AT COME EARLIE R IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. AN DY GROVE, THE LEGENDARY LEADER OF I NTEL, HE WAS PENNILESS. HE CAME TO THE UNITED STAT ES AS A TEENAGER FROM HUNGARY AFT ER WORLD WAR II. NOTHING WOU LD HAVE SIGNALED TO IMMIGRAT ION OFFICIALS THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BE ONE OF SILI CON VALLEY'S MOST INFLUE NTIAL LEADERS. HE WAS. THAT I MMIGRATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL AND CONTINU ES TO BE. THE FAC T THAT WHY IS SILI CON VALLEY SO GREAT? IT I S NOT BECAUSE AME RICANS ARE BETTER AT TECHNOLO GY THAN EVERYO NE ELSE, THE A MERICAN SYSTEM HAS ALLOWED THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND CAPITAL . AN D IT HAS DRAW N PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD LIKE A MAGN ET FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD A S STUDENTS AND ENTREPRENEU RS. TO THE VALL EY AND TO AMERICAN TECH CENTER S. TH AT HAS BEEN RE ALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AMERICAN DO MINANCE I N THE TECH SPACE. SUSA N: THE 1970'S ARE PIVOTAL DECADE, READING ABOUT. SO M UCH HAPPENED, W HAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE 1 970'S? PRO FESSOR O'MARA: THAT WAS THIS MO MENT WHEN A NEW GENERATION , THE BABY BO OM GENERATION COMES OF AG E IN THE VALLEY. THEY HAVE BEEN - - THEY ARE PRODUCTS OF THIS SPA CE RACE COLD WAR AG E PUSH TOWARD SCIENCE AND TECHNOL OGY. WHEN THEY ARE ELEMENT ARY SCHOOL STUDENTS, THEY WANT T O BECOME ASTRONAUTS. WHEN THEY'RE IN COLLEGE, THEY GO TO THE COLL EGE COMPUTER LAB AND LEA RN ABOUT PUNCHCARDS AND UNDERST AND HOW TO PROG RAM COMPUTERS AND HOW TO INTERFAC E WITH COMPUTERS FOR THE FIR ST TIME. THEY WORKED ON TIME-SHA RING AND TERMINALS. THERE WERE ALSO C OMING-OF-AGE IN THE VIETNAM ERA , THE WATERGATE ERA, AN ERA WHEN GO VERNMENT IS INCREASI NGLY SEEN AS, GOVERNM ENT IS USING IT S POWER FOR D ESTRUCTION , FOR CORRUPT ION. YOU HAVE PE OPLE COMI NG UP WHO ARE MUC H MO RE INTERESTED IN TURNING AWA Y THE GOVERNMENT AND , TURN ING AWA Y FROM BIG GO VERNMENT AND BIG BUS INES S AND THINKING ABOUT USING COMPU TERS. WHO HAD COM PUTE RS BEFORE THIS? IT WAS BIG COM PANIES AND BIG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. T HEY WERE SO BIG AND EXPENSI VE. THIS NEW GE NERATION WAS, HOW CAN WE TAKE THI S COMPETE OR POWER, T HIS INCREDIBLY POWER MACHI NE , INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MA CHINE HOW CAN WE TAKE THESE AND USE THEM AS A TOOL FOR PERSONAL EMPOWERMENT ? HOW CAN WE MAKE IT PERSONAL ? HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE INTERFA CE? HOW CAN WE CHANGE IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IT OR NOT VERSED IN COMPUTER LANGUAGES. HOW CAN WE CREATE AN INTERFACE SO ORDINARY PE OPLE CAN ACCESS AND USE THI S INCRED IBLE VISE. HOW CAN WE CREATE A COMMUNICATI ONS NETWORK FOR COMPUTERS? THERE WAS A TECHNO OPTIMISM. T HIS INCRED IBLE STATE BORN OUT OF THIS POLITICAL MOMENT THAT CAN'T BE SE PARATED FROM THE OTHER THING S GOIN G ON IN THE U NITED STATES AT THE TIME. AND I N THE BAY AREA AT THE TIME. THAT IS THESE COMPUTERS W ILL , SAVE US. ALL THE SE T HINGS YOU SEE WRONG WITH THE WORLD, WAR, INEQUI TY, RACISM AND SEXISM, IF WE HAVE CONTROL OF THESE CO MPUTERS AND WE ARE COMMUNICATI NG WITH THEM AND CONNECTING AND UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER , THEN THIS IS GOING TO FIX IT. SUSAN: WHAT ARE SO ME OF THE NAMES WE KNOW TODAY THAT CAME O UT OF THE HOMEBREW COMPUTER CL UB? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: THE TWO MOS T FAMOUS NAMES THAT COME O UT OF IT ARE STEVE JOBS AND STEVE W OZNIAK. THEY SHOW U P AT ONE OF THE FIRST MEETI NGS OF THIS RANGY GROUP OF COMPUTER HOBBYISTS. PEOPLE WHO ARE PLA YING AROUND WITH PERSON AL COMPUTING AND SOLDERI NG THEIR OWN MOTHERBOARD S. AND BUILDIN G THEIR OWN DEVICES. TH ESE ARE THE GUYS THAT GREW UP WIT H RADIO SETS IN THEIR BASEMENTS. THEY GRADUATED TO BUILDING TH ESE MACHINES. THEY SHOWED UP A S TWO YOUNG GUYS AND TH EY CAME IN HAU LING THIS DEVICE THAT WOZNIAK HAS DESIGNED. T HIS COMPUTER, THIS MOTHER BOARD THAT IS MORE ELEGANT AND SIMPLE AND SOPHISTICATED THAN ANYTHI NG ANYONE ELSE IS DOING. IT I S THE APPLE ONE. IT IS SO FUNNY , YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE AN IMAGE OF THE ORIGINAL APPLE ONE. THEY H OUSED IT IN THIS WOODEN CASE . IT LO OKS LIKE 70 BELTED IN HIGH SCHOOL SHOP CLASS. IT WAS VERY RUDIMENTARY. BUT INSIDE WAS A SOPHISTICATED DEVICE. THE HOMEBREW COMPUTER CL UB WAS THIS WAY FOR TECHNOLOGIS TS TO TRADE ON IDEAS. IT WAS VERY COLLABORATIVE. IT IS A WAY TO FIGURE OUT THIS TECHNICAL HACK AND SH ARE IT WITH YOU. IT WAS NOT ABOUT MAKING MONE Y OR COMMERCIALI ZING. YET. OUT OF THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT GREW S TEADI LY, THEY HAD THIS MO NTHLY MEETING, IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER. OUT OF THIS COMES AN INDUSTRY, A WHOLE HOST OF PER SONAL COMPUTER CO MPANIES. APPLE IS ONE OF T HEM. THEY CREATE A TRANSFORM ATIVE NEW GENERAT ION OF MICRO-CO MMU NICATING. WHICH BECOM ES WHAT WE KNOW AS DESKTOP COM PUTING O R PERSONAL COMPUTING. SUSAN: AND LAWYERS ? PR OFESSOR O'MARA: I W ANTED TO SHOW THE OTHER P ART OF THIS SILICO N VALLEY GALA PAGOS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHY A IT GREW AND WH Y IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. WHAT YOU HA VE IN SIL ICON VALLEY WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE YOU HAVE SPECIALIZED VENTURE-CAPITAL FIRMS. THIS IS HIG H TEC H VENTURE CAPITAL. MANY THE PE OPLE WHO ARE VENTURE CAPITALISTS WERE FIRST ENGINEERS O R ENTAIL TECHNOLOGY COPIES THEM SELVES. MANY CAME OUT OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. AND THEIR G ENER ATION, THE NEXT VENTURE WAS TO START VE NTURE CAPITAL FIRMS. YOU SEE THI S AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE VALLEY. PEOPLE ARE IN ONE COMPANY AND DO WELL AND HAVE A GOOD IPO, THEY THEY G ET AC QUIRE D AND THEN THEY BECOME INVE STORS THEMSELVES. THEN THEY A RE THE ONES MENTORING A ND PICKING THE WINNERS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE REALLY CRITICAL. O NE THING Y OU HAVE ALL OF THESE , COM PUTER CO MPANIES STARTING OU T OUT OF THIS HOB BYIST COMMUNITY. WHAT SETS APPLE APART IS THEY GET THE VENTURE CAP ITALISTS TO BACK THEM REALLY EARL Y. THEY GET VENTURE-CAP ITAL FUNDING FRO M ESTABLISHED VENTURE CAP ITALISTS . THEY ALSO GET EX ECUTIVE L EADERSHIP FROM THIS G UY FROM INTEL. A GU Y NAMED MIKE MARKEL WHO CAME IN AND HE H AD MADE A HEALTHY A MOUNT OF MONEY, H E WAS SEMI RETIRED IN HIS MID-30'S AND IT DECI DES TO PUT A CHUNK OF MONEY IN TO APPLE , PERSONALLY. AND THEN CO ME IN AS, ADUL T SUPERVISION AS THEY CAL L IT IN THE VALLEY. THE TWO STE VES WERE NOT CAPABLE OF RUNNING , THEY DID NOT HAVE MANAGE RIAL EXPERIENCE AT ALL. THEY W ERE P RETTY UNCONVENTIONAL GUYS. SO MA RKULA CR EATES AN ORGANIZA TIONAL STRUCTURE THAT IS MOR E LIKE A BUSINESS, SOMEWHAT TR ADITIONAL. APPLE POSITIONS I TSELF AS A COUNTERCU LT URAL COMPANY, A THINK DIFFE RENT COMPANY, IT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH ORDINARY CORPORATE A MERICA. TH AN YOU MIGHT EXPECT. SUS AN: WE WILL RUN OUT OF TIME FOR AL L THE HISTORY BUT I WANTE D TO GET TO RONALD REAGAN. WE HAVE A CLIP OF RONALD R EAGAN TALKING ABOUT A VERY IMPO RTANT PROJECT TO HIM. THE ST RATEG IC D EFENSE INITIATIVE, STI LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN TALK ABOUT THIS CALIFO RNIA GOVERNOR. H E COMES TO WA SHINGTON AND HOW IMP ACTS YOUR STORY. >> THERE HAS B EEN A DESI RE TO DISCUSS SDI. AS OF ITS FUND ING TO BE DETER MINED BY DOMESTIC CONSIDERATI ONS ON CONNECTE D TO WHAT THE SOVIETS ARE DOING. SDI IS A VITAL INSURANCE P OLICY. A NECESSARY PART OF ANY NATI ONAL SECURITY STRATEGY THAT INCLUD ES DEEP REDUCTIONS IN STRATEGI C WEAPONS. IT IS A COR NERSTONE OF OUR SECURITY ST RATEGY FOR THE 1970'S AND BEYOND. , THE 1990'S AND BEYOND. WE WILL RES EARCH AN D DEVELOP IT AND WHEN IT IS READY WE WILL IT. SUSAN: LOTS OF MON EY COMING INTO THIS. HOW DID IT AFFECT SILICON VAL LEY? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: STI WAS REA LLY A SUPERCOMPUT ING PROJECT. IN ORDER TO WORK IT WOULD RE QUIRE IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF COMPETING POWER. SO IT BECOM ES THIS INCREDIBLE RESOURCE FOR COMPUTER SC IENCE AND OTHER RELATED DISCIPLINES . A LOT OF THE COMPUTER SC IENTISTS THE FUNNY THING IS, I N SILICON VALLEY WERE VERY M UCH AGAINST SDI. THEY W ERE, A NUMBER OF THEM WER E AGAINST IT TECHNICA LLY . THEY WERE LIKE, THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK. TH ERE IS A POSSIBILI TY FOR ERROR AND ERROR WOULD BE CA TASTROPHIC. IT WOULD RE QUIRE SO MUCH. WE ARE NOT THERE Y ET, TECHNOLOGIC ALLY. IT REMINDS ME ABOUT SOME OF THE CONVERS ATIONS ABOUT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AN D DRIVERLESS CARS. PEOPLE ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET. BUT AL SO PHILOS OPHICALLY. THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING CO MPUTERS, PROGRAMMING COMPUTERS, WHO ARE ON THE FACULTY OF STANFORD OR WORKING AT RESEARCH INSTITUTES LIKE SRI IN THE VALLEY, THEY ARE THE ANT IWAR GENERATION. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SEE, YOU KN OW THEY WANT TO MAKE PEACE, , NO T WAR. TH EY ARE PO LITICALLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY OPPOSED TO WHAT THE REAGAN ADMI NISTRATION IS DOING. AND SO, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE WONDERF UL T HINGS AND IT IS UNDERSTANDING THIS RELATI ONSHIP AND HOW IT EVOLVED. YO U HAVE SOME OF THE PEOP LE WHO BECAUSE ARE THE BIGGEST BEN EFICIARIES OF SOME OF THIS MONEY. THE MONEY KEEPS ON FLOWING. BECAUSETHE MONEY KEEPS ON FL OWING. IT'S COMING THROUGH DAR PA AND POLICE AGENCIES. A ND IT IS A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO WARD , COMPUTING. EVEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE BIGGEST BEN EFICIARIES ARE SIMULTA NEOUSLY PROTESTING AND PICKETING. AND HAVING MEETINGS AND WRITING OPEN LETTERS. THIS ABILIT Y TO DISSENT WHILE STILL BEING PART OF THE SYSTEM I TH INK IT' S REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN WE THI NK ABOUT COMPETITION WITH CHINA IN TECHNOLOGY. THE DIFFERE NCE IN THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM, REC OGNIZING HOW MUCH THE AMERICAN PO LITICAL SYSTEM HAS MADE SI LICO N VALLEY POSSIBLE , NOT ALWAYS INTENTIONAL LY, SOMETIMES IT HAS BEEN UNINTE NDED CONSEQUENCE S. THE IMMIGRATION ACT BEING A N EXAMPLE OF THAT. THERE'S BEE N EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMP LE. THAT IS THIS INTERPLAY THAT I FIND SO INTERESTING . REALLY IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTA NDING , IF WE'RE TA LKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOI NG TO HAPPEN N EXT AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF WASHINGT ON. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIS HISTORY AND THESE INTERESTING COMPLEXITIE S. AND THE DIS TINCTIVE, ONLY IN AMERICA ASP ECT OF SO MUCH OF IT. THE NEXT CL IP S USAN: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRAT ION FOR WHOM YOU WORKED, AND AL GORE. THIS IS BEF ORE THEY TOOK OFFICE AND THE SUMMIT THE PULLED TOGETHER TO ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEUR ALYSSA HIM. , ENCOURAGE E NTREPRENEU RS. >> A LOT OF TH E INVE STMENT WE HAVE MAD E IS AN INFRASTRUCT URE THAT MAKES IT EA SIER FOR US TO MOVE AROUND RESO URCES THAT USED TO BE MORE IMP ORTANT. THEY ARE STILL IMPORTANT. BUT IF THE KEY RESOURC ES KNOWLEDGE, TODAY, SHOULDN'T WE BE GIVING A LO T MORE EMPHASIS TO THE KIND OF NATIONAL IN FRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO SHARE INFORMATION AND CREATE AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE LIKE THE IN FORMATION SUPERHIGHWA Y'S REFERRED TO EARLIER, THE DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND SOFTWARE AN D PROGRAMS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR CHILDRE N TO COME HOME AFTER SCHOO L AND PLUG INTO THE LIBRARY COM MERCE , LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. SUSAN: DURI NG THE CLINTON MINISTRATIO N WITH GORE THIS WAS THE BOO M IN SILICON VALLEY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. HOW RESPONS IBLE WAS ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNM ENT POLICIES FOR THAT BO OM? PROFESSOR O'MARA: THE GOVERNMENT PLAYED A BIG ROLE. I LOV ED THA T CLIP. THE OTHER PERSO N, THE CLOSE-UP SH OT WAS JO HN SCULLY, THEN CEO OF APPLE. THER E, DURI NG 1992 AND HE 1993, APPEARS SITTING NEX T TO HILLARY CLINTON. AT THE FIRS T STATE OF THE UNIO N IN 1993. WHAT AL GOR E TALKS ABOUT IN THIS CLIP, THE I NFORMATION SUPERHIGHWA Y AND ALSO THIS NOTION OF I NFRASTRUCT URE. YOU DID HAV E TO HAVE THAT THIS W AS THE BASIC FOUNDATIONAL , INFRASTRUCT URE FOR THE INTERNE T BOOM TO HAPPEN. THE INTERNE T TH AT EXISTED SINCE 1969 AS A N ETWORK FOR RESEARC HERS, MILITARY PEOPLE, DIF FERENT PARTS OF THE DEFENSE RES EARCH ESTABLISHMENT AND ALSO AC ADEMIC RESEARCHERS TO COMMUNIC ATE WITH EACH OTHER. IN T HE 1980 'S, IT GRADUALLY STARTS OPEN ING UP. BUT UP UNTI L 1991 IT WAS THE WAL LED GARDEN OF THE INTE RNET. YOU COULD NOT DO ANY SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER. YOU COULD HAVE, COMPANIES COULD HAVE A.COM DOMAI N BUT THEY COULD NOT BUY OR SELL ON IT. IT WAS VERY LIMITE D. WHAT HAPPEN S IN THE EARLY 1 990'S, IN THE LATE YEARS OF THE GEOR GE H A MINISTR ATION AND THE EARLY YEARS OF TH E CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS THIS LAYING DOWN OF INFRASTRUCT URE. THIS INCLUD ED YOUNG POLITICAL AND LIKE ME . I WAS W ORKI NG ON OTHER TH INGS, I WAS NOT W ORKING ON TECHNOLOGY AT THE TIME . LIKE WHAT I S THI S INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY STUFF NO ON E , UNDERSTOOD IT. WE WERE WOR KING ON HEALTH CARE REFORM AND OTHER THINGS THAT SEEMED MORE CENTRAL. TH ERE WERE A FEW LAWMAKERS, BUT AL GORE BEI NG ONE OF THEM. NEWT GINGRICH WAS ANOTHER. WH O IN THE EARLY 1980'S AND 1990'S ARE KEEPING THEIR EYE ON THE BALL OF RECOGNIZING THAT YOU HA VE TO LAY DOWN THE BASIC INFRA STRUCTURE AND ALLOW T HIS INTERNET BACKBONE TO BECOME - - NOT REGULAT ED IN TERMS OF WHAT COMMER CIAL ACTIVITIES COULD HAPPE N ON TOP OF IT BUT C REATING A NETWORK. TH AT THE GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAG ING ENTREPRENEU RIAL ACTION TO HAPPEN. SO THERE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE THE GOVERNMENT PLAYED. SUSAN: YOU ALSO RE PORT IN THE BOOK THAT AL GORE WAS ON THE BOARD OF AP PLE AND BECAME A HUNDRED MIL LIONAIRE IN THE PROC ESS. HOW IMPORTA NT I S THAT IN TELLING THE STORY FOR PEOPLE WHO LEAVE OFFICE AND MADE A LOT OF MO NEY IN THIS FIELD? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: AL GORE IS AN EXCEPTIO NAL FIGURE. HE IS EXCEP TIONAL IN THE CENTRAL ROLE HE PLAYS IN TH E 1980 'S CARING ABOUT COMPUTERS WHEN OTHER LAWMAKERS DID NOT QUITE G ET IT. ALSO, IN TH E CENTRAL ROLE THAT HE PLA YED BEING THE TECHIE IN CHIEF FO R THE CLINTON ADM INISTRAT ION. ALSO THE IMMENSE WEALTH AND SUCCESS HE HAD AFTERWARDS. IN THE LAST 25 YEARS, S ILICON VAL LEY HAS GOTTEN LARGER AND WEALTHIER. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH M ORE TRAFFI C BAC K AND FO RTH BETWEEN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND THE VALLEY IN T ERMS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN ONE AND MOVE TO ANOTHER OR VICE VERSA. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE VALL EY NOW WHO OF THE CLINTON , BUSH TO AN OBAMA ADMINISTRAT ION'S WHO ARE NOW WOR KING IN THESE CO MPANIES. A LOT OF THEM , THEIR NUMBER OF P EOPLE-THES E VALLEY COMP ANIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT FORCES IN W ASHINGTON, D.C. POLITI CS. THEY HAVE G ROWN THEIR LOBBING OPE RATION S IGNIFICANT LY. IN THE THEY DID NOT HAVE 1990'S, LOBBYISTS. MICROSOFT H AD ONE GUY WORKING UP IN BETHESDA . O UT OF HE W OULD CARRY STUFF IN THE BACK OF HIS JEEP. S USAN: NOW HOW LARGE IS TH EIR LOBBING GROUP? PROF ESSOR O'MARA: SOM E OF THE BIGG EST LOB BING OPE RATIONS IN WASHINGT ON TODAY ARE THE BIG FIVE TE CH COMPANIES. SUSAN: PRESUMABLY THE MICROSO FT ANTITRUST SOON HAD LOT TO DO WITH THE RECOGNI TION THAT THAT WE IMPORTANT IN THEIR DE VOUT MEANT. PROFESSOR O'MARA: IT WAS A BIG WAKE-UP CALL. GAETZ FAMOU SLY JOKED WHEN THE FTC WAS STA RTING TO BRING ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAI NST MICROSOFT IN THE EARL Y 1990'S, GAE TZ SCOFFED THE WORST THING , THA T CAN HAPPEN TO M E IN WASHINGTON IS I COULD FALL DOWN THE STEPS OF THE FTC AND BREAK MY NECK. [LAUG HTER] IT TURNS OU T THAT MICROSOFT DID NOT HAV E TO BREAK UP. BUT IT CAME OUT WI TH GUARD RAILS ON WH AT IT COU LD DO. IT CAME OUT MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS AN D CONSTRAINED. PERHAPS LES S WILLIN G TO DIVE IN TO NEW MARKETS AND THE AGGRESSIVE FOP FASHION IT HAD BEFO RE. PART OF IT WAS A NEW TECH GENERATION WAS GROWING. IT IS NOT L IKE YOU WOULD NOT H AVE GOOGLE HAD MICROSO FT NOT BEEN HEMMED DOWN. OF CO URSE, WE DO NOT K NOW. COUNTERFACT UAL HISTORY IS IMPOSSIBLE. THIS NEW GE NERATION WAS GROWING . THIS HAPPENS AGAIN AND A GAIN. THIS REGENE RATION OF TECH, TH E COMPANIES THAT ARE BI G NOW WILL NOT BE FOREVER. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 25 YEARS FR OM NOW AND WHAT RELATIONSHI P THEY WILL HAVE TO THE COMP ANI ES OF RIGHT NOW. SUSAN: A VERY QUIC K CLIP BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF TIME. IT SEEMS A LON G TIME A GO. IT WAS JUST 20 11 AND THE FIR ST TWEET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WITH BARACK OBAM A HERE. >> I'M GOING TO MAKE HIS TORY HERE AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT T O LIVE-TWE ET. WE HAVE A COMPUTER OVER HERE. ALL R IGHT. HERE IS THE QUESTION. I N ORDER TO REDUCE T HE DEFICIT, WH AT COSTS WOULD YOU C UT AND WHICH I NVESTMENTS WOULD YOU K EEP? THE R EASON I THOUGHT T HIS WAS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION, I S BECAUSE AS ALL OF Y OU KNOW, WE ARE GOIN G THROUGH A SPIRITED DEBATE HERE IN WAS HINGTON. BUT IT IS I MPORTANT TO GET THE WHOLE COUNTRY INVOLVED. S USAN: THAT WAS ONLY 2011. NOW W E HAVE THIS TWEAKING PR ESIDENT , TWEETING PR ESIDENT. WHO HAS USE D THIS PLATFO RM. BUT THE TO THOUSANDS A ND THE 201 0S ARE THE STORY OF THE RISE OF SOC IAL MEDIA AND HOW IMPORTANT I T BECAME AS A PLATFO RM. A S WE TELL THE STORY W E ARE NOW COMING FULL CIRCLE. WHA T GUARANTEE IS THERE THAT SILICO N VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DOMINANCE IT HAS? IN THE UNIT ED STATESHAVE THE DOMINANCE I T HAS? , WE ARE HEARING THE HUAWEI STORY. CHINA HAS CERTAIN INTENTIONS. RUSSIA HAS BEEN A MAJOR PLA YER AND USING DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIE S. THERE ARE OTHER NONSTATE AC TORS THAT ARE USING SOCIAL MEDI A. HOW DOES SI LICON VALLEY PRESERVE TH E IMPORTANT ROLE IT HAS PLAY ED? PRO FESSOR O'MARA: YES. LOOKIN G BAC K TO ITS HISTORY AND RECOGNIZING THE FOUNDATIONAL NATURE OF P UBLIC POLICY AND CREATIN G AN ENTREPRE NEURIAL SANDBOX FOR LACK OF A BETTER ANALOGY.WHA T THE U.S. GOVERN MENT DID IS TO PUT A WH OLE LOT OF MONEY IN TE CHNOLOGIE S DIRECTION AND THEN GO T OUT OF THE WAY. THE IN TERNE T-PART OF THE DILE MMA OF SOCIAL MEET AT RIGHT NO W, IS IT IS THEN UNR EGULATED SPACE. FUNN ILY ENO UGH, THAT IS WHA T ALLOWED THE SE COMPA NIES TO BLOSSOM. IN THE 1990 'S WHEN THE RU LES OF THE ROAD WERE BEING LAID DOWN, THE INFRAST RUCT URE, THERE WAS A CHOICE MADE , AN AG REEMEN T THAT THE IN TERNET COMPANIES WOULD SELF REGULATE. THAT WAS MADE IN ORD ER TO ENCOURAGE FREE SPEECH AND CONVERSATION ON THE INTERNET BE CAUSE IN THAT TIME, THE BIG WOR RY W AS T HE BIG BUSINES SES, MEDIA WAS CABLE, COMCAST, TIME WARNER . NOW YOU HAV E THESE COMPANIES T HAT ARE PERHAPS MORE POWERF UL THAN ALL OF OUR MEDIA C OMBINED IN SOME WAYS, IN SOME PLA CES. SO WILL IT CONTINUE TO DOMINATE ? , THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MAKING INVE STMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ADVANCE D TECHNOLOGY LIKE AI, AU TONOMOUS VEHICLES AND ON AND ON. IN HIGH ER EDUC ATION, THE U.S. HAS DR AWN BACK. THE U .S. IS DRA WING BACK FROM THE OPEN DOORS OF AL LOWING THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST F ROM AROUND THE WORLD T O EASILY COME HERE AND BE ENCOURAG ED TO COME HERE AND CREATE. IT IS IMPOS SIBLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE CA N CREATE THIS FOUNDATION. NOT JUST TO REPLICATE WHAT IS GOING ON NOW BUT THINK ABOUT HOW C AN NEW VOICES COME INTO THE CO NVERSATION? HOW DO YOU HAVE MO RE ANN HARDY'S? WH ERE ARE THE KIDS THAT WOULD NOT E ASILY COME INTO THIS WORLD? HOW DO YOU BRING THEM IN? HO W DO YOU ALSO GET DIFFERE NT VOICES IN T HE ROOM WHO ARE FIGURIN G OUT WHAT THE TECHNOLOGICAL QUESTIONS A ND SOLUTIONS ARE? ONES T HAT ARE MADE WITH T HE WORLD IN MIND. BE CAUSE AME RICAN TECHNOLOGY COMPANY'S H AVE GLOBAL MARK ETS. THINGS THAT ARE BORN AN D BRED IN CALIFORNIA DON'T OFTEN TRANS LATE EASILY TO MYANMAR OR NAME YOU R GEOGRAPHY. THESE ARE T HE REAL CHALLENGES SO THAT NOT JU ST THE VALLEY AND ,NOT JUST WASHIN GTON, BUT BOTH. A ND ALL OF US WHO USE THE PRODUCT S, N EED TERRAC E WITH GOING FORWARD.

AS PART OF HIS FINAL CAMPAIGN SW ING THROUGH THE STATE THIS YEAR. AFTER QUESTIONS HE MET AND TO QUESTION WI TH SOME OF THE SUPP ORTERS. [APPLAUSE] >> DON'T JUMP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS . SUNDAY IN P ETERBOR OUG H. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE THIS STATE, FOR REAL. YOU HAVE HE ARD ME SAY THAT , I GO BACK A LONG WAY WI TH A LOT OF FOLKS WH O REPRESENTED THE STATE. SOME OF YOU HEARD ME SA Y IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HO ME STATE OF DE LAWARE IN ONE IMPO RTANT RESPECT. EVERYBODY K NOWS EVERY BODY. THAT IS A GOOD THIN G. FIRST TIME I RAN FOR T HE UNITED STATES SENA TE, I WAS 29 YE ARS OLD. NOT OLD ENO UGH TO B E SWORN IN. THAT'S JUST ICE BRO ADDRICK, I HAVE TO BE CAREF UL IN FRONT OF HIM, I MAKE IT CALLED IN FRONT OF THE COURT. BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN I RAN, MY STA TE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS, DOWN AROUND THE MASSACH USETTS BORDER, A L ITTLE COMPETITION. BUT I REMEM BER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUT HERN PART OF THE STATE O F DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. W E WE RE A B ORDER STATE, WASN'T SURE WHAT S IDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE S OUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOU THERN. T HEY TALK A T YOU LIKE YOU'RE A GOOD OLD FELLA. SO T HE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YO UR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. T HEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SA Y BEC AUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOW N HERE. I REM EMBER THERE WAS A GUY CALLED EDGAR C. BENNETT , YOU COULDN' T CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU'R E NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AN D HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YO U'RE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOME. ED GAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CO NSER VATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HA PPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO W E WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WAN TED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN A TOWN C ALLED SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BE AUTIFUL OLD CHURCH, MET HODIST CHURCH, AND IT HAD THE GRAVEYA RD IN THE FRONT L IKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BE LONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH' S. YOU WALK TH ROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENT RANCE TO GO UP. AND THE MINISTER WAS VERY KI ND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP A T THE CHURCH WITH HIM. AND HE SAID WE HAV E WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HOP EFULLY, HE WILL GRE ET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WAL K OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT , BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTE R SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR C. WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER WARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EX CEPT FOR THAT HO RSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE S AID OH, THAT'S MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: TRUE STORY. SO I GUESS IT'S LIKE THAT I N NEW HAMPSHIRE, ANYWAY. LOO K, THERE 'S A LOT TO TA LK ABOUT SO I WANT TO GET YOUR QU ESTIONS, SO I WILL B E RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMB ER ONE, THERE' S AN OVERWHELMIN G AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SIN GLE MOST CONSEQ UENTI AL ISSUE, AS Y OU KNOW, MR. M AYOR, IF WE GET F OUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD T RUMP, IT IS GOING TO CH ANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACTER O F OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. SO, I T MATT ERS A LOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE'RE GOING TO PICK. AN D S O, WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SENATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE CLEAR LY WHY I WAS R UNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND THERE'S THR EE REASONS. ON E WAS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COU NTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT' S HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTT ESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY AS KED THE PRESIDENT WHAT HE THO UGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SID ES. NO P RESIDENT'S NEVER SAID ANYTHI NG LIKE THAT, I MEAN FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAI D SOMETH ING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT H AS EVER SA ID SOMETH ING LIKE THAT. THAT' S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M RUNNING , TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THO SE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDEN T. WE'VE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS AD MINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVE RY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED T HE ARC OF INCLUSION WIDER AND W IDER AND I T'S BEING SHUT DOWN N OW. I THIN K IT'S BEING CORROSIVE F OR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING WAS TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS T AKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE W EALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN TH E WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHI EST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORL D. AND ALMOST ALL THE DAT A SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE ST ANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. WE'VE NEVER THOUG HT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CE NTURY. WE 'VE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED . THIS TIME WHEN W E REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE'V E GOT TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVER YBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE OF C OLOR, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKIN G PEOPLE WHO JUST , MY DAD WOUL D SAY, I'M NO T LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, JOEY. I JUS T WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE M E A SHOT. THE THIRD REASO N I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO U NITE THE COUNTRY. AN D I WAS P RETTY ROUNDLY CRI TICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGU ES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM , OF FOR THE PRIMARY , NO, THERE A RE A CTUALLY SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. THE Y REALLY ARE. THEY'R E GOO D PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BE FORE, REMEMBER? H E DID THE ARMS CONTROL TRE ATIES. H E DID , AND THEY WO ULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT T HAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. AND T HIS RE PUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFERENT. IT'S DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY TH REE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LOT O F THESE THINGS. I T HINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTE LY CRITICAL. I DON'T THINK IT'S NAIVE , I UNDERSTAN D THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY W ELL. I'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONA LD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ON LY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FA MILY, GOING AFTER ME , I UNDERSTAN D THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT I T'S NO T ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S A BOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. AN D PRESIDE NTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGE S. PR ESIDENT SHOULD RUN AND REP RESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. JOHN KNOWS ME WELL. I MEAN IT. ALL THE PEO PLE. IMM IGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND , DEMO CRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPEN DENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO - - CAN'T DO ANYTHING. T HIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NO THING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESID ENT W HO SAYS I CAN'T GET I T DONE SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AN D DO IT. SO I DO N'T THINK IT'S NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY AND THE NEED TO DO IT. I BELIE VE WE CAN BECA USE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT T HE PROPOSITION , SOME OF THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING WITH IN THI S NOMINATION SAY TO ACCEPT T HE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT B E SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: SO W E HAVE TO. WE CAN' T SURRENDER T HE NOTION. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I 'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE . DOE SN'T MEA N IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HARD THI S TIME. HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REP UBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUS E AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, A ND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DON'T MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSO NALITIES. I DON'T MEAN THE DI RTY POLITICS OF GOING AF TER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK WHAT'S HAPP ENED IN AMERICAN PO LITICS. E VEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CL OSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPEN S? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THI NK YOU 'R E IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSI NESS. I THINK YOU'RE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU'RE THIS , BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE'R E GOING TO WORKOUT CLI MATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I L EARNED A LONG TIME AGO FROM A GUY NAMED M IKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORIT Y LEADER FROM MONTANA, HE WAS CALL ED IRON MIKE, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FING ER THAN MOST P EOPLE HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID JOE , IT'S NOT ALWAYS APPR OPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WO MAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT'S AL WAYS APPR OPRIATE TO QUESTION TH EIR JUDGMENT. Y OU DON'T KNOW THEIR MOTIV ES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. T HEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHI NG PASSED. WHE N IN FACT A LOT HAS C HANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIN D OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UNDER THE T HREE S HELLS, YOU USUALLY DON'T BET ON HIM A SE COND TIME. HE WAS GOIN G TO TAKE CARE OF THE FORG OTTEN P EOPLE AND THEN HE FORGOT T HAT THEY FORGET. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN, IN FACT, SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MU CH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLIC ANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN OWN THE 21ST CE NTURY. WE HAVE WHAT IT TAK ES. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMI STIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY. FO LKS, LOOK. IF YO U THINK ABOUT IT, W E'RE IN A SITUAT ION WHERE WE'VE GOT TO GIVE , WHEN THE REPUBLI CANS DISAGREE WITH US, WH EN I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF I'M YOUR PRESID ENT, HERE'S THE DEAL. WE TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DI STRICTS. CAMPAIGN. F OR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FO R 67, 69 , I'M NOT SURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES , LAST TIME O UT IN 2018. I'M T HE ONLY GU Y INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FRO M ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANI A, STATE THAT WE LOST AND/OR WERE CLOSE. AND GUESS WHAT WE DID? WE DID N'T GO A FTER THE PERSONALITI ES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAI NST. WE SAID WE' RE GOING TO WIN 41 SEATS AN D W E'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK THE HO USE. WE WON 41 S EATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEMY GRA DUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PIL OT, DROPPING BOMBS. YOU KNOW, T HIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. BUT WHAT'D WE DO? WE SAID, AL L OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REAL IZED, REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HO USE WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE. EVERYBODY S AID YOU LO ST BECAUSE IT'S NOT PO PULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? T HEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, W E'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMAC ARE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-E XISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YO U CAN'T KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YO UR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL HE'S 26 ANYMORE, ETC. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY SAID WHOA, WHAT? BECAUSE PEO PLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT , I KEEP ON P ICKING ON JOHN, BUT J OHN KNOWS , MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 'VE GOT TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. Y OU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. REMEMBE R, I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRE SIDE CHAT , REMEMBER THAT? BUT T HE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE H AVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY L AP. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STAR TED TO TAKE IT AWAY THA T PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. SO AL L WE DID WAS GO OUT AND SAY LOOK, YOUR STATE REP, GOVERNOR, Y OUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRE SSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY T HIS THING YOU H AVE. PEOPL E SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN Y OU CAN'T CONVINCE, Y OU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. A ND S O PEOPLE KNOW , I'M CONCLUD ING WITH THIS A ND I'LL GO TO QUEST IONS, BECAUSE THE RE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WA NT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCAT ION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A W HOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENC E AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY 'RE TRYING TO K ILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. EVE RYBODY W HO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL. THIS IS REALITY. EV EN THE SU PPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KN OW W HO YEARS. PEOPLE LIKE HIM. T HEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THE M ARE AR GUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR BECAUSE OF THINGS D EMOCRATS D IDN'T DO OR WHATEVER. W E'VE GOT T O LET THEM KNOW THAT , WHO WE ARE, HOW EVER. WE'VE GOT T O LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHO OSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAU SE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEA R TO PEOPLE. FEA R. WE HAVE TO CHO OSE T RUT H OVERL IES. , OVER LIES. THAT' S HIS THEORY, EVE NTUALLY IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT . WE CHO OSE T RUTH OVER LIES. WE CHOOSE S CIENCE OVER FICTION. OV ER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: FOR REAL. WE GO T A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. AND I W ANT TO START OFF BY THANKING EVERYBODY UNDER THE A GE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KI DDO. I DO N'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HER E, BUT T HANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. BUT AF TER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBO DY UNDER 15, YOU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY, BECA USE THI S HAS GOT TO BE BORIN G, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. TH ANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: ANYWAY, MY MOTHER W OULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, H USH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. SO FIRE AWAY. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN T HE AUDIENCE, GIVE THE MICROPH ONE TO THEM , >> HELLO, THAN K YOU S O MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I JU ST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE ACA. MY CHILD WAS BORN SUPER SICK AND BEFORE THE ACA LIFTED LIFETIME IN SURANCE CAPS, AND S O I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M JUS T WONDER ING WITH ALL TH ESE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ACA, WHAT ARE YOU GOI NG TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDRE N RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT T HEY NEED AND CA N ACCESS ALL THE MEDICAL SERVICES THEY REQUIR E? MR . BIDEN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST NAME? >> SA RAH. MR. BIDEN: SARAH. YOU KNOW, YOU C OULD HEAR A CRACK IN SARAH'S VOICE THERE, BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TH ING SARAH HAS. I ALSO WAS A SIGNIFICA NT USER OF HEA LTH CARE . WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED, BEFORE I GO T SWORN IN, I WAS IN WASHINGTON AND A TRACT OR-TRAILER BLINDSIDED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, A ND KILLED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTE R. B UT MY SONS SURVIVED. A NYWAY. BUT WHAT HA PPEN ED WAS, I HAVE INSURANCE. I HAD THE PEACE OF MIND THAT I WOUL D BE ABLE TO GET THEM GOOD DOCTOR S. AN D THEN, YOU KNOW, I GOT HOSPITA LIZED YEARS AGO WITH A CRAN IAL A NEURYSM. I WAS HOSPITALIZED A COUPLE OF TIMES. THEY TOOK THE TOP OF MY HEAD OFF THE SEC OND TIME, SAID THEY COULD N'T F IND MY BRA IN THE FIRST TIME. [LAUG HTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT IT WAS MY NURSES THAT GAVE ME HOPE. AN D MY SON, BEAU, ATTOR NEY GENERAL, A DECORATED WAR HERO , FOR REAL. A YEAR IN I RAQ, SIX MONTHS IN COZUMEL BEFORE THAT. HE CA ME HOME AND WAS DIA GNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA, GIVEN MONTH S. IT WASN'T COULD HE - - WOULD HE LIVE, IT WAS WHEN. R UN OUT OF COVERAGE. S UFFER IN PEACE. Y OU' RE ON YOUR OWN . ONE OF THE THINGS MY DAD USED TO SAY IS T HAT EVERYO NE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREAT ED WITH DIGNITY. HO W CAN A P ARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHE N THEY HAVE A DYING CHILD AND T HERE'S NOT A DAMN THING YOU C AN DO ABOUT IT? HOW CAN A P ARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHEN THEY'R E IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE A TALE NTED CH ILD IN SCHOOL AND CAN'T F IGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY TO G ET THEM THERE. HEAL TH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. SO HERE'S WHAT I SUPPOSE. AN D I WON'T GO INTO EXCRUCIATIN G DETAIL, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO DO MORE, LET ME KNOW. NUMBE R ONE, I TAKE OBAMACARE AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZE IT SO IT COSTS LESS TO GET INTO OBAMACARE FOR EVERYON E, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR I NCOME IS, SO YOU CAN GET WHAT YO U CA LL A GOLD PLAN, AND IF YOU CAN AFF ORD, THAT IS, IF YOU HAVE GOOD INCOME, YOU CAN BUY INTO IT AND IN FACT , YOU'LL NOT HAVE A DEDU CTIBL E MORE THAN $ 1000 EVER. THAT' S THE GOLD PLAN. YOU D ON'T HAVE TO BUY THAT PLAN. YOU CAN BUY A CHEAPER P LAN IF YOU'D LI KE. FOR T HOSE WHO CAN'T AFFOR D HEALTH CARE PLAN, I PRO VIDE WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED , ARE , I US UALLY W OULD CALL HIM PR ESIDENT, BUT I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH TH E OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: I MEAN IT. I DON'T WANT TO GET THEM MIXED UP. WE TALKED A BOUT THE NEED TO ADD A PUBLIC OP TION, A PUBLIC OPTION THAT PROVIDED ME DICARE, A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO IN FACT WAN TED TO BUY INTO A MEDICARE OPTION IF T HEY WANTED TO DO IT. A ND IF THEY WANTED TO DO IT, A ND IF THEY COU LDN'T AF FORD IT, IF THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, THEY WOULD AUTOMATICAL LY BE ENROLLED IN THIS MED ICARE OPTION. IT'S MEDICA RE FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT, BECAUSE WE HAVE 160 MILLION PEO PLE NATIONWIDE WHO IN FACT LIKE THE HEALTH CARE PLANS THEY HAVE NEGOTI ATED, MANY OF THEM WITH THE UN IONS AND COMPANIES, THAT ARE VE RY EXPENSIVE PLANS THAT THEY LIKE. AND, IN FAC T, THEY GAVE UP SIGNIFICANT SALARY CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO GET THAT COVERAGE. A ND YOU SHO ULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP IF YO U WANT TO KEEP IT. LIKE ME DICA RE FOR ALL, YOU MUST, AS A MATTER OF LAW, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY PR IVATE INSURANCE. YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. BARACK PROM ISED YOU COULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE R IGHT. YOU CAN KEE P YOUR PLAN AS LONG AS YOUR COM PANY HAS THE PLAN. THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND SAY, WE'RE NOT G OING TO DO IT ANYMORE. TH EN YOU'RE ABLE TO BUY INTO OBAMAC ARE, THE OBAMA-BIDEN PLAN, THAT RELATES TO HAVING THIS PUBLIC OPTI ON. AND MY PLAN , I D ON'T WAN T TO KILL YOU , WHAT DOES IT COST? COST A LOT OF MONEY, $750 BILLION OVE R 10 YEARS. BUT IT DOES N'T COST $30 TRILLION OV ER 10 YEARS, AND IT LEAVES YOU WITH THE OPTION OF KEEPING WHA T YOU HA VE IF YOU WANT IT OR BUYIN G I N IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. EV ERYBO DY IN MY STATE, LIKE YOURS, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, U NLESS GOD BLESS H IS MEMORY. UNLESS YOU ALL , I KNOW HE'S A REPU BLICA N , HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT? I LAY OUT IN DETAIL HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THE PLAN AND EVERYTH ING ELSE I CALL FOR, AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU THE SE CHARTS. AND THESE ARE THE TAX INC REASES FOR THE VERY, VERY WEALTH Y, BE CAUSE WE NOW HAVE $1 TRI LLION, $800 BILLION, $900 BILLION ADD ITIONAL DEFICIT BECAUSE OF THE TAX PROPOSA LS T HE PRESIDENT PUT FORWARD, TR UMP, THAT OVERWHELMIN GLY TAKES CARE OF THE TOP 1% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE , WHAT I DO IS I T AK E CAPITA L GAI NS AND I TREAT THEM AS ORD INARY INCOME. NOT HING WRONG WITH THAT. IF YO U WANT TO DO THAT. BU T IF YOU' RE IN , AND I'D RAI SE T HE TAX BRACKET BAC K UP TO 39.6% FOR THE WEALTHIEST. IF YOU'RE IN THAT TAX BRACKET, YOU PAY 39.6% ON TH E CAPITAL GAINS INSTEAD OF 20%. THA T ALONE WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION, TH AT ONE TH ING. I'D RAISE THE C ORPORATE TAX RATE. I COM E FROM THE CORPORATE S TATE OF AMERICA. MO RE CORPORATIONS ARE INCORPORATE D IN MY STATE THAN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT'S NOT A JOKE. IT'S GIGANTIC. G UESS WHAT? BARACK AND I THOUG HT THESE CORPORATE TAX RATES S HOULD BE LOWERED FROM 38% TO 28%, BUT NOT TO 20%. SO IF YOU TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28%, WHI CH IS A RATIONAL PO SITION, T HAT RAISES ABOUT $720 BILLION. I' M NOT GOI NG TO GO THROUGH IT ALL. AND ENDING THE FOSSIL FUEL PRODUC TION TAX BREAK, THAT RAISES ABOU T $25 BILLION RIGHT OFF THE BAT . THERE' S A W HOLE RANGE OF THINGS. SO I PAY FOR E VERYTHING I CALL FOR, EVERYT HING I CALL FOR. AND ST ILL WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT IN THE PROCESS. BE CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED ALL THIS MO NEY TO PAY FOR THE THINGS I CA LL FOR IN HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ETC. SO THAT'S P ROBABLY MORE THAN YOU WA NTED TO KNOW. THERE'S A L OT MORE TO SAY, BUT YOU SHO ULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY. IF YOU HAVE , FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN GALE I NTRODUCED ME , YOU KNOW, LET M E SAY IT ANOTHER WAY. HOW MA NY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, IF YOU DON' T WANT TO ANSWER YOUR , YOU DON'T HAVE TO, OB VIOUS LY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHTER, H USBAND, WIFE, MOTHER, OR FATHER T O CANCER ?WERE FATHER , T O CANCER? RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T H AVE COVERAGE. A ND IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOU R HOUSE TO GET THE COVERAGE, HOW MANY HA VE , I WON'T GO THROUGH IT. ANYWAY, SO THERE'S A LOT WE CA N DO, AFF ORD TO D O, AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST DEAL. I ADMIRE TH E INTENTION OF MY FRIENDS WHO FOUGHT FOR MEDICARE FO R ALL, BUT THE MINIMUM NUMBER IS $ 30 TRILLION OVER 10, MO ST PEOPLE THINK IT'S $40 TRILLION, B UT THAT'S $3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. THAT'S MORE MONEY THAN WE SPEND ON EVERY SINGLE THING THE G OVERNMENT DOES. YOU COULD W IPE OUT THE PENTAGON, SATELLITES IN THE SKY, EVERYTHING. YOU CAN WIP E OUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIO N. YOU CAN WIP E OUT TH E ENTIRETY OF THE CIVI L SERVICE, WIPE IT ALL OUT. IT DOE SN'T ADD UP TO $ 3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORT ANT THING IN RUNNING AGA INST DONALD TRUM P IS WE HAVE TO HAV E TRUTH IN LENDING HERE. NO, N O, THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO AGAI NST THI S GUY, RUNNIN G AGAINST HIM, IS ASS ERT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ACCURATE OR SO PREPO STE ROUS TO GET DONE THAT HE'S ABLE TO HAVE A F IELD DAY. DON'T UNDERESTIMA TE. DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE THIS GUY. DON'T UNDERESTIMA TE HIM. HE BRAGS ABOUT AN EC ONOMY THAT IS GRO WING, AND IT IS G ROWING. EX CEPT IF Y OU'RE IN THE BOTTOM 96% OF THE COUN TRY. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: NO, NO, BUT LOOK, THE STOCK MARKE T IS AS HIGH AS IT HAS EVER BE EN. UNEMPLOYMEN T IS INCREDIBLY LOW. IT'S REAL. IT HA S GROW N. BUT THERE'S NO RATIONAL DISTRIBUTIO N OF THE GROWTH IN TERMS OF INCREASES IN INCOME AND OTHER T HINGS. I WILL ANSW ER QUESTIONS SHORTER NOW IF YOU ASK ME LESS COMPLICATED QUESTIONS. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: I LI KE THE PLAID CAP. >> WHA T ARE YO U LOOKING FOR IN QUALITIE S FOR A RUNNING MATE? MR. B IDEN: YOU AVAILABLE, SIR? [LAUGH TER] MR. BIDEN: LOOK, THE ONLY THING I KNO W A LOT ABOUT IS THE VICE PRESID ENCY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: AND ONE OF THE THIN GS THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT BY A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PR ESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS OF LATE, IS TH AT THEY ARGUE THAT THERE HAS N EVER BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT O R PRESIDENT CLOSER THAN BARACK AND I. NOW, THA T D IDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. W E DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER THAT WELL WHEN I T STARTED. I GOT TO KN OW HIM. AND WH EN HE MOVED HIS FAMILY TO WASHINGTON AFTER SOME TIME, I SET HIM U P WITH MY SON HUNT ER AND HIS FAMILY, AND THEY TA LKED AND BECAME FRIENDS. MI CHELLE BE CAME FRIENDS WITH MY DAU GHTER-IN-LAW. OUR GRANDDA UGHTERS, MY GRANDDAU GHTERS AND HIS DAU GHTERS A RE EACH OTHER'S BES T FRIENDS. MA ISIE, WHO IS A FRESHMAN AT PENN, AN D H IS DAUGHTER, S AME ONE WHO PIC KED MICHIGAN OV ER YALE, THEY' VE BEE N BEST FRIENDS SINCE GRADE SCHOO L BECAUSE THEY WENT TO GRADE SCHOO L TOGETHER IN A SMALL SCHOOL OF W ASHINGTON. SO, THEY BE CAME VERY CLOSE. BUT IT DIDN'T H APPEN ACCIDENTALL Y. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE AGREED A T THE FRONT-END T HAT WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER . AN D WHEN THE PRESIDENT I S ASKED BY HIS FRIEND FROM CHICAGO, WHAT IS IT LIKE HAV ING JOE AROUND, HE SAYS IT' S LIKE H AVING AN OLDER BROTHER. LI KE HAVING AN O LDER BROTHER WITH HIM. WHAT WE AGR EED ON, WHEN HE FIRST ASKED ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, I SAY THIS BECAUS E IT'S PUBLIC KNOW LEDGE N OW, IS THAT I SAID I DIDN'T WA NT TO BE VICE PRESID ENT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD HEL P HIM MORE BEING A SENIOR SENA TOR THAT HAD SOME INFLUENCE I N CONGRESS. AND I KNOW VICE PRESIDENTS ARE USUALLY STANDBY EQUIPMENT. I ASKED HIM , HE CAME BACK AND SAID TO MEE T WITH MY FAMILY ABOU T IT, A ND HE CAME BACK. HE KN OWS MY FAMILY WELL. TO MY SURPR ISE, MY DECEASED SON AND MY SON HUNTER STRONGLY AR GUED I SH OULD DO IT, AND THE COUP DE GRA CE WAS DELIVERED BY MY MOTHE R, WHO WAS THEN 92 YEARS OLD. SHE WO ULD N OT MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WITH US, BECAUSE WE WERE IN A FOUR B EDROOM HOUSE WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDPA. SH E WAS NOT GOING TO MO VE AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A ROOM FOR HER. THERE IS A LITTLE GARA GE THAT WE TURNED INTO A NICE APAR TMENT AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVEWA Y, AND SHE SAID THAT WAS OK. BUT AFT ER WE HAD THIS MEETING ON THE BACK PORCH, HE SAID GET BA CK TO ME IN 48 HOURS, OK, ABOUT W HETH ER I COULD BE VETTED A ND CHECK ME OUT, WITH 10 LAW YERS LOO KING AT ME, AS SOME ONE VERY TACTFU LLY SAID, LIKE A PUBL IC COLONOSCOPY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: SO WHAT HAP PENED WAS, WE WEN T THROUGH THIS MEETIN G FOR ABOUT O NE HOUR, A ND MY MOM , I WON THE GENE POOL. I HAD A MOM THAT EVERYONE WISHED COULD BE THEIR MO M. MY MOM HEARD EVERYONE'S CONFESSIONA L ALL THE TIME, LET US OUT, YOU HA D TO BE IN BY 12:00, AND IF MY M OM WAS IN CONFESSION WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS, SH E WOULD GO LIKE THIS , DON'T STOP, KEEP MOVING. SHO ULD I SI T, YOU HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING. SHE SAID JO EY, REMEMBER WHEN I CALLED YOU A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ASKED Y OU TO COME UP TO THE HOUSE, AND ASKED ABOUT BARACK, AND HE SAID HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY A ND BRILLIANT? I SAID, YEA H. SHE SAID, R EMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND T HEY DESEGREGATED THE ADJACEN T NE IGHBORHOOD AND SOLD A HOME, A R EA L ESTA TE GUY SOLD A HOME TO A N AFRICAN-AMERICAN COUPLE, AND PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING AT NIGHT, IT WAS IN THE SUMMER, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE, YOU WENT DOWN AND GOT ARRESTE D BY POLICE WERE STANDING ON THE PORC H WITH THE BLACK COUPLE? I S AID, YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT. SHE S AID, R EMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD A COUNT RY CLUB JOB, BUT WANTED TO W ORK AT THE CITY POOL AND BE THE ONLY WHITE EMPLOYEE IN THE PROJ ECT S? Y EAH, MOM. SHE SA ID, REMEM BER WHEN YOU HAD THAT GOOD J OB AT A LAW FIRM AND YOU BECAME A PU BLIC DEFENDER BE CAUSE THE CITY WAS OCCUPIE D? I SAID, YEA H, WHAT IS THE POINT? SHE SAID, L ET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, T HE FIRST AFRICAN-AME RICAN MAN IN HISTORY WHO HAS THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OFFERED YOU TO WORK FOR HIM AND YOU TOLD HI M NO? [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: DAMMIT ALL, MOM. TRUE STORY. [APP LAUSE] MR. BIDEN: BEST DECISION MY MOTHER E VER MADE FOR ME . THE POI NT WAS THIS. W E SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WHO TO PICK , THERE ARE S O MANY QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO BE PRESI DENT. WHO YOU PICK AS A VICE PRESIDENT, NO MATTER IF Y OU ARE 36 YEARS OLD, YOU SH OULD PICK SOMEONE WHO, IF GOD FOR BID SOMETHING HAPPENS, TH EY CAN STEP IN AND BECOME PRES IDENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VER Y QUALIFIED, BUT HERE IS THE COUP DE GRACE TH AT NEEDS TO BE HAD. WITH B ARACK AND I, WE KNEW WE WERE INT ELLECTUA LLY SIMPATICO ON THE ISSUES. WE DID NOT DIS AGREE FU NDAMENTAL LY ON ANY ISSUE, FOR REAL. WE DI SAGREED O N TACTIC, NOT SUBSTAN CE, AND WE WOUL D ARGUE LIKE HELL WITH O NE ANOTHER PRIVATELY. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, EVERYBODY KNEW, HE IS PRESIDENT, HE DECIDES. BU T HE WANT ED SOMEBODY WHO HAD A DIFFERING V IEW, WHO WOULD , IN , WHO W OULD C OME IN, IN HIS PHRA SE, ""NOT BE INTIMIDATED WHEN THEY W ALKED IN THE OVER OFFICE."" IT HAS TO B E SOMEONE WHO SHARES, IF I AM ELE CTED, MY VALUE SET AND MY PRIORITIES. OTHERWISE I T MAKES IT VERY HARD, BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL. THE D AYS OF PICKING SOMEONE TO BALANCE THE TICKET ARE THE DAYS TH AT ARE BASICALLY GONE BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENT IS SO IMMENSE, NO ONE WOMA N O R MAN CAN HANDLE THE JOB. TH EY H AVE TO DELEGATE SI GNIFICANT RESPONSIBIL ITY. NOT A JOKE. THE P RESIDENT DID THAT WITH ME, WH ETHER IT WAS DEALING WITH IRAQ O R WOR KING ON THE RECOVERY ACT, WHICH WAS $900 BILLION. WH EN HE GAVE ME AN ASSIGNME NT, HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORITY. I COULD HIRE AND FIRE, P ICK PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CABINET , DO EXACTLY AS IF I WERE T HE PRESIDE NT. FOR REAL. IT TA KES A LOT OF COURAGE FOR A PRESIDENT , HE HAS TO B E CONFIDEN T OR SHE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN GIVE SI GNIFICANT AUTHORITY A ND NOT HAV E THE PRESS SAY, SO AND SO IS DOING IT FOR HIM. BUT NO ONE EVER QU ESTI ONED WHETHER HE WAS BRILLIANT, THEY NEVER QUEST ION WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE AB LE TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY, IF I GET TO BE THE NOMI NEE, WHO IS SOMEBODY SIMPATICO, COMFORTABLE WITH ME, WI LL ARGUE AT ME AND HOLLER AT ME WHEN I DISAGREE, F OR REAL. THE O THER THING IS, W E AGREED WE WOULD ME ET FOR LU NCH ONCE A WEEK, AND EVERY SINGL E DAY, WHEN WE WERE IN SESSION AND BOTH IN THE COUNTRY, WE MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE MORN ING, EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT HAS TO BE S OMEONE, TH AT OLD EXPRESS ION, YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING BE TWEEN THE CUP AND THE LID. THERE ARE A LOT O F PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, NO T A JOKE, OF SEVEN WOMEN , OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. NOT A JOKE. WHO A RE CAP ABLE OF BEING PRESI DENT T OMORROW IF THEY STARTED OFF AS VICE PRESIDENT. I HAVE A CO UPLE IN YOUR STATE THAT ARE NO T BAD, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AFRICAN- AMERICANS, MALE AND FEMALE. AS YOU KNOW , I HAVE OVERWHELMIN G SUPPORT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF AFRICAN- AMERICANS WHO, IN COULD AN D I T WOULD BE PE OPLE B EING CONSI DERED BY ME AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BECOMES THE PRESIDE NT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A G REAT CADRE OF PEOPLE TO P ICK FROM, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF RE AL LY GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE. AND IT IS NOT A BAD TRAINING GROUND, BEI NG VICE PRESIDENT. SO THAT IS AS HONEST AS I CAN BE WITH YOU. I'M GO ING TO GO TO YES/NO. [LA UGHTER] >> THANK YOU, MR. NEXT PR ESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [AP PLAUSE] >> WE HAVE A C OMMON AND VERY GOOD F RIEND IN GREG. HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF M INE. HE SA YS TO SAY HELLO. THAN K YOU FOR COMING. THO SE CHILDREN UNDER 15, T HEY ARE OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND CHILDRE N. MR. BIDEN: THEY ARE YO URS? OH. >> AND WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR 46TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TODAY, MY WIFE AND MYSELF. [AP PLAUSE] >> AND HER NAM E IS JILL. THANK YOU, AND TH ANK YOU FOR BRINGING HOPE BACK T O THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE QUESTIO N I HAVE , LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT , [APPLAUSE] >> THE LEAST O F US WHO YOU HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FO R IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE GREA T HOPE IN OUR HEARTS. SPE AK A MIN UTE ABOUT THE NATIVE AMER ICANS A ND HOW DEEPLY THEY NEED OUR HE LP. MR. B IDEN: BY T HE WAY, FIRST OF ALL, MY SYMPATHI ES. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY S AYS TO JILL. EVERY BODY K NOWS, I AM KNOWN AS IN WASHINGTON, JILL HUSBAN D, AND I AM PR OUD OF IT. YOU HAV E TO BE REALLY PATIENT WITH GRANDP OPS. WE ARE DIFFICULT TO RAISE. F IRS T OF AL L, THEY ARE INDIAN NATIONS. OT HER THAN AFRICAN-AME RICANS, WHO WERE BR OUGHT OVER HERE I N CHAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF SLAVES S HIPS, MANY OF WHOM DIED BEFORE THEY GOT HERE , THAT IS THE ORIGINA L SIN OF THIS COUNTRY, THE STAIN O N OUR SOUL , WHAT WE HAVE DONE O VER THE YEARS TO THEY GOT HERE , THAT IS THE NATIVE AMERICANS H AS BEEN EQUALLY AS CONSEQUENTI AL. I LEARNED EARLY ON FROM A FELL OW WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND A WONDERFUL SENATOR WHO SUPPORT ED ME WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND HELPED RAISE ME A LITTLE BIT WAS A SENAT OR FROM HAWAII. AND SENATOR WHEN HE LEFT. THEY WERE G IANT SUPPORTERS OF INDIAN N ATI ONS, AND ANY TIME SOMEON E WOULD SAY, INDIANS, NA TIVE AMERICANS , NO, JOE, IN DIAN NATIONS. WH AT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM HAS BEEN DE VASTATING OVER THE YE ARS. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOME STA TES WHER E WE ARE, AND THAT IS MAYBE UP IN YOUR STATE A LIT TLE BIT AND IN MY STATE, IN DELAWARE , I S THAT THE CO MMITMENTS THAT HAVE B EEN MADE HAVE BEEN W ALKED AWAY FROM, A LOT OF THEM. ONE O F THE THIN GS I HAVE DONE IT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, WHEN I WROT E THE VIOLENCE AG AINST WOMEN ACT, WHAT I DID WAS C HANGED THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SAME PROCED URES THAT ARE AVAILABLE T O WOMEN IN INDIAN NATI ONS WHO ARE VICTIMIZED A LOT, BY T HE WAY, WHERE IF A MAN WALKED ON A ND ENGAGED IN A FORCED SE X WITH ANOTHER MAN, WHICH HAPPE NS ABOUT 4% OF THE TIME, T HEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRIED IN IN DIAN COURT. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY T O TRY IN THEIR COURTS, ON THEIR LA ND, IF IT IS ON THE LAND OF AN INDIAN NATION. WE HAVE TO FINALLY BEGIN TO MAKE GOO D O N WHAT WE SAID WE BELIEVED , THAT IN FACT IT WAS A CO MMITMEN T MADE, IF WE MOVED YOU AWAY AND DID ALL THESE THING S LIKE JACKSON DID YEARS AGO, THAT W E WOULD BEGIN TO TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT REPAR ATIONS, I AM TALKING ABOUT DEALI NG WITH WHAT CONTINUES T O BE BASICALLY SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT EXISTS FOR NOT ONLY TH E AFRICAN -AMERICANS, BUT ALSO FO R INDIAN AMERICANS. THANK YOU. YES, M A'AM? >> D O WE HAVE TIME FOR ON E MORE QUESTION? M R. BIDEN: CAN I TAKE A COUPLE MORE? ASK M E ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, MAN . IT IS THE N UMBER ONE ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] >> [INAUDIBLE] IF WE DO NO T STOP USING FOSSIL FUEL , MR. BIDEN: WE A RE ALL DEAD. >> WE ARE ALL DEAD. A NY OTHER I SSUE IS SE CONDARY TO THAT. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? MR. BIDEN: BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TELL HE REA LLY CARES ABOUT CLIMATE CHA NGE, BECAUSE I MENTION I T WHEN I START OFF, AND HE DOES NOT ASK A QUESTION, HE HOLDS UP A SIGN. IT IS THE E XISTEN TIAL THREAT THAT EXISTS . THERE ARE THREE T HINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT THA T I WOULD DO. THE FIR ST THING I WOULD DO IS IMMEDIAT ELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMA TE ACCORD. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: AND BY THE WAY, I HELP ED WITH THAT TOGETHER. I AM THE GUY WHO CONVINCED OUR TEAM TH AT CHINA WOULD JOIN BECAUS E I SPENT MORE TIME WITH XI JIN PING THAN ANYONE HAD AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED AT HAVING TO BE PART OF IT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD TAKE THE MOST EG REGIOUS , THE DEAL WHEN WE DID THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, EVE RY NATION THAT SIGNED UP WOULD IN FACT MOVE TO DEAL WITH C LIMAT E CHANGE AS SCIENCE DIC TATED IT. THEY AL L SET STANDARDS, WE SET STAN DAR DS ACROSS THE BOARD, AND IN THE MEANTIME, WE LEARNED THI NGS WERE EVEN MORE DANGER OUS. I WOULD CALL IN THE FIRS T 100 DAYS A MEETING WITH ALL THE MAJ OR P OLLUTERS IN THE WORL D, TO W ASHINGTON, D.C. TO UP THE COMM ITMENTS. THOSE WHO D ID NOT, THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITI ON WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD EXACT ECONOMIC PE NALTIES FOR FAILURE TO DO THAT. LOOK AT WHAT THE CH INESE ARE DOING NOW. THEIR BELT AND ROAD PR OPOSAL. T HEY ARE EXPORTI NG MORE DIRTY COAL AROUND THE WORLD I N THE NAME OF THEIR OWN I NTERESTS, BUT NOT DOING IT IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. TH EY WOULD BE HE LD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT UN DER THE ECONOMIC , RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE REAS ONS IT WORRIES ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE PRESIDE NT WALKING AWAY FROM OUR IN TERNATION AL RESPONSIBIL ITIES, YOU KNOW BE CAUSE YOU KNOW TH IS AREA THE , LARGEST CAR BON SINK IN THE WORLD IS TH E AMAZON, IN THE WORLD. I AM ONE OF T HE GUYS WHO CAME ALONG WITH THE PR OPOSAL YEARS AGO, DEBT FOR FO REST PRESERVATIO N. IN CASE YOU ARE MY BONA FIDES, YOU CAN CHECK L ATER FACT. I INTRODUCE D THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL AND IT WAS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER AND I PUSHED ON IT. WHEN WE DID THE RECOVERY ACT OF $990 BIL LION, WE PUT $100 BILLION IN BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF PRO DUCING SOLAR AND WIND, S O TH ERE IS NO RATIO NAL E T O BUILD COAL. THE POINT I S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, MORE CARBON FROM THE AI R, THE THING BREAK ING THROUGH AND CAUSING GLO BAL WARMING, IS ABSORBED IN THE AMAZON THAN IS EMITTED BY EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE DRI VEN OF A NY TYPE IN THE UNITED STAT ES OF AMERICA. IT IS BURNI NG. I HAVE BEEN PUSHING, NOT ALONE, BUT I HAVE BEEN PUSHING ALONG WITH JOHN KERRY, A BIG SUPPORTER A ND FRIEND OF MINE, PUSHING THAT WE SHO ULD BE SAYING T O BRAZIL, YOU HAVE GO T TO FIX IT AND WE WILL HEL P Y OU, PAY YOU TO STOP IT. NO T $2 BILLION. MO RE LIKE $40 BILLION. IF YOU DO NOT, YOU PAY ECONOMIC PRICE OR EV ERY OTHER EXPORT YOU HAVE, NO MATTER W HAT. THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCE S. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO , MA YBE WE CAN TALK , TELL ME WHE N I'M GOING TO MUCH. TH E SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO, RIGH T O FF THE BAT IMMEDIATELY, IN 2021, JA NUARY, WHEN I SAY JOIN AN D REJOIN THE PARIS ACCOR D, I INTRODUCE D THE PROPOSA L, WE GET TO Z ERO MISSIONS BY 2050. SO ME PEOPLE HAVE 2049 AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 2030. IF YO U ARE A S CIENTIST, YOU KNOW IT IS VIRTU ALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THERE I N 20 30. WE ONLY MAK E UP 15% OF THE PROB LEM. YOUR FOREST IS STILL GO ING TO FIND INSECT S AND EVERGREENS THE SUMMER. YOU R WINTER S WILL GET WARMER. YOU WILL SE E POLLUTION AND THE WATER SUPPL Y. THE SHORE TAKING OUT A LAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING. YOUR WINTER S WILL GET WARMER.85% OF THE PROB LEM IS OVER THERE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT R EQUIRES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW T O BRIN G TOGETHER THE WORLD. NOT A JOKE. BE ABLE TO HAVE A F OREIGN-POLICY VISION THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN ARE T RUSTED SO ON DAY ONE, THE NEXT PRESID ENT WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAK E COMMAND OF THE WORLD STAGE . WHEN HE OR SHE SPEAKS, THE WORLD WILL KNOW WHO THAT PE RSON IS AND KNOW THAT P ERSON THOSE WHO THEY ARE, W HAT THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE. WHAT T HEY ARE LIKE. SO YO U CAN DEMAND CERT AIN STANDARDS ARE KEPT. WE CAN DO I T BUT WE HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE BUSINESS. W E ARE THE LEADER NOT ONLY OF THE FREE WORLD, THE LEADER OF T HE WORLD. IN THIS EFF ORT. WHEN WE SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CL IMATE CHANGE, AND WE ALREADY DEFORESTED OUR LAND OV ER THE LAST 300 YEARS AND H AVE DONE WELL BY IT, AND THE RES T OF THE WORLD SAYS YOU KEEP IT UP, COME ON. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE HARD. REALL Y HARD. THE T HIRD THING WE HAVE TO DO IS SET DOWN GUIDE RAILS NOW. BETWEE N THE YEARS 2021 AND 2030, IT IS IRREVERSIBLE THE PATH WE HAVE SET OURSELVES ON. GETTING RID OF SUBSIDIE S FOR FOSSIL FUEL . NUMBER TWO, HOLDING THEM RELIAB LE FOR WHAT TH EY HAVE DONE, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSER VED NEIGHBORHOO DS. AND WHEN TH EY DO NOT, PUT THEM IN JAIL. I AM NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: RIGH T NOW, WE HAD A PROGRAM WHE RE WE GI VE A TAX CREDIT FOR DOING T HE RIGHT THING . FOR EXAMPLE , TH IS BUILDI NG , THIS CITY-OWNED BUILDING I ASSUME? THE CITY WO ULD BE ABLE TO BORROW MONE Y AND GET DIRECTED TO , DIREC T AID TO REPL ACE ALL THE WINDOWS. AN D THE DOORS AND INSULAT ION SO YOU ARE NOT EMITTING FROM THE BUILDIN G HEAT OR AIR CONDITI ONING, COSTING MUCH MORE M ONEY. IF W E TOOK EVERY PUBLIC AND FEDERAL BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY, WH ICH THE PLAN ST ARTED OFF DOING BEFOR E THEY TANKED IT, WE COU LD REDUCE THIS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL TO BE CONSUMED EV ERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER ENERGY CONS UMING IT. WE SHOULD TERM FARMER , TURN FARMERS INTO THE NET ZER O EMITTERS IN THE WORLD. SIGN IFICANT CONSERVATION PROPERTY, H AVING THEM PLANT DEEPE R ROOTS TO ABSORB THE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. BIOFUE LS IS THE NEAR-TERM T RANSITION. WE CAN DO SO MUCH. TH E F IRST THING I WOULD DO IS REESTABL ISH MILE STANDA RDS. EIGHT BILLION GAL LON BARRELS OF OIL. AUTO C OMPANIES AGREED TO I T. I CALL FOR EVERY NEW I NFRAST RUCTURE HAS TO BE G REEN. SO W E DO NOT BUIL D TO WHAT IT IS BEFORE, BUT WHAT IT IS NOW. I MEAN THIS SINCER ELY. I HAVE GONE ON TOO MUCH . I WILL STOP WITH THIS. MAKE SURE THAT, I WANT TO INSTALL 550,000 CHA RGING STATIONS ON ALL OF OUR HIGHWAYS. W E SHOULD O WN THE EV MARKET OF ELECTRONIC VEHICLES. E XPERTS POI NT OUT ON MY PLAN THAT WE CAN CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. S ERIO US JOB S, NOT $15 AN HOUR. $45 A N HOUR BEF ORE YOU START TALKI NG ABO UT BENEFITS. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD HAS E VER TAKEN A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY . THIS OPPORT UNITY IS GIGANTIC. T HE LAST TH ING I WILL SAY , I WI LL TALK A ND GIVE YOU THE WHO LE PLAN IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. WHAT WE SHO ULD B E DOING IS DE ALING WITH THIS IN A WAY THAT IT IS. IT I S AND EXI STE NTIAL THREAT, NOT A JOKE. IF WE DO NO T MAKE CHANGE , WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE. THE PLANET IS I N TROUBLE. IT IS REAL. HUNDREDS OF SPECIES ARE GONE AND WILL NO T COME BA CK. DELAW ARE IS THREE FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. NOT A JOKE. IN 15 YEARS, A LOT OF THEM WILL BE GON E. THE L AST THING I WILL SAY, WHEN PRESID ENT OBAMA AND I GOT ELECTED , TH E FIRST WEEK OR 10 DAYS, WE WE RE INVITED TO THE PENT AGON TO THE MOST SECRETIVE PLACE IN TH E PENTAGO N, BELOW GROUND, COM PLETELY SECURE, AND THE JOINT CHIEF S WANTED TO TELL US WHAT THE GR EATEST THREAT TO OUR SECURITY WA S. YOU KNOW WH AT THEY SAID? CLIMATE CHA NGE. THE MILITAR Y, CLIMATE CHANGE. THE Y PUT TH E MAPS ON THE WALL. I F WE DO NO THING AND THE SEA LEVEL R ISES TWO F EET, Y OU WILL HAVE MILLIO NS OF PEOPLE MIGRATING F ROM ALL THE ISLANDS IN THE SOUT H PACIF IC, ACROSS THE WORLD. YOU SAW WHA T HAPPEN ED IN DARFUR.

TH E MOST POWERFUL AND MOST EN LIGHTENED LEADER IN T HE WORLD AT TH E TIME, ANGELA MERKEL. HER PARTY GOT CLOBBERED. IT IS FEAR. A LOT IS AT STAKE. I WI LL GIVE YOU A COPY OF T HE WHOLE P LAN, AND THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: I KN OW YOU HAVE TO GO AND I 'M SUPPOSED TO GO. IF Y OU ASK ME AN EASY QUESTION, IF YOU GIVE ME SOM ETHING, I WILL TRY AND DO IT I N 25 WORDS OR LESS. YOU, MA'AM, GIVE HER TH E MIC. >> WHA T IS YOUR PLAN F OR ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE? [ APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: THAT IS REALLY IMPO RTANT. WHEN I SAID THE SOUL OF THE NATION, THINK ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT OUR SOUL WH EN YOU SEND YOUR C HILD OR GR ANDCHILD OFF IN FIRST OR SECOND O R THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE, AND THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND CO VER. BUIL DING NEW SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN HIDE BE HIND THEM IN CAS E A SHOOTER S HOWS UP. THE GENERAT ION THAT IS MOS T UNEASY AND HAS THE GRE ATEST AN XIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA IS THE Z GENERATION, AGES 7-17. KNOW WHAT T HE GREATEST FEAR IS? GETTING SHO T IN SCHOOL. TAL K ABOUT A SICK SOUL. I AM THE ON LY GUY WHO HAS EVER BEATEN THE NRA NATIONALLY. I HAVE BEAT EN THEM TWICE. I GO T THE B RADY BILL PASSED. BAC KGROUND CHECKS. I AM THE GU Y WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEA PONS BAN PASSED. I C OULD ONL Y GET IT FOR 10 YEARS AND I T HAD TO BE RENEWED. BE CAUSE OF SOME HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA, A GUY NAMED BUSH LET IT EXPI RE. YOUR STATE AND MINE, A LOT OF HUNTERS, THAT IS FINE. BU T A NYBODY WHO NEEDS A MAGAZINE WI TH 100 RO UNDS IN IT, YOU SHOULD NOT BE HUNTING. YO U ARE A DANGER TO YOURSELF. N OT A JOKE. ANYBO DY THAT NEEDS AN AR-15, T HERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DEER WEARING A KEVLAR VEST. MY DE CEASED SON AND MY SON WERE BIRD H UNTERS. TH ERE IS BIG BIRD HUNTIN G IN THE DELAWARE PENINSULA. I HAVE A 12 GAUGE SHOTGUN. THEY ARE LO CKED UP. YOU LOCK TH EM UP. WE'RE T HE ONLY COUNTRY, TH E ONLY INDUST RY IN THE NATION NOT ABLE TO BE SUED, THE GUN MANUFACTURE RS. HOW WOULD T HAT HAVE BEEN THE CASE WH EN I WAS PUSHING TO GO AFTER THE PHARMACEUTI CAL COMPANIES FOR OPIOIDS ? BE CAUSE WE WERE ABLE T O SUE THEM FOR TH E DAMAGE THEY WERE D OING, WE W ERE ABLE TO CHANGE T HE WHOLE THING AND IT IS STILL CHANGING. Y OU CAN'T DO THAT WIT H GUN MANUFACTURE RS. ONE OF MY OBJEC TIVES, I WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. THERE ARE EVEN DE MOCRATS VOTED TO GI VE EXEMPTIONS TO GUN MANUFACTURE RS. BUT I WILL WORK LIKE HELL TO TRY TO E LIM INATE THAT EXEMPT ION. LASTLY, WE TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. THE FACT IS WE HAVE THE , TECHN OLOGY NOW. THAT T HE ON LY PERSON WHO CAN PULL TH E TRIGGER ON ANY WEAPON WOULD BE ONE WHOS E BIOMETRIC M ARKER MATC HED WHAT THE GUN WAS SOLD TO . IT IS J AMES BOND STUFF BUT IT IS REAL AND IT EXISTS. OUT IN SILI CON VALLEY, AND MET WITH THIS GROUP OF EXPERTS ON HOW THEY COULD DO THAT. IT CA ME ALO NG AND THEY CAME UP WITH SEVERA L PISTOLS THAT DO THAT. THEY STARTE D TO SELL THEM AND ADVERTI SED THAT WAY. YOU'RE NOT VIOLATING ANYONE'S SE COND AMENDMENT RIGHT. IF I'M ABLE TO BUY THE GUN ON A BACKGR OUND CHECK, I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO FIRE THE GUN. BE CAUS E LOO K WHAT HAPPENED UP IN CONNE CTICUT . THE MOM HAD THE GUN AND THE KID PICKED IT UP. HE WOUL D NOT HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK. THERE IS NO VIOLATION O F THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO SAY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE A GUN. CERTAIN GUNS, NOT E VERY GUN. WHAT H APPENS? THEY PUT TH EM IN STORES AND THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURE RS SAID IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THE M, WE WILL BOYCOTT YOUR STORES AND PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS . S O THEY'RE NOT ON THE SHEL VES AT ALL NOW. WHAT I S GOING ON? THIS IS WRONG. THER E ARE SO MANY AVENUES WE CAN GO WITH OUT VIOLATING ANYONE'S BA SIC RIGHT. TO O WN A GUN. FOR TH OSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A GROUP WHO SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WIT H THE BLOOD O F PATRIOTS, YOU NEED A FIGHTER JET IF YOU WILL PROTEC T YOURSELF AGAINST THE GOVERNM ENT. YOU NEED SOMETHING A LOT MORE IF THAT IS THE RATIONALE. EXTREME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT THE REASON WHY THE SECOND AMEN DMENT E XISTS IS SO WE CAN DEFE ND OURSELVES AGAINST THE GOVERNM ENT. YOU NEED A COUPLE OF FLAMETHROWE RS. ALL KIDDING ASI DE. THESE PEOPLE TELL ME YOU CANNOT LIMI T THE TYPE OF WEAPONS. CA N ANYONE HERE, LIKE THEY DID WITH A FORMER DUPONT GUY, WELL, YOU W ANT TO TAKE ON THE GOVERNMENT, YOU BETTER GET A PERSONNEL CARRIER OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL NOT DO IT WITH AR-15. WE H AVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE G UN AND THAT IS THE LAW. YOU CA NNOT OWN A MACHI NE GUN OR BAZOOKA. I KNOW IT SOUNDS S ILLY, BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CA NNOT SAY THERE ARE C ERTAIN TYPES OF WE APONS YOU CANNOT OWN IS NOT AT A LL INCONSI STENT WITH THE SE COND AMEN DMENT. FROM THE BEGINNI NG, FROM THE BEGINNI NG, EVERY SINGL E AMEN DMENT OF THE CONS TITUTION HAS AN EXCEPTIO N. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IF ANYONE STOO D UP AND YELLED FIRE, WE CO ULD PUT YOU IN JAIL WITH PEOPLE RUNN ING OUT OF FEAR OF PEOPLE GETT ING HURT AND THERE IS NO FIRE. YO U DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH T O YELL FIRE. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM IF YOU ARE A CONVI CTED FELON OR TERRORIS T T O GO BUY A WEAPON. PER IOD. ONE REASONS WHY, AND TH IS IS THE BEST WA Y TO CONCLUDE IT, I TALK ABOUT THE V IOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I WROT E THA T, I DID IT MYSELF. IT TOOK FOU R YEARS TO GET IT PASSED. IT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON C HANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. EVERY SEVER AL YEARS IT HAS TO BE REAUTHOR IZED. THE HOUSE P ASSED OVERWHELMIN GLY, IT IS SITTING IN THE SENATE. WHY ? IT CUT S OUT WHAT THEY CALL THE BOYFRIE ND EXCEPTION. THE BIGGEST FIGHT I HAD TO GE T IT REAU THORIZED THE SECOND TIME WAS TH AT IF YOU WERE THE SUBJECT OF ABUSE BY A HUSBAND OR SOMEONE YOU LIVE WITH, AND THAT PERSON WAS CONVICTED, THEY COULD NOT O WN A G UN, A WEAPON. WHA T HAPPENED WAS THEY WORKED OUT AN EXEMPTION, THE BOYFRIE ND EXEMPTION. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHIL D WITH A PERS ON BEATING YOU UP, OR YOU DO NOT LIVE WITH HIM, THAT P ERSON CAN OWN A WEAPON. T HE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN WH O A RE KIL LED BY THEIR ABUSERS ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. KNOW W HAT THE GREATEST LO SS OF LIFE IS WITH A GUN? SUICID E. OV ER 20% OF ALL PEOP LE WHO DIE BECAUSE OF A BULLET AR E PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AN D WE SAY WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE POLICE TO KNOW WHETHE R OR NOT SOMEONE HAS A SERIOUS M ENTAL ILLN ESS THAT MAYBE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A WEAPON? IT IS NOT AN EASY PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE RIGH T OF PRIVACY, BUT THAT IS WHY WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ALONG THE V IOLENCE AGAINST WOM EN ACT TO BE P ASSED AND REAUTHORIZED AND WE WILL LOSE ENORMOUS PR OTECTIONS , IT HAS CUT DOWN BY WELL OVE R 60% OVER THE AGE OF 30. THE REP ORTS ARE WAY UP. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD. TH E NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURE RS ARE MUCH TO O POWERFUL AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT A RATIONAL RE ADING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I TAUGHT CO NSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR 22 YEARS. I PR OMISE YOU. THEY DON'T. THANK YOU FOR BEING H ERE. I APPRECIATE IT. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE] MR. BIDEN: THAN K YOU, MAN.

MY FATHER-IN-L AW MADE A STEP LADDER FOR HIM TO GET ON TO THE BED, BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE THE VERTICAL LEAP TO MAK E IT ON HIS OWN. IF WE DON'T PUT HIM ON THE BED, HE WIL L CRY ALL NIGHT. ANYW AY, WE HAD A GREAT CHRISTMAS H OLIDAY. SO THRILLED IN THE MIDD LE OF THE HOLIDAY S AND SOME INTERESTING FOOTBALL GA MES ON TELEVISION. YOU'RE ALL SPENDING , THAT IS ALL I WILL SAY ABOUT FOOTBALL THIS EVENIN G, I PROMISE. SO GLAD TO BE HERE WITH YOU. REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF OUR COUN TRY. AND THE ROLE THAT IOWA I S GOING TO PLAY IN 37 SHORT DAYS IN DECIDING THE TRAJECTORY OF THE NOMI NATION, AND THEREFORE, THE REPUBLI C AND, THEREFORE, THE WORLD. NO P RESSURE. I CAN TELL HOW SE RIOUSLY IOWANS TAKE THIS RESPON SIBIL ITY. HOW SERIOUS LY YOU TAKE THE POWER THAT COMES WITH THAT THUMB ON THE SCALE T HAT YOU HAVE. AND S EEING US CANDIDAT ES COME THROUG H FOR THE BET TER PART OF THE LAST YEAR O R SO, KICKING THE TIRES O N OUR POLI CY PLANS. REME MBER THE FIRST TIME WE CAME THROUG H AND HER THINGS LIKE YOU ARE IN MY TOP SEVEN. LET' S SEE HOW YOU DO. I WANT TO SEE YOU SPEAK SIX MORE TIMES AND THEN WE WILL SEE. I CAN TELL NOW WE ARE GETTING TO DECISION TIME, THE MOMENT THAT IOWANS WHO TAKE THAT RESPON SIBILITY SO SERIOUSL Y ARE DECIDING HOW TO USE THAT RE SPON SIBILITY TO SET THE RIGHT COURSE. I A M HERE TO ASK FOR YOU TO CAUCUS FOR ME ON THAT DAY CO MING IN FEBRUARY FOR THIS SI MPLE REAS ON , TO HELP ME CRE ATE AN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE THAT IS DEF INED NOT BY EXCLUSIO N BUT BY THE LONG ING FOR EVERYON E IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE REA DY FOR THAT. WHICH IS GOOD. BE CAUSE THE GREAT THING ABOUT THAT FUTURE IS WE CAN START BUILD ING IT EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST V OTE IS CAST. I'M G OING TO SHARE A LOT WITH YOU AB OUT HOW I ENVISION USING THE P OWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY TO CHANGE T HE POLICY OF THIS COUNTR Y TO MAKE OUR LIVES BETTE R, BUT THE FIRST THING WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS UNIFY THIS COUNTRY AROUND THAT SENSE OF BE LONGIN G THAT CALLS OUT TO EVERYBODY AND LETS TH EM KNOW WHERE THEY FIT IN THE FUTU RE. AND WE CAN DO THAT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN. T HE FACT THAT YOU AR E HERE MEANS WE ARE ALREADY DOI NG IT. SO, THANK YOU FOR WHA T YOU ARE BUILDING FOR ALL OF US. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO NEED THAT, NOT ONLY TO EARN A BIG WIN ON CAUC US N IGHT, NOT ONLY TO EARN THE NO MINATION AND EARN THE ELECTIO N AN D THE PRESIDENCY ITSELF, BUT WE ARE GOING TO NEED IT MORE THAN EVER THAT NEXT DAY. T HAT FIRST DAY I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT I ASKED VOTERS TO PICTURE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PICTURE IN HIS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN TO CLOS E YO UR EYES IF YOU WANT. THAT DAY THE SUN COMES UP OVER DES MOINES AND THE REST OF THIS COU NTRY AND DONALD TRUMP IS NO LONGE R THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LOUD CHEERING] M AYOR BUTTIGIEG: THAT DAY WI LL COME. WE'RE GOING TO BRING TH AT DAY ABOUT AND MAKE SURE I T COMES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, RIGHT? BUT THEN WHAT? [LAUG HTER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: THEN COMES THE HARD PA RT. THINK ABOUT HOW I T IS GOING TO FEEL THAT DAY. Y ES, WE WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE THIS PRESIDENCY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR, NO QUESTION. N O MORE THE CORRUPTION, NO MORE TWE ETS EMANATING FROM THE OVAL OFFICE THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT . PUTT ING IT AWAY WILL BE GOOD. BUT T HEN THINK ABOUT HOW IT IS GOING TO FEEL. OUR C OUNTRY WILL BE DIVIDED. OU R COUNTRY WILL BE HURTING. OU R COUNTRY WILL BE EXHAUSTE D F ROM FIGHTING EVEN MORE T HAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW. YOU JU ST THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN EVERYTHING WE ARE ABOUT T O GO THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN CALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING, THAT WILL N EVER HAPPEN, BUT WHO CAN CALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AS ONE NATION. AND THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM S WE ARE STIL L GOING TO HAVE ON THAT DAY. THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL BE UP AGAINST. TH AT DAY THAT SUN CO MES UP, IT'LL B E COMING UP O VER A CLIMATE T HAT IS CHANGING SO QUICKLY WE ARE JUST A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM THE POINT O F NO RETURN. IT WILL BE COM ING UP OVER SCHOOL S WHERE KIDS ARE BEING DRILL ED IN ACTIVE SHOOTER TRA INING BE FORE THEY HAVE LEARNED HOW TO READ. IT'S GOING TO BE COMING UP OVER AN ECO NOMY WHERE IT IS NO LONGER POSS IBLE ANYWHERE IN ANY COUNTY OF T HE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME A T MINIMUM WAGE TO AFFORD A TW O-BEDROOM APARTMENT. SO, THINGS WILL STILL BE SO TROUBLED IN THIS COUNTRY. TH ERE WILL STILL BE SOMETHIN G VERY WRONG IN THE HEART O F THAT WOMAN BEHIND THE WHEEL WHO S AW A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND A 12-YE AR-O LD BOY AND SAI D I AM GOING TO HURT THEM BECAUS E THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE ME. THAT IS THE WORK WE ARE GOING TO NEED THE NEXT PRESIDENT T O DO. TO RISE TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES WITH BIG POLICY IDEAS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S GOIN G TO SERVE TO UN IFY AND N OT DIVIDE THE AMERICA N PEOPLE. THE GOOD NE WS IS THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF JOB THE PRESIDENCY IS FOR. IT IS NOT TO GLORIFY THE PRESIDE NT. IT IS TO EMPOWER, UNIFY, AND HEAL TH E AMERICAN PEOPLE. THA T IS WHAT I WANT TO U SE THAT OFFICE FOR WITH YOUR H ELP. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: THAT IS WHAT A PRESIDENT CAN DO. TO CALL THIS COUNTRY TO ITS HIGHEST VALUES, VAL UES THAT HAVE BEEN W ITH US ALL ALON G AND THAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST WHEN WE LOOK TO AND ALLOW T HOSE VALUES TO GUIDE OUR STEPS. BUT WE GOT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THOSE VALUES REQU IRE OF US BECAUSE IT IS NOT A LWAYS OBVIOUS. TAKE PATRIO TISM. RESPECT FOR THE FLAG. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT R EQUIRES OF US. AND THEY ARE NO T BEING MET BY A MILITARY PARADE OR A PRESIDENT WHO THUMPS HIS CHEST. MOST CERTAINLY NOT BEING HONOR ED BY THE DECISION TO OVERTHRO W M ILITARY JUSTICE AND PARDON WAR CRIMINALS AS IF THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A W AR CRIMINA L AND IT HONORABL E S ERVICE NUMBER OF U NITED STATES OF A MERICA. TH AT'S NOT PATRIOT ISM. NOW, I'M HE RE TO TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF PAT RIOTISM, ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THE MOST IM PORT ANT THING WE CAN DO TO HONOR TH E FLAG IS TO HONOR THE V ALUES IT STANDS FOR. THAT T O RECOGNIZE THE PATRIOT ISM, FOR EXAMPLE , AND THE SPIRIT OF THOSE WHO GO BEFO RE CONG RESS AND PUT THE IR CAREERS ON THE LINE TO TES TIFY ABOUT WRONG DOING BECAUSE THA T IS AN ACTIVE LOYALTY TO THE REPU BLIC FO R WHICH IT STANDS. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: I'M TALKING ABOUT A PATRIOTIS M AND A LOVE OF COUNTRY THAT BEGINS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR CO UNTRY IS MADE OF PEOPLE, AND YOU CAN'T LOVE OF PEOPLE I F YOU HATE HALF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN IT. SO, WHAT DOES IT MEA N TO LIVE UP TO LOVE OF COUNTRY? WHAT DOES I T REQUIRE? IT CERTAINLY REQUIRES WE KEEP THIS C OUNTRY SAF E FROM ALL ENEMIES FOR EIGN AND DOMESTIC. I T REQUIRES MAKING SURE THAT ABROAD WE SEE TO IT THAT ANY ALLY OR WOULD BE ALLY NEVER QUEST IONS WHETHER IT IS A GOOD IDEA T O BET YOUR LIFE ON THE CREDIBI LITY OF THE UNITED STAT ES, BECAUSE WE WILL BE A COUNTRY T HAT KEEPS ITS WORD TO ENE MIES AND ALLIES ALIKE. THAT IS HOW WE PROTECT OUR COUNTRY ABR OAD. [CHEERS] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: AND PROTECT ING OUR COUNTRY, THAT MEANS PROTE CTING EACH OTHER. THAT STARTS RIGHT HERE AT HOM E. IT IS AS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SE CURITY THAT WE MUS T SEE TO IT THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT C AN NEVER BE CONFUSED FOR AN EXCU SE TO D O NOTHING AT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING OUR COMMUNI TIES AND OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CHURCHE S. AND OUR SHO PPING CENTER SAFE FROM G UN VIOLENCE TH AT IS NATIONAL SE CURITY. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT PROTE CTING OUR COUNTRY AND SERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND O UR FUTURE, THAT IS LIK E SO MUCH DEPENDS , WHAT IS WHY SO MUCH DEPENDS ON US RISIN G TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS THE GLOB AL SECURITY TH REAT OF OUR TIME AND LE ADING THE WORLD AND D OING SOMET HING ABOUT IT, AND HOW PROUD W E WOULD BE IF WE DID BECA USE THE WORLD NEEDS US RIGHT NO W TO TAKE ON CLIMATE CHA NGE. SO THAT'S WHERE A VAL UE LIKE LOVE O F COUNTRY LEADS ME AND WILL BE MY PRESIDENCY. I'M TALKING ABOUT VALUES. I'M TALKING ABOUT VALUES THAT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE USED TO PIT US A GAINST EACH OTHER, LIKE FAITH. FIRS T OF ALL, THIS IS A COUNTR Y THA T WAS BUILT ON THE IDEA THAT OUR CONSTITUTION AND OUR GOV ERNM ENT BELONG TO P EOPLE OF EVERY RELIGION AN D OF NO RELIGION EQUALLY. IT IS IN TH E CONSTITUTION. NOW, IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT WE CAN CALL OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE GUIDED BY FAITH TR ADITIONS AND OFFER A CHOICE, A ND THE CHOICE IS I S , DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A WHITE HOU SE THAT YOU CAN TURN ON THE NEWS AN D SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO AND N OT HAVE TO SCRATCH YOUR HEAD OR SHA KE YOUR HEAD AND SAY WHATEVE R HAPPENED TO ""I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU FED ME? I WA S A STR ANGER AND YOU WELCOME D ME? WHAT YO U HAVE DONE FOR THE LEA ST OF THESE YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME ."" GOD DOES NOT BELONG TO A POLITI CAL PARTY IN THE UNIT ED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: VALUES LIKE DEMOCRACY THAT THAT FLAG H AS ALWAYS STOOD FOR WHEN WE HAV E BEEN AT OUR BEST. BEING SERIO US ABOUT DEMOCRACY , YOU NEED SO ME HELP? CAN WE GET SOME HELP T O SOMEBODY, RIGHT THAT WAY? THANK YOU. WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A DEMOCRACY, THAT MEANS LIVING UP TO THE VALUES OF D EMOCRACY. NOT JUST DEMOCR ACY AS A SYSTEM. BUT DEMOCRACY A S A WAY OF LIFE. THAT MEANS SEEIN G TO IT THAT POWER IN THIS COUNTR Y IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE, THAT OUR OFFICIA LS ARE ACCOUNT ABLE FOR. THAT IS WHAT KEE PS OUR GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR US RATHER THAN THE OT HER WAY AROUND. YOUR VOTE IS WHA T KEEPS YOUR GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR YOU AND NOT THE OTH ER WAY AROUND. SO, LET'S SEE TO IT T HAT EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED AND EVERY VOTER COUNT S AND PASS A 21ST CENTURY VOTING RIGH TS ACT TO MAKE SURE VOTER SUPPR ESSION OF ANY KIND IS NOT TOLE RATED IN THE UNITED STATES OF A MERICA. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT DISTR ICTS BEING DRAWN AROUND THIS COUNTR Y BY POLITICIANS WHO GET TO PICK OUT VOTERS, INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY R OUND. IF W HAT IT REQUIRES TO END CITIZEN S UNITED IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, THEN THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THEY THOUGHT UP THE PROCESS. LE T'S THINK BIG AND PROTECT OUR DEMOCRA CY. THINKING ABOUT VALUES LIKE FREEDO M AND THIS IS ALL ABOU T FREEDOM, BUT FREEDOM IS BIGGER AND MORE COMPLICATED THAN CUTTIN G EVERY TAX A REGUL ATION. THAT IS NOT GOING T O MAKE US FREE. FR EED OM REQUIRES A GREAT DEA L FROM US. AND PAR T OF IT, YES, GE TTING GOV ERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN GOVERN MENT IS IN THE WRONG PLACES. WE NEED TO KEEP GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF, FOR EXAMPLE, CO UNTY CLERK'S TELLING YOU WHO YOU OUGHT TO MARRY. THANK YOU, IOWA, FOR YOUR HAND AND BRINGING MA RRIAGE EQUALITY TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. RE SPECTING AMERICAN FR EEDOM MEA NS KEEPING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE BUSI NESS OF DICTATING TO WOMEN WH AT THEIR REPRODUCTIV E HEALTH CARE CHOICES OUGHT TO BE . THAT FR EEDOM BELONGS WITH YOU. BUT SO METIMES IT MEANS IN SISTING T HAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR STEP UP. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE LOC AL GOVER NMENT, THAT IS WHY WE HAVE MAYORS . YOU ARE NOT FRE E IF THERE IS NOT A CLEAN , SAFE, PLOWE D ROAD BETWEE N WHERE YOU A RE AND WHERE YOU NEED TO GET TO. YOU ARE NOT FREE, I F YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU'R E GOING TO GO GET A GLASS OF SAFE DRINKING WA TER. BY M AKING C ERTAIN THINGS AVAI LABLE. A SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WHO BELIEVE S IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SUPPORT S AM ERICA'S TEACHERS. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO STEP UP IN THE PUBL IC SECTOR AND DELIVER HEA LTH CARE , BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FRE E IF YOU DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. T HAT IS THE IDEA OF MEDICARE FOR ALL WHO WANT IT. GIVE EV ERYBODY A PUBLIC OPTION, BUT I TRUST YOU TO DECIDE W HETHER YOU WANT IT. THE IMPORTA NT THING IS TO SEE TO IT ONE W AY OR THE OTHER THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNINSURED AMERICAN, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. [CHEERI NG] MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: SO, YOU SEE HOW THESE V ALUES CAN LEAD US FOR WARD AT THIS MOMENT THAT IS COM ING UP WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE FAS T. THERE 'S A SENSE OF URGENCY HERE. WE CA N'T 10 YEARS, CAN' T WAIT FOUR Y EARS. WE C ANNOT WAIT TO TAC KLE THESE PROBL EMS , CLIMATE CHA NGE CAN'T WAIT. THE D EADLINES ARE NOT BEI NG SET BY CONGRESS. I T IS BEING SE T BY EARTH. IT WILL COME AND GO WITHOUT US IF WE DO NOT ACT. WE CAN NOT WAIT TO TAKE STEPS TO SEE TO I T THAT OURS IS A COUNTRY WHE RE YOUR RACE HAS NO BEARING ON YOUR HEA LTH OR YOUR WEALTH OR Y OUR REL ATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT . THAT IS WHA T THE PLAN IS ABOUT. WE C AN'T WAIT TO DO SOMETHING A BOUT THE C RISIS OF DEATHS FROM DESPAI R IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT ME ANS THAT JUST AS MUCH ATTENT ION AND JUST AS MUCH OPEN DISCUS SION AS WE GIVE TO PHYSICAL MEDICAL ISSUES MUST NOW BE THER E FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ISSUES, TOO. LET'S BRING IT INTO THE SUNLIGH T AN D LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AN D LET'S F IX IT. NOW. IS SUE AFTER ISSUE, WE C AN'T WAIT. WE GO T TO ACT NOW. AN D, WHEN WE DO, WE HAVE THE OPPORTU NITY TO BRING TOGETHER THIS NEW AM ERICAN MAJORITY MAKING SURE WE DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT WE GOT TO DO I T TOGETHER. N OT THAT WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT THE PRESIDENCY IS SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO ALL OF US, IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED TO CALL IN EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE THAT BETTER FUTURE. YES, WE ARE CALL ING OUT TO PROGRESSIVES, WE ARE CALL ING OUT TO MODERATE S. I'M MEETING AN AWFUL LOT OF FUTURE F ORMER REPUBLICANS WHO ARE READY T O BE PART OF THAT CHANGE . THA T'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO WIN. BUT MO RE IMPORTANTLY, THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO GOVERN. WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS TOGETHER. T HERE IS GOT A BE A FIGHT, WE WILL HAVE A FIGHT. WE C AN'T BE FIGHTING SO MUCH THA T IT GETS TO WHERE FIGHTING IS ALL WE HAVE GOT. THE PO INT IS WHAT LIES ON THE OTHER S IDE OF THE FIGHT, AND THAT IS BETTER LIFE FOR AL L OF US. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN EX PERIENCE DEFINED BY BELONGING. BE READY TO HELP US BRING ABOUT THAT DAY. [ CHEERING] [CHANTING ""PETE""] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: NOW IS OUR CHANCE. SO, OUR GATHERINGS HAVE GOTTEN SLIG HTLY LESS INTIMATE SINCE WE ST ARTED OUT WITH ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE IN AN OFFICE ABOU T THE SIZE OF THIS STAGE HERE. AND W E HAVE GROWN WITH YOUR HELP TO THE MOVEMENT WE ARE BECO MING TO DAY. BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A GROUP SO LARGE. W E H AVE AN EXC HANGE OF IDEAS. WE H AVE GAT HERED QUESTIONS FROM FOLKS AS TH EY HAVE COME IN. I'D LIKE YO U TO WELCOME ANOTHER TEA M MEMBER WITH THE FAMOUS FISH BOWL. YOU ALREADY MET CLAUDIA . DO N'T WE HAVE THE BEST ORGANI ZERS AND VOLUNTEERS ON THIS TEA M? NOW, TO BE YOUR VOICE, I WANT YOU TO WELCOME ANOTHER, A FANTASTIC MEMBER OF THE PETE FOR AM ERICA TEAM, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE CHARLOTTE WHO IS GOIN G TO GUIDE OUR DISCUSSION. [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WEARING ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHIRTS, WHI CH CONTAINS THE VALUES OF O UR CAMPAIGN. LOOK AT THAT. YOU G OT FANS. IF IT WAS YOUR QUESTION, G ET A HOLLER OR WAVE, SO I CAN LO OK AT YOU AS WE RESPOND. >> SO, THIS QUESTI ON IS FROM BOB L. AND HE A SKS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KE EP THE ECONOMY STR ONG? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: GREAT QUESTION. A GAIN, IF THAT WAS YOU, GIVE A LITTLE HOLLER SO I CAN LOOK IN YOUR GENERAL DIR ECTION. HELLO, BOB. THANKS FOR COMING. SO, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE CONTINUE D E CONOMIC GROWTH IN THIS COU NTRY. AN D IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST IN THE THINGS THAT MAKE O UR ECONOMY COMPETITIVE . OUR ECONOMY IS NOT GOIN G TO GO JUST BEC AUSE. IT 'S GOING TO GROW BECAUS E WE HAVE THE BEST SCHOOLS OR ARE WORK ING TOWARDS HAVING THE BEST SCHOOL S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT I NFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT WORKFORCE - -NONE OF THAT HAPPENS ON ITS OWN. WE HAV E GOT TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS . THE ECONOMY CANNOT KEEP GROWIN G OF PEOPLE ARE NOT HEALTHY OR IF WE RE MAIN AS DIVIDED AS A ARE. THAT IS GOING TO CATCH UP TO US. WE H AVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ON TOP OF THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT. REMEM BER WHEN WE USED TO HEAR FRO M REPUBLICANS ABOUT THE DEFICIT IN THE DEBT. IT'S $1 TRI LLION AND GROWING. WE GOT A GET A HANDLE ON THAT, AND WE CAN WITH RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS AND RESPONS IBLE TAXATION, BUT YES, ASK TH E WEALTHIEST INCORPORATIONS TO PAY THEI R FAIR SHARE, BUT IT'S CO MPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH GROWTH. ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OU T. I'M WORRIED WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ECONOMY WE ARE COUNTING TH E WRONG THINGS. BEC AUSE A LOT OF COMMUNIT IES , ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDW EST, ARE NOT SEE ING THE KIND OF BENEFITS WE SEE ON PAPER. IT'S GREAT THE DOW JON ES IS DOING WELL. BUT S O MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. IT IS WHY WHEN I AM P RESIDENT WE WILL MEASURE THE PERFORM ANCE OF OUR ECON OMY NOT BY THE DOW JONES, NOT BY THE GDP, BUT BY THE INCO ME GROWTH OF T HE 90%. IF YOU ARE WORKING AND YOUR INCOME IS GROWING, THAT COUNTS TOWARDS A GOOD ECON OMY IN MY BOOK. [CHEE RING] >> THIS IS FRO M JULIE M. AND SHE ASK S, WHAT CAN WE DO TO BETTER C OUNTER THE POLARIZATIO N AND FRACTURES WHEN THE PARTY A ND NATION TO GET TO A LEADER THAT IS REC OGNIZED AS FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE? MAY OR BUTTIGIEG: VERY GOOD. HI, J ULIE. THANKS FOR COMING. SO, THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. LET'S START WITH THE PA RTY BECAU SE THIS IS REALLY I MPO RTANT, RIGHT? THE PRIMARY PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO HELP YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCES AMONG ALL OF US D EMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. THAT'S FINE . THAT IS HEALTHY. BU T WE'VE GOT T O REMEMBER WE ARE ON THE SAME TEAM AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE'VE GOT TO BUILD EACH OTHER UP. HOW MAN Y PEOPLE HAVE RUN FOR PRESIDE NT, 25? 24 DON'T GET T O BE THE NOMINEE. THE MOMENT WE I DENTIFY THE ONE WHO IS EVERYBOD Y ELSE HAS TO RALLY AROUND THAT NOMINE E THE MATTER WHO IT IS. WE - - US CANDIDATES NEED TO MAK E SURE OUR SUPPORTERS ARE FOCUSED ON THAT, TOO. LOOK I THINK IN A ROOM, EVERYPLACE I HAVE BEEN TO, WE HAVE HAD HEALTHY, RESPECTFUL CONVERSATIONS AMONG DIFFE RENT CAMPS. ONLI NE CAN BE A LITTLE , A BIT OF A WE IRD PLACE. TRY TO PUT A LITTLE GOOD OUT ON LINE, TOO. BUT WE GOT TO REMEMBER WE ARE ON T HE SAME TEAM. IF TH ERE WAS EVER A REAS ON TO UNIFY AN D GET OVER THE 10 % OR 20% OF THE THINGS WE DO NOT A GREE O N IS LOOKING TO THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT U S ALL AGREEIN G. I T IS THE SAME THING WITH MY MESSAGE TO REPUBLIC ANS. I'M NOT TRY ING TO TRICK ANYBODY INT O THINKI NG WE WILL ALL AGREE. LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN BUILD TOGET HER. EVERYONE HAS TO SEE WHERE THEY FIT IN THAT FUTURE. WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. WE CA NNOT HAVE, OH, WE GOT AIR COM ING IN. ALL RIG HT. WE CANNOT REMAIN THIS DIVIDED AND SUCCEED AS A COUNTR Y. AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT THE PE OPLE WE KNOW AND LOVE WHO VO TED DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DID, THA T DOESN'T MAKE THEM BAD PEOPLE ANYM ORE THEN VOTING WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE RIGHT WAY MADE US GOO D PEOPLE. WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT ALL OF US CAN HAVE BETTER THINGS AND WORST THINGS AROUSED IN US BY LE ADERSHIP. AND ONE OF THE REAS ONS THE PRESIDENCY MATTERS SO MUCH IS IS IT CALLING OUT TO WHAT IS BEST IN US OR CALLING OUT TO WHAT IS WORST IN US? I BELIE VE WE WILL BE A MORE UNIFIED COUNTRY WITH THE PR ESIDE NT I AM DETERM INED TO BE, WHO CAL LS OUT TO WHAT IS BEST IN US AND ASKS US TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP FOR THE COU NTRY. [CHEERING] >> THIS QUESTI ON IS FROM ANO THER JULIE. JULI E P. THE QUES TION IS, PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTE D TO DO SO MANY THINGS . HOW WILL YOU HANDLE THIS ? MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: YES. ALL RIGHT. SO, PRESIDE NT OBAMA EXPERIENCED THE CHALLENGES OF BAD , RESI STANCE IN TODAY'S WASHINGTON. ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND REMEMBER THAT REVERS ING A GREAT DEPRESSION, BRINGING BA CK THE AUTO INDUSTRY, COVERING TE NS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICAN S, AND KILLING OSAMA BIN L ADEN, NOT TOO BAD FOR EIGHT Y EARS OF WORK. [CHEE RING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: BUT, EVEN SO, WE SAW A RE SISTANCE RIGHT AND LEFT. BY RI GHT AND LEFT, I DO NOT ME AN POLITICALLY. ANYTIME YOU STEP IN TO WASHINGTON. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE HAV E GOING FOR U S THAT IS TRUE EVE N MORE THAN I T WAS 10 YEARS AG O, EVEN MORE THAN WHAT PRESIDENT O BAMA HAD T O WORK WITH AND TH AT IS THIS , THE AMERICAN PE OPLE WANT TO SEE THESE CHANGES. EV EN IN MORE CON SERVATIV E STATES, WHE N WE TALK ABOUT ISSUE S FROM MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET PAID MO RE AND RAISING WAGES TO MAKING S URE THAT WE GET HEALTH CARE FOR EV ERYBODY, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, TO DELIVERING PAID FAMILY LEAVE, EVEN ISSUES WHER E MY PARTY HA S BEEN ON DEFENSE , IMMIGRATION , GUNS. RIGHT NOW 80% OF REPUBLICANS AND MOST GUN OWNERS THINK WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS. WHA T WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS A POWERF UL AMERICAN MAJORITY BUT WE NEED TO ENGAGE TO GET THE RIGHT T HINGS DONE. AND T HAT WILL MEAN NOT ONLY TAKING THE PRESIDENCY. THAT IS THE BEGINNING. NOT ONLY SEEKING TO TAKE THE SENATE, BECAUSE IT SURE WOU LD BE NICE TO HAVE MITCH MCCON NELL NO LONGER B E THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. [CH EERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WE GOT TO WORK ON THA T. IT'S PART OF WHY HAVING A CANDIDATE WITH COATTA ILS WILL BE HELPFUL. NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SENA TE, ON THE FLOOR, REMEMBERING THAT EACH OF THOSE MEMBERS, EA CH OF THOSE SENATORS HAS TO ANSW ER TO VOTERS. THE VOTERS ARE WITH US . THE BEST USE I CAN THINK O F THAT BIG BLUE AND WHITE AIRPLANE IS TO FLY INTO THE HOME STATE OF ANYBODY GET TING IN THE WAY OF A CHANGE TH AT IS NEEDED THAT IS GOOD FOR AM ERICA, THAT IS POPULAR IN MORE CONSERVATIVE STATES, AND ASK THEIR VOTERS TO ASK THEI R S ENATOR WHY THEY ARE BEING DEFIE D. I B ELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE WHAT IT TAK ES TO REUNITE SOME OF THESE FOLKS WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE. >> THIS QUESTION IS FROM JUL IE D. [LAUGHTER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: LOT OF JULI ES. >> WE'RE IN IOWA. MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: THE LAND OF MANY JULIES. [LA UGHTER] >> JULIE D. AS KS, WH AT DO YOU THINK O F THE SNL PORTRAY AL OF YOU? [LA UGH TER] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: I DON'T SEE IT AT ALL. I DON' T SEE THE RES EMBLANCE . NO, I'LL AD MIT THAT I FEEL A LITTLE BI T OF NERV OUSNESS WHEN SATURD AY NIGHT ROLLS AROUND. I H EARD IT' S SATURDAY AT 8:00, BUT I THINK IT IS A RERUN. WE'L L PROBA BLY BE ALL RIGHT. I US ED TO L OOK FORWARD TO HAVING A GO OD LAUG H. NOW I GOT T O WONDER IF I'M GOING TO GE T MADE FUN OF. IF THERE IS EVER A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE, I GUESS THIS WOULD BE IT. [APP LAUSE] IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN. >> THI S NEXT QUESTION IS FROM DUN DER H. I HOPE I 'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORREC TLY. MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: ALL RIGHT. [LAU GHTER] >> WHAT DO YOU THINK T HE EXTENT OF F OREIGN INVOLVEMENT SHOULD BE, MORE OR LESS? WHAT SPECIFIC ISSUES LONG OR SHO RT TE RM? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: I IMAGINE Y OU ARE THI NKING ABOUT U.S. INVOLV EMENT IN THE WORL D AND HOW WE ENGA GE IN THE WORL D AROUND US? SO, I B ELIEVE IN A VERY ENGAGED AME RICA, BUT THAT DO ESN'T MEAN YOU MA RCH IN AN D CHANGE OTHER COUNT RIES, ESPECIALLY AT GUNPOINT . W E'VE SEEN HOW THAT WORKS OUT. AND ONE THI NG I BELIEVE WE HAVE GOT TO DO I S REPLACE THIS AUTHOR IZATION FOR THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE THAT WAS PASSED TO DEAL WITH 9/11 BUT NOW HAS FOL KS IN PLACES LIKE EAST AFRICA AND WE GOT FOLKS PACKING THE IR BAGS FOR AFGHANISTAN THAT WEREN' T EVEN BORN ON 9/11. WE HA VE TO BRING AN END TO E NDLESS WAR, AND IT STARTS B Y CHANGING THE AUTHORIZATI ON PROCESS. AN D MAKING SURE THAT W E HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN FORCE. N OW, HAVING SAID THAT, EVEN WITH A HIGH ER BAR FOR USE OF FORCE, WE SHOULD BE MUCH MOR E ENGAGED USI NG OUR OTHER T OOLS OF THE TOOLKIT , DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMI C. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE WORLD N EEDS AMERICA RIGHT NOW, BUT IT CAN' T BE JUST ANY AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE THE AMERICA THI S PRESIDENT HAS REDUCED US TO. ONE MOR E COUNTRY SCRAPPING FOR OUR ADV ANTAGE. IT HAS TO BE AN AMERI CA WHOSE POLIC IES ARE BASED ON OUR VALU ES. AND THE FACT TH AT OUR VALUES, WHEN WE ARE BEIN G HER BEST, OUR VALUES LINE UP WITH UNIVER SAL L VALUES AND THAT IS TRUE FOR OUR COMPETITORS LIKE THE WA Y THAT CHINA IS TREATING A RELIGIOUS MINORITY OR THE PROT ESTERS OF HONG KONG STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRA CY, THEY NEED T O KNOW THEY HAVE A FRIEND IN T HE UNITED STATES. IT IS ALSO OUR ALLIES, SEEING THE WAY THE SAUDI A RABIA AND TURKEY HAVE BEHAVE D, BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE IS A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT CA RE. WE HAVE TO SEND A M ESSAGE THAT WE DO CARE. AND W E WILL HAVE N OT TRYING TO SINGLE-HANDEDLY CHANGE EVER Y COUNTRY AFTER OUR O WN IMAGE BUT TRYING TO MAKE SUR E THERE IS MORE PEACE AND P ROSPERITY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IF THERE WERE MORE PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND STABILI TY IN CENTRAL AMERICA WE WOULD HA VE LESS OF A MIGRATION ISSUE. IF T HERE WAS MORE STABILITY IN THE MIDD LE EAST RIGHT NOW THE ENTIRE WORL D WOULD BE BETTER OFF. WE HAV E AN INTEREST IN BRINGING THAT ABOUT AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT, NOT ALONE, BUT IN PART NERS HIP WITH AN INTERNATION AL COMMUNITY THAT WAS TO SEE THOSE SAME THINGS HAPPEN. [CH EERING] >> FROM CRAIG F. HOW WOUL D YOU ADDRESS THE FEDERAL DEFICIT? MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. CRAIG? SO, MAYBE IT'S A GENERATIO NAL THING. I'M MUCH MO RE INCLINED TO TALK ABOUT THIS THAN MOST PEOPLE IN MY PARTY HAVE BEEN, WHICH IS IRONIC B ECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT IT MY PARTY HAS GOTTEN MUCH BETTER TRACK RECORD IN T ERMS OF EVERY PRESI DENCY IN MY LIFET IME WHERE THE DEBT WENT D OWN OR UP. THE LON GER YOU' RE PLANNING TO BE HERE, TH E M ORE THIS MIGHT CATCH UP TO US. W E HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS A MATTER OF F AIRNESS BETWEEN GENERATIONS BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS TO PLAY THE BILL , PAY THE BILL. THE G OOD NEWS IS WE CAN GET THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL WITH TWO TH INGS IN MIND. ONLY MAKE PROMISES WE CAN KEEP. RIGHT NOW WE ARE WATCHING THE DOLLARS AND THE PENNIES. WH EN IT COMES TO COLLEGE, I'M A BIG B ELIE VER IN MAKING SURE COST I S NO LONGER A BARRIER FOR ANYONE TO GO TO COLLEGE, BU T ALSO T HINK ITI MATTERS HOW MUCH INCOME YOU MAKE IT IF YOU A RE IN THAT TOP 10%, I STILL WAN T YOU TO THRI VE, BUT I'M GOING T O ASK YOU TO PAY YOUR OWN TUITION SO WE CAN SAVE THOSE DOLLA RS FOR OTHER T HINGS AND TARGET THEM WHERE THEY MAKE THE BI GGEST DIFFERENCE. IT'S WHY WE'VE W ORKED HARD TO CREATE A HEALTH CA RE PLAN THAT SOLVES THAT PROBLE M, THAT MAKES SURE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNINSURED A MERICAN BUT INSTEAD OF $50 TRIL LION OVER 50 YEARS, I T'S $1.5, BUT STILL A LOT OF MO NEY BU T AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE CA N OBTAIN BY TAKING RESP ONSIBLE STEPS, LIKE ROLLING BAC K TRUMP TAX CUTS THAT BENEFIT COR PORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY. I MEAN, IF YOU PAID A DOLLAR AND FEDERAL INCOME TAXES LAST YEAR YOU PAID MORE THAN AMAZON DID. IT MAK ES NO SENSE. WE G OT CORPORATION S MAKING BILL IONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. SOME OF THEM HAVE N EGATIVE TAX RATES. I'D LIKE TO GET IN O N THAT. NEGAT IVE TAX RATE, F OR SOME OF THE MOST PROFIT ABLE COMPANIES. WE GOT TO H AVE REAL ENFORCEMENT . REFORM THE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES SO TH ERE IS SOME KIND OF COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WAY YOU GET TAX ED O N A PAYCHECK AND THE WAY YOU GET TAXED ON A HEDGE FUND. I'M N OT EVE N TALKING ABOUT TAKIN G US B ACK TO THE EISENHOWER YEARS. THIS IS NOT SOME LEVEL OF TAXATION THAT IS INCOMPATIBL E WITH GROWTH. THI S IS RESPONSIBLY FUNDING OUR GOVERNMENT. IF WE DO THAT, THEN WE ALS O CAN START REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE DOLLARS THAT ARE GO ING INTO DEBT SERVICE WHE N THEY C OULD BE GOING INTO PROGRA MS THAT WILL MAKE US BET TER OFF. WE CAN DO THIS IF WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO RESTRAIN WHAT WE ARE PROMISING ON THE FRON T END A ND MAKE SURE THOSE WHO A RE BEST PO SITIONED TO SUPPORT THIS COUNTRY ARE ACTUALLY PA YING THEIR FAIR SHARE. [CHEERING] >> SO, THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION. I T COMES FROM DANIEL M. IT COMES FROM DANIEL M. >> RIGHT HERE. MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. [LAU GHTER] >> WHERE DO YO U STAND ON GUN RIGH TS? MAYOR BUTTIGIEG: SO, HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE. FIRST OF AL L, I AM WITH THE MAJORITY OF GUN OWNE RS, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, AND AMERICANS WHO THINK THAT BACKGR OUND CHECKS ARE JUST COMMON SENS E. YOU KNOW, YOU NEED ONE TO GET A JOB. GOT TO HAVE ONE , AND, BY THE WAY, THERE IS THIS LOO PHO LE WHERE IF THE BACK GROUND CHECK DOES NOT COME BA CK, THEY JUST GIVE YOU THE GUN. CA N YO U IMAGINE IN THE HIRI NG PROCESS , IF THE BACKGRO UND CHECK WAS LATE, HIRE THEM ANYWAY . OF COURSE NOT. ANOTHE R THING I THINK THA T IS VERY IMPORTANT IS RED FLAG LAWS. THIS IS WHEN SOMEBO DY IDENTIFIES A LOVED ONE THAT CO ULD BE A DANGER TO THEMSELV ES , LET'S NOT OVERLOOK HOW MUCH SU ICIDE HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM WE ARE FACI NG HERE. WE OU GHT TO HA VE A MEANS FOR MAKING SURE THAT W HEN SOMEBODY IS A DANGER , WHETHER IT IS DOMESTIC ABUSE OR ON E OF THESE OTHER CHALLENGES, THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING A BOUT THAT DANGER. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF WEAPONRY WE SOLD. , CA N BE SOLD . WE GOT TO DRAW A LINE SOMEWHERE. SOME FOLKS WILL DISAGREE ON WHERE IT OUGHT TO GO. ANYTHIN G REMOTELY RESEMBLING THE STUFF I WAS TRAINING ON TO GO OV ER TO AFGHANISTAN HAS NO BUSI NESS BEING SOLD FOR PROFIT ANYWHERE NEAR A SCHOOL. [CH EERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WE JUST DON 'T NEED IT. ALL OF THIS, IN MY VIEW, IS COMPATIB LE WITH THE SE COND AMEN DMENT. NONE OF THIS WIL L BE A GUARANTEE D WAY TO PREV ENT EVERY SINGLE TRAGEDY, BU T IT WILL SAVE THOUSA NDS AND THOUSAN DS AND THOUSAN DS OF LIVES. A ND I BELIEVE W E OWE IT TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COU NTRY TODAY. I HEARD FROM A 14-Y EAR-OLD GIRL WHO WROTE ME SA YING SHE WAS SO AFRAID T HAT HER DA Y AT SCHOOL WOULD BE HER LAST THAT SHE HAS WRITTEN OUT A WILL AT THE AGE OF 14. NO O THE R MODER N COUNTRY HAS THIS HAPPEN AT T HIS RATE. AND I REFUS E TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT O UR CO UNTRY IS SOMEHOW INF ERIOR AN D WE JUST OUGHT TO PUT UP W ITH THIS. AMERI CANS DESERVE AS MUCH SAF ETY AS A NYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD, AND WE CAN BE COMPLETELY CONSTITUTIONAL AND COMPLET ELY RATIONAL AND DO SOMETHING A BOUT THESE GUNS. [CHEE RING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: ALL RIGHT. WHOOPS. SOR RY ABOUT THAT. ONE MORE BI G THANK YOU TO CHARLOTTE F OR BEING YOUR VOICE THIS EVENING. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AGAIN FOR C ARING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE HEADED AS A COUNTRY AND FOR BEING INVOLVED. I WANT TO LEAVE YO U WITH THIS. I THI NK A LOT OF US ARE WATCHING TH E PROCESS IN WASHINGT ON AND JUST FE ELING EXHAUSTED B Y IT, BECAUSE WE KNOW WHA T IS PROBABLY GO ING TO HA PPEN. IT GOES TO THE SENATE AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS LI KE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND THERE IS A SENSE OF EXHAUSTION. THAT IS HOW THEY GET US, THOUGH. WE CANNOT G IVE IN TO EXHAUSTION AND CYNICIS M AND TURN OFF THE PROCESS COM PLETELY. WE CAN'T. WE H AVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT W E TAKE CON TROL. AN D THE GREAT NEWS IS, IN A FEW SHORT D AYS, IT'LL BE 20 20, AND WHAT HA PPENS IN 2020 IS IN OUR HANDS. NO M ATTER WHAT GOES O N ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE, IT IS UP TO US TO BRING ABOUT A BET TER FUTURE. THAT IS YOUR POW ER. THAT IS MY SOURC E OF HOPE. IT TAKES HOPE TO BE INVOL VED IN POLITICS AT ANY LEVEL. ARE YOU READY TO SPREAD A SENSE OF HOPE TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW? A RE Y OU READY T O BRING ABOUT A BETTER FU TURE FOR US AND FOR THOSE WE LOVE? AN D C OULD Y OU HELP MAKE SURE THAT I SUCCEED I N THE IOWA CAUCUSES IN 37 DAYS? [CHEERING] MAYOR BUTTI GIEG: WESTERN DES MOINES, I B ELIEVE YOU WILL HELP ME BECOME T HE NOMINEE AND THE PRESIDENT.

AFTER THAT, JOE BIDEN N EW HAMPSHIRE FOLLOWED BY PETE BUT TIGIEG SPEAKING TO REPORTERS I N IOWA. (musi c) SUSAN: MARG ARET O'MARA, WHA T WILL READERS GET IN YOUR NEW BOOK, ""THE CODE""? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: WHAT THEY WILL GET, I S A BIOGRAPHY OF SILICON VAL LEY ITSELF, AND THE MOD ERN AMER ICAN TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IT SELF. THE RE ARE MANY PE OPLE REGI ON FOR SO LONG AND TH IS IN DUSTRY FOR SO LONG AND PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK, WHAT IS THE SILI CON VALLEY SECRET? I SET OUT T O ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR THEM. S USAN: YOURS IS THE STORY OF 75 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE TECH INDUST RY. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CLIP OF WHE RE WE ARE TODAY. THIS IS FROM LAST YEAR ON CAPITOL HILL WITH MARK ZUCKER BERG. IN FRONT OF THE SENA TE PANEL. LET' S WATCH. >> C AR COMPANIES FACE A LOT OF COMPETIT ION . IF THEY MAKE A DEFE CTIVE CAR, IT CAN GET INTO TH E WORLD AND PEOPLE WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE. IS THERE AN ALTERNAT IVE TO FACEBOOK IN THE PRIV ATE SECTOR? >> YES, SENATOR.

THIS IS ABO UT TH E RIGHTS TO PRIVACY, TH E LIMITS OF YOUR RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AND HOW MUCH YOU GI VE AWAY IN MODERN AMERICA IN THE NAME OF CONNECTING PEOPLE AROU ND THE WORLD. SUSAN: SINCE THAT HEARING HAPPENED, OTHER INDUSTRY TI TANS HAVE BEEN IN FRONT OF PANELS ON C APITOL HILL WITH SIMILAR EXC HANGES. TODAY, WHILE WE ARE TALKING , DOWN AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THER E IS A GATHERING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AGG RIEVED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SPEC TRUM WHO FEEL THEY A RE NOT GETTING ACCESS AND ARE BEI NG CENSORED. I T IS ALL WRAPPED UP IN ONE B IG QUESTION. WHAT IS THE STATE OF THE RELATIO NSHIP BETWEEN BIG TECH AND THE GOV ERNMENT TODAY? PROFESSOR O'MARA: IT IS PRETTY ROCKY. IT IS REALL Y INTERESTING. IT IS SUCH A CONT RAST. HERE WE ARE TALKING IN 2019. FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I STARTED WORK ON THI S BOOK, THE MOOD WAS SO DIFF ERENT. THERE WAS A LOT OF TECH OPTIMISM IN SILICON VALLEY AND IT WAS SHAR ED BY A LOT OF LEADERS IN WASHINGT ON. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THE IDEA THAT THESE PRIVATE COM PANIES HAD DONE THIS EXTRAORDINA RY THINGS, THAT THERE , THEIR PRODU CTS COULD BE BENEFICIAL. THINK ABOUT HOW BARACK OBAMA'S CAM PAIGN USED FACEBOOK TO MARSHALL SU PPORT. IT WAS SEEN AS THE FUTURE OF CAMPAIGN ING AND ALSO GO VERNING. NOW THE MOO D IS DIFFERENT. 2016 IS AND WAS A TURNING POINT, IN THE RECO GNITION OF HOW SOCIAL MEDI A PLATFORMS H AVE FUNCTIONED AS DISRUPTO RS TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. TH AT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF A VERY R EAL REALITY, THAT OUTSIDE ACT ORS HAD BEEN USING SOCIAL MEDI A PLATFORMS TO MESS WITH THE EL ECTIO N, THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD A CONSE QUENTIAL EFFECT ON O UTCOMES . A ND THE VERY RE AL FEELIN G THAT COULD CONTINUE GO ING FORWARD. TH AT, COMBINED WI TH THE PERMEAT ION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFOR MS IN OUR LIVES. THIN K ABOUT THE P RODUCTS OF THE BIGGEST FIVE AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. MICROSOFT, APPLE, GOOGLE, AMA ZON, FACEBOOK. I F YOU SAY, I WILL NOT BE ON ANY OF THESE THINGS, IT IS REALL Y HARD TO GO THROUGH YOU R LIFE FROM DAWN TO DUSK IN MOD ERN AMERICA WITHOUT IT SOME WAY HAVING BEING AFFECTED BY A PRODUC T MADE BY ONE OF THOSE COMPA NIES. THIS IS DRIVING THE CONVERS ATION IN WASHINGTON. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE SE COMPANIES IN SHAPING THE POLITIC AL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF MODERN AMERICA? SU SAN: WHAT ARE TH E CHARACT ERIS TICS OF THESE CO MPANIES? WAS IT, HUB RIS? NAI VETE? IN ATTENTION TO CERTAIN DETAILS? WH AT DO YOU THINK ARE THE FACTORS? PR OFESSOR O'MARA: IT IS HELPF UL TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY ITSELF. THE SE COMPANIES ARE THE PRO DUCT OF A BUSINESS CULTURE, A BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM. I CALL IT A GALAPAGOS , A VERY DISTINCTIVE COMMUNITY T HAT GREW FOR A LONG TIME IN RELATIVE ISOLATION FROM WASHIN GTON. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DEEP LY AFFE CTED BY THEM FROM T HE BEGINNING. YOU HAVE HIGH T ECH VENTURE CAPITALISTS . THEY ARE FUNDERS , ADVISORS, M ENTORS. CA RRYING ON THIS DIS TINCTIVE CULTURE FROM ONE GENERAT ION TO THE NEXT. IT IS A CULTUR E FOCUSED ON GROWTH, MAK ING TECHNOLOGY BETTER, FAS TER. IT IS , FA CEBOOK HAD POSTERS IN THEIR HE ADQ UARTERS THAT SAID MOVE FASTER , BREAK THINGS. IT WAS THIS NOTION , THIS WAS NOT SOM ETHI NG THAT WAS FACEBOOK, Y OU CAN LOO K AT INTEL OR SEATTLE-BAS ED COMPANIES LIKE MICROS OFT. YOU NEEDED TO DOMINATE YOUR MARKET QUICKLY OTHERWISE Y OUR COMPET ITORS WOULD EAT Y OU ALIVE. YOU HAD TO MOVE VERY F AST. IF SO METHING GOT BROKEN ALONG THE W AY, THAT WAS TH E COST OF DOING BU SIN ESS. T HAT IS PART OF HOW WE GOT WHERE W E AR E. THESE LEADERS DID NOT SET UP TO SAY W E A RE GOING TO BE THIS DISRUP TIVE FORCE IN THIS WAY. I LIKEN IT TO A RUNAWAY TRAIN, THIS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY WAS SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY S ET OUT TO DO. IT HAD ALL OF THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE S. SUSAN: YOURS IS THE STOR Y OF 75 YEARS OF EVOLUTION. I WANT TO GO INTO THE SE STORIES BECAUSE THEY ALL HA VE CHARACTERS. THERE ARE T HEMES AND YOU REFERENCED THE GOVERNM ENT INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THIS. AL SO, LIGHT REGULATION, WHICH MAY BE CHANGING. W E CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. HIGH TECH HAS BEEN AN D MAYBE CONTI NUES TO BE THE - - TO BE THE PROV ENA NCE OF MOSTLY WHIT E MALES. ONE CHARACTER I N YOUR BOOK IS SOMEONE WHO WORKS T HEIR WAY UP. HER NAME IS ANN HARDY. PROF ESSOR O 'MARA: ANN HARDY IS ONE OF THOSE HI DDEN FIGURES OF SILICON VALLEY. HER STORY T ELLS US SO MUCH ABOUT HOW THE IND USTRY AS , HAS C HANGED AND HOW WE CAN CONTINU E TO UNDERSTA ND THE GENDER IMBALANCE. IN 1956 SHE WALKS INTO IBM HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK CITY A FEW YEARS OUT O F COLLEGE. SH E HEARD THERE ARE PROGRAMMING JOBS TO BE HAD. SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABO UT COMPU TERS. A FRIEND TO LD HER ABOUT THIS JOB. THEY S AID THEY ARE HIRING PEOPLE AND IT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE JOB. SHE GETS THE JOB AS AN ENTRY-LE VEL PROGRAMMER. SHE WORKS HER WAY UP. SHE BECOMES A MANAGER. SH E IS MANAGING A TEAM FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE. SHE IS COMBATING S EXISM EVERY SINGLE RUNG OF THE LADD ER. SHE FINDS OUT THAT EVERY MAN I S MAKING MORE MONEY THAN HER. S HE DEMANDS A RAISE AND GETS A RAISE. SHE REALIZE S TH E PEOPLE SHE IS SUPERVISING ARE STILL M AKING MORE THAN SHE IS, SO SHE LEFT. SHE ENDS UP IN CALIFORNIA BY THE PART OF THE 1960'S AND SHE IS PASSIONA TE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY. SHE IS REAL LY INTERESTED IN PROGRAMMING AND USING COMPUTERS. SHE ENDS UP AT A SMALL START UP IN PALO ALTO, IN THIS NEW BUSINES S CALLED TIMESHARING . THE INTERNET BEFORE THE INTERNE T, IT IS NETWORKED C OMPUTERS. THIS IS A TIME WHEN COMPUTERS W ERE EITHER GIANT MAINF RAMES OR MINICOMP UTE RS. BUT THERE W AS NOTHING MINI ABOUT A MINICOMPU TER, IT WAS REFRIGERATOR SIZED. THEY WERE VERY EXPENS ES AND USUALLY HOUSED IN CORPORAT E OFFICES OR GOVERNMENT LABS. YOU C ANNOT HAVE ONE IN A SMALL OFFICE OR IN YOUR HOME. TIME-SHARIN G WAS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO REMOTELY CONNECT THR OUGH TEL EPHONE CABLE AND CONNECT TO A COMPUTER POWER. SO ANN HARD Y BUILT THIS OPERAT ING S YSTEM FOR THIS COMPAN Y TO BUILD THIS TIMESH ARING NETWORK. WH EN SHE WA S HIRED, SHE WAS HIRED A CCID ENTALLY. SHE WALKS I N AND SAYS, I CAN DO THIS . LA TER HER B OSS, THE CEO THE COMPANY SAID, IF I HAD KNOWN HOW CENTRAL THI S OPERATING SYSTEM WAS TO OUR BUSINESS, I NEVER WOULD HAVE HIRED A WOMAN TO DO IT. T HE IDE A YOU WOULD BE A TECHNICAL WOMAN AND A N EXECUTIVE, SOMEONE WIT H AUTHORITY WAS SO ALIEN. IT W AS THE 1960'S. THERE WERE VERY F EW WOMEN AND THIS WAS A DIFFE RENT TIME IN CORPORATE AMERICA. WH AT HAPPENS IN TECH AND BUT PAR TICULARLY IN THE VALLEY , NETWORKS AR E WHERE PEOPL E CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THE SAME PE OPLE FOR FROM ON E COVERAGE OF , , ON E COMPANY TO ANOTHER. THEY USE THEIR NETWORK TO HIRE AND CHOOSE WHO THEY AR E GOING TO INVEST IN. THE VERY OV ERWHELMINGLY MALE NETWOR K OF THE 1960 'S KIND OF GETS TRA PPED IN THE AMBE R. IT G ETS HARDER FOR NEW VOICES TO BREAK IN . THE OTH ER THING A CHALLENGE FOR, PEOPLE LIKE ANN HARDY B ESIDES THE EVERYDAY SEXISM OF C ORPORATE RETREATS , WORK, PEOPL E WOULD SAY, YOU CANNOT COME BECAUSE IF THE WOMEN COME, THEN WE HAVE TO INVITE OUR WIVES, THEN WE CAN 'T HAVE DALLIANCES ON THE SIDE AT THIS CORPORATE RETREAT. AS IDE FROM THAT, THE WORK HA BITS OF TECHNOLOGY, WORK HARD, PLAY HARD CONTIN UES TODAY. WORKING IN TECH IS A FULL IMMERSION ACTIVITY. Y OU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL I N. PART OF WHAT MAKES SILIC ON VALLEY GO WAS THE FACT THAT T HESE MALE EXECUTIVES AND MALE EN GINE ERS COULD GO CO MPLETELY HEADS DOWN, BUILD ING THEIR SEMIC ONDUCTORS AND COMPUTE RS AND WORKING ON THEIR SO FTWARE AND THEY HA D WIVES A T HOME TAKING CARE OF THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THOSE WOMEN ARE REALLY IMPORTANT P ART OF SIL KEN VALLEYS STORY TOO. SUSAN: AS W E GO THROUGH THIS WE HEAR THE WORD SILICON VALLEY AND ALSO AN OTHER WORD, CODING. WHE RE DID THOSE WORDS COME FROM? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: THE EARLY DAYS OF DIGITAL COMPUTING. THE FIRST DIGITAL COMPUTERS, THE ART AND THE SCIENCE OF COMPUTIN G W AS CONSIDERED TO REST IN HARDWARE, IN THE MACH INE ITSELF. THE ORIGINS OF THE FIRS T ALL-DIGITAL COMPUTER CO MES OUT IN WORLD WAR II. IT IS AN ARMY FUNDED PROJECT. BASED AT THE UNIV ERSITY OF PENNSYLVANI A. IT IS CALLE D THE ENIAC. IT IS LATER CO MMERCIALIZED AS THE UNIVAC. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF COMPUTING, UNIVAC WAS A BRAND LIKE KLEENE X OR GOOGLE. THE RE IS A GREAT POLITICAL STORY INVOL VING A UNIVAC. THE FIRST A PPEARANCE ON TELEVISION WAS IN THE 1952 ELECTI ON EVE OF THE ELECTION. W ALTER CRONKITE, NEWLY HIRED ANCHO R, IS MANAGING THE ELECTION NI GHT COVERAGE. T HEY HAVE A UNIV AC COMPUTER THAT IS SUP POSED AFFECT THE OUTCOME . THIS IS EIS ENHOWER VERSUS STEVENSON. THE UNIVAC PRED ICTS CORRECTLY AN OVERWHELMIN G VICTORY FOR EISENHOWER. IT WAS SO D ECISIVE IN ITS PREDICTIONS THAT ALL OF THE PROGRAMMERS WERE LIKE I THINK THEY GOT IT WRON G. CODING, IT IS A TIME WHEN T HE HARDWARE IS CONSIDERED TO BE SO IM PORTANT. THE SOFTWARE IS LIKE BEI NG A TELEPHONE OPERATOR. T O PROGRAM A COMPUTER, YOU'RE JUST PLUGGING IN DIFFEREN T WIRES IN DIFFERENT P LACES. IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN ART OR SCIE NCE, JUST VERY ROUTINE. TH AT CODING SOMETHING WAS LIKE DA TA E NTRY. SO A CODER WAS KIND OF A DRONE. UNSU RPRISINGLY THIS WAS SE EN AS WOMEN'S WORK. SECRE TARIES, TELEPHONE O PERATORS, IT IS KIND OF BASIC, A WOMAN CAN DO IT. TURNS OUT IS THAT PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPLICATED. IF, FOR SOM E REASON, THERE IS SOME MIS FIR E IN THE PROG RAM, THERE IS A BUG IN THE PROGRAM, YOU HAVE TO DO A WOR KAROUND. IT IS A VER Y CREATIVE PROCESS. WH AT COMPUT ER SPECIALISTS AND TECHNOLOGIS TS REALIZE IS PROGRAMM ING THE SOFTWARE IS REALLY W HER E IT IS AT. AS THAT BECOMES MORE AND SO , PROFESSIONALIZED, THE DISCIPL INE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IS CREATED. BY THE LATE 1960'S , YOU HAVE WOMEN NOT O NLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT OTHER S CHOLARS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WHO HAVE WRITTEN ABO UT HOW WOMEN ARE PUSHED OUT OF PROGRAMMING . BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A MO RE HIGH PRESTI GE ACTIVITY. THE CODERS SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME MEN. SUSAN: THE NAME CODE ITSELF CAME FROM , IS IT A PRODUCT? PR OFESSOR O'MARA: YES, THERE IS SOFTWARE CODE. THE IDEA TH AT A CODE , IT IS COMING OUT OF WORL D WAR II , CODE CRACKI NG. T HERE IS THE ROUTINI ZATION OF IT. IT IS S OMETHING WHERE THERE IS A PATTERN. SU SAN: LIKE MORSE CODE. PROFE SSOR O'MARA: IT IS NOT A CREATIVE PROCESS. SU SAN: CODI NG IS. IT IS S OMETHING W HERE THE BEST CODERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS THIN KING AB OUT , THINKING IN RATHER C OMP LEX WAYS. PROFESSOR O 'MARA: PARTICULARL Y NOW, PROGRA MMING IS MUCH MORE C OMPLE X. BU T EVEN TH EN, PROGRAMMING IS EVEN TOU GHER WHEN YOU HA D LESS MEMORY AND YOU HAD TO BE BRUTALLY EFFICIENT IN GETTING THE COMMANDS TO BE AS SH ORT AS POSSIBLE, TO USE AS L ITTLE MEMORY AS POSSIBLE. N OW WE HAVE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MACHINES WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT MORE LATITUDE. S USAN: HOW DID SILICON VALLEY GET ITS NAME? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: GRE AT STORY. IT W AS NOT CALLED THAT UNTIL 1971. BEFOR E THAT, IT WAS SANT A CLARA VALLE Y. A F RUIT GRO WING VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA. IT GETS ITS NAME , WHAT IS HAPPENIN G I N 1971 IS THE MAJOR INDUSTRY TH ERE IS SILICON SEMICONDUCT ORS. AT THE TIME , THE MAIN CUSTOM ERS FOR THE SEMICON DUCTOR COMPANIES, WERE NOT PE OPLE LIKE YOU AND ME, THEY WERE O THER COMPANIES. THEY WERE COMPUT ER MAKERS. THE BIG COMPUTER MA KERS LIKE IBM AND HONEYWELL WERE MOSTLY BASED ELSEWHERE. SO, THE SALES GUYS FOR TH ESE THE COMPUTER COMPANIES WOULD COME OUT AND THEY STARTED COL LOQUIALLY REFERRING T O THE VALLEY AS SILICON VALLEY. BEC AUSE THAT WAS THE MAI N ACTION. THE RE IS A REPORTER FOR A TRADE PAPER. THIS IS BASED IN PALO ALT O. ELECT RONICS NEWS. A GUY NAMED DON HOFFLER . HE WRITES ABOUT THE S EMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IN SILICON VALLEY. HE GETS WIN D THAT SILICON VALLEY IS THE COLL OQUIAL NAME AND HE HE THINK S THAT IS A GOOD THING TO TIE IT. SO HE H EADLINE S THE STORY, SILI CON VAL LEY USA. THAT N AME S TUCK. ALTH OUGH IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BA NDIED ABO UT IN THE VALLEY FOR A WHILE WIT HIN THE INDUSTRY. I S NOT TO THE LATE 1970'S WHEN IT STA RTS BECOMING , STARTS DISS EMINATING OUT. I FOUN D MY REFERENCES IN THE WASH ING TON POST AND NEW YORK TI MES. AND FORTUNE MAGAZINE, START TALKI NG ABOUT THE SANTA C LARA VALLEY AND THEN OCCASIONALLY THEY WILL SAY SI LICON VALLEY. IN QUOTATION MARKS. THE POST IS REF ERRING TO SILICON VAL LEY IN Q UOTATION MARKS UNTIL 1979. THEN IT BECOMES A MORE FAMILIAR LEXICON. IT WAS AN O UT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE, SEEN AS OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE MAIN ACTION FOR SO LONG. SUSAN: WERE GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME TO TEL L THE STORY AS YOU DO IN YOUR BOO K. BEFORE THAT I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW A L ITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU. HOW DID YOU GET INTERESTED IN THIS? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: I WAS IN GRADUATE SC HOOL, I KNEW I WANTED TO W RITE , I WORKED IN POLITICS BE FORE I WENT TO GRADUATE SC HOOL. I C AME TO GRADUATE SCHOOL TO STUDY PO LITICAL HISTORY AND I WAS I NTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE EISE NHOWER YEARS AND THE DOM ESTIC IMPACT OF THE COLD WAR. FUNNIL Y ENOUGH, I WAS BECOMING A POLITICAL JUNKIE. I W AS INTERESTED IN WHAT THE EISENHO WER WHITE HOUSE WAS D OING AND W HAT LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS WE RE DOING IN THE 1950'S. AND THEN, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE GREATEST DOMESTIC IM PACTS OF THE COLD WAR WAS WHA T THE MILITAR Y INDUSTRIAL COMP LEX DID TO SEED THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, THE COMPUTE R INDUSTRY. I REALIZED THAT THIS I S THE THEN, I STORY. THIS IS THE STOR Y OF HOW THIS WHOLE NEW ECONOMY WAS BUILT. I WAS ALWAYS REAL LY INTERESTED EVER SINCE I WAS WORKING IN WASHINGT ON, WITH HOW BUSINESS AN D GOVERNM ENT INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. TH EY HAVE A N ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHI P BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A COLLABORA TIVE RELATIONSHIP. THE REAL ST ORY IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS ONE OF P UBLIC-PART , PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN MANY WAYS, THAT ARE SOMETIMES UNSEEN. I T HINK THIS STORY IS A REALLY GR EAT WAY TO GET INTO THAT. TO UN DERSTAND HOW GOVERNMENT CAN SUPPORT BUSINESS AND VICE VERSA. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THE COLD WAR, IF YOU HAVE THE BI GGEST OF BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, T HE SPACE RACE, YOU HAVE WH AT EISENHOWER LABELS THE MILITAR Y INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. TH AT BECOME S THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS ENTREP RENEURIAL FLYWHEEL OF INCREDIB LE CREATION AND INNOVAT ION AND PRIVATE WEALTH CREA TION. I T IS AN IN DUSTRY THAT CONSIDERS I TSELF AN I NDUSTRY THAT BUILT ITSEL F ON I TS OWN. GOVERN MENT HAS BECOME ALMOST INVI SIBLE T O MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SILICON VALLEY. WHO ARE THE CREATORS OF THESE CO MPA NIES AND THESE TECHN OLOGIE S. THE CREATORS THINK THERE IS NOT A ROLE BUT THERE I S. THAT IS PART OF THE MAGIC. IT IS A GOVERNMENT OUT OF SIGH T. SUSAN: WHAT DID YOU DO IN WASHINGTON? PROFESSOR O'MARA: LIK E A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME TO WASHINGTON, I CAME FOR A PRESIDENT IAL I WORKED ON CAMPAIGN . T HE 1992 PRESID ENTIAL RUN OF THE CLINTON . I GRADUATED F ROM COLLEGE IN ARKANSAS . L IKE ANY GO OD HISTORY MAJOR, I DID NOT H AVE A JOB. [LAUGH TER] HISTORY MAJ ORS GET LOTS OF JOBS. BU T I CAME HOME TO TRY TO FIGURE O UT WHAT TO DO NEXT. WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE WHEN I GREW UP. I FIGUR ED I WOULD VOLUNTEER ON THE CAMP AIGN. T HAT POSITION TURNED INTO AN ENTRY-LEVEL JOB. I STARTED I N THE CORRESPONDE NCE OFFICE AS MANY GRE AT BLUE GHOST , GR EAT POLIT ICAL STAFF CAREE RS START. ONE THING L ED TO ANOTHER AND THEN, W HEN YOUR CANDIDATE WINS, EVERY THING CHANGES. SO I SPENT THE FIRST CLINTON TERM AND A LITTLE EXTRA IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WORKI NG IN THE WHITE H OUSE WERE THING , WORKING AT DHHS WOR KING FOR BOTH , PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE. IT WA S AN EXTRAORDINA RY EDUCATION. I CALL IT MY FIRST GRADUATE SC HOOL. ASIDE FROM JUST WITNESSING THINGS AS ONE DOES WHEN YOU AR E A YOUNG STAFFER ON THE PERI METER OF THE ROOM OR IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS, NOT MAKING THE DECISIONS BUT WATCHING VERY POWERF UL PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THE DE CISIONS THEY HAVE TO MAKE, IT GA VE ME THIS APPRECIATION FOR THE HUM ANITY OF POLITICS. P ARTICULARLY, EVEN THE PE OPLE AT THE HIGH EST LEVELS OF POWER. W HET HER IT BE IN GO VERNMENT OR A BUSINESS, THEY ARE JU ST HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. THEY ARE VE RY SMART, TALENTED BUT THEY ARE DO ING THEIR BEST AND TRYING TO IMPLEMEN T THE VISION THEY SEE. IT GAV E ME AN UNDER STANDING OF HOW POWE R WORKS AND E MPATHY FOR WHERE D IFFERENT P EOPLE ARE COMING FROM. I THI NK BEING A HISTORIAN HAS GIVEN M E MO RE EMPATHY. I SPENT 20 YEARS ON THE OTHERS , O THER SIDE OF THE FENCE, LOOKING AT POLITICS AND BUSINESS FROM THE VI EW OF SOMEONE TRYING TO UNDERSTA ND WHY PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DO. LO OKING AT THE HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY OR AMERICAN HI STORY WRIT LARGE, IT IS A WAY OF NOT ONLY BETTER UNDERSTANDI NG OUR PRESENT - THAT IS ONE THING THAT I HOPE THIS BOOK WILL H ELP READERS DO, UNDERSTAND HOW WE GET TO T HIS BIG TECH NOW AND WHE RE D O WE GO? YOU NEE D THE BACK STORY. IT H ELPS YOU GET BACK FROM A LL OF THE NOISE AND THE FIGHTIN G OF RIGHT NOW. OF WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG AND DRAW BA CK AND SAY WHY DID WE MAKE THE SE CHOICES AND WHAT WERE THEY HOPING TO DO. AND WHA T DID NOT WORK OU T? THEN Y OU HAVE A RICH ER UNDE RSTANDING AND PERHAPS MORE EMPATH Y FOR WHY DIF FERENT ACTORS DO WHAT THEY D O. SUSAN: HOW LONG DI D YOU WORK ON THIS BOOK? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: I W ORKED ON THIS FOR THE BET TER PART OF SIX YEARS F ROM IDEA T O EXECUTION. I LIVE IN S EATTLE. MY FAMILY A ND I MOVED DOWN TO PALO ALT O F OR TWO YEARS. I WA S REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SAB BAT ICAL FELLOWSHIPS . I HAD A WAY TO BE DOWN THE RE. AND I INTERVIEWED A LOT OF PEOP LE. I H AD TO BUILD MY OWN ARCHIVE . HI STORIANS LIKE TO GO TO ARCHI VES , TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS , TO THE NATI ONAL AR CHIVES AND GET IN THE DUSTY BOXES AND DO OUR THIN G. THIS HISTORY, TH ERE ISN'T A LIBRARY O F CONGRESS OR NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN THIS IND UST RY. A LTHOUGH GO VERNMENT ARCHIVES WE RE VERY I MPORTANT TO ME. AND ARC HIVE S LIKE THE C-SPAN ARCH IVES AND THE GOVERNM ENTA L ARCHIVES WERE REALLY IMPO RTANT TO ME. BUT I H AD TO DRAW IN DIFFERENT T HINGS AND TALK TO PEOPLE W HO WERE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED . A ND DRAW IN ORAL HISTOR IES FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE LONGER WITH US. NO CORPORATE RECORDS. SO METIMES PEOPLE WOULD GIVE ME FIL E FOL DER S THAT THEY KEPT I N THEIR ATTICS FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS. ONE OF THE REAL CHALLE NGES AND ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT T HINGS GOING FORWA RD IS HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THIS H ISTORY THAT IS IN THE MAKING, WILL BE PRESERVED? IT REALLY M ATTERS. NOT ONLY THE TECHNOLOGY , UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WHAT WERE THE BUSINESS DECISIONS S URROUNDING THOSE TECHNOLOGIE S? WHO WERE THE PEOPLE? THIS IS GOI NG TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT T O HISTORIANS GOING FORWARD. SU SAN: RIGH T AFTER THE WAR, YOU WRITE A BOUT FACT THAT WAS A COMPETITI ON BETWEEN TWO DIFFERE NT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS - BOSTON AND PALO ALTO. WHO ARE THE PATRONS ? WHY WAS IT BOSTON AND PALO ALTO? WHY D ID SILICON VAL LEY TRIUMPH IN THIS? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: COM ING OUT OF WORLD WAR II, BOS TON WAS , AS THE U.S. GO VERNMENT DECIDED TO GET INTO TH E SCIENCE BUSINESS, IN A BIG WA Y, THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOU NDATION WAS CREATED IN 1949. THERE IS A DECISION TO GO BIG ON PUBLIC I NVESTMENT IN PEACE TIME RESEAR CH AND DEVELOP MENT . IT WAS PEACETIME ONLY IN TEC HNICALIT Y. IT WAS THE COLD WAR. I T WAS VERY MUCH AN INVESTMENT MADE FROM THE COLD WAR ST RUGGLE. T O COMPETE IN SCIENCE AND EDUCATION WITH THE SOVIETS . NOT ONLY A MATTER OF P RESTIGE BU T DEVELOPING THE NUCLEAR REA LITIES OF THE NUCLEAR AGE , WHICH THE U NITED STATES HAD ENTERED INTO THIS. BOSTO N WAS THE 800 POUND GORILLA. WH AT WAS IN BOSTON QUESTION , WHAT WAS IN BOSTON? HAR VARD AND M.I.T.. YES THERE IS THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLV ANIA AND ITS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING THAT WERE ALSO I MPORT ANT BUT THE LEADERS , WHAT GAVE T HEM AN ADVANTAGE, WAS THAT TH EY WERE THE CENTER OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED BUSINESS RE SEARCH DURING THE WAR. THE LE ADERS WERE FROM H ARVARD AND M.I.T., INC LUDING ONE OF THE PEOPLE I TALK ABOU T IN THE BOOK, VANNE VAR BU SH, WHO IS THE ORIGINA L EN TREPRENEUR PROFESSOR. HE HAS THIS EXTRAORDINA RY CAREER, CROSSING OV ER ACADEMIA, GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTR Y. HE IS THE FOUNDER OF RAYTHEON . WHILE HE IS AN ELECTORA L - - ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROFESSOR AND M.I.T.. HE GOES ON IN WORLD WA R II TO LEAD THE WARTIME RESEARCH AN D ABOUT MEANT OFFICE UNDE R FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT. HE IS KNOWN AS RO OSEVELT'S GENERAL OF PHYSICS. HE HAS A VERY HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE THEN. HE IS THE PERSON WHO KIND OF CONCEIVE S OF THIS POS TWAR RES EARCH NE TWORK THAT IS BASED IN A LOT OF UNIVERSITIE S. AND SO, THA T EXPLAINS BOSTON. BOS TON IS, A LOT OF MONEY IS FINALLY IN AFTER WORLD WAR II. AND THE RE'S, THE ELECTRO NICS INDUSTRY IS BASED ON THE EAST COAST. THER E IS A LOT OF EXISTING IN DUSTRY. W HAT EXPLAINS SI LICON VALLEY? SANTA CLARA VALLE Y WAS KNOWN FOR IT'S BIGGEST EXP ORT IS PRUNES AT THE TIME BEING THE PRUNE CAPITAL. IS KNOWN FOR O F AMERICA. IT HAD TWO ASS ETS. IT WAS ON THE PACIFIC COAST WHERE A LOT OF WA RTIME MILITARY AC TIVITY HA D GONE ON AND CONTINU ES T O GO ON. SO MILI TARY IN STALLATIONS IN THE BAY ARE A. A ND, IT HAD STANFORD. S TANFORD UNIVERSITY WAS A RESPE CTAB LE INSTITUTION BUT WAS BET TER KNOWN FOR ITS FOOTBAL L TE AM THAT BEING A HARVARD O F THE WEST. I T WA NTED TO BE A HAR VARD OF THE WEST. B UT I T HAS A GREAT ASSET IN THIS GUY NA MED FRED TURMAN WHO HAD GONE TO M.I.T. F OR GRADUATE SC HOOL AND WAS A STUDENT OF VANNEVAR BU SH. DURIN G WORL D WAR II, HE HAD GONE TO BOS TON TO W ORK UNDER BUSH IN THIS RESEAR CH EFFORT. HE IS SITTI NG IN CAMBRIDGE AND LOOKING AT WHAT IS GOING ON AND HE KNOW S AFTER THE WAR, BUSH AND OTHERS ARE BUILDING THIS INFRAS TRUCTURE TO CONTINUE FO RWARD. AND RESEARCHING DIVERSITY L IKE HARVAR D AND M.I.T. ARE GET A GOING TO BIG PIECE OF THIS ACTION . HE WRITES TO A COLLEA GUE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR THA T THERE IS AN OPPOR TUNITY THAT IS ABOUT TO BLOSSOM. ST ANFORD HAS A POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING A NATIONALLY INFLUENTIAL INSTITUTION LIKE HARVAR D OR COULD STATE LIKE DARTMO UTH. GOOD BUT NOT HAV ING A REAL EFFECT ON THE NATIONA L CONVERSATIO N. NOW, I DO N OT KNOW WHAT DARTMO UTH ADMINISTRAT ORS THEN OR NOW WHAT THEY C AN THAT ASSESSMENT. IT IS A LIT TLE BIT UNCHARITABLE. NOT WITH HA S ITS OWN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING. NONETHELESS , HE GOES BACK TO PALO ALTO A ND TALKS TO THE INCOMIN G PR ESIDENT OF THE UNIV ERSITY. A GUY NAMED WALLACE STERLING, HISTORIAN H E JOINED HIM IN SAYING THAT WE WILL TURN STANFORD INTO THE PR EMIER COL D WAR UNIVERSITY. WE WILL REO RGANIZE THE CURRICU LUM AND BUILD UP THE PHYSICS DEP ARTMENT, WE WILL BUILD UP SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS. A ND ENGINEERING, AND LABORAT ORIES THAT REALLY MEET EXACTL Y WHAT THE COLD WAR MILITAR Y WANTS US TO DO. AND NO OTHER UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD D ID THAT. THE A RCHITECTURE DEPARTMENT EVAPORATED. THEY DID AWAY WITH O THER THINGS TO BUILD UP SCIENCE AND ENGINEE RING . AND THEY FORMED THESE CLOSE ALLIA NCES WITH INDUST RY AND ENCOURA GED STUDENTS LI KE DAVID PACKA RD AND BILL HE WLETT TO START CO MPANIES N EARBY. THE Y ENCOURAGED TECHNOLOGISTS FROM ELSEWH ERE, A GUY NAMED EL SHOCKLEY , COINVENTOR OF THE TRANSISTOR, TO COME TO PALO ALTO AND SE T UP SHOP. , BILL SHOCKL EY. IN OTHER CO MPANIES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FOLLOWED. SO STANFORD WITH THIS H UB OF, NOT THE ONL Y FACTOR, BUT WASN'T INCR EDIBLE CRITICAL. SUSAN: ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE OUTS IDE SILICON VALLEY ASSOCIATE W ITH IS THE STOC K O PTIONS THAT MAKE PEOPLE SO WEALTHY. YOU WRITE T HAT THAT BEGAN IN 1957 WITH H EWLETT-PAC KARD. PROFESSOR O'MARA: HP WAS FOUNDED IN 1939 AND GOES PU BLIC IN 1957. FROM ITS FOUNDING, I T'S TWO FOUNDERS, HEWLETT AND PACKARD SET OUT TO FORM A D IFFERENT SORT OF COMPANY. ONE THAT WA S-THING ABOUT THE BIG BUS INESSES OF THE 1940'S AND 1950'S. THE BIG CORPORATION S, THE TRITE , TH E DETROIT AUTOMAKERS. THEY WANTED SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THEY WANTED A NONHIERARCHICAL COMPANY. NO CORNER O FFICES, NO MANAGERIAL SUITS AND T IES. NO UNIONS B ECAUSE THAT SIGNALS SOM ETHING IS WRONG WITH MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEE RE LATIONS IF YOU HAVE TO BE UNION, THEY ARE NOT GETTING ALONG. INST EAD, THEY WANTED TO C REATE SOME THING THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE A SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY. THAT WAS MUCH MORE E GALITARIAN , WHERE PEOPLE FELT FREE TO-DID NOT FEEL HEMMED IN B Y THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION . THAT THERE IS NO T AS MUCH OF A LADDER. WHE RE PEOPLE WORK SHORT-SLEEVED AND WANDERE D, WHAT HEWLETT AND PACKER CALLED IT W AS MANAGEMENT BY WALKING AROUND. RAT HER THAN CALL P EOPLE IN AND SEE WHA T THEY W ERE DOING, THEY WOULD BE ON THE S HOP FLOOR AND SEE WHAT WAS GO ING ON. SO THIS MERITOCRATI C IDEA, AND THEN EVERYONE GO T STOCK OPTIONS. NO T EVERYONE. N OT SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON T HE MANUFACTURING ASSEMBLY LINES. BUT THE WHITE-COLLAR EMPLOYEES D ID. EVERYO NE HAD STAKE IN THE COMP ANY 'S FINANCIAL SUCCESS. TH IS BECOMES THE MODEL THAT COMPAN Y AFTER COMPA NY AFTER COMPA NY IN THE VALL EY FOLLOWS. SUSAN: WE TALKED A BOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPAC E RACE, SPUTN IK LAUNCHED IN 1967. ALL THE MONEY FLOWING IN. I WANT TO FAST-FORWARD TO THE 1960 'S AND TALK ABOUT ONE GOVERNM ENT POLICY THAT CHANGED IN A BIG WA Y. LBJ SIGNING AN IMMIGRATION LAW. WE ARE HAVI NG A BIG IMMIGRATION DEBATE RIGH T NOW. HOW DO ES TH IS 1965 IMMIGRATION BILL FIGURE INTO THE HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY? PRO FESSOR O'MARA: IT IS INCREDIB LY IMPORTANT. I THINK THE 1965 IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQ UENTIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE LATTER HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THE FUNNY THING IS IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE THAT AT ALL. IN FACT, AS LYNDON J OHNSON IS SIGNING IT ON LIBERTY ISLAND IN OCTOBER, 1955, , 1965, HE SA ID IN HIS REMARKS THA T THIS IS NOT A RE VOLUTIONARY BILL. IT WA S SEEN AS CROSSING THE T'S AND DOT TING THE I'S ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN SOME WAYS. IT HAD BEEN A RACIALLY DISCRIMINAT ORY QUOTA SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRA NTS THE 1920'S AT A TIME ESTA BLISHED OF FIERCE A NTI -IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT. IT WAS VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY PREJUDICE A GAINST SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPEANS, CATHOLICS AND JEWS. P EOPLE WHO WERE SEEN AS OTHER AT THE TIME. THAT WAS HOLDING FAST UNTIL THE MID-1960'S. SO JOHNSON AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS P USHED THROUGH THI S IMMIGRATION REFORM. THA T WAS REALLY JUST ABOUT SUPPOSED TO SET THINGS RIGHT. THE ASSURANCE THAT JOHNSO N GAVE SOME O F HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS I NCLUDING SOUTHERN DE MOCRATS WHO WERE A LITTLE WO RRIED ABOUT WHAT THIS L IBERALIZAT ION OF IMMIGRAT ION MIGHT BRING, HE SAID THI S I S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYT HING. I T TURNS OU T IT DID. IT OPE NED U P AMERICA'S DOORS TO IMMIGRAN TS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. INCL UDING HUGE CHAINS OF IMMIGRAT ION FROM SOUTH AND E AST ASIA. MANY OF THESE IMMIGRANTS FROM TAIWAN , HONG KONG, INDIA AND C HINA E NDED UP IN SANTA CL ARA AND SILICON VAL LEY. THEY BECAME THE ENGINEE RING BACKBONE OF THE VALL EY. THEY GO ON TO FOUND CO MPANIES IN DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS. BY THE 1980'S, ONE THIRD OF THE COMPANIES I N THE VALLEY ARE FOUNDED BY PEOPLE W HO WERE BORN FROM EITHER INDI A OR CHINA. ON TOP OF THAT, TH ERE ARE PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES. YOU HAVE RE FUGEE PROGRAMS, REFUGEES FR OM THE FORMER SOVIET UNIO N. THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN GO ON TO FO UND COMPANIES. GOOGLE IS COFOUNDE D BY THE CHILD OF A SOVIET REFU GEE. YO U HAVE OTHER REFUGEES THAT COME E ARLIER IN AMERICA'S H ISTORY. AN DY GROVE, THE LEGENDARY LEADER OF I NTEL, HE WAS PENNILESS. HE CAME TO THE UNITED STAT ES AS A TEENAGER FROM HUNGARY AFT ER WORLD WAR II. NOTHING WOULD HAVE SIGNALED TO IMMIGRAT ION OFFICIALS THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BE ONE OF S ILICON VALLEY'S MOST INFLUE NTIAL LEADERS. AN D YET HE WAS. THAT I MMIGR ATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL AN D CONTINUES TO BE. THE FAC T THAT W HY IS SILICON VALLEY SO GREAT? I T I S NOT B ECAUSE AMERICANS ARE BETTER AT T ECHNOLOGY THAN EVERYO NE EL SE, THE AMERICAN SY STEM HAS ALLOWED THE FREE MOVEME NT OF PEOPLE AND CAPITAL. AN D IT HAS DRAWN PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD LIKE A MAGNET FROM ALL OV ER THE WORLD AS STUDENTS AND ENTREPR ENEU RS. TO THE VALLEY AND TO AMERICAN TECH CENTERS. TH AT HAS BEEN REALLY FUND AMENTAL TO WHAT WE HAVE TOD AY AMERICAN DO MINANCE IN THE TECH SP ACE. SUSA N: THE 1970'S ARE PIVOTAL DEC ADE, REA DING ABOUT. SO M UCH HAP PENED, WHAT ARE TH E MOS T CRITICAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE 1 970'S? PRO FESSOR O 'MARA: THAT WAS THIS MOMENT WHEN A NEW GENERATION , THE BABY BO OM GENERATION COMES OF AG E IN THE VALLEY. THE Y HAVE BEEN , THEY ARE PRODUCT S OF THIS SPACE RACE COLD W AR AGE PUSH TOWARD SCIENCE AND TECHNOL OGY. WHEN THEY ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUD ENTS, THEY WANT TO BECOME A STRONAUTS. WHEN THEY'RE IN COLLEGE, THEY GO TO THE C OLLEGE COMPUTER LAB AND LEA RN A BOUT PUNCHCARDS AND UNDERST AND HOW TO PROGRAM COM PUTERS AND HOW TO INTERFAC E W ITH COMPUTERS FOR THE FIR ST TIME. THEY WORKED ON TIME-SHA RING AND TERMINALS. THERE WERE ALSO COMING -OF-AGE IN THE VIETNAM ERA, THE WA TERGATE ERA, AN ERA WHEN GOVERN MENT IS INCREASINGLY SEEN AS, GO VERNMENT IS USING ITS POWER F OR DESTRUCTION, FOR CORRUPTION. YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMI NG UP WHO ARE MUCH MORE INTERE STED IN TURNING AWAY THE GOVERNM ENT AND , TURNING AWAY FROM B IG GOVERNM ENT AND BIG BUS INESS AND THINKIN G ABOUT USING COMPUTERS. WHO HAD COM PUTERS BEFORE THIS? IT WA S BIG COMPANIES AND BIG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THEY WERE S O BIG AND EXPENSIVE. THIS NEW GE NERATION WAS, HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS COMPETE OR POWER, THIS INCRED IBLY POWER MACHINE , INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MACHINE HOW CAN WE TAKE THESE AND USE THE M AS A TOOL FOR PERSONA L EMPOWERMENT ? HOW CAN WE MAKE IT PERSONAL? H OW CAN WE CHANGE THE INTERFACE? HOW CAN WE CHANGE IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IT OR NOT VERSED IN COMPUTER LANGUAGES. HOW CAN WE CREATE AN INTERFAC E SO ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN ACCESS AND USE THIS INCREDIBLE VISE. , TH IS INCREDIBLE DEVICE. HOW CAN WE CREATE A CO MMUNICATIONS NETWORK FOR COMPUTERS? THERE WAS A TECHNO OPTIMISM. THIS INCREDIBLE STATE BORN OUT OF THIS POLITICAL M OMENT THAT CAN'T BE SE PARATED FROM THE OTHER THINGS GOIN G ON IN THE UNITED STATES AT T HE TIME. AND I N THE BAY AREA AT THE TIME. THAT IS, TH ESE COMPUTERS WILL SAVE US. ALL THE SE T HINGS YOU SEE WRONG WITH THE WO RLD, WAR, INEQUITY, R ACISM AND SEXISM, IF WE HAVE CONTROL OF THESE CO MPUTERS AND WE ARE COMMUNI CATI NG WITH THEM AND CONNECT ING AND UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER , THEN THIS IS GOING TO FIX IT. SUSAN: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NAMES W E KNOW TODAY THAT CAME OUT OF THE HOMEBREW COMPUTER CL UB? PROFE SSOR O'MARA: THE TWO MOST FAMOUS NAMES THAT COME OUT OF IT ARE STEVE JOBS AND STEVE WOZNIAK. TH EY SHOW U P AT ONE OF THE FIRST MEETI NGS OF THIS RANGY GROUP OF COMPUTER HOBBYISTS. PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH PERSON AL COMPUTING AND SOLDERI NG T HEIR OWN MOTHERBOARD S. AND BUILDING THEIR OWN DEVICES . THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT GREW U P WITH RAD IO SETS IN THEIR BASEM ENTS. THEY GRADUATED TO BUILDING TH ESE MACHINES. T HEY SHOWED UP AS TWO YOUNG G UYS AND TH EY CAME IN HAULING THIS DEVICE THAT WOZNIAK HAS DESIGNE D. T HIS COMPUTER, THIS MOTHER BOARD THAT IS MORE ELEGANT AND SIMPLE AND SOPHISTICATED THAN ANYTHI NG ANYONE ELSE IS DOING. I T I S THE APPLE ONE. IT IS SO FUNNY, YOU CAN EAS ILY GOOGLE AN IMAGE OF THE ORIG INAL APPLE ONE. THEY H OUSED IT IN THIS WOODEN CASE. IT LO OKS LIKE SOMEONE BUILT IT IN HIGH SCH OOL SHOP CLASS. IT WAS VERY RUDIME NTARY. BUT INSIDE WAS A SOPHI STICATED DEVICE. THE HOMEBRE W CO MPUTER CLUB WAS THIS WAY FO R TEC HNOLOGISTS TO TRADE ON IDEAS. I T W AS VERY COLLABORATI VE. IT IS A WAY TO FIGURE OUT THIS TE CHNICAL HACK AND SHARE IT WI TH YOU. I T WAS NOT ABOUT MAKING MONEY OR COMMERCI ALIZING. YET. OUT OF THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT GREW S TEADILY, THEY HAD THIS MO NTHL Y MEETING, IT GETS BIG GER AND BIGGER. OUT OF THIS COMES AN IN DUSTRY, A WHOLE HOS T OF PERSONAL CO MPUTER CO MPANIES. APPLE IS ONE OF T HEM. THEY CREATE A TRANSFORM ATIVE NEW GENERATION OF MICRO-CO MMU NICATING. WHICH BECOM ES WHAT WE KNOW AS DESKTOP COM PUTING O R PERSONAL COMPUTING. SUSAN: AND LAWYERS? PR OFESSOR O 'MARA: I WANTED TO SHOW THE OT HER PART OF THIS SILICO N VAL LEY GALA PAGOS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHY A IT GREW A ND WHY IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSF UL. WHAT YOU HAVE IN SILICON VALLEY WHIC H YOU DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE EL SE YOU HAVE SP ECIALIZED VENTURE-CAPITAL FIRMS. THIS IS HIGH TECH V ENTURE CAPITAL. MA NY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VENTURE CAPITALISTS WERE FIRST ENGINEERS OR ENTAIL T ECHNOLOGY COPIES THEMSELVES. MANY CAME OUT OF THE SEMICON DUCTOR INDUSTRY. A ND THEIR G ENERATION, THE NEXT VENTUR E WAS TO START VENTURE CAP ITAL FIR MS. YOU SEE THI S AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE VALLEY. PEO PLE ARE IN ONE COMPANY AND DO WELL AND HAVE A GOOD IPO, THEY THEY G ET ACQUIRED AND THEN THEY BECOME INVE STORS THEMSELVES. THEN THEY ARE THE ONES MENTOR ING A ND PICKING THE WINNERS FOR THE NEXT GE NERATION. VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE REALLY CRITICAL. O NE THING, YOU HAVE AL L OF THESE COMPU TER CO MPANIES STARTING OU T OUT OF THIS HOB BYIST CO MMUNITY. WHAT SETS A PPLE APART IS THEY GET TH E VENTURE CAPITALISTS TO BACK THEM R EALLY EARLY. THEY GET VE NTURE-CAPITAL FUNDING FRO M ESTABL ISHED VENTURE CAPITALISTS. THEY ALSO G ET EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP FROM THIS GUY FROM INTEL. A GU Y NAMED MIKE MARKEL WHO CAME IN AND HE H AD MADE A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF M ONEY, HE W AS SEMIRETIRED IN HIS MID-30'S AN D IT DECIDES TO PUT A CHUNK OF MONEY INTO APPLE , PERSONALLY. AND THEN CO ME IN AS, ADULT SUPER VISION AS THEY CALL IT IN THE VALLEY. THE TWO STEVES WERE NOT CAPABLE OF RUNNING , THEY DID NOT HAV E MANAGERIAL EXPERIENCE AT ALL. THE Y WERE PRETTY UNCONVENTIONAL GUYS. SO MA RKULA CREATES AN ORGANIZA TIONAL STRUCTURE THAT IS MOR E LIKE A BUSINESS, SOMEWHAT TRADITIONAL . APPLE POSITIONS ITSELF AS A COUNTERCULTURAL COMPANY, A THINK DIFFERENT COMPANY, IT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH ORDINARY CO RPORATE AMERICA. THAN YOU MIGHT E XPECT. SUS AN: WE WILL RUN OUT OF TIME FOR AL L THE HISTORY BUT I WANTE D TO GET TO RONALD REAGAN. WE HAVE A CLIP OF RONALD R EAGAN TALKING ABOUT A VERY IMPO RTANT PROJECT TO HIM. THE ST RATEGIC DEFENSE INI TIATIVE, STI LET'S W ATCH THAT AND THEN TALK ABOUT THIS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR. H E COMES TO WASHINGT ON AND HOW HE IMPA CTS YOUR STORY. >> T HERE HAS BEEN A DESIRE TO DISCUSS SDI. AS OF ITS FUNDING TO BE DETERMIN ED BY DOMESTIC CO NSIDERATI ONS UNCONNECTED TO WHAT THE SOVIETS ARE DOING. SDI IS A VI TAL INSURANCE POLICY. A NECESSARY PART OF ANY NATIONAL SE CURITY ST RATEGY THAT INCLUDES DEEP REDUCT IONS IN STRATEGIC WEAPONS. IT IS A CORNERSTONE OF OUR SECU RITY STRATEGY FOR THE 1970'S AND BEYOND. , THE 1990'S AND BEYOND. WE WILL RESEARCH AND DEVELOP IT AND WHEN IT IS READY WE WILL IT. , WE W ILL DEP LOY IT. SUSAN: LOTS OF MON EY COMING INTO THIS. HOW DID IT AFFECT SILICON VAL LEY? PRO FESSOR O'MARA: SDI WAS REALLY A SUPERCOMPUT ING PROJECT. IN ORDER TO WO RK IT WOULD REQUIRE IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF COMPETING POWER. SO IT BECOM ES THIS INCREDIBLE RESOURCE FO R COMPUTER SCIENCE AND OTHER R ELATED DISCIPLINES . A LOT OF TH E COMPUTER SCIENTISTS THE FUNNY THING IS, IN SILICON VAL LEY WERE VERY MUCH AGAINS T SDI. THEY W ERE, A NUMBER OF THEM WERE AGAINS T IT TECHNICA LLY . THEY WERE LIKE, THIS IS NOT GOING T O WO RK. THERE IS A POSSIB ILITY FOR ERROR AND E RROR WOULD BE CATASTROPHI C. IT WOULD RE QUIRE SO MUCH. WE AR E NOT THE RE YET, TECHNO LOGIC ALLY. IT REMINDS ME ABOUT SOME OF THE CONV ERSATIO NS ABOUT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AN D DRIVERLESS CARS. PEOPL E ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET. BUT AL SO PHILOSOPHIC ALLY. THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDIN G CO MPUTERS, PROGRAMMING COMPUTERS, WHO ARE ON THE FACULTY OF STANFORD OR WORKING AT RESEARCH INSTITUTES LIKE SRI IN THE VALLEY, THEY ARE THE ANTIWAR GENERATION. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SEE, YO U KNOW, THEY WANT TO MAKE PEACE, NOT WAR. THEY A RE POLITICALLY AND PHILOSO PHICALLY OPPOSED TO WHAT THE RE AGAN ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. A ND SO, BUT THIS IS ONE OF T HE WONDERFUL T HINGS AND IT IS UNDER STANDING THIS RELATIONSHI P AND HOW IT EVOLVED. YO U HAVE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE ARE THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF SOME OF THIS MONEY. THE MONEY K EEPS ON FLOWING. BECAUSE IT'S COMING THROUGH DAR PA AND A LL THESE AGENCIES. AND IT IS A LOT OF IT IS GOING, TOWARD COMP UTING. EVEN SOME O F THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE BIG GEST BENEFICIARIES ARE SIMULTANEOU SLY PROTESTING AND PICKETI NG. AND HAVING MEETINGS AND WRITING OPE N LETTERS. THIS ABILITY TO DISSENT WHILE STILL BEING PART OF THE SYSTEM I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPO RTANT. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT COMPE TITION WITH CHINA IN TECHNOLOGY. THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS POLITI CAL SYSTEM, RECOGNIZING HOW MUCH TH E AMERICA N POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS MADE SILICON VALLEY POSSIBLE , NOT ALWAYS INTENTIONAL LY, SOMETIMES IT HAS BEEN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE S. THE IMMIGRATION ACT BEING A N EXAMPLE OF THAT. THERE 'S BEEN EXAMPL E AFTER EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE. TH AT IS THIS INTERP LAY THAT I FIND SO I NTERESTING . REALLY IMPO RTANT IN UNDERSTANDING , IF WE'RE TA LKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN N EXT AND WH AT IS THE ROLE OF WASHINGT ON. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIS HISTORY AND THESE I NTERESTING COMPLEXITIE S. AND THE DIS TINCTIVE, ONLY IN AMERICA ASPECT OF SO MUCH OF IT. SUSAN: THE NEXT CL IP, I WAN T TO FAST-FORWAR D TO THE CLIN TON ADM INISTRAT ION FOR WHOM YOU WORKED, AND AL GORE. THIS IS BEFORE THEY TOOK OFFICE AND THE SUMMIT THE PULLED TOGE THER TO ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURS. >> A LOT OF TH E INVESTMENT WE HAVE MAD E IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES IT EA SIER FOR US TO MOVE ARO UND RESOURCES THAT USED TO BE MORE IMPORTANT. THEY ARE STILL IMPORTANT. BUT IF THE KEY RESOURCES K NOWLEDGE, TODAY, SHOULDN'T WE BE GIVIN G A LOT MORE EMPHASIS TO THE KIND OF NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEE D TO SHARE INFORMATION AND CREATE AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE L IKE THE IN FORMATION SUPERHIGHWA Y'S REFERRED TO EARLIER, THE DIGITAL LIB RARIES AND SOFTWAR E AND PROGRAMS THAT MAKE I T POSSIBLE FOR CHILDREN TO COME HOM E AFTER SCHOO L AND PLUG IN TO THE LI BRARY OF CONGRESS. S USAN: DURING THE CLINTON MINISTRATION WITH GORE T HIS WAS THE BOOM IN SILICON VAL LEY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. HOW RESPONSIBLE WAS ADMINISTRAT ION AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES FO R THAT BOOM? PROFESSOR O 'MARA: THE GOVERNMENT PLAYED A BI G ROLE. I LOVED THA T CLIP. THE O THER P ERSON, THE CLOSE-UP SHOT WAS JO HN SCULLY, THEN CEO OF APPL E. THER E, DURING 1992 AND 1993, HE APPEARS SITTING NEXT TO HILLARY CLINTON. AT THE FIRST STATE OF TH E UNION IN 1993. WHAT AL GORE TALKS ABOUT IN THIS CLIP, THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY AND ALSO TH IS NOTION OF INFRASTRUCT URE. YOU DID HAVE TO HAVE THA T THIS W AS THE BAS IC, FOUNDATIONAL , INFRASTRUCT URE FOR THE INT ERNET BOOM TO HAPPEN. THE INTERNET THAT EXISTED SINCE 1969 AS A NETWORK FOR RESEARCHERS , MILITARY PEOPLE, DIFFERENT P ARTS OF THE DEFENSE RESEARCH ES TABLISHMENT AND ALSO ACADEMIC RE SEARCHERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH O THER. IN T HE 1980 'S, IT GRADUALLY STARTS OPEN ING UP. BUT UP UNTI L 1991 IT WAS THE WALLED GARD EN OF THE INTERNET. Y OU COULD NOT DO ANY SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION S WHATSOEVER. YOU COULD HAVE, COMPANIES COULD HAVE A.COM DOMAIN BUT THEY COULD NOT BUY OR SELL ON IT. IT WAS VERY LIMITED. WH AT HAPPENS IN THE EARL Y 1990'S, IN THE LATE YEARS OF THE GEORGE H W BUSH AD MINI STRATION AND THE EAR LY YEARS OF THE CLIN TON ADMINISTRAT ION IS THIS LAYING DOWN OF INFRASTRUCT URE. THIS INCLUDED YO UNG POLITICAL AND LIKE ME. I WAS W ORKING ON OTHER THINGS, I WAS NOT W ORKING ON TECHNOLOGY AT THE TIME . LIKE WHAT I S THIS INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY STUFF, NO ONE UNDE RSTOOD IT. WE WERE WORKING ON HEALTH CARE REFORM AND OTHER THING S THAT SEEMED MORE CENTRAL. THERE WERE A FEW LAWMAKERS, BUT AL GORE BEING ONE OF THEM. NE WT GINGRICH WAS ANOTHER. WH O IN THE EARLY 1980'S AND 1990'S ARE KEEPING THEIR EYE ON THE BALL OF RECOGNIZING THAT YOU HAVE TO LAY DOWN TH E BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALLOW T HIS INTERNET BACKBONE TO BECOME , NOT REGULATED I N TERMS OF WHAT COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES COULD HAPPEN ON TOP OF I T BUT CREATING A NETWORK. TH AT THE GO VERNMENT IS ENCOURAG ING ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION TO H APPEN. SO THERE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT R OLE THE GOVERNMENT PLAYED. SUS AN: YOU ALSO REPORT IN THE BOOK THAT AL GORE WAS ON THE BOAR D OF APPLE AND BECAME A HUNDRED M ILLIONAIRE IN THE PROCESS. HO W IMPORTANT IS THAT IN TEL LING THE STORY FOR PEOPLE WHO LEAVE O FFICE AND MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN TH IS FIELD? PROF ESSOR O'MARA: AL GORE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL FIGURE.

ALSO, I N THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT H E PLAYED BEING THE TECHIE IN C HIEF FO R THE CLINTON ADMINISTRAT ION. ALSO THE IMMENSE WEA LTH AND SUCCESS HE HAD AFTERWA RDS. IN THE LAST 25 YEARS, S ILICON VAL LEY HAS GOTTEN LARGER AND WEALTHIER. THERE HAS B EEN MUCH MORE TRAFFIC BACK AND FO RTH BETWEEN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND TH E VALLEY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN ONE AND MOV E TO ANOTHER OR VICE VERSA. THER E ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE VALL EY NOW WHO OF THE CLINTON, , BUSH 2 AND OBAMA A DMIN ISTRAT IONS WHO ARE NOW WORKING IN THESE COMPANIES. A LOT OF TH EM, THEIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE-T HESE VALLEY COMPANIES ARE VERY IM PORTANT FORCES IN WASHINGTON, D.C. POLITICS. THEY HAVE GROWN THEIR LOBBING OPERATION SIGNIFICANT LY. IN THE 1990'S, THEY DID NO T HAVE LOBBYISTS. MICROSOFT H AD ONE GUY WORKING UP IN BETHE SDA . O UT OF HE WOULD CARRY STUFF IN TH E BACK OF HIS JEEP. SUSAN : NOW HOW LARGE IS THEIR LOBBI NG GROUP? PROF ESSOR O'MARA: SOME OF THE BIGG EST LOB BYING OP ERATIONS IN WASHINGT ON TODAY ARE THE BIG FIVE TECH COMPANIES. SUSAN: PRESUMABLY THE MICROSO FT ANTITRUST SOON HAD LOT TO DO WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THAT W E IMPORTANT IN THEIR DEVOUT MEAN T. PROF ESSOR O'MARA: IT WAS A BI G WAKE-UP CALL. GAETZ FAMOUSLY JO KED WHEN THE FTC WAS STA RTING TO BRING EN FORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT I N THE EARLY 1990'S, GAE TZ , GA TES SCOFF ED, THE WORST T HING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ME IN WASHI NGTON IS I COULD FALL DOWN T HE STEPS OF THE FTC AND BREAK M Y NECK. [LAUGHTER] IT TURNS OU T THAT MICROSOFT DID NOT HAV E TO BREAK UP. BUT IT CAME OUT WI TH GU ARD RAILS ON WHAT IT COULD DO. I T CAME OUT MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS AN D CONSTRA INED. PERHAPS LESS WILLIN G TO DIVE IN TO NEW M ARK ETS AND THE AGGRESS IVE FOP FASHION IT HAD BEFORE. PART OF IT WAS A NEW TECH GENERA TION WAS GROWING. IT IS NOT L IKE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GOOGLE HAD MICROSOFT NOT BEEN HEMMED DOWN . OF CO URSE, WE DO NOT KNOW. COUNT ERFACTUAL HISTORY IS IMPOSSIBLE. THIS NEW GE NERATION WAS GROWING. THIS HAPPEN S AGAIN AND AGAIN. THIS REGENE RATION OF TECH, THE COMPANIES THAT ARE BI G NOW WILL NOT BE FOREVER. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHO WE ARE TALKING ABO UT 25 YEARS FROM NOW AND WHA T RELATIONSHIP THEY WILL H AVE TO THE COMPANIES OF RIGHT NO W. SUSAN: A VERY QUIC K CLIP BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF TIME. IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS JUST 2011 AND THE FIRST TWEET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WITH BARACK OBAM A HERE. >> I' M GOING TO MA KE HISTORY HERE AS THE FIRS T PRESIDENT TO LIVE-TWE ET. WE HAVE A C OMPUTER OVER HERE. ALL R IGHT. HERE IS THE QUESTION. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT, WHAT COSTS WOULD YOU CUT AND WHICH I NVESTMENTS WOULD YOU KEEP? THE R EASON I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN IMPO RTANT QUESTION, IS BECAUSE AS ALL OF Y OU KNOW, WE ARE GOING THROU GH A SPIRITED DEBATE HERE IN WAS HINGTON. BUT IT IS IMPORTAN T TO GET THE WHOLE COUNT RY INVOLVED. S USAN: THAT WAS ONLY 2011. NOW W E HAVE A TWEE TING PR ESIDENT WHO HAS USED TH IS PLATFORM. BUT THE TO THOUSAND S AND THE 2010S ARE THE STORY O F THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDI A AND H OW IMPORTANT IT BECAME AS A PLATFORM. AS WE TELL THE STORY W E ARE NOW COMING FULL CIRCLE. WHA T GUARANTEE IS THERE THAT SILICO N VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DOMINANCE IT HAS? IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE HEARING THE HUAWEI STORY. CHIN A HAS CERTAIN INTENTIONS. RUSSIA HAS BEEN A MAJOR PLA YER AND USING DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIE S. THERE ARE OTHER NONST ATE ACTORS THAT ARE USING SOCIA L MEDIA. HOW DOES SILICON VALLEY PRES ERVE THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT HAS PLAYED? PRO FESSOR O'MARA: YES . LOOKIN G BACK TO ITS HISTORY AND RECOGNI ZING THE FOUNDATIONAL NATURE OF P UBLIC POLI CY AND CREATING AN ENTREPRE NEU RIAL SANDBOX FOR LACK OF A BETTER ANALOGY. WH AT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID IS TO P UT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TE CHNOLOGIES DIRECTION AND THEN GOT OU T OF THE WAY. THE IN TERNET-PART OF THE DILEMMA OF SOCIAL MEET AT RIGHT NOW, IS THA T IT IS AN UN REG ULATED SPACE. FUNNILY ENO UGH, THAT IS WHAT AL LOWED THESE COMPANIES TO BLOSSOM. IN THE 1990'S WHEN THE RU LES OF THE ROAD WERE BEING LAID DOWN, THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE WAS A CHOICE MA DE, AN AGREEMEN T THAT THE INTERNET COMPANIES W OULD SELF REGULATE. T HAT WAS MA DE IN ORDER TO ENCOURAG E FREE SPEECH AND CONVERS ATION ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE IN THAT TIME, THE BIG WORRY WAS THE BIG BUSINESSES, MEDIA WAS CABLE, COMCAST, TIME WARNER. NOW YOU HAVE THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE PERHAPS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL OF OUR MEDIA COMBINED IN SOME WAYS, IN SO ME PLACES. SO, WILL IT CONTINUE TO DOMINATE? T HESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MAKING INVE STMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY LIKE AI, AU TONOMOUS VEHICLES AN D ON AND ON. IN HIGHER EDUC ATION, THE U.S. HAS DRAWN BACK. THE U .S. IS DRAWING BACK FROM THE OP EN DOORS OF ALLOWING THE BEST AN D BRIGHTEST FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO EASILY COME HERE AND BE ENCOURAGED TO COME HERE AND CR EATE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THERE ARE W AYS IN WHICH WE CAN CREATE THIS FOUNDATION.

I' M EXTREME LY E XCITED THA T YOU'RE STATION, IT SHOWS YOU, THAT PROGRAM, WH AT WE CAN DO AS HUMAN BEING S IF W E REALLY W ANT TO ACCOMPLI SH SOMETHING DIFFICULT. IT'S THE MO ST COMPLE X, HIGHLY TECHNOLOGIC AL PROGRAM EVER CONCEIVED AND EXECUTE D BY PEOPLE . IT INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS DIFFERENT C OUNTRIES W ITH DIFFERENT AGENDAS, DIFFERENT L ANGUAGES.

A T THE END OF THE DAY, PEOPLE THAT WORK I N SPACE AR E PASSIONATE ABOUT SPACE.

IT I S PRETTY REFRESHING IN MANY CAS ES. >> I WILL JUST TALK D OLLARS QUICKLY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT COSTS TO DE VELOP THE SHUTTLE, IT WAS BETW EEN $30 BILLION AND $40 BIL LION. THE SHUTTLE PRO GRAM WAS ABOUT $ 3 BILLION PER YEAR. THAT GOT YO U ABO UT F OUR TO FIVE FIG HTS PER YEAR DEPENDING ON THE YEAR . IF YOU JUST LO OK AT THE WAY THE COM MERCIAL CREW PROGRAM IS EVEN HOL DING, FO R THE COS T OF OPE RATING THE SPACE S HUTTLE PRO GRAM FOR TWO YEARS, A LITTLE BI T OVER THAT, YOU ARE GET TING TWO DIFFERENT PROVIDERS T HAT ARE CONTRAC TED TO DO A FUL L DEVELOPMENT , TO TEST FLI GHT S AND SIX SERVICE FLIGHTS BACK AND FO RTH TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON. JUST LOOKIN G AT THE DOLLAR VALU E, TURNOUTS WO ULD BE A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR T HE AMERICAN TAXPAYER WH EN THEY EXECUTE. WHERE DOES THAT R EINVESTMENT DOLLAR GET PAID? I THINK THE INTENT IS T O REINV EST THAT INTO E XPLORATION TECHNOLOGY TO GET US T O THE MOON AND BACK TO MAR S. THE IDEA BE ING, LIKE I SAID EARLIER, LE T'S INVEST IN LOWER ORBIT AND P ROVIDE AN GETTING CAR GO BACK AND FO RTH. NOW SOON TO BE HUMANS BACK AND FO RTH THERE AND I ALLOW A NAS A TO GO BEYOND LOWER ORBIT WITH THAT TAXPAYER INVESTMENT. DEANNA: WE' RE GOING TO TRANSITION TO THE AUDI ENCE FOR QUESTIONS.

A NE W MILITARY BRANCH WAS CREATED LAST YEAR. SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A N EW MILITAR Y BRANCH FOR THE ARMED SERVICES. W ITH YOUR REAL-W ORLD EXPERIENCE OF SPACE, YOUR PERSPECTIVES ARE VERY VA LUAB LE TO MAKE SUR E THE NEW BRANCH COUL D OPERATE TO ITS MAXI MUM EFF ICIENCY AND DELIVER THE BEST VALUE. I WOULD JUS T LIKE TO ASK THE PANEL TO SH ARE SOME OF YOUR VIEWS. ALSO MAYBE SOME SPECIF IC SUGGESTIONS. SO THE SPAC E FORCE WILL BE OPERATED ACCORDINGLY . DEANNA: THE QUESTION IS, YOUR VIEWS OF SPACE FORCE. >> O R SUGGESTI ONS AS WELL. CMDR. STAFF ORD: THE WAY THE FORCE HAS BEEN EV OLVED OVER THE YEARS STARTED WIT H ARMIES AND LATER SOMEONE INV ENTED A NAVY, AND THAT WE NT ON FOR YEARS. BUT WHO INVENTED THE BOAT AND TH E WHEEL. IN T HE AIR. I THIN K THE FIRST SHOT EVER FIRED WAS ITALIAN, ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN 1910. AND S OME FIGHT IN THE BALKANS AND SOMEONE FIRED OUT OF THE BACK SEAT. I DO NOT KNOW THEY HIT ANYBODY . BU T THEN AIR BECAME A DOMAIN OF FORCE PR OJECTION. AND SO, ALL YOU ARE DOING IN THIS CASE, YOU ARE GOING HIGHER AND YOU ARE GOING FASTER. TO THINK TH AT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE, I TH INK IS A LITTLE NAIVE. WE A RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHAT T HE CH INESE ARE DOING WITH HYPERSONIC GUIDANCE. A ND THAT IS OUT IN SPAC E. DEAN NA: DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO TAKE THAT. [LAUG HTER] DEANNA: WE HAVE INTERNAL VIEWS ON 'S UP HERE. NEXT QUESTI ON. >> MY NAME IS DAN BAKER FROM THE UN IVERSITY OF COLORADO . I 'M A PRACTITIONER OF SPACE WE ATHER. , SPACE RADIATION A S A CONCERN , SPACE WEATH ER. MA NY OF YOU ON THE PANEL MENTIONED RADIATION AS A CONCER N. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO YO U IN YOUR MIND FOR THE FUTURE TO HAVE FORECAST OF WHAT THE SP ACE ENVIRONMENT IS GOING TO BE, AND TO HAVE ADEQUATE WARNING FOR THE MOR E TRANSIENT S PACE RADIATION E FFECTS. >> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ASTRONAUTS BUT NOT NEA RLY AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS FO R US ON THE PLANET. SPACE WEATH ER TODAY, I'M SPEAKING TO THE CHOIR, IT IS HOW WE ANTI CIPATE PROBLEMS TO COMMUNICATIONS. WE HAVE BEE N VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD A MAJOR SPA CE WEATHER OCC URRENCE THAT HAS KN OCKED OUT SATELLITE COMMUNICATI ONS AND THE LIKE. WITH THAT I S A POSSIBILITY . , BUT THAT IS A POSSIB ILITY. MAJ. GEN. B OLDEN : I THINK LONG BEFORE WE N EED TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS THE RISK TO A CREWMEMBER FLYING IN SPACE, WE HAVE TO CON TINUALLY HAVE AN ONGOING IMPROVING, TECHNOLOGICALLY DEVELOPING SPACE WEATHER CAPABILITY JUST TO PRO TECT US HERE ON THE PLANET. >> I THINK SOME OF THE IDEAS F LOAT ED ON PROTECTING ASTRONAUTS FROM SPACE RADIATION, AND I UNDER STAND THERE ARE BEING M ADE IN POLYMERS, BUT ONE OF THE MOST PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS I'VE SEEN I S TO ESSENTIALLY CREATE AN E FFECTIV E VAN ALLEN BELT AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. WHICH OF COURSE IS EXTREMEL Y POWER INTENSIVE. THIS IS A P ROBLEM WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SOLVE. CAPT. FERGU SON: WHILE I STRONGLY ADVOCATE THE PREDICTION OF SUCH EVE NTS , I DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD WE ARE GOING TO GE T. TO SAY , HEY , WE ARE GOOD FOR THREE Y EARS. FOR YOUR TH REE YEARS TRIP TO MARS. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BEAT THE PROBLEM . MR. KOENIGS MANN: FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I WATCH THE SPACE WEATH ER EVERY TIME WE LAUNCH. IT HAS A DI FFERENT EFFECT IN THE SENS E THAT YOU CARE ABOUT LIFE ON BOA RD AND THE OTHER ELECT RONICS RATHER THAN WIND IN THE UPPE R ATMOSPHERE. IT IS A FACTOR THAT GOES INTO THE WHOLE PICTURE, TH E WHOLE ENVIRONMENT . DEANNA: WE WILL TAK E THE NEXT QUESTION. R IGHT HERE. >> FROM A COMM ERCIAL PERSPECTIVE , WHAT IS THE END GOAL? WHERE YOU SEE THIS PROGRA M IN 25 YEARS OR 50 YEARS. WHAT IS YOUR VISION ? AND IT COULD BE AN YONE IN THE PANEL. MR. KOENIGS MANN: IT IS GOOD QUESTION. WE WERE CUR RENTLY ON FIXED CONTR ACTS. AND THANKFULLY, ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS FOUND THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISCRIMINAT ORS. THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF M ONEY YOU GET AND THA T YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. IS NOT QUIT E LIKE THAT. WE DO GET SOME SU PPORT, OBVIOUSLY. AND WE WORK AS A TEAM ALWAYS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MONEY IS FINITE T HAT YOU GET FOR SOMETHI NG. THAT IS THE MODEL I CAN SEE HELPING THE COST KE EPING IN CONTROL BECAUSE WE ARE VERY COST CONSCIOUS. IT IS NOT B ILLABLE HOURS LIKE YOU HA VE IN OTH ER PROFESSIONS . SO, BECAUSE THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT COST P LUS IS. IT IS BILLABLE HOURS AND IT GOES UP SO THE INTE NT IS NOT THERE TO KEEP A L OW COST. I SEE THIS AS A CURRENTLY, WE KEEP THESE CONTR ACTS THAT WAY. BECAUS E IT IS MORE OF A SERVICE. AN D I FORGO T WHO SAID IT, IT COULD BE LI KE A SERVICE THAT YOU BOOK IT LIK E YOU BOOK YOUR TICKET BASI CALLY, YOU'RE A CERTAIN AMO UNT OF MONEY TO BRING STUFF FROM THE GROUND TO THE MOON. AND S OME AM OUNT OF MONEY THAT GOES TO MAR S. FUNDAMENTAL LY, COST MUST COME DOWN D RAMAT ICALLY IN THE NEXT 25 YEARS IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK. IN OR DER TO MAKE THE WHOLE ECONOMICS OF IT CLOSE . OTHERWISE I T MIGHT BE TOO EXPENSI VE. DR. MAGNUS: IN A PERFECT WORLD, 25 O R 50 YE ARS FROM NOW, THE COST OF LAUNCH WILL HAVE COME DOWN. SO PE OPLE LIKE YOU GUYS WHO ARE VERY CR EATI VE AND HAVE GOOD EXPERT ISE IN CERTAIN AREAS, HAVE AN OPP ORTUNITY TO GO HAVE THESE PERCE PTION SHIFTS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. AN D THEN THE CREATIVE JUICES FLOW , AND YOU THINK OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IN LOW EARTH ORBIT IN MI CROGRAVIT Y. OUR BUSINESS IDEAS. WHAT WE ARE REALLY MISSING NOW IS THAT PIE CE. WE HAVE A L OT OF CAPABILITIES THAT WILL C OME ONLINE. WE HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT HOW TO DEVELOP THE MARKETS FOR THE USE CASES FOR T HE BROADER PRI VATE ENTERPRISE. SO, GETTING THE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO GET UP THERE AND HAVE GOOD I DEAS, FIGU RING OUT OTHER PLATFORMS B EYOND THE SPACE STATION, AND WHAT OT HER KINDS OF ADVENTURES WE CAN CREA TE AN SPACE, 25 T O 50 YEARS FR OM NOW I AM HO PING THAT WE HAVE STA RTED TO SOLVE THOSE PROBL EMS AN D YOU SEE THAT WEDGE OF ACTIVITY BECOMING SORT OF NOR MAL. >> I AM THE ET ERNAL OPT IMIST. HOWEVER, TH IS IS ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME. BECAUSE WE ALL TALK ABOUT 25 TO 50 YEARS FR OM NOW. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT LONG. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE SESSI ON , SPACE STATI ON IS A MACHINE. AN D ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, MOST OF YOU , OUR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTI STS I AM NEITHE R BUT I HAVE BEEN AROUND YOU LONG EN OUGH TO KNOW THAT MACHINES BR EAK. MAJ. GEN. BOLDEN: WE HAVE PROBAB LY FOUR TO EIG HT YEARS, I THINK, OF LIFE LEFT O N THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON. MONEY IS NOT GOIN G TO HELP THAT. WE JUST YOU DO NOT HAVE A WAY TO GET ENOU GH PIECES AND PARTS THERE TO REFURBISH IT AND MAKE IT NEW. SO SOMETHING H AS TO STEP INTO ITS PLACE. SO W E WILL BE EXA CTLY WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE SHOT THE SPACE SHUTT LE, WE WILL SHO OT THE STATION WIT H NOWHERE TO GO. SOMEBODY HA S TO COME UP WITH A BUSINESS CASE THAT H ELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS VALUE IN GOING INTO LOW EARTH ORBIT AND HAVING A PH ARMACEUTI CAL LABORATORY. THERE IS VA LUE IN GOING INTO LOW WHERE'S ORB IT AND HAVING A MATERIALS PROCESSING LABORATORY. BECAUSE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED ALL OF THAT ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON NOW FOR 19 YEARS. THAT IS WHA T THE SPACE STATION'S P URPOSE WAS , TO DEMONSTRATE FOR PEOPLE IN B USINESS THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY POTENTIAL MONEYMAKING VENTURE. AN D UNTIL S OMEBODY BUYS THAT CASE AND MA KE THE INVESTMENT, AND SAYS I' M GOING TO PUT A PLATFORM UP THERE. I TH OUGHT B OB BIGELOW WAS GOING TO DO IT. H E HAS HAD THE BEAM ON THE INTE RNATIONAL SPACE STATION NOW FOR FOU R OR FIVE YEARS AND IT HAS NOT STEPPED OFF YET. SO AM I BEING CRITICAL? YOU BET I AM. B ECAUSE NASA SPENT A LOT OF MO NEY, THE GOVERNMENT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ALLOWING THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO GO AND USE THIS TE ST FACILITY SO THEY COULD STEP OFF AND GO MAKE MONEY. YOU DO NOT MAKE MONEY IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE A RISK. AND H ANGING AROUND THE INTERNA TIONAL SPACE STATION IS RISKY IN ONE RESPECT. BU T IT IS NOT A BUSINESS RISK. BECAU SE YOU'RE HAVING ROOM AND BO ARD PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNM ENT. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HA VE ENOUGH MONE Y, FOR ALL OF YOU CONSERVATIVES WHO BELIEVE IN THE FREE MARKET , YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. JUMP OFF TH E INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON AND BUILD THE LOW EARTH ORBIT INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO HAVE WE ARE GOING TO SUCCESSF ULLY SEND HUMANS BACK TO THE MOON AND ONTO MARS. ENOUG H FROM ME. [A PPLAUSE] >> JUST TO BRI NG THE POINT HOME. BOEIN G AND SPACEX AT NO SMALL COST TO THE TAXPAYERS ARE DEVELOP ING TWO NEW CAPABIL ITIE S TO GET BACK AND FORTH T O LO W EARTH ORBIT. WE H AVE ONE CUSTOMER RI GHT NOW, THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON. WE NEED OTHER MARKETS TO EVOLVE. IT HAS TAKE N NINE YEARS TO GET THIS FAR. THIS IS THE FIRS T T IME WE HAVE DONE THIS A S A COUNTRY IN 40 YEARS SINCE WE DE VELOPED T HIS SPACE SHUTTLE. WI THOUT A DESTINATI ON 2028 OR A COMMERCIA L MARKET THAT BUILDS , WILL WE REALLY B E READY TO RETIRE THE CAPABIL ITIES TO GET BACK WITH HUMANS. ? I SURE HOPE NOT. C MDR. STAFF ORD: YESTERDAY I MENTIONED HOW FAST THE APOLLO PROG RAM WAS TURNED ON. IT WAS DONE IN ABOUT TH REE WEEKS . IN T HE SAME WA Y, THE SPACE EXPLORATION INITIATIVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH SENIOR STARTED, ST ARTED OFF BY WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON WHE N HE WAS IN OFFICE. BUSH STARTE D OFF, BOOM. AND IN THE OBAM A ADMINISTRATION, THE CONSTEL LATION PROGRAM. I DO NOT KN OW WHO WILL WIN THE ELECTIO N A YEAR FROM NOW, BUT THAT COULD BE TU RNED OFF REALLY FAST, WHAT WE HAVE THERE. SO I CANNOT FORECAST WHO IS GOING TO BE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE I N THE NEXT TWO OR THREE CYCLES. BUT THAT CA N GO ON AND IT CAN GO OFF. THAT I S THE BIG RISK. DEANN A: NEX T QUESTION. > > HANS, I'M G LAD YOU CAN SEE WELL. W HAT ABOUT THE COMPETITION, JEFF BEZOS VERSUS SPACEX. THE IR COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ROCKET PLANS AND IT TOOK OFF AND THA T IS QUITE AMAZING. IS THAT SERIOUS COMPETITION TO SPACEX? MR. KOENIGSMANN: I WOULD DEFIN ITELY SAY, THEY ARE COMPETI TION . THEY ARE BUILDING GREAT VEHIC LES. A ND WE ARE AHEAD OF THE GAME RIGHT NOW. THERE IS ONE BIG STEP A ROCK ET NEEDS TO DO AND THAT IS GO TO OR BIT. AND THAT IS IN SOME CASES, HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE HARDER THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. I HAVE LEARNED THA T MYSELF. IT IS HARD TO GET TO O RBIT. SO WE HAVE THAT ADVANTAGE N OW. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS COMPETIT ION AND WE WELC OME COMPETITION . WE FEEL LIKE IT GIV ES US AN EDGE BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN A PUSH TO WORK HAR DER. WE PUSH TO WORK ON LOW ERING THE COST AND BECOMING THE BEST CO MPETITOR AMONG OTHER COMPE TITORS . DEANNA: NEXT QUESTI ON. > > HELLO MY NAME IS TOM JONES, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSI N AT MADISON. I WANT TO THA NK THE ACADEMY AND THE PANEL FOR A N EXCITING SESSION. SI NCE WE HAVE A L OT OF ENGINEERS IN THE ROOM, I WAN T TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE F UTURE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE. A ND STRIKING RIGHT BALAN CE BETWEEN SPEED AND S AFETY. WE HAVE SEEN D URING THE SESSION, AND THE INC REDIBLE ADVANCES THAT ARE BEING M ADE, DRIVEN BY COMPETITION , IN TERMS OF ADVANCES VERY RAPIDL Y. IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY, ARGUABLY NOT FAST EN OUGH. BUT IN THE LAST YEAR, WE CAN SEE THAT SP EED CAN LEAD TO SCREW UPS WITH RE GARD S TO BASIC LAWS OF AEROSPACE E NGINEERING IN TERMS OF REDUNDAN CY. SO FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE BET WEEN THOSE TWO IS A CHALLENGE . I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE PANELISTS M IGHT COMMENT ON ABOUT WHAT IS GOI NG ON AND WHAT THE FUTURE HOLD S, THE ROLE OF NASA ON THE ONE HEA D OF ADVOCACY AND ON THE OTHER H AND INVOLVED IN DARE I USE THE TERM REGULATION OR PROVIDIN G THAT SAFEGUARD AGAINST A KIND OF D ISASTER THAT WOULD BE A BLOW F OR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IF APPOSITE , A MOMENT. DEA NNA: I THINK THE HEART OF THE QUES TION IS ABOUT HOW DO YOU BALA NCE SPEED AND SAFETY? CMD R. STAFFORD: Y OU NEED TO HAVE BOTH. SAFET Y IS A MINDSET AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. HANS AND I WERE TALK ING AT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING. TH E SAFETY MINDSET SAYS WE MAY 2 SE CONDS FROM LAUNCH AND I DO NOT FE EL WELL AND I SAY STOP. THAT IS THE CRITICAL PART, IS HAVING P EOPLE WHO HAVE THE ETHICAL BACKGROUND TO SAY, THIS IS NOT RIGHT. THE SHORTCUTS WE ARE TAKING ARE NOT RIGHT. AND YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE AN D A JUST IT AS NECESSARY. THE GOVERNM ENT DOING IT, NASA DOING IT, DOES NOT MEAN, BECAU SE WE GENERALLY TAKE LONGER , THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE ANYMORE SAFE THAN THE PR IVATE SECTOR. GOI NG SLOW DOES NOT GUARANT EE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAFE EITHER. [LA UGHTER] , EITHER. IT GIVES YOU MORE TI ME TO DO STUPID STUFF. [LAUGHTER] >> IS THE DELI CATE BA LANCE, A MINDSET. I VISITED WITH AN ENG INEERING SCHOOL AND ONE UND ERGRADUATE SAID WE NEED TO BECOME TAUGHT AN ETHICS COURSE FOR ENGINEERS, SO THAT WE DO NOT, ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO HA VE TO MAKE A LIFE AND DEATH DECIS ION. A ND THAT NEEDS TO BE ETHICALLY GROUNDED. C MDR. STAFFORD: S O THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE ANYTHI NG TO DO WITH MATH AND SCIENCE AND ENGINEE RING THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE T HE YOUNG PEOPLE OF TODAY UN DERSTAND. THERE IS RI GHT AND WRONG. MAJ. GEN. B OLDEN: THERE IS WHAT IS ETHICAL AND WHAT IS NOT ETHICAL. AND THERE'S A GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLE TO R EAD AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE CHA LLENGER OCCURRED, T HE UNDERLYING TITLE IS, I FORGE T. [LA UGHTER] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT MY AGE. WHEN W E ALL OW THINGS TO GO ON THAT WE KNO W ARE NOT RIGHT, WE INFUSE THAT ATTITUDE OR THAT CULTURE AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. SO WE HAS E NGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE GOT TO TEACH THEM HOW TO THINK ETHICALLY AND HOW TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION, E VEN IF IT MEANS THE PROGRAM IS SLOWED F OR A WHILE. BECAUSE NOTHING WIL L AND PROGRAM LIKE RUSHING TO THE END AND HAVING IT BLOW UP ON YOU. THAT IS DONE. THAT IS THA T. PEOPLE GET OVER BEING YEARS LATE AND DOLLARS OVER. PEOPL E DO NOT FREQUENTLY GET OVER... WE HAVE NEVER RECOVERED F ROM LOSING TWO SHUTTLES. I THINK ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN O N SPACECRAFT WILL SAY THAT. YOU D O NOT RECOVER FROM THAT, IT IS NOISE THE SCAR YOU CARRY WITH YOU. S O GET IT RIGHT. DR. MAGNUS: THE OTHER THING TO TH ING AB OUT AS OPPOSED TO SPEED IS JUST COMPLACENCY . YOU FORGET TO QUESTION TH INGS BECAUSE THINGS ARE NORMALI ZED. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A SPEED THI NG BUT A MATTER OF STAYING ALWAYS ALERT AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING, AND QUESTIO NING AND LISTENING T O THE SYSTEM. AND MAKING SURE YOU CA N HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPL E CAN BRING UP QUESTIONS. BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE REA LLY GOING TO CREATE THE RIGHT SAFET Y ENVIRONMENT AND AVOIDING TH AT COMPLACENCY . AND THAT IS HARD. I TAL KED ABOUT EARLIER HOW ADAPTAB LE WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND HOW WE NORMALIZED TO SITUATIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE ACCIDENTS, IT WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT COMPLACENCY . WE WERE NOT QUESTIONING AS CAREFULL Y AS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN D OING. CMDR . STAFFORD: THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING IT THAN GOING FASTER SLOPE. THE WORST THING YOU CAN HAV E IS AN ON-TI ME FAILURE. [LAUGHTER] DEANNA: CHR IS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON BO ARD ONE OF THE TEST FLIGHTS. WHAT IS YOU R THOUGHT ABOUT SPEED VERSU S SAFETY? [LAUGHTER] CAPT. FERGU SON: I DID NOT HEAR YO UR LAST LINE. [LAUGHTER] CAPT. FERGU SON: I DO NOT TH INK THAT SPEED AND S AFETY ARE SYNONYM OUS. I'VE HAD THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH EVERY PHASE OF OUR VEHI CLES DESIGNED FROM THE ENGINE ARRINGTON T HE PIECE PARTS THAT COME TOGETH ER. DOES THAT MAKE ME AN EXPER T? NO, IT MAKES ME AN INTEREST ED WATCHER. WE ALSO WOR K TO A PRETTY SPEC IFIC, I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE , SET OF REQUIREM ENT S THAT COME F ROM NASA THAT ARE BATHED IN T HE MISTAKES THAT NASA HAS MADE IN THE WAY IT HAS RUN SPACE FLIGH T OPER ATIONS IN THE PAST. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF HELP FROM NASA. SOMET IMES T OO MUCH HELP. BUT I TELL YOU ANY AMOUNT OF HELP IN THE RIGHT AREA IS A GOOD THING. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY APPROP RIATE TRANSITION BETWEEN A GOVERNMEN T RUN AND MANAGED PROGRAM, OV ER TO A COMMERCIALLY RUN AND MAN AGED PROGRAM, WITH JUST ENOUGH OF THE PAST STEEPED IN. AND BOE ING OR ITS LEGACY COMPANIES H AS BEEN INVOLVED IN EVERY HU MAN SPACEFLIGHT PROGRAM SINCE THE B EGINNING. SO A LOT OF THAT MEN TALITY AND MINDSET IS STILL TH ERE. ULTI MATELY, I THINK HAVING FOLKS ON TH E FLOOR AND WATCHING THE HARDWAR E COME TOGETHER DOES BUILD A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. MR. KOENIGSMANN: I WANT TO A DD, MY MOTTO IS ONLY THE PARANOID SU RVIVE. YO U HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUN T OF PARANOIA. I F IT MEANS STOPPING THE LAUNCH AND EXPLAINING TO YOUR CUSTOM ER WHY YOU HAVE STOPPED IT FOR THRE E D AYS. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO GET THIN GS RIGHT. AND TO GET THEM DONE IN TIME. >> QUESTION. > > I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABO UT THE C OST AN D COMPLEX ITY OF GETTING THINGS FROM THE EARTH TO LOW EARTH ORBIT AS BEING ONE OF THE BARRIER S OF , AS THE CONCEPT OF BE , BO TH IN SCIENCE FICTION AND THE SERIOUS AERONAUTICA L JOURNALS HA S BEEN THE SPACE ELEVATORS. IS ANYBODY STILL THINKING ABOUT THE C ONCEPT OF THE SPACE ELEVATOR? D R. MAGNUS: I CAN TELL YOU THAT WH EN I WAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, W E HAVE A VERY PASSIO NATE COMMUNITY INSIDE THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY THAT IS VER Y ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE SPACE E LEVATOR. IT IS STILL OUT THERE A S A CONCEPT. TE CHNICALLY, I THINK THE RE ARE STILL ROADBLOCKS. A LOT HAVE TO DO WITH THE STRENGTH OF CABLES AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT NANOPART ICLES AND CAN WE WEAVE TOGETHER SO ME CABLES OF THESE KINDS OF MA TERIAL S THAT ARE RE ALLY SUPERSTRONG AND COULD H ANDLE THE TENSION. BU T I DO NOT KN OW ALL OF THE DETAILS. I JUST KNOW THERE IS A VERY PASSIONATE COMMUNITY O UT THERE. >> M ATERIALS SCIENCE, VE RY SERIOU S MATERIALS S CIENCE PROBLEM WE SELL THI NGS LIKE THAT. DEANN A: OK NEXT QUE STION. > > ANDREW JACK SON, I DO NOT WANT TO BE A DOWNER ON THIS WE ARE TALKING ABO UT HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT. HUMANS ARE FRAGILE.

ROBOT ICS, A RTIFICIAL INTELLIGENC E, WOULD IT BE BETTER TO C ONSTRUC T A COMMUNITY ON MARS WHICH IS BA SED ON ROBOTS, NOT ON PEOPLE. BUT THE PEO PLE CAN CONTROL THE ROBOTS SO YOU HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE? IT SEEMS LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF T HE COST IN GETTING US TO MARS IS PROTECTING THESE FRAGILE BEI NGS. WE TALK ABOUT RADIATION. ANY THOUGHTS ON AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO CREATE A COMMUNITY ON MARS WIT HOUT NECESSARILY SENDING PEO PLE THEIR FIRST, THEY COULD GO TH ERE LATER. >> YOU'VE GOT CURIOSITY, SOON YOU WILL HAVE MARS 2020 W ITH A N EXPERIMENT CALLED MOXI E , AND SOON YO U WILL HAVE MARS 2020 WITH A N EXPERIMENT CALLED MOXIE.

WE HAVE BEE N DOING THAT FOR 50 YEARS. I AM NOT A GEOLOGIST, BUT I HAVE GEOLOG Y FRI ENDS WHO TELL ME IF WE PUT ONE GEOLOGI ST O N THE SURFACE OF MARS FOR AS LONG AS CURIOSITY HAS BEEN TH ERE, WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE EXPLORED THE PLANET BY NOW. [LAUGH TER] MAJ. GEN. BOLDEN : AND I DO NOT SAY THAT AS A T RIVIAL, IS NOT A JOKE. BUT T HERE IS THIS INNATE CURI OSITY HUMANS HAVE THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE, YET, TO TEACH A ROB OT. I ME AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENC E AND ALL THESE OTHER THING S WILL BE HERE ONE OF THESE DA YS WE THINK. AN E XAMPLE I WILL GIVE YOU, H UBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE. WHEN WE FOU ND OUT THAT HUBBLE HAD A SPHERICAL OPERATION AND WE DECI DED WE WERE NOT GOING TO SEND THE SHUTTLE UP TO GET HUBBLE. THE NATIONA L ACADEMY TOGETHER A TEAM OF P EOPLE TO GO DETER MINE H OW WE COULD SAVE HUBBLE. THAT WAS THE TITLE O F THE STUDY GROUP , SAVING HUBBLE. WE WENT INTO IT, AL L OF US DID, EVEN THE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT PEOPLE SAYING WE H AVE TO FIND A ROBOTIC CAPABILITY TO DO THIS. THE TECHNOLOGY WAS NOT THERE AT THE TIME. IF WE HAD T HAT HAPPEN TO HUBBLE T ODAY, I'M CONFIDENT WE COULD PR OBABLY PUT TOGETHER A ROBOTIC M ISSION THAT COULD DO A LOT OF THE REPAIRS ON HUBBLE T HAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO DATE. BU T THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXPERIE NCE OF HUMANS G OING UP THERE AND MESSING ARO UND WITH IT AND FINDING OUT THINGS YOU CAN DO THAT WE CAN AUTOMAT E. THAT IS ESSENTIA LLY THE STORY, YOU HAVE ROBOTS RUNN ING AROUND. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW DO YOU OFFLOAD THE HUMAN FROM DOING MUNDA NE THINGS. AND IT IS NOW T IME TO SEND HUMANS TO MARS TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER SOME OF THE SE THINGS THAT THE RO BOTS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 5 0 YEARS NO W. I THINK. DR. MAGNUS: LOOK AT IT AS A TOOLBOX. HU MANS HAVE CERTAIN SCHOOLS AND THEY CO ME WITH C ERTAIN PROS AND CONS. , CE RTAIN SKI LLS, WITH CERTAIN PROS AND CO NS. MACHINES HAVE CERTAIN SKILLS WITH CERTAIN PROS AND CONS. LIKE YOUR TOOLBOX IN THE GARAGE, YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH ALL SCREWDR IVERS. YOU NEED A MIX DEPENDS ON WHAT IS THE MISSION AND WHAT YO U'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. THEY BOTH C OME WITH EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCT URE ON THE IN SPACE AND O N THE GROUND. IN THE BOOK , FRAGILITY SEE DESIGN THE MISSION. PICK THE TO OLS BASED ON WHAT YOUR OBJECT IVES ARE. I DON' T THI NK IT IS GOING TO BE AN OR, I T IS GOING TO BE IN AND AT SOME LEV EL. MAJ. GEN. B OLDEN: AGAIN, I'M A BIG FAN O F MARS. AND I 'M A BIG FAN OF USING ROBOTS IN T HE RIGHT PLACE. I THINK BEFORE WE A HUMAN FOOT ON MARS SHOULD HAVE AN ARMY OF ROBOTS THAT ARE PU T THERE TO BURROW INTO THE SURFACE , BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE, JUST THE SA ME WA Y WE DO FOR ANY AMERICAN SO LDIER MARINE, AIRMAN OR ANYBODY GOES TO ANY OF THESE PLACE S TODAY. WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY WALK I N, TH EY DO NOT BUILD IT. KBR OR SOMEBODY WITH A LOT OF RO BOTS HAS TAKEN PREFAB STUFF AND T HEY GO INTO AN AIR-COND ITIONED SPACE WHERE THEY CAN DO STUFF. YOU STILL HAVE TO DIG A FO XHOLE WHE N YOU GET OUT INTO TH E REMOTE PARTS. BUT WE CAN USE ROB OTS TO BUILD HABITATS. T HAT IS A BUSINESS. THAT WE COU LD BE WORKING ON RIGHT NO W. >> MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY APPLES AND ORANGES. WE TALK ABOUT CURIOSITY ON MARS. THREE AND A HALF YEAR S TO COVER THE SAME DISTANCE TH AT SOMEONE ELSE DID IN THRE E DAYS. THEY BROUGHT BACK TO UND ER 45 POUNDS OF ROCKS. - - T HEY BROUGHT BAC K 245 POUNDS OF ROCKS. YOU NEED BOTH. BUT I T COST MORE TOO. DEANNA : NEXT QUESTI ON. > > A SHORT QUE STION, LIKELY CONTROVERSI AL. YOU TALK AB OUT COMPETITION AND COLLABORATI ON. IT SEEMS TO ME ONE OF THE BIG ELEPHAN TS IN SPACE, C HINA. I'M INTERES TED IN YOUR RES PONSE IN ADDRESSING THE RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF SPACE AND CHINA. >> WHY DOES EV ERYBODY LOOK AT ME? [LA UGHTER] MAJ. GEN. B OLDEN: I'M THE GUY THAT SHOT H IM, AGAIN. SAY WHAT YOU WILL AB OUT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE OBA MA ADMINISTRATION PAIRED IN 2010, WE THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE VERGE O F HA VING A NOT HER APOLLO SOYU Z, AND IT GOT CHECKED DOWN BY THE CONGRESS. A LL OF YOU RECOGNIZE BECAUSE A LOT OF YO UR INTELLECT WILL AND , INTE LLECTUAL AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS AR E CHINESE. WE GOT PROB LEMS WITH EVERYBODY. [LAUGHTER] MAJ. GEN. B OLDEN: WHA T MAKES US ABLE TO WORK WITH C OSMO' S ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATI ON SO INCREDIBLY WELL IS MISSION FOCUS. IS D ECIDING WHAT WE WILL DO TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. WHEN I WAS NAMED TO GO COMMAND MY LAST SPA CE SHUTTLE MIS SION, I WAS AT NASA HEADQUARTER S AND GEORGE SAID I WANT YOU GO BACK TO HOUSTON AND FLY ANOTHER SHUTTLE MIS SION. I WAS HOPING IT W OULD BE TO GO REPAIR HUBBLE. HE SAID NO, NOT IN LIFE. HE SA ID I WANT YOU TO GO BACK AND COMMAND THE FIRST MISSION THAT WILL C ARRY A RUSSIAN COSMONAUT. FIRST MISSI ON THAT WILL C ARRY A , I SAID FORG ET IT, I AM A MARINE. I'VE TRAINED ALL MY LIFE TO KILL THEM AND FO R THEM TO KILL ME. [LAUGHTER] AND I DO NO T TO FLY WITH ANY RU SSIAN. , AND I DO NO T TO FLY WITH ANY RUSSIAN. [L AUGHTER] AND HE SAID , DOWN AND GO HAVE DINNER WITH THEM - - HE SAID, DOWN,. HE S AID JUST GO HAVE DINNER WITH THEM. I MET THEM FOR MY DEAR FRIENDS TODAY, SOME 20 ODD HEIR S - - ODD YEARS L ATER , WHAT WE TALKED ABOU T HAD NOTHING TO DO IT TECHNOLO GY. AND WE TALKED ABOUT OUR KIDS AN D WHAT WE WANTED TO DO FOR T HE FUTURE AND WE BECAME MISSION FOC USED ON FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN GET OUR TWO TEA MS TOGETHER AND SUCCESSFULLY WORK ON THA T MISSION. AND NOW THE INT ERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. I THINK TOM WILL TELL YOU THE SAM E THING. CMDR. STAFF ORD: EXACTLY THE SAME THING. I GR ADUATED T HE NAVAL ACADEMY AND WENT TO THE AIR FORCE. I WAS A COL D WARRIOR. I WANTED TO GO TO KOREA AND KILL COMMIE S. TH EN I ENDED UP ON APOLL O SOYUZ, AND I REALIZE ALL THE RUS SIANS WERE NOT COMMUNIST. AND SINCE THEN, ONE I S MY DEAREST FRIEND, LIKE A BROT HER TO ME. HIS GRA NDDAUGHTER IS NAMED AF TER MY DAUGHTER. A ND MY TWO GRANDSO NS, A DIFFERENT SON IS NAME D AFTER HIM. WE WERE REA LLY WORKING GOO D TOGETHER. AND I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD GEORGE, WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE RUSSIANS BECAUSE WE NEED AN ESCAPE VEHICLE AND THE SOYUZ WAS T HERE. ALSO I DO NOT KNOW THAT 28 YEARS LATER I WOULD BE ADOPTING TO , TO RU SSIAN ORP HAN BOYS. DEANNA: NEX T QUESTION. >> PROUD MEMBE R OF S ECTION 10. CHARLIE , I LOVED WHA T YOU SAID ABOUT ETHICS. I WONDERED WHETHER WE AT NAE M IGHT T HINK ABOUT A HIPPOCRATIC OATH. MY QU ESTION IS WITH THIS, THERE ARE S O MANY PEOPLE, APOLLO AND THE SPA CE MISSION WERE BORN AT THE SAME TIME AS MASSIVE CIVIL RIGHT S WORK WAS GOING ON FOR RACE EQ UALITY, GENDER EQUALITY, L GBTQ, SO MANY PEOPLE , AND AT THE TIME TH ERE WAS A LOT OF DISC RIMINATION IN CHOOSING WHO GOT TO GO AND DO DIFFEREN T T HINGS. I T HOUGHT M AY BE THE PANE L COULD LIFT ONE OR TWO IDEAS. THE LAND SP EED RECORD FLIGHT RECORD FOR THE MER CURY SEVEN WHO T HEY USED TO CALL SEV EN A HAL F. SHE EMBEDDE D WI TH THEM FOR A LOOK MAGAZINE, L IKE TIME MAGAZINE STORY. THEY DID EV ERY TESTS , SHOU LD A WO MAN BE FI RST IN SP ACE, OR A GIRL, BACK THEN, A GIRL. JUST SHARIN G THOSE STORIES, WOMEN OF AL L RACES, MEN OF COLOR, LGBTQ FULKS, YOU MIGHT REFLECT ON THAT MAYBE PEOPL E , LGBTQ FULKS , YOU MIGHT REFLECT ON THAT MAY BE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, AND T HINGS WE CAN DO AS AN ACADEMY TO MAKE SURE THE STORIES ARE BETTER KNOWN. DR. MAGNUS: I WOULD LIK E TO SHARE A STORY THAT ADDRES SES THE ROOT OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKI NG ABOUT. I WAS IN MIDDLE S CHOOL WHEN I DREAMED O F BEING AN ASTRONAUT. I HAD NO ID EA HOW I WOULD DO IT. I HAD NO ID EA IF WAS EVEN POSSIBLE. B UT IT WAS SOMETHING I REALLY DE CIDED, IT WAS JUST WHO I WAS. IN 1 978, WHEN I ENTERED HIGH SCHOOL , THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ON THE FRON T P AGE OF MY HOMETOWN NE WSPAPER. WOMEN ACCEPTED INTO THE NA SA ASTRONAUT CORPS. IT HAD ALL PICTURE OF ALL THE WOMEN IN TH AT 1978 CLASS. WHEN I SAW THAT NEWSPAPER A RTICLE AND THAT PICTURE, I STARTED CRYING QUITE FRANKLY. AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT THE DR EAM THAT I HAD, THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT I COULD IDE NTIFY WITH DOING THE THING T HAT I HAD ALWAYS DREAMED OF DOING. AND OVER THE YEARS, I HAVE SYNT HE SIZED THAT MOMENT INTO THE POWER OF ROLE MODELS . AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. EVER YONE IN THIS ROOM I S A ROLE MODEL FOR SOME CONSTI TUENCY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GENDER OR NECESSARILY RACE. BUT Y OUR WHOLE TOWN. A HIG H SCHOOL THAT YOU WENT TO, TH E COMMUNITY THAT YOU LIVING, YOU R NIECES AND NEPHEWS, BECAUSE KID S NEVER LISTEN TO THEIR PA RENTS. [LAUGHTER] THERE IS SO MEBODY , SOMEWHERE, THAT YOU AR E A ROLE MODEL FOR. TO YOUR POI NT, WHAT COULD NAE DO? THIS GROUP IS AN INCREDIBLE , DO? THIS GR OUP IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF PE OPLE WHO ARE VERY TALENTED AN D SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD ENC OURAGE YOU TO GET OUT AND BE ROLE MODELS AND ENCOURAGE P EOPLE AND EXCITE PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR PASSION IN STEM. AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO CREATE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ENGA GING IN OUR FIELD. BUT DO NOT UNDERES TIMATE THE POWER OF RO LE MOD ELS. DEA NNA: ANO THER HIT IN FIGURE STORY. >> I WILL BRIN G UP ONE POINT. I HA VE THRE E DAUGHTERS. AND I BECAME CONV INCED EARLY IN MY CAREE R T HAT WOMEN COULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO. I HAD T HE PLEASURE OF HAVING 202- 748-800 0 SALLY RIDE ON MY CREW AND SHE LIVED U P TO EVERYTHING I EXPECT TO HAVE HER. AND WENT ON TO HELP INSPIRE OTHER YOUNG GIRLS TO GET INVOLVED IN STEM PROJE CTS. CAPT. CRIPPEN: 35 YEARS GO , AGO TODAY, KATHY SULLIVAN AN D SALLY RIDE WERE ON MY CREW. AND W E'RE GOING TO PROVE TH AT KATHY WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A SPA CEWALK BECAUSE A L OT OF MEN DOUBTED A WOMAN COU LD. SHE WENT OUT AND DID THE JOB SUPERBLY. A ND PROVED THAT. AND SUBSEQUENTLY WE HAVE HAD ALL KINDS OF WOMEN DO SPACEWAL K'S. AND SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP WE MAY HAVE TO WOMEN GO OUT ON T HE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TOG ETHER SOON. >> I'M SURE TO M AN D BOB AND CHARLIE CANNOT IMAGINE IN THE 1960 'S AND 19 70'S FLY ING INTO THE AIRCRAFT WITH A WOMAN ON TH EIR WING. WOMEN IN CO MBAT AVIA TION IN TACTICAL AV IATION CAME ABOUT WHEN I WAS A FLE ET AVIATOR. IT WOULD HA VE BEEN A ROCKY START. BEFORE THAT WE DO NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT IT.

FERGUSON: AND ENGINEE RING . WE HAVE LEAD FLIGHT DIRE CTORS, TO WHOM ARE WOMEN. LEAD A SPACEWALK OR SWEAR WOMEN. THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE LAST 30 YEA RS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. , LEAD SPACEW ALKERS WHO WERE WOMEN. DEAN NA: I K NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ARE NOT SPEAKING DIRECTLY ABOUT ARTEM IS. FOR ME AS A WOMAN, MOTHER AND AS A DA UGHTER, WE'RE GOING TO HA VE A WOMAN ON THE MOON. IT IS PHENO MENAL. IT IS TIME FOR US TO BEGIN WR APPING UP, UNLESS SOMEONE AT THE NAE GIVES ME PE RMISSION TO GO FURTHER. OK , IT IS TIME FOR US TO WRAP UP.

THIS IS MOR E IMPORT ANT THAN EVER TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT P ERSON TO BE IN TH E WHIT E HOUSE AND TO LEAV E THE C OUNTRY THE RIGHT WAY. NOT ONLY WI TH COMMITMENT TO THE NATION, SHE IS A SO LDIER. SHE WAS ABL E TO STE P DOWN FROM THE POSITION ON CONGRESS TO SERVE AS A SOLDIER. SH E IS SOME BODY THAT DOES NOT FO LLOW THE CURRENT . SHE SPEAKS UP. SHE HAS THE STRENGT H TO DO THAT.

RAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUN TRY IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY . WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF VO LUNTEE RS WHO ARE HERE TODAY, AND ARE TOO MANY TO LIST BY NAM E, BUT I'M SO PROUD OF THE CAMP AIG N THAT WE HAVE AND THE PEO PLE-POWERED CAMPAIGN WE ARE BUIL DING. WE TAKE NO PAC MONEY, NO L OBBYIST MONEY. WE A RE FUELED AND BEING MOVED BY OU R VOLU NTEERS WORKING HARD EVERY DAY. VOLUNT EERS, IF YOU CAN RAISE A ND WAVE YO UR HANDS. THEY ARE IN THE BACK, WORKI NG HARD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I'M RE ALLY, REALLY GRATEFUL. I T'S GATHERING TOGETHER IN SPACES L IKE THIS WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU AC ROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT GIVES ME SO MUCH HOPE FOR OUR FUT URE, FOR OUR FUTURE, BECAUSE WE ARE THE CHANGE. THE RE'S A REASON WH Y OUR FOUNDIN G FATHERS CHOSE THOSE THREE MOST IMPORTANT W ORDS TO BEGIN OUR CONSTITUTION, ""WE THE PEOPLE. "" TW O REASONS. SO THAT WE THE PEOP LE WOULD NEVER FORGET THE RESPONS IBIL ITY WE HAVE, TO BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND INFORME D AND INVOLVED IN DEMOCRACY, BUT ALSO SO THAT THE LEADERS WHO WE CHOO SE TO ELECT NEVER FORGET WHO THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING. ""WE THE PEOPLE."" SO AS WE LOOK AT THE MANY CHALLENGES WE SEE, AS WE TALKED THROUGH HOW WE WANT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, I THINK IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE STA Y FOCUSED ON WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, WHO IT IS R EALLY FOR. IT'S A BOUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. IT IS ABOUT YOUR CHILDR EN. I T IS ABOUT YO UR LOVED ONES, YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR COMMUN ITY, OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. ABOU T 161 YEARS A GO, ABRAHAM LINCOLN GAVE A SPEE CH THAT WAS ENTITLE D ""A HOUSE DIVID ED AGAINST ITSELF CANN OT STAND."" DUR ING THAT TIME, I WAS GOING BACK AND READING ABOUT WHAT WAS SURROUNDING HIM AT THAT TIME AS HE DELIVERED T HE SPEECH. MANY OF HIS COLL EAGUES WERE TELLING HIM THIS WA S VERY CONTROVERSI AL, THIS WAS NOT A SPEECH YOU SHOULD DELIVER. BUT HE DELI VERED IT, TO DELIVER A W ARNING A BOUT HOW DIVISIVE TH INGS WERE THEN. BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY LOUDLY AND CLEARLY TO US AS A COUNTRY, AS WE LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE TOD AY. ""A H OUSE DIVID ED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAN D."" AND SADLY, THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE, AS A COUNTRY. OU R COUNTRY IS DEEPLY DIVIDED. WH ETHER IT BE BASED ON PARTISAN LINES, ONE GROUP VOTING FOR THIS PARTY OR TH IS PERSON, ANOTHER GRO UP VOTIN G FOR A DIFFERENT PARTY OR DI FFERENT PERSON, OR IF IT IS BASED ON RACIAL LINES, ETHN IC, REL IGIOUS, ALL THESE DIFFE RENT T HINGS THAT ARE UNFORTUNATE LY BEING USED TO TEAR US APART AND DIVIDE US. WHEN TH AT A CTUALLY GOES COUNTER TO THE VISION THAT OUR FOUNDERS HA D, FOR OUR COUNTRY, YOU KNOW? A S TH EY WERE WORKING THROUGH A LOT OF DI VISIONS, AS THEY WERE TRYING TO HEAL THIS NATION AND BRIDGE THESE DIVIDES, RE COGNIZING THAT, AS WE HAVE VER Y D IFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW T O SOLV E PROBLEMS, AS WE COME FRO M D IFFERENT PLACES IN OUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND BACKGROUNDS AND FAMILY STORY, THAT ULTIMATELY WE ARE STRONG WHEN WE STAND TOGET HER, WHEN WE, EVERY ONE O F US, ARE FIRMLY ROOTED IN THAT FOU NDA TION OF OUR CONSTITUTIO N THAT SERVES AS THE BEDR OCK FOR OUR COU NTRY, SO THAT WE CAN REME MBER THAT OUR OBJECTIVE REALLY IS T HE SAME. WE ARE GATHERED HE RE TODAY, AS MANY PEOPLE ARE IN DIFF ERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY , BECAUSE WE CARE. WE CA RE FOR EACH OTHER. WE CARE FOR OUR COU NTRY. AN D WE CARE FOR TH E FUTURE, OUR FUTURE. NOT ONLY FO R THE ONE THAT LIES BEFORE US, BUT THE ONE THAT WE WILL LEAVE BEHIND, FOR THOSE WHO COME AFTER US. AND IT IS THIS FOCUS AND THIS CARE T HAT ALLOWS US T O SEE PAST SO MUC H OF THE DIVI SIVENESS, AND INSTEAD HAVE THE DI ALOGUE AND THE CONVERSATIO N BUILT ON THIS FOUNDATION OF RESPECT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAV E TO SOLVE PROBL EMS, TO WORK SID E-BY-SID E, TO BUILD TH IS BRIGHTER FUTURE. AS ALEJANDRO S AID, TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COUNTRY , OUR WHITE HOUSE CAN ONCE AG AIN BECOME A BEACON OF L IGHT, OF HOPE, OF OPPORTUN ITY , OF RESPECT. THESE THING S ARE SO IMPORTANT T HAT WE CAN NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED, AND WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN MAKE TH IS HAPPEN. WE ARE THE ONLY ON ES WHO CAN BRING ABOUT THIS CHANGE . SOME CRITICS WILL COME TO ME AND EXPRESS CYN ICISM ABOUT, IS THIS REALLY POSS IBLE? I SPOKE TO A COLLEGE STUDENT NOT LONG AG O, A CTUALLY SHE JUST GRADUATED F ROM COLLEGE, AND SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS. THAT T HE LINES ARE SO DEEPLY DRAW N IN THE SAND, ONE SIDE AGAINS T THE OTHER SIDE, THAT WASHIN GTON IS SO DIVIDED, IT IS SUCH A H YPER-PARTISAN ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE HOW IT IS P OSSIBLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN, BECA USE INCREASINGLY, YEAR AFTER YEAR, IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WOR SE. WHO HERE DISAGREES WITH THIS? YOU D ON'T THINK OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED? IT IS. RIGHT, YOU AGREE WE CAN FIX IT. THERE Y OU GO. YOU DIS AGREE WITH THE COLLEGE STUDENT. GOT IT. [LAUGHT ER] I WAS ABOUT TO TR Y TO UNDERSTAND, WHERE ARE YOU LIV ING? NO, NO, YOU ARE RIG HT, THOUGH. THI S IS A CONVERSAT ION I HAD WITH HE R. IT MAD E ME SAD THAT SH E HAD LOST ALL HO PE THAT WE COULD CO ME TOGETH ER IN THE FUTU RE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT'S BE COME. THI S IS WHAT I CONV EYED TO HER. NUMBER ONE, FAILUR E IS NOT AN OPTION. AND THIS WA S HOW ABRAHAM LINCOLN CLOSED THAT SPEECH ABOUT A HOUSE DIVIDED AGA INST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. HE S AID, ""W E SHALL NOT FAIL, IF WE STAND FI RM, WE SHALL NOT FAIL."" THAT ""WE"" H E IS TALKING ABOUT IS ""WE THE PEOPLE. "" WE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BRING ABOUT THIS CHANGE, BOTH IN SELECTIN G WHO WE WANT TO SEE LEADING OUR COUNTRY, LEADERS WHO WILL PU T SERVICE ABOVE SELF, WHO WILL PU T THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICA N PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY ABO VE ALL ELSE, LEADERS WHO WILL TR EAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT, AN D INSPIRE THIS POSITIVE CHANGE WITH IN OUR COUNTRY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNI TIES. REMEMBERING WHO WE ALL ARE, AS AMERICANS, WHAT IT IS THAT CONNECTS US . THIS COMMON GROUND WE STAND UPON IN THI S COUNTRY, IN THE UNITED STAT ES OF AMERICA. NO W, WHERE I COME FROM IN HAWAII, WE HAVE A WORD, ""ALOHA."" IT IS A WOR D OFTEN MISTAKENLY UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN HELLO OR GO ODBYE, BUT IT MEANS NEITHER. SO MEBODY SAID, I WAS IN SECOND G RADE AND MY TEACHER TOLD ME THA T WORD MEANT HELLO AND GOODBYE. AR E YOU TELLING ME SHE WAS WRO NG? UNFO RTUNATELY, SHE WAS WRONG. [LAUGHTER] IT IS A WOR D THAT WE USED TO GREET EACH OTHER, BOTH IN THE BEGINNING OF CONVERSATIONS AND WHEN WE ARE LEAVING, BECAUSE OF ITS SPEC IAL AND POWERFUL MEANING. WH AT ""ALOHA"" REALLY MEANS IS ""I COME TO YOU WITH RESPECT."" I COME TO YOU WITH AN OPEN HEA RT, WITH CARE, WITH COMPAS SION, AND SEEING EACH OTHER FOR WHO WE REALLY ARE, AS BRO THER AND SISTER, AS FAMILY, AS CHILDREN OF GOD, AS PEO PLE WHO ARE ALL CONNECTED. THEREFORE, AS WE ARE H AVING CONV ERSATIONS AND LIVING OUR LIVES, OUR RELATIONSHI PS PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONA LLY, WE ARE ABLE TO SEE PAST ALL OF THESE DIFFERENCES THAT CAN SOMETIM ES GET IN THE WAY OF REAL DIALOGUE AND CONVERS ATION. THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO LIVE BY IN MY OW N LIFE, TO LEAD WITH, AND TO BRIN G TO WASHINGTON. WE NEED A LOT OF AL OHA IN WASHINGTON. IT'S SOMETH ING THAT CAN AND MUST BE APPLIED IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAY. I KNEW GOING INTO WASHIN GTON AS A FRESHMAN DEMOCRAT, E LECTED IN 2012, WI TH A STRONG MA JORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUS E OF REPRESENTATIVES AND A VERY PARTISAN ENVIRONMENT , TRYING TO THINK, O K, HOW CAN I PRACTICE TH IS ALOHA IN MY WORK IN CONGRESS? H OW CAN I REACH OUT WITH RESPECT, START TO BU ILD THESE RELAT IONSHI PS NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO MY JOB, THE JOB I WAS HIRED T O DO BY MY CONSTITUENT S IN HAWAII, TO SERVE THEM AND DELIVER RES ULTS FOR THEM. IT WO ULD BE EA SY TO JUST TURN MY BACK AND SAY, WE LL, THE OTHER TEAM IS IN CHARGE SO I WILL JUST HUNKER DOWN AND HANG OUT WITH MY TEAM AND JU ST WORK HARD UNTIL WE GET ENOU GH SEATS IN CONGRESS TO WIN, AND THEN THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THINGS DONE. THAT PROBAB LY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASIER PATH TO TAKE, BUT IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT PATH TO TAKE, BECAU SE THA T'S NOT WHY I RAN FOR CONGRES S AND NOT WHAT PEOPLE VOTE D FOR ME. THEY VO TED FOR ME TO DO A JOB, TO SER VE THEM, TO WORK FOR THEM, TO BE THEIR VOICE IN WASHINGTON. AND SO I HAD AN IDEA IN HOW TO B EGIN TO DO THIS OUTREACH. I CALLED MY MOTHER IN HAWAII, WHO MAKES T HIS INCREDIBLE MACADAMIA N UT TOFFEE. I THOUGHT, WHAT BETTER WAY THAN SPEAKING THROUGH THE UNIVERS AL LANGUAGE OF FOOD, TO BE ABLE TO OPEN SOM E, BEGIN TO ESTABLISH T HESE RELATIONSHIPS. I ASKED IF SHE COULD MAKE 434MY MOTHER, SHE AND MY DAD JUST CE LEBR ATED 51 YEARS OF MARRIAGE YE STERDAY. THEY RAISE FIVE KIDS. I KNOW IT IS A RARE THING THESE DAYS. I HAVE ONE MO RE FAVOR TO ASK. WOULD YOU M AKE BO XES OF TOFFEE FOR THE STAFF. AND AGAIN, SHE IS AN AMAZING WOMAN. SHE PAUSED TO F IGURE OUT HOW MUCH THAT WOULD TAKE HER AND HOW MANY POUNDS OF MACADAMI A N UTS SHE WO ULD NEED. SHE GOT TO WORK IN HAWAII. SHE HAD MY DAD ASSI STING H ER IN THE JOB. HE WOU LD BE A QUALITY C ON TROL OFF ICER. HE WOULD TA KE A SLICE OUT OF EVER Y SINGLE PAN THAT SHE POURED. WHI LE THEY WERE DOING THIS, I WAS HANDWRITING PERSONAL NO TES TO EV ERYONE OF MY NEW C OLLEAGUES. GOING ONLIN E AND LOOKING UP INFORMATION. JUST GETTIN G BETTER INFORMED AB OUT WHO THEY ARE. SIGNING EVE RYONE OF THESE NO TES . AS W E BEGIN TO DELIVER THE SE GIFTS OF A LOJA, IT IS THE ONLY TI ME THAT W E ALL IN T HE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I NORMALLY WOULD NOT H AVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH, CHAIRMEN, WOMEN OF IMPORTANT C OMMITTEES IN CONGRESS, S TARTED TO MAKE THE LONG WA LK FROM T HE REPUBLICAN SIDE TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, FINDI NG ME AND SAYING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MANY O F THE M SAYING, I ATE ALL THE CAN DY, I NEED MORE BEFORE I GO HOME T HI S WEEKEND. AN D MOST IM PORTANTLY, WHAT ARE THINGS YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERN ED ABOUT, WHAT ARE THINGS YOU WANT TO TACKLE? I A M THE CHAIR OF THIS OR THAT COM MITTEE, THIS IS HOW MANY YEARS I HAV E BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS OR THA T. LET'S WORK TOGETHER. I WANT TO HELP. THAT SIMPLE GESTURE OF REACHING OU T WITH ALOHA, WITH RESPECT, WI THOUT PRECONDITIONS, WITHOUT PUR ITY TESTS, WITHOUT PICKING AND CHOOSING, I WILL TALK AND WO RK WITH THIS PERSON BUT NOT THA T PE RSON. REACHING OUT WITH RE SPECT TO EVERYONE, FOCUSED ON THIS MISSION THAT WE ALL SHARE T OGETHER OF SERVICE, OF PUTTING SERVICE ABOVE SELF, PUTTING THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AHEA D OF POLITICS, HEAD OF PRO FITS, AHEAD OF SPECIAL INT ERESTS AND CORPORATION S. PUTTING THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY FIR ST. IT W AS BECAUSE OF THIS OUTREA CH, THE SLAYING OF A FOUNDA TION BASED ON RESPECT, THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE VERY EFF ECTIVE T HROUGHOUT MY TIME IN CON GRESS. A T A TIME OF A STRONG RE PUBLICAN MAJORITY, I WAS ABLE TO PASS LEGISLATION, SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE S AID WAS IMPOSSIBLE, THAT I SHOU LDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME TRYING TO DO FROM THE BE GINNING. IN INTRODUCING AMENDMENTS TO SOME OF THE LARGER BILLS THAT GET TH ROUGH CONGRESS, B EING TOLD, REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER SUPPO RT IT, DON'T E VEN TRY. AND TH E LEADERSHIP OPPOSING MY BILL AND AMENDME NT. BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS I HAD, I HA D MY PH ONE CALLS RETUR NED. B UT I AM TE XTING COLLEAGUES TO SAY, MY BILL IS COMING UP FOR A VOTE, I N EED YOUR SUPPORT, THEY WILL RESPOND AND SAY, OK, TELL ME WHY. INSTEA D OF JUST GOI NG ALONG WITH THE PARTY LINE, WHICH IS OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON. REPUBLICAN BILL, REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR IT , DEMOCRATS V OTE AGAINST IT. A DEMOC RATIC BILL, DEMOCRATS V OTE FOR IT , REPUBLICANS AGAINST. TH AT IS THE NORM , RATHER THAN EVERY MEMBER OF C ONGRESS LOOKING AT EACH PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND SAYING, WHAT ARE TH E PROS AND CONS, W ILL THIS H ELP PEOPLE OR HURT PEO PLE? SO INSTEAD OF JUST TOEING THE PARTY LINE, I WAS ABLE TO HAVE THESE CONVE RSATIONS WHERE MY COLLEAGU ES KNEW AND TRUSTED BEC AUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP THAT I WOUL D MAKE MY CASE, BUT I WASN' T TRYI NG TO SCREW THEM OVER OR SET THEM UP FOR FAILURE. NO T EVERY S INGLE ONE OF THEM CAME MY WAY , BUT ON MANY OF THESE CASES I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE EN OUGH PEOPLE, TAKING THE CASE BA SED ON THE SUBSTANCE OF MY LEGIS LATION, TO SUPPORTED, BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO . THIS IS THE LEADERSHIP THAT I WILL BRIN G AS YOUR PRESIDENT AND COMMAND ER-I N-CHIEF. REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE. TREA TING EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WI TH RESPECT. NO T SEEING ONE GROUP OF AMERICAN S AS PART OF MY TEAM, AN D T HE REST AS DEPLORABLE. SEEING EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, W ITH RESPECT, AND BRINGING AB OUT THE K IND OF LEADERSHIP THAT PUTS Y OUR WELL-BEING AND YOUR INTERE ST AHEAD OF ALL ELSE, E VERY SINGLE DAY. AS WE GO ON HERE, WE HAVE OUR VO LUNTE ERS WHO WILL PASS A ROUND SOME GOLD-WRAPPED MACADAMIA N UT TOFFEE, MY MOM'S RECIPE. [LA UGHTER] [APPLAUSE] SO YOU CAN GET A LITTL E TASTE OF HOW MY COLLEAGUES FELT, WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED AND THE MAG IC OF TH IS STUFF. IT I S DANGEROUSLY ADDICTIVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED . [LAUGHTER] BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY PRAC TICAL LEVEL, AND THIS IS WHAT I S HARED WITH THAT C OLLEGE STUDENT, HO W WE CAN AND MUS T MOVE FORWARD TOG ETHER. H OW I WILL LEAD A S PRESIDENT. NOT ACCEPTING FAILURE AS AN OPTION. BEI NG INSPIRED BY THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND SO MANY OTHER LEADERS WHO CAME BEFORE US, FACING VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES IN DIVISIVE TIMES BUT ALWAYS LEADING WIT H LOVE AND WITH CARE, AND C OMPASSION, PUTTING THE WELL-BEING AND INTERES T OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE ABOV E ALL ELSE. T HERE 'S A LOT OF DI FFERENT I SSUES THAT WE WILL TACKLE, TOGETHER. A S PRESIDEN T, I WILL TAKE ON AND HOLD TO ACC OUNT BIG PHARMA. THO SE WHO A RE PERPETRATING THIS OPIOID EPIDEMIC AC ROSS OUR COUNTRY . TH OSE WHO H AVE LIED AND CHEATED, AND INTENTI ONALLY DECEIVED PE OPLE, JUS T TO MAKE MORE MONEY. RUIN ING PEO PLE'S LIVES. TAKI NG PEOP LE'S LIVES IN THE PROCESS . I HAVE INTR ODUCED LEGISLATION THAT BEGINS THIS PROCESS, OPIOID ACCO UNTABILITY ACT, THAT WOULD HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE AND TAKE THE DOLLARS THA T WOULD COME FROM THESE CASES AND E ARMARK THEM SPECIFICALL Y FOR THOSE SURVIVORS OF THIS EPI DEM IC, TO HELP THEM THROUGH REC OVERY, TO HELP PROVIDE THOSE DESPE RATELY-NEEDED RESOURCES T O THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ABUSE AND ADDICTION, TO GET THE HELP TH AT THEY NEED AS THEY WALK THIS L ONG PATH TOWARDS RECOVERY. I WILL HOLD BIG PHARMA AND BIG INS URAN CE ACCOUNTABLE, AND TAKE TH EM A WAY FROM THE POLICY-MAKI NG TABLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SO MANY OF THE PIEC ES OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO OUR HEAL TH CARE THAT HAVE COME BEFORE CONGRESS, YOU SEE IN THIS PAY TO PLAY CULTURE IN WASHINGT ON HOW THEIR HIGH- POWERED, HIGH PAID LOBBYI STS HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OVER THE LE GISLATION THAT AFFECTS OUR EVERYDA Y LIVES. I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE AARP, WHO I S HERE. I AM SO GRATEFUL TH AT ALMOST EVER Y MEETING WE HAVE, AN D I KNOW OTHE R CAMPAIGNS AS WELL, TH ERE ARE AARP VOLUNTEERS WITH THE RE D SHIRTS AND JACKETS, AN D I JUST LOVE THE MESSAGE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ED TO STAND UP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE YOU HER E FOR A SECOND, AND I CAN G IVE YO U THE MIC IF YOU WANT TO SAY A WO RD OR TWO. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. SEE TH E JACKET, IT SAYS ""ST OP GREED."" YOU ARE EVERYWHERE, A NONPARTIS AN ORGANIZATIO N FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE. IT SAYS ""STOP GREED."" EXA CTLY. ST OP THE GREED. YOUR MESSAGE IS SO CRYSTAL CLE AR, BECAUSE IT CUTS TO THE HEART O F WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW. IT'S B EING DRIVE N BY GREED AND PROFITS RATHER THAN HOW TO BETTER T AKE CARE O F OUR PEOPLE, WHE THER IT IS OUR GRANDPARENT S, OUR PARENTS , US, OUR CHILDREN, A T EVERY SI NGLE AGE. SO, WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVE RSATIO NS IN OUR COMMUNITY A BOUT HOW W E CAN IMPROVE HEALTH CARE , THE N UMBER ONE THING WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE AWAY THE CRONY C APIT ALISM AND THE GREED THAT HAS IN FECTED THIS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT UNFORTUNATE LY REALLY ISN' T ABOUT HEALTH AT ALL, REA LLY . IT IS SICK- CARE, RIGHT? WE A RE NOT PLACING HIGH LEVELS OF I MPORTANCE ON PREVENTION AND WELLNES S, AND DOING MORE TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER, PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM GETTIN G SIC K IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO, YOU, EVERY ONE OF YOU HAVE MY PER SONAL COMMITMENT THAT IN A G ABBARD A DMINISTRATION, BIG PHARMA AND BIG INSURANCE WILL HAVE N O SEATS AT THE TABLE AS WE FORM POL ICIES GUARANTEEIN G QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR EV ERY SINGL E AMERICAN, THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE WHO, IF YOU HAVE GREAT PRIVATE INSURANCE OR IF YOUR EMPLOYER OFFERS ONE, IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE, YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE . BUT FOR THE SINGLE MOM OF FOUR WHO I MET EARLIER TODAY JUST DOWN T HE WAY AT COOKIE'S CAFE, WHOSE SON IS 25 YEARS OL D AND WAS BOR N WITH SEVERE DISA BILITIES, AND WHO NEE DS A LUNG TRAN SPLANT. HE DOESN'T KNOW IF HE CAN GET IT BECA USE THEY HAVE T O COME UP WITH $30,000. HE'S ON MED ICARE . H E'S ON MEDICAID . THEY WILL C OVER JUST THE COST OF THE SURGERY ITSELF. BUT ALL THE OTHER THING S HE NEEDS AROUND THE SURGERY TO MAKE SURE IT IT IS SUCCESSFUL, $35,000. SO HER BOSS, T HEY HAVE A DONATION CAN IN THE COMMUNITY TO CHIP IN, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER TO MAKE SUR E THAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LIFE CAN BE SAVED. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN RAISE IT. I ASKED, DO YOU HAVE A GOFUNDME PAGE, BECAU SE I WOULD LOVE TO SPREAD THE WORD AND TO PEOPLE TO CHIP IN. WH ETHER IT IS $20 OR WHATEVER YO U CAN. YOU KNOW WHAT S HE TOLD ME? NO, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT, BECAUSE IF WE HAVE A GOFUNDME PA GE, THEY COUNT THOSE DOLLARS AS INCOME AND HE WILL LOSE HIS APARTME NT AND HIS HEALTH CARE. SO TH E PREDICA MENT THIS YOUNG MAN IS IN, AND HIS MOTHER WHO IS WORRIED SIC K ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO LIVE AND BE ABLE TO BREATHE PROPERLY, G ET THIS LUNG TRANSP LANT, POINTS TO THE CORRUPTION AND THE PROBLEM WIT HIN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. PEO PLE LIKE HER AND HER SON AND SO MANY FAM ILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY SHO ULD BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH P EACE OF MIND THAT WHEN YOU ARE AT THAT MOST DIFFICULT M OMENT IN YOUR LIFE, WHEN YOU OR YOUR LOV ED ONE NEEDS CARE, THAT YOU WI LL BE ABLE TO GET IT NO MATTER W HERE YOU WORK WHAT YOUR ZIP CO DE IS OR WHAT YOUR FAMILY BACK GROUND IS, OR THE COLOR OF YO UR SKIN. NONE OF THESE THINGS SHOU LD STAN D IN THE WAY OF US AS AMERICAN S LIVING IN THE GREATEST NA TION IN THE WORLD, ABLE TO ENS URE Q UALITY HEALTH CARE FOR EV ERY PERSON. [AP PLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS HERE. I WAN T TO HEAR WHAT'S ON YOUR MIN D IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS. WE WILL COME TO YOU FIRST. AS I KNOW, WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK ABO UT MANY OF THE OTHER C HALL ENGES, WHETHER IT IS CLIMA TE CHANGE, IMMIGRATION REFORM, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REF ORM. THE RE'S A LOT OF ISSUES W E NEED TO ADDRESS. I DO WANT TO CLOSE ON ON E ISSUE THAT IS CENTRAL TO ALL OF T HESE OTHER ISSUES, AND THAT IS THE COST OF WAR. FOREIG N POLICY IS DOMESTIC PO LICY. YET VERY RARELY IN THIS PRE SID ENTIAL CAMPAIGN, O R EVEN CAMPAI GNS IN THE PAST , DO YOU SEE A M AJOR FOCUS ON FO REIGN POL ICY. WHI CH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, FOR TWO BIG REASONS. NU MBER ONE, THE MOST IM PORTANT RESPONSIBILITY THE PRESIDE NT HAS IS TO S ERVE AS COMMANDE R-I N-CHIEF. I WOULD THI NK, AS VOTERS, YOU WOULD WANT TO BE BEST-INFORMED ABOUT WHO IS MOST QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS COMMANDE R-I N-CHIEF, RIGHT? AND NUMBER TWO, THOSE DECISIONS T HAT ARE MADE RE LATED TO OUR FOREIGN POLICY HAVE DIRECT IMPA CTS ON EVERY SI NGLE ONE OF US, IN O UR EVERYDA Y LIVES, WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT. I HAVE SERVED AS A SOLDIER IN THE ARMY NATION AL GUARD FOR ALMOST 17 Y EARS. I HA VE DEPL OYED TWICE TO THE MIDDLE EAST . MY FI RST DE PLOYMENT WAS IN A MEDICAL UNI T, WHERE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH THE TERRIBL Y HI GH HUMAN COST OF WAR. I HAVE SERV ED IN CONGRESS NOW FOR SEV EN Y EARS, GOING ON EIGHT. THRO UGHOUT THIS TIME, I HAVE SERVED ON T HE HOMELAND SECURITY CO MMITTEE, THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COM MITTEE, THE ARMED SERVICES CO MMITTEE, GAINING EXPERIENCE AND UNDERST ANDING RELATED TO OUR NATI ONA L SECURITY AND FOREIGN POL ICY. SEE ING FIRSTHAND WHO ACTUALLY BE NEFITS MOST FROM OUR COUNTRY 'S LONG-STANDING POLICY OF WAGING R EGIME CHANGE WARS, TOPPLING DI CTATORS, NATION-BUILDING MISSIONS. I T IS NOT OUR COUNTRY THAT BENEFI TS, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS MOST OFTEN UNDERMINED AS TERRORIS T GROUPS LIKE ISIS AND AL QAED A ARE STRENGTHENE D. IT IS THE MILITARY-IN DUSTRIAL COMPLEX, AND A LOT O F FANCY WASHINGTON CONSULTANTS WHO MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONE Y OFF OF THIS CONTINUED POLICY. THE COST OF WAR TAKES A TOL L ON EVERY ON E OF US AS AMERICAN S, BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONE S WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE. JUST IN AFGHANISTAN ALONE, RIGH T NOW, WE ARE PAYING $4 BILLION A M ONTH. $4 B ILLION A MONTH. IT B EGS THE QUESTION, WHAT ARE WE TRYI NG TO ACCOMPLISH? THAT'S $5.5 MILLION AN HOUR, GOING TOWARDS A WAR AND N ATION-BUILDING MISSION THA T SOME OF THE HIGHEST LEA DERS IN THE PENTAGON, IT'S NOW BE EN REVEALED BEHIND CLOS ED DOORS THEY ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS, SAYI NG, WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING THERE ? WHAT ARE WE TRYING T O ACCOMPLI SH? WHAT DOES ""WINNI NG"" LOOK LIKE? THEY CAN'T ANSWE R THAT QUESTION. I HAVE LONG A DVOCATED FOR BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN AND STOP WA STING AME RICAN TAXPAYER DO LLARS. RE GIME CHANGE WARS AND NATIONB UILD ING MISSIONS, INSTEAD REDIRECT TH OSE DOLLARS TOWARDS SERVING THE NEEDS OF OUR PEOPLE, NATIONBUILD ING RIGHT HERE AT HOME. THIS IS THE CHAN GE THAT I WILL BRING ABOUT AS PR ESIDENT. GETTING OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. ENDING THES E REGIME CHANGE WARS. ENDING THES E NATIONBUILD ING MISSIONS. T HIS NEW CO LD WAR NUCLEAR ARMS RACE. TAKIN G CARE OF OUR VETERANS, AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE REDIREC TING TAXPAYER DOLLARS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. WE NE ED A C OMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO WILL MA KE T HE RIGHT DECISIONS, TO ENSURE T HE SAFETY, SECURITY AND FREEDOM OF THE AMERICAN PE OPLE AND OUR COUNTRY, AND I BRING THE E XPERIENCE NECESSARY T O PREPARE ME TO DO THAT JOB ON DAY ONE. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US PAYS THE PRICE F OR WAR. I'M NOT A P ACIFIST. I DON'T LIVE IN A DREAMLAND. I LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD WHERE I UND ERSTAN D THAT UNFORTUNATE LY SOMETIMES WAR MAY BE NECESSAR Y T O PROTECT AND DEFEND THE AMERICA N PEOPLE. BUT AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL MAXI MIZE ALL DIPLOMATIC MEASURES, BUILDING RELATIONSHI PS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, LEADING WIT H COOPERATION RATHER THAN CONFLI CT, MAKING SURE THAT IF WE ARE SEND ING MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS INTO HARM'S WAY, THAT W E ARE SEND ING THEM ON MISSIONS THAT ARE TRULY WORTHY OF THEIR GR EAT SACRIFICE, AND THAT WAR SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE LAST RESORT. IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS L EADERSHIP THAT WE NEE D IN OUR COUNTRY , THEN I WANT TO P ERSONAL LY INVITE EVER Y SINGLE ONE OF YOU HERE TO JOIN ME, TO JOIN MY CAMPAIGN, TO JOIN THI S MOVEME NT TOWARDS THIS BRIGHT FUTU RE WHERE WE ARE SERV ED BY A GOVERNMEN T THAT IS TRU LY OF, BY AND FOR THE PEO PLE. THA NK YOU VERY MU CH. WE WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS NOW. THANK YOU. [APPLA USE] THANK YOU V ERY MUCH. WE'VE GOT A COUPL E PEOPLE WALK ING ARO UND WITH THE MICROPHONE. WE START WI TH YOU, SIR. >> GOO D AFTERNOON. I'VE BEEN L OOKING AT THE CHESSBOARD AND IT LOOK S LIKE TRUMP IN FLORIDA, MI CHIGAN, PENNSYLVANI A AND WISCONSIN WITH A MINO RITY OF THE VOTE. IF TH E LIBE RTARIANS HAD BEEN ALLOWE D IN THE PRESIDENTIA L DEBATES, TH E LIBERTARIANS, FORMER REPU BLICAN GOVERNORS, PROBABLY WO ULD HAVE TAKEN MORE VOTES AWAY FROM TRUMP, AND THE DEMOCRA TS M AY HAVE WOUND UP WINNING IN THOSE STATES. NOW , IF YOU FIND AN ORGANIZATIO N THAT WOULD SPONSOR, THAT WOULD RUN P RESIDENTIAL DEBATES AND ALLOW T HE LIBERTARIANS TO PARTICIP ATE, AND INVITE THE REPUBLI CANS IF THEY CHOOSE OR NOT TO, I'D LIKE THAT CHESS MOVE BECAUS E IT GETS DONALD TRUMP OUT O F THE WHITE HOUSE. I WO ULD LIKE THAT TEST MOVE B ECAUS E THAT GETS DONALD TRUMP OUT O F THE WAY. IT WOU LD ALLOW THE LIBERTARIAN S TO PRESENT THEIR SOLUT IONS TO MORE VOT ERS. I T HINK YOU WOULD LIKE IT BEC AUSE IT WOULD HELP YOU GE T ELECTED. RE P. GABBARD: FAIR ENOUGH . THA NK YOU. WHAT I S YOUR NAME? >> TO M. REP. G ABBARD: AWESOME. TH ANK YOU, TOM. I WANT TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE THAT YOU AR E RAISING, WH ICH IS THAT WE NEED A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PEOP LE TO CHOOSE M ORE THAN JUST THE TW O PARTIES. I THINK THE CONCENT RATION OF POWER THAT EXISTS WITH IN THESE TWO PARTIES HAS REALLY BEEN FUELED BY MONEY. I T D OES NOT DO SERVICE TO THE AMERICA N PEOPLE IN A LOT OF WAYS. WE SE E HOW THA T IMBALANCE OF POWER EX ISTS. >> YOU HAVE SA ID EVERYTHING ABOUT FOREI GN POLICIES. I 'M A TRUCK DRIVER AND I HAVE BEEN D OING THIS FOR 35 YEARS. WHAT YOU TH INK ABOUT THE AUTONOM OUS TRUCKS THAT ARE DOING IT? I T IS REALL Y FALLING APART. REP. GABBAR D: THANK YOU. I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS. I THINK THERE IS NOT WON ANY SINGLE ANSWER TO THIS. I THI NK THERE ARE A LOT OF SAFETY C ONCERNS AND OTHER ISSUES RELA TED TO THESE CHANGES. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS A MATTER OF TIME. I WOU LD LOVE TO HEAR MORE OF YOUR THO UGHTS. W E NEED TO BE BEST PREPARED TO EMPOWER THOSE WHO ARE IN A SITUAT ION LIKE YOURSELF. M AYBE SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT BEE N DRIVIN G THEIR WHOLE CAREERS BUT THEIR F AMILY DEPENDS ON THAT INC OME TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. WH AT HAPPENS NEXT? I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT . >> IT IS BECAUSE OF THE REAL ST RICT REGULATIONS . EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS CO ME OUT AN D THE LAST 15 YEARS. I DO N'T KNOW, THE LAST TIME Y OU WERE HERE MY BUDDY HANDED YOU A PACKET OF INFORMATION . DID YOU READ IT? REP. GA BBARD: I STARTED TO READ IT AND I PASSED IT ONTO MY STA FF. H E M ENTIONED YOU GUYS WO ULD BE GOING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO HE LP PAS S LEGISLATION FOR THOSE O F YO U WORKING IN THIS IND USTRY. T HANK YOU. I APPR ECIATE. WE WILL GRA B THAT FROM YOU BEFORE WE GO. THE WOR K THAT YOU AR E DOING TO RAISE MORE AWAREN ESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES YOU ALL ARE FACING, I THINK THAT THIS I S A BIG TOPIC. I WILL NOT CL AIM TO HAVE THE ANSWER TO EVERY SI NGLE RESPECT. A UNIVERSAL B ASIC INCOME WILL HELP P ROVIDE A LAYER OF SECURITY . T HAT'S FOR THOSE LIKE TO SELL THAT MAY BE FACED WITH THIS SERIOU S AND MASSIVE CHANGE IN YOUR LIVES ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN S NEXT. WHERE DO YOU GO? HOW DO YOU TRAN SFER YOUR SKILLS? WHAT OTHER OPPOR TUNITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU? I HAVE TALKED TO O THER FOLKS WHO ARE IN A SI MILAR POSITION. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR ENTIR E CARE ERS ON THE SUGAR PLANT ATION. JUST ON THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE VERY LA ST SUGAR PLANTATION IN OUR STAT E SHUTDOWN. T HEY WERE G IVEN SOME MONEY FOR TRANSIT ION ASSISTANCE. FOR SOMEONE WHO IS 65 YEARS OLD, THEY A RE TH INKING, WHAT KIND OF RETRAINI NG AM I GOING TO GO DO? WE HAVE TO GET TO THE REALITY OF THE SITU ATI ON. RECOGNIZE T HE INEVITABILITY OF WHAT IS COM ING. MAK E SURE W E ARE STANDING UP FOR OUR BROTHER S AND SISTERS. >> WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. IF I WERE FROM HAWAII I WOULD PRO BABLY RATHER BE THERE IN DECEMBER . REP. GABBARD: I LOVE MY C OUNTRY. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. >> I WANT TO ASK A SERIOUS QUE STION RELATED TO YOUR VOTE ON IMP EACHM ENT . YOU HAD A VERY UNIQUE VOTE . YOU VOTED PRESENT ON BOTH ARTICL ES OF IMPEACHMENT . THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YO U IS IF THERE WAS INCONTROVER TIBLE EVIDENCE OF A HIGH C RIME OR MISDEMEA NOR, WOULD YOU HAVE VO TED YES? REP. G ABBARD: YES. THIS I S PART OF THE PROBLEM. TH ROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, IT WAS AND CON TINUES TO BE EXTREMEL Y PARTISAN. T HIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE FO UNDER S WARNED AGAINST IN THE FEDERAL IST PAPERS. THE PROCESS WOULD RESULT IN A CONCLUSION THAT WAS BASED O N THE STRENGTH OF ONE PARTY O VER THE OTHER R ATHE R THAN OBJECTIVE A SSESSMENT OF INNOCENC E OR GUILT. T HAT SUCH AN OUTCOME WOU LD ONLY FURTHER DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY . TH IS IS WHY I VOTED PRE SIDENT TO , PRESE NT TO TAKE A STAND FOR OUR COU NTRY. TO TAKE A S TAND FOR THE PEOPLE. WE CAN AND SHOULD DEFE AT DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS MULTIPLE WR ONGDOINGS AND ABUSES OF POWER. AND DEFEAT HIM AND THR OW HIM OUT OF OFFICE SO WE CAN C OME TOGETH ER AS A COUNTR Y AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. I T IS WHY I IN TRODUCED A CENSURE RES OLUTION THAT LISTED MANY OTHER AREAS THAT WERE N OT INCLUDE D IN ANY IMPE ACHMENT ARTICLES OR DISCUSSE D THROUGHOUT THAT WHOLE PROCE SS. DE CISIONS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE TH AT WERE C LEARLY UNC ONSTITUT IONAL AND ILLEGAL. DR OPPING BO MBS AND ANOTHER COU NTRY WIT HOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL. V ETOING A W AR POWERS RESOLUTION FROM CONGRE SS TO STOP SUPPORTING SAUDI ARABI A'S GENOCIDE IN YEMEN. THERE ARE M ANY OTHER AREAS THAT I THIN K SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED B UT WEREN'T. GIVEN THE R EALITY OF THE SITUATION, I DO NOT WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUM P FURTHER EMBOLDENED AND STRENGT HENED AS HE WILL BE. THE SEN ATE WILL EXONERATE TRUMP. THEY WILL P ROCLAIM HIS INNOCENCE. HE WILL TAK E THAT MESSAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE HIS SUPPORT GRO W BECAUSE OF THAT. >> BY THE ABSE NCE OF YOUR YES VOTE, D OES THAT MEAN YOU DO NOT THINK T HERE WAS ANY INCONTR OVERTIBLE EVIDENCE? R EP. GABBARD: I'M SAYING THAT THE PR OCESS WAS FLAWED. THE ENTIRE PROCESS. TH AT IS WHY I COULD NOT IN GOOD CON SCI OUS VOTE EITHER YES OR NO. TRUM P H AS COMMITTED MANY ACTS OF WRO NGDOING. THAT I BELIEVE HAVE MADE O UR COUNTRY LESS SAFE. THAT IS WHY I'M SO COMMITTED TO DEFEATIN G HIM AND WORKING TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICA NS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO WE CAN R EMOVE THEM FROM OFFICE. >> BUT NONE RISING TO THE HIGH CRIME OR MISDEMEANOR ? REP. GABBARD: THE PROBLEM IS THE PROCESS . IF IT IS FLAWED, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE A CLEAR LOOK AT WHA T LEVELS AND WHAT HE HAS DONE . THAT WAS WHY I CHOSE TO TA KE THE VOTE I DID. [APPLA USE] >> I WAS WONDE RING I F YOU CAN ELABORA TE ON THE THIN GS THAT PRECEDE THESE REGIME WARS . THE C OVERT ACTIONS TAK EN BY OUR GOVERNM ENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE D ON'T KNOW IN 1949 IN SYRIA, T HE U.S. BACKED A COUP. IRO NI CALLY ENOUGH, THE GUY WHO WROTE T HE AFGHANISTAN PAPERS IN THE WASH INGTON POST, HE AL SO WROTE AN ARTICLE IN 2011 ABOUT THE U .S. INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA IN 2006. I WAS WONDERI NG WHAT YOUR THOUGH TS ON STOPPING THESE COVER T ACTIONS TO OVERTHROW G OVERNMENTS ? REP. GABBAR D: THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTI ON. S O OFTEN TH E STORY WE HEAR IN THE NEWS ABOUT SOME OF THESE WARS, REGIM E CHANGE WARS, WHETH ER THE Y ARE USING MILITARY ME ANS OR CO VERT MEANS THROUGH THE CIA OR THIS MODERN DAY SIEGE TACTI C OF DRACONIAN SANCTIONS TO TRY TO O VERTHROW A GOVERNMENT. THE BACK ST ORIES OFTEN NOT TOLD. W E DO NOT O FTEN FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENIN G UNTIL MAYBE DECADES LAT ER AS HAPPENED WITH IRAN. THAT WAS A REGIME CHANGE WAR THAT TH E U.S. PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW WE RE INVOLVED IN. WHAT IS AT ISSUE HERE IS MY POSITION THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOU LD NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS ROLE OF BEI NG THE POLICE OF THE WORLD. WE S HOULD NOT BE INTO THE BUSINES S OF OVERTHROWIN G DICTATORS THAT WE DO NOT LIKE . EVEN UNDER THE GUISE OF HUMANITA RIA NISM. WHEN WE LOOK THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF TH E WORLD, IT HAS RESULTED IN MORE SUF FERING AND STRUGGLING. IT HAS UNDERMINES THE INTERES TS O F OUR COUNTRY. YO U CAN GO ON AND ON. THERE I S SOME HYPOCRISY THERE. SOME DICTATORS, THE U.S. AS WE HAVE TO OVERTHROW THEM. OTHER S IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE UNITED STATES PROPS UP AND SUPP ORTS. E VEN CALLS ALLIES AND PARTNERS. T HIS IS SOMETHING I WILL AND AS , END A S PRESIDENT. INSTEAD FOCUS ON TH ESE DECISIONS A BOUT WHEN AND WH ERE OUR MILITARY TAKES ACTIO N. THI S LONG-STANDI NG PRACTICE OF REGIME C HANGE AND NATIONBUILD ING. REALLY HAVI NG THE FORESIGHT TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE TH E CONSEQU ENCE S DOWN THE LINE OF THOSE ACTIONS? WI LL THEY ACTUAL LY HELP PEOPLE IN O THER COUNT RIES? OR WILL IT HURT? THAT IS SOMETHIN G THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTE N ENOUGH. IN THE BACK . >> I WANT TO S AY I THINK YOU ARE AMAZING . HO W WILL WE DEAL WITH FOREIGN LEA DERS WHO DO NOT TREAT WOMEN LIKE WOMEN? REP. GABBAR D: GOOD QUESTION. I T IS SOMET HING I HAVE DEALT WITH BEFORE . DUR ING MY S ECOND DEPLOYMENT TO THE MIDD LE EAST, ONE OF MY PLATOON' S M ISSIONS WAS TO CONDUCT COU NTERTERRORISM TRAINING WI TH THE KUWAIT ARMY . I WAS A LIEUTENANT. I HAVE MY SERGEANT AND WE BROU GHT SOME OF OUR SOLDIERS. W E WENT TO THEIR CAMP TO BEGIN TH IS TRAINING. F ROM THE OUTSET, I WAS TOLD, T HEY DO NOT ALLOW WOMEN ONTO THEIR CAMP. OBVIOUSLY I HAD A MISSI ON. I WENT ANYWAY. THE GUARD AT THE GATE, HE WAS A LI TTLE PUZZLED WHEN HE LOOKED A T ME. HE WAVE D US THROUGH. AS WE WENT DOW N THE LINE AND STARTED MEETING THE SOLDIERS WE WOULD BE TRAINING, HALF OF THEM DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I EXISTED A T ALL. THEY WOULD NOT SHAKE M Y HAND. THEY WOULD NOT MAKE EYE CO NTACT. IT WAS AS THOUGH I WAS INVIS IB LE, SIMPLY BECAUSE I A M A WOMAN. TH E WAY I TREATED THIS SITUAT ION WAS I GOT THERE CULTU RAL DI FFERENCE AND BACKGRO UND AND WHAT TH EY WERE COMING FROM . BUT I KNEW WHAT MY MIS SION WAS. I LET MY ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDE R THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE WE NT AND GOT THIS TR AINING. W E DID IT A FEW DAYS A WEEK. WE SHOWED THEM HOW TO SHOOT THEIR FIREARMS. W E SHOWED T HEM HOW TO CONDUCT BASIC COUNTERTERR ORISM TACTICS. HOW TO CLEAR BU ILDINGS. HOW TO DEAL WITH CIVIL DISOBEDIENC E AND RIOTS. WHAT I FOUND WAS AS TIME WENT ON, THEY SAW ME NOT AS A WOMAN WITH THEIR PRECO NCEIVED NOTIONS BUT AS A FELLOW SOLDIER WHO THEY GREW T O RESPECT, BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIE NCE AND LEADERSHIP THAT I BROUGHT T O THE TABLE AND WHAT THIS R ESULT ED IN WAS, ON GRADUATI ON DAY, WHEN THEY WERE DONE W ITH T HEIR TRAINING COURSE, THE Y GATHER ED IN A ROOM. THEIR COMMA NDER WHO WAS A VERY CONSER VATIV E MUSLIM, HE CALLED ME UP TO TH E FRONT IN FRONT OF ALL OF H IS SOLDIERS AND HE PRESENTE D ME WITH AN AWARD FOR THE APP RECIATION FOR THE TRAININ G WE HAD GIVEN TO HIS UNIT. A S WE LEFT, THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THERE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THESE GUYS FOR A LONG TIME. HE SA ID I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST H APPENED. WHAT IT TOOK FOR TH IS COMMANDER TO RECOGNIZE A WOMAN IN FRONT OF HIS SUBORDINATE S. IN FRONT OF HIS SOLDIERS. W HAT KIND OF HISTORIC THING THAT WAS. W HATEV ER THE OBSTACLES WERE, IT HA S BEEN MY PRACTICE TO SAY MY L EADERSH IP WILL ALLOW ME TO OVERC OME THE OBSTACLES THAT OTHERS MAY PLACE BEFORE US. PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT I MEAN BUSI NESS. I WILL NOT BE DETRACTED A WAY FROM MY MISSION OF WORKING FOR AND REPRESENTING OUR COUNTRY WIT H STRENGTH AND PRIDE. [APPLAUSE] >> I HAVE A CO MMENT AND A QUESTION. M Y COMMENT THANK YOU F OR BRINGING DOWN KAMALA HARR IS'S CAMPAIGN. W E REALLY DODGED A BU LLET WITH THAT O NE. MY QUE STION WAS YOU EMP HASIZE T HE UNITER IN CHIEF AS PECT. I K NOW ONE OF YOUR BIG GEST ISSUES IS ENDING FORE IGN WARS AND PROTECT CIVIL LIBER TIES. THERE ARE REPUBLI CANS IN CONGRESS AND IN THE COUN TRY IN GENERAL WHO AGREE WITH THAT KIND OF GOA L. I WAN T TO KNOW WHO YO UR FAVORITE REPUBLICAN HAS BEEN TO WORK WITH IN CONGRESS ON THE SPIR IT OF THAT QUE STION? R EP. GABBARD: I HAVE WORKED WITH A LOT OF MY REPUB LICAN COLLEAGUES ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. YOU MENTIONED C IVIL LIBERTIES. I WORKED A LOT WITH FORMER CONG RESSMAN TREY GOWDY. I HA VE WORKED WITH CONGRESSMAN JUSTIN AMAS H AND CONGRESSMAN TOM MASSEY. NOW PASSED AWAY CONGRESSMAN WALTER JONE S ON ISSUES RELATED TO ENDING P RESIDENTIAL WARS. RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTION AND THE ROL E THAT C ONGRESS HAS. TO BE THE BODY THAT DECIDES WHE THER OR NOT TO DECLARE WAR. I'VE W ORKED WITH A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN IN FLORIDA WHO IS A COMBAT VE TE RAN. CONGRESSMAN BRIAN MAST WHO LOST THREE LIMBS IN HIS SERVICE. ON VETERANS RELATED ISSUES, SOM ETHING T HAT WE ARE WORKING ON THAT HAV E T O DO WITH MAKING SURE OUR GE NERAT ION OF POST-9/11 V ETERANS DOES NOT HAVE TO DEAL WIT H W HAT OUR VIETNAM VETERANS FA CED IN AGENT ORANGE. MAN Y ARE SUFFERING AND STRUGGL ING WITH RARE CANCERS AND REALLY TERRIBLE RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES BECAUSE OF THAT EXPOSU RE. I WORKED WITH A LOT OF DIFFEREN T P EOPLE IN CONGRESS ON A LOT OF DIFFEREN T ISSUES. FIN DING THOSE AREAS WHERE WE CA N FIND AG REEMENT PRESENT THAT UNITED FRONT TO THE AMERICAN PE OPLE. AS DIVIDED AS THINGS ARE, WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND TACKLE SOME OF THE GREATEST ISSUES OF OUR TIME . WE ST ILL RESPECT EACH OTHER. WE S TILL MAINTAIN FRIENDSHIPS BECAUSE OF THAT FOUNDATION. [APPLAUSE] >> WE HAVE A P ROBLEM WIT H PEOPLE TAKI NG POSITIONS OF POWER IN GOVERNME NT AND THEN THEY B ECOME VERY RICH. REP. GABBARD: I HAVE ALWA YS WOND ERED HOW THAT HA PPENS. >> WOULD YOU SUPPORT SOMETHING L IKE SENATORS, P RESIDENTS, AND THEIR F AMILY MEMBERS TO GET YEARLY AUDITS BY I NDEPENDENT PARTIES? IF SOMETHING L IKE THAT HAPPENED, I THINK WE WOULD SEE BIG CHANGES IN HOW POLITIC IANS PUSH FOREIGN AID TO OTHER CO UNTRIES OVER THE HOMELAND. R EP. GABBAR D: THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT I SSUE. I TA LKED AB OUT THIS PAY TO PLAY CULTURE IN WASHINGTON. THIS REVOLV ING DOOR THAT WE SEE BETWEEN MEM BERS OF CONGRESS AND SENIOR STAF FERS WHO WORK ACROSS DIFF ERENT I NDUSTRIES IN WASHINGT ON. AREA THEY W ILL GO FROM SPENDING TI ME IN THI S PUBLIC SERVICE ARE NA AND T HEN LEAVING AND GETTING BIG PAYOUTS. PE OPLE THEN GO AND WORK AND GET A B IG P AYCHECK FROM AN INDUSTRY TH EY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE REGULATI NG. THERE MUST BE TRANSPARENCY AND NOT ONL Y WHERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR SPOUSES ARE GETTING THEIR INCOME FROM. ARE T HEY ABUSING THEIR POSITION OF INFLUENCE? GETTING PERSONALLY FINANCIAL B ENEFITS FROM THOSE RELAT IONSHI PS? I THINK WE HAVE TO GO EVEN FURTHER. THERE IS A FINANC IAL DISCLOSURE FORM. YOU C OULD LOOK IT UP, WHERE Y OU CAN SEE WHERE YOU YOU ARE GET TING YOUR INCOME FROM, WHAT STOCKS ARE YOU INVESTING I N? THERE I S A CONGRESSMAN WHO JUST RE SIGN ED BECAUSE HE WAS , I DON'T REM EMBER THE DETAILS , BUT THE BOT TOM LINE WAS HE WAS IN A PO SITION OF POWER ON A COMMITTEE . TURNS OUT HE WAS A MAJOR SHARE HOLDER IN A COMPAN Y AND HE WAS ENCO URAGING OTHER MEMBE RS OF CONGRESS TO INVEST IN T HE COMPANY AND THEN MADE D ECISIONS I N CONGRESS THAT WOULD THEN IF IT THAT COMPANY. I THINK IT WAS A PH ARMACEUTI CAL COMPANY. CH RIS COLLINS. HE IS BEING INDICTED FO R IT. MAKING SURE THAT TRANSP ARENCY IS THERE AN D THE ACCOUNT ABILITY IS THERE. I DO N'T THINK MEMBE RS OF CONGRESS SHOULD BE A LLOWED TO INVEST I N STOCKS. TO BE IN A POSITI ON WHERE THEY CAN PE RSONALLY BENEFIT OFF OF THOSE DE CISIONS. WHETHER YOU ARE ON THE COMMITTEE O F JURISDIC TION OR NOT, EVERYONE OF US HAS T O VOTE ON BILLS RELATED TO EVERY SI NGLE SECTOR IN O UR ECONOMY , DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AND NO ONE SHOULD BE IN POSITION OF BENEFITING FROM THAT. MEMBE RS OF CONGRESS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BECOME L OBBYISTS. NEITHER SHOULD SENI OR STAFFERS. CLOSING THI S REVOLVING DOOR AND OUR GOV ERNMENT WILL DO A LOT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL O F CORRUPTION AND INFLUEN CE. IT IS BEING EXPLOITED BY TOO MANY PEOPLE IN A POSITION OF POWER FOR T HEIR OWN FINANCIAL G AIN. JUST LIKE W E SEE, DO WE HAVE ANY TEACHER S HE RE TODAY? THAN K YOU F OR YOUR SERVICE. TEACHERS, N URSES, FIREFIGHTER S, LAW ENFORCE MENT OFFICERS, SCHOOL COUN SELORS, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONA LS, WHEN YOU GO DOWN THI S LIST, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO SERVE. THEY ARE NOT GETTING INTO THESE PROFE SSIONS FOR THE MONEY. NOT EXPLOIT ING THEM FOR PERSONAL GAIN. >> I JUST LEAR NED ABOUT YOU RECENTLY AN D FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT. BUT BEFORE THAT, I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO SETTLE I N F OR THE BIG NAM ES LIKE WARREN OR SANDERS. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO STAND UP AGAINST THE SE PEOPL E THAT ARE MORE HOUSEHOLD NAMES COMPA RED TO YOU? >> I'M COUNTIN G ON YOU TO HELP ME DO THAT. AND THANK Y OU.

THERE WAS A BIG ISSUE IN THE HALLWAY S THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. VETE RAN SUICIDE IN AUSTRALIA, MOTHERS OF VETERANS WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR OWN LIVES. LABOUR SUPPORTS TH E MOVE. IT WANTS TO KNOW IF THE GOVERNMENT WILL. >> MY QUESTION IS ADDRESSED TO THE PRIME MINIS TER. EVERY MEMBER OF THIS PARLIA MENT AGREES THAT REDUCING THE APPALLI NGLY HIGH RATES OF VETERAN SUI CIDES IN AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE A N ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. WE HAVE MET WITH JULIANNE FINNEY. HER SON DIE D EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND HER PET ITION HAS ALREADY ATTRACTED A QUARTER O F A MILLION SIGNATURES. WILL THE PRIME M INISTER AGREE WITH MRS. FINNEY'S CA LLS, JOINING WITH US? P.M. MO RRISON: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I HAVE MET WI TH JULIANNE FINNEY JUST LAST WEEK H ERE IN CANBERRA. WE HAD ANOT HER VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION. HER SON DAV ID HAD DIED BY SUICIDE EAR LIER THIS YEAR. I ALSO MET WITH MA NY OTHER PARENTS IN SYDNEY RECE NTLY TO DISCUSS THEIR PROPOSAL FO R A ROYAL COM MI SSION TO BE HELD FOR VETERAN SUI CIDE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE RATE OF MENTAL I LLNESS AMONG VETERANS IS UNACCEPT ABLY HIGH. THE S UICIDE RATE FOR MEN UNDER 3 0 IS 2.2 T IMES THAT FOR AUSTRALIAN MEN OF THE SAME AGE. ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE WH O HAVE LEFT IN THE PAST FIVE Y EARS HAVE REPORT ED HIGH TO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. M R. SPEAKER, THIS HAS BEEN A MATTER THAT HAS BEEN MADE A NATI ONAL PRIORITY BY MY GOVERNMENT AS PART OF ITS BROADER FOCUS TOWARD THE GOAL TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSU ES AND ADDRESS SUICIDE PREVENTION. CHRISTINE MORGAN HAS BEEN APPOINTED AS THE NATIONA L SU ICIDE PREVENTION ADVISOR. WE HAVE HEL PED A NUMBER OF DETAILED PO LICY DECISIONS WITH OFFICI ALS, INCLUDING W ITH THE HEAD OF THE DEFENSE COR PS AND T HOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEP ARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. THERE ARE MANY CH ANGES BEING MADE, BOTH IN THE WAY THE DEFENSE FORCE OPERATES AN D HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OPERATES. F OUR THANK , I WANT TO THANK TH EM FOR THE CHA NGES. I SAID TO J ULIANNE, I WISH THOS E ARRANGEMENT S HAD BEEN IN PLACE WHEN HER SON HAD BEEN IN THE DEFENSE FORCE. I WI SH THEY HAD BE EN IN PLACE FOR A LL THE AUSTRALIANS WHO HAVE SE RVED AND HAVE PASSED AWAY FROM O UR DE FENSE FORCES. THE LESSONS ARE BEING PUT INTO PLACE. I HA VE REMAINED OPEN TO THIS QUE STION, A ND I REMAIN OPEN TO THIS QUESTION. I AM WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE MI NISTER OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, AN D I AM ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WIT H THE VETERANS WHO ARE IN THIS CHA MBER, AND I WOULD WELCO ME THE INPUT FROM VETERANS ON THE OTHERS OF THE CHAMBER. , THE OTHER S IDE OF THE CHAMBER . I MET WITH A MEMBER TO TALK ABO UT THESE ISSUES. I H AVE GIVEN AN UNDERTAKING THAT WE WILL CONTIN UE TO REFLECT ON THESE THING S OVER THE BREAK BEFORE MAKING A DE CISION ON THIS MATTER. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THIS . WHAT I AM SEEKING TO DO IS EN SURE THAT WHENEVER A VETERAN HAS SADLY T AKEN THEIR LIFE, WHETH ER IN THE PAST OR SADLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT W OULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTU RE, BUT NOBODY COULD STAND HERE AND SAY THAT, O N EVERY SINGL E OCCASION THERE MUST BE JUS TICE, THERE MUST BE ACCOUNTABIL ITY, THERE MUST BE LEARNINGS, AND THERE M UST BE CHANGE, AND THAT IS WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO. >> THE GOVERNMENT HAD A PARLIAMENTA RY LOSS IN THE SECOND WEEK OVER A UNIO N BILL. THE FINAL W EEK, IT DID MANAGE TO GET KEY SUPPORT AND REPEAL THE MEDICAL EVACUATIONS OF ASYLUM-SEEK ERS BILL. IT GO T SUPPORT. LA BOR WANTE D TO KNOW HOW. >> THANK YOU, MR. SP EAKER. MY QUESTION IS TO THE P RIME MINISTER. I REFERRED TO SENATOR LAMBIE'S ST ATEMENT T O THE SENATE THAT SHE CUT A DEAL WITH THE GOVERNM ENT TO REPEAL T HE MEDEVAC LEGISLATION . HAS THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY AGR EED TO R ESETTLE PEOPLE TO NEW ZEALAND? IF NOT, WHAT IS THE DEAL? P .M. MORRIS ON: I AM NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE MEMBER IS REFERRING TO. I HAVE BEFO RE ME WHAT THE COMMENTS WERE IN THE SENATE ON T HIS BILL. IT MA KES A REFERENCE TO THAT. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SENATOR LAM BIE IS F ULLY AW ARE OF THE GOVERNM ENT' S POLICIES AN D IS PLEASED WITH THOSE POLIC IES. TODAY, SHE HAS SUPPORT ED THE POLICIES BY SUPPORTING THE REPEAL OF THE MEDEVAC BILL, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE LABOR P ARTY A YEAR AGO AROUND THIS TIME, AND THE LABOR PARTY DID THAT BE CAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN A STRONG BORDER PROTECTION. MR. SPEAKER, ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYTHS IS TH AT THE LABOR PARTY HAS THE SAME POLICY AS T HE NATIONALS W HEN IT COMES TO BORDER PROTECTION. THAT IS SIM PLY UNTRUE. ON EVERY OCCASION, T HIS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, JUST LIKE THE LAST LE ADER OF THE OPPO SITION, HAS PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE WEAK ON BORDER P ROTECTION. THE AUSTRAL IAN PEOPLE KNOW IT. THEY KNOW L ABOUR CANN OT BE TRUSTED ON BORDER PROTECTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW T HEY ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE LAST TIME AND A TIME BEFORE THAT WHEN WE SAW THESE THINGS OCCU R IN THE WAY THEY DID. SEEKING TO FRUSTRATE THE POLICIE S OF THE GOVERNMENT WHEN WE HAV E SOUGHT TO REMEDY THE QUESTIO NS. LABOUR ARE WEAK ON BORDER PROT ECTION. THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE KNOW IT, AND THI S LEADER OF THE LABOUR PART Y IS WEAK ON BORDER PROTECTION. HE CONFIRMED THAT TODAY BY HI S RESPONS E AND HIS REACTIO N TO THE REPEAL OF THE MEDEVAC BIL L. OUR GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES WE RE SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO REQUIRE MEDICAL ATTENTION, AND THEY WERE B ROUGHT TO AUSTRALIA. IT WAS OUR GOVERNMENT THAT GOT EVERY SINGL E CHILD , THAT WAS DONE UNDER MY PR IME MINISTERSHI P. WE ENSURED WE DID THAT . THIS LABOR PARTY WAS THE LABOR P ARTY THAT SENT CHILDREN TO THE ISLAND. HOW DO I KNOW THAT ? I WENT THER E AS A SHADOW IM MIGRATION MINISTER, AND I SAT W ITH THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN TH EY SENSE THERE. I WILL NOT TAKE PICTURES , [CROSSTALKING] , OUTRAGEOUS TREATMENT OF WOMEN AN D CHILDREN, AND THEY DID NO THING. WE GOT EVER Y SINGLE CHILD. THE LABOR PARTY'S RECORD ON THIS ISS UE IS BEYOND DISGRACE. I F THIS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY EVER GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN CHARGE OF BORDER P ROTECTION, HE WOULD SET A NEW L OW. >> RIG HT AT THE END OF THE PARL IAMENTARY YEAR WAS A SURPR ISING ANNOUNCEMENT ON POLICY I N REARRANGING AND RESTRUC TURING THE DEPARTM ENTS WITHIN GOVERNMENT, GOING FROM 18 DOWN TO 14. THAT ME ANT FIVE DEPART MENT HEADS HAVE GONE. >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. MY QUESTION IS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER. CAN THE PRI ME MINISTER CONFIRM THAT HE HAS CUT FIVE DEPART MENTAL SECRETARIES ? >> THE PRIME M INISTER HAS THE CALL. P.M. MORRIS ON: I AM HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PART OF THAT QUESTION. T HE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS ANOTHER UGLY SMEAR FROM THE OP POSITION. [CROWD SHOUTING] T HEY TODAY HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES TO BE ANGRY . THEY HAVE REMAIN ED ANGRY SINCE THE 18TH OF MAY . THE PEOPLE THEY ARE MOST ANGRY AT AR E THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE REJECTED TH EM AT THE LAST ELECTI ON AN D THEIR SOFT POLICI ES ON BORDER PROTECTION, AND THEIR L ACK OF FAITH IN THE AUSTRAL IAN PEOPLE TO KEEP MORE OF WHAT THE Y EARNED. WHA T I DID TODAY IN ANNOUNCING A RESTRUCTU RED AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERV ICE IS TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC SERVICE IS FOCUSED ON AUSTRALI A. THAT THEY A RE FOCUSED AND HAVE A CLEAR LIN E OF SIGHT BE TWE EN WHAT THEY DO AND THE NEEDS OF THOSE ON THE GROUND. IT IS TRUE, I REDUCED T HE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS FROM 18 DOW N TO 14. THEY AR E THE SOURCE OF R EFORMS THI S COUNTRY NEEDS, BECA USE I RESPECT A ND VALUE THE E XCELLENT WORK OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. I WANT TO GIVE THE M THE RIGHT STRUCTURE THAT ENABLE S THEM TO DELIVER ON THE SERV ICES TH AT ARE NEEDED RIGHT ACROS S THIS COUNTR Y, WHETHER IT IS PROVI DIN G SERVICES , THE MINISTER HAS JUST OU TLINED THE OUTSTANDING WORK OF THE RECOVERY AGENCY, WHICH WILL NOW BE GIVEN A BROADER CHARTER AND ASSISTI NG T HEIR RECOV ERY AN D IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE DROUGHT. WE HAVE WHOLE OF LIFE EDUCAT ION, AND UNDERST ANDING THE EQUIPPING W E GIVE TO PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTR Y OF WHATEVER AGE THROUGH OUR EDUCATIONAL, VOCATIONAL, OR INWARD P LANNING SYSTEM IS ALL DESI GNED TO GET THEM INTO A JOB AND K EE P TH EM IN A JOB AT WHATEVER AGE THEY AR E AT. AND TO ENSU RE THAT COMMUNICATI ONS ARE LINKED WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM TO ENSURE IT IS CONNECTED TO OUR REGI ONA L DE VELOPMENTAL AGENDA. WE ARE INSURING OUR HUMAN S ERVICES DEPARTMENT IS PART OF THE BROA DER SOCIAL SERVICES PO RTFOLIO, AND THROUGH THE WORK OF THE MINISTE R, THAT GOVERN MENT SERVICES CA N GIVE THOSE SERVICES TO PEOPLE O N THE GROUND. IT IS IMPORTANT W E HAVE A PUBLIC SERV ICE THA T IS SUPPORTED B Y THE GOVERNMENT TO GET THE JOB DONE, A ND THAT IS WHY I TOOK THE DECISION I TOOK TODA Y. I EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO WORK FOR THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. I A M ENSURI NG THE AUSTRAL IAN PUBLIC SERV ICE IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING FOR AUSTRALIA. >> AMID DEBATE ABOU T JUST WHAT T O DO WITH THE VARIOUS ASYLUM-SEEK ERS AND REFUGEES, E ITHER IN A USTRALIA OR UNMANNED ASSIGNMENT, THERE IS A QUESTION OF RESETTLEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE. >> THANK YOU. MY QUESTION IS TO THE MINISTE R. L AST WEEK, THE GOVERNMENT RESETTLED A REFUGEE ACCUSED OF MURDERIN G EIGHT WESTERN TOURISTS DU RING A RA MPAGE IN UGANDA IN 1999. TW O O THERS ACCUSED OF THE SAME CRIMES RESETTLED IN AUSTRALIA LAST YEAR. THE THREE OF THEM WERE B ROUGHT HERE UNDER THE REFUGEE SWA P THAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE UN ITED STAT ES. WHAT KIND OF DEAL IS THIS? THE U .S. CLEARLY DID NOT WAN T THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY HELD THEM F OR MORE THAN A DECADE IN I MMIGRATION DETENTION. DO THESE ME N POSE A SECURITY RI SK TO THE AUSTRAL IAN COMMUNITY, AND HAS THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY B EEN TOLD? >> TH ANK YOU, MR. PR ESIDENT. I THANK THE SENATOR FOR THE QUE STION IN RELATION TO THE DETAILS OF THOSE THAT THE SENATOR HAS REFERRED TO. WE WOULD NORMALLY NO T COMMENT ON INDIVIDUAL CASES, BUT WHAT I WILL DO, BECAUSE I D ON'T HAVE A BRIEF ON THAT, IS TH AT ON NOTICE , I S TAKE THA T ON NOTICE FOR YOU. I HAVE SAID THAT I WILL TAKE IT , [CROWD SHOUTING] > > I CANNOT HEAR THE MINISTER. IF I CANNOT HEAR HER, THEN OTHERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. >> WHAT I CAN ADVISE YOU IS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRMED P UBLICLY IN MAY OF THIS YEA R THAT A USTRALIA HAD RESETTL ED TWO FROM THE UNITED STAT ES IN 2018. HE ALSO STATED THES E PEOPLE WERE RESETT LED AS REFUGEES , ALONG WITH OTHER RWAND AN PEOPLE FROM OUR RA NGE OF OTHER CO UNTRIES UNDER AUSTR ALIA'S ONGOING HUMANITARIA N PROGRAM. HE ALSO SAI D, AS THE PRIME MINIS TER NO TED, BOTH INDIVIDUALS WERE SUBJEC T TO STRICT SECURITY AN D CHARACT ER CHECKS. >> SENATOR LAM BIE. >> THE FORMER U.S. JUDGE REJEC TED TH E ASYLUM CLAIM TOWAR D THOSE RWANDAN MEN IN 2007 BECAUS E HE BELIEVED THEY WERE A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. HE NOTED THAT THESE MEN WERE ME MBERS OF A TERRORIST G ROUP. HE DID NOT FIND THEY HAD BE EN REHABILITAT ED. IF THESE ME N TRY TO COME UNDER SECTI ON 501 OF THE IMMIGRATION ACT, THEY WOULD BE REJECTED ON CHARACTER GROUNDS. HO W ABOUT THAT? >> THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. >> AGAIN, MR. PRESIDENT, WE WOULD NO T NORMALLY COMMENT ON INDIVIDUAL CASES. I WI LL GO BACK TO THE COMM ENTS TH AT THE PRIME MINIS TER MADE AT THE TIME . BOTH INDIVI DUALS WERE SUBJECT TO STRICT SECU RITY AND CHARACTER C HECKS. I C AN ALSO ADVISE THAT THE RWANDANS WERE NOT PART OF THE UNITED STATES RESETTLEMEN T ARRANGEMENT. >> SENATOR LAM BIE, FINAL SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION. > > I AM NOT SU RE , [INDISCERNIBLE] IT IS ABSUR D THIS IS GOING ON. THE AUS TRALIANS DESERVE TO KNOW THAT T HE DEAL IS PUTTING THEIR SAFETY AT R ISK. THEY DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT T HE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO DO HERE , BECA USE AT THE MOMENT IT L OOKS AS TH OUGH WE ARE GIVING THE U.S. RE FUGE ES AN D GIVING MORE CRIMINALS A BED IN RE TURN. HOW MANY MO RE MEMBERS OF A TERRORIST O RGANIZATION DO YOU PLAN TO BRI NG TO AUSTRALIA? >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO REJECT THE PREMISE OF SENATOR LAMBIE'S QU ESTION OUTRIGHT. I N RESPONSE TO SENATOR LAMBIE'S FI RST SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION, I DID ADVIS E THE RWANDAN S WERE NOT PART OF THE UNITED STAT ES RESETTLEMENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH MAKES ALL OTHER STATEMENTS SENATOR LAM BIE HAS MADE REDUND ANT. >> HAVE YOU CONCLUDED YOUR ANSWER S, SENATOR CASH? >> TH EY CONTINUED TO PUSH THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. LAT EST REPO RT ON THE GREAT BARRIER REE F NOT A ROSY ONE. >> MY QUESTION IS TO SENATOR MURDERING H IM , SENATOR BIRMINGHAM. AUSTRALIA H AD HOMEWORK TO SHOW WHY THE GREAT BARRIER REEF SHOULD NOT BE LISTED AS ENDANGERED.

T HE GOVERNMENT TAKES THE HEALTH OF THE GREAT B ARRIER REEF INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SUPPORTED R ECORD LEVE LS OF INVESTMENT AND SUPPORT AS PART OF OUR REEF PROTECTION EFFORTS, WH ICH ARE DESIGNED TO BUILD RE SIL IENCE FOR THE REE F AND AD DRESS THE MANY CH ALLENGES IT FACES. AND TO DO T HAT JOINTLY WIT H THE QU EENSLAND GOVERNMENT. AS PART OF OUR WE P ROTECTION EFFORTS, WE HAVE DEV ELOPED A PLAN JOINTL Y WIT H THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT.

SENATOR BIR MINGHAM. >> I AM NOT SU RE THERE IS A LOT OF CHRISTMAS S PIRIT IN THOSE COMMENTS EITHER. IN TERMS OF OUR COMM ITMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS OUTLINE D PLANS TO MAKE 203 0 TARGETS IN RELATION TO CLIMATE ACTION. THA T IS WHAT THE CLIMATE SOL UTION TA KES US TH ROUGH, 10 BY 10.

IT DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE MILLION S IN DONATIONS FROM BIG OIL, BI G COAL, AND BIG GAS TO YOUR PAR TY OVER THE LAST FO UR YEARS. WHEN WILL YOU BAN DONATIO NS FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, A N INDUSTRY WHICH BENEFITS NI CELY FROM YOUR LACK OF CLIMATE POLICY? >> ORDER.

I WILL CALL ON THE MINISTER TO RESPOND AS FAR AS THE RESPONS IBILITY TO REPRESEN T. >> THAT SUPPLE MENTARY QUESTION FR OM SENATOR WAT ERS HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLET E MISLEADING RUBBISH WE GET FROM THE AUSTRALIA GREENS. WHE N IT COMES TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE POL ICY, DECIDING TO BRING IT INTO A W HOLE RANGE OF OTHER MATTERS AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT THIS I S ABOUT DEALING WITH A GLOBAL PR OBLEM THROUGH GLO BAL COOP ERATION AND ACTION. THEY ARE WR ONG. WE HAVE DONE SO CONSISTE NTLY OVER RECENT YEARS IN TERMS OF SIGNING ONTO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHA NGE AGREEMENTS, ACTING IN ACCORDAN CE WITH THEM, SIGNING ONTO FUTURE AGREEMENTS SUCH AS THE PARI S AGREEMENT, AND WE ARE ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT. IT DOES NOT COME DOWN TO A SINGLE PIECE OF RE GULATORY APPROVAL FOR ONE MIN ING PROJECT. IT DOES NOT COME DO WN TO WHAT THE NATION'S ELECTORAL F INANCING LAWS MIGHT LOOK LIKE. IT COMES DOWN TO WORKING IN CONCERT WITH OTHER NATIONS TO MAKE SUR E THAT WE DELIVER UPON OUR CO MMITMENT AND ENSURE THEY DELIVER UPO N THEIRS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING. > > AND THEIR I S THE BUSHFIRE CR ISIS, WHICH HAS HAD THE ATTENTION OF ALL OF AUSTRALIA AS WELL AS THE PARLIAM ENT. ON A PRACTI CAL LEVEL, A SENATOR W ANTS TO KNOW ABOUT FUTURE PLAN S, WHETHER OR NOT JUST LEASING THEM FROM C OUNTRIES IN THE NORTHER N HE MISPHERE WOULD STILL BE AD EQUATE. >> MY QUESTION IS TO THE MINISTE R REPRESENTING THE MINISTER FOR NATURAL DISASTER, S ENATOR MCKENZIE. Q UESTIONS HAVE BEEN R AISED BY A FORMER NE W SOUTH WALES FIRE CHIEF ABOUT WHETH ER THEIR LONG-STANDING PRACTICE OF RELEASING FIREFIGHTIN G AIRCRAFT IS SUSTAINABLE AS GLOBAL F IRE SEASONS CON VERGE. THE COMMONW EALTH PROVIDES 90 % OF THE FUNDING FOR THE AERIAL FIRE FIGHTIN G CENTER, WHI CH RELEASES FIREFIGHTING PLANES. IT IS TRIPLED FROM 52 TO MORE THAN 1 40. THEY C OLLECT CON SIDERABLE COST FROM PRIVATE COU NTRIES LEASED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTL Y STARTED ACQUIRING ITS OWN FIR EFIGHTING AIRCRAFT. IS THE FEDE RAL GOVERNMENT CONFIDENT T HEY HAVE LEASED SUFF ICIENT AIRCRAFT FOR THIS SU MMER? >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QU ESTION. AND I CAN PROVIDE YOU AN ANSWER. AERIAL FIREFIGHTING PLAYS AN IM PORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTI NG COMMUNITIES AND ESSENTI AL INFRASTRUCT URE, AND PROVIDING VITALS TO F IREFIGHTERS ON THE GROU ND. WHILE AERIAL FIREFIGHTIN G IS ONE ASPECT, FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS JURI SDICTIONS USE A COMBI NATION OF FIREFIGH TING TACTICS PRIOR TO AN D DURING OPER ATIONS. THE NATIONA L AERIAL FIREFIGHTING CENTER WAS AN INCORPORATED COMPANY FOR MED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN 2003, AND IT IS N OW A BUSIN ESS UNIT OF THE AUST RALIAN FIRE EMERGENCY S ERVICES COUNSEL. IT REPRESENTS A COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER MAN AGEMENT CAPABILITY.

THE LEASING THE Y HAVE ADVISE D THE GOVERNMENT THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH AERIAL FIRE FIGHTIN G EFFORTS. DO WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED GIVEN THE CONTEXT? TH EY HAVE R ETURNED THAT THEY DO. HOWEVER, TH E GOVERNMENT REMAINS OPEN TO REQ UESTS. T HAT WILL C ONTINUE TO BE A FLEXIBLE AR RANGEMENT WITH US RES PONDI NG AS NEEDED. WE SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY. THE NFIC HA S CONTRACTS IN PLACE WHICH GUARANTEE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT AR E ON STANDBY DURING THE FIRE SE ASON. THIS IS THE CASE OF BOTH SMA LL LOCAL AIRCR AFT AND LARGE AIRCRAFT. >> SUPPLEMENTA RY QUESTION. > > AS FIRE SEA SONS LAST LONGER IN PLACES L IKE GREECE AND THE U.S. AND ST ART EARLIER IN AUSTRALIA, THERE IS A RISK THAT AIRCRA FT IN FUTURE YEARS WILL BE IN USE O VER SEA S AND NOT AVAILABLE HERE. WHAT IS THE LONG-TERM PLAN TO ENS URE THE AIRCRAFT ARE AVAILAB LE WHEN NEEDED? >> THANK YOU V ERY MUCH, SENATOR. WE HAVE 147 AIRCRAFT RE LEASED AT THE MOMENT. THI S CHANGE S THROUGHOUT THE BUSHFIR E SEASON, DEPENDING ON ASSESSED RISK AND TIMEFRA ME. I AM HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THOSE, BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, TO YO UR DIRECT QUESTION, T HERE IS AN APPARENT TREND OF LO NGER FIRE SEASONS IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN HEMISPHERES . ALTHOUGH SOME FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT AR E SHARED WITH THE NORTHER N HEMISPHERE, THE NATIONAL AERIAL FIREFIGHTIN G CENTER WILL CONTRACT 141 SPECIAL IZED AIRCRAFT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND OVER TH REE QUARTERS OF THESE RE MAI N RESIDENT IN AUSTRALIA YEAR-ROUND. THE FIREFIGHTING CENTER ACKN OWLEDGES THE POTENTIAL C HALLENGE O F LONGER FIRE SEASONS AND THE NEE D TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MAN AGE INTE RNATIONAL MOVEMENT OF RESOURCES. >> FINAL SUPPL EMENTARY QUESTION. >> IN CANADA, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS A FLEET OF FIREFIGHTIN G AIRCRAFT, W HICH IT LEASES OUT TO PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT LOCAL RESOURCES. HAS THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT DETERMINED THE VALUE AND COST OF , I F IT WERE TO PUR CHASE A CORE FLEET OF FI REFIGHTING AIRCRAFT FOR AUSTRAL IA, FOR FUTURE FIREFIGHTING SEASONS? >> THANK YOU. FIREFI GHTING AIRCRAFT ARE GENERAL LY LINKED DUE TO THE HIGH CO ST OF PURCHASING AND MAINTAI NING SPECIALIST AIRCRAFT. THE AUSTRAL IAN FIRE SEASON TYPICALLY O CCURS DURING THE OFF-SEASON FOR U.S., C ANADA, AND EUROPEA N FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT. T HAT GIVES US GREATER FLE X ABILITY TO ADJUST RESOURCING LEVELS, AND TO COST-EFFECT IVELY INTRODUCE N EW TECHNOLOGIES.

MORRISON: I UNDERSTAND THE LEADER OF THE OPPO SITION IS UNHAPPY. HE IS STAND ING UP TO THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO SEE BULL YING AS PART OF THE WORKPLACE, PARTICULARLY AGAINST WOMEN. THE LABOUR PART Y LIKE TO TALK BIG ABOUT THESE ISSUES, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CALLING INTO ACCOUNT AND ASKING THEM TO OUTLAW THUGGISH AN D BULLYING BEHAVIOR, THIS IS THE IR REACTION.

WE STOOD UP FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND HELD PR ESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ABUSING THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE AND OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS. WE PASSED N EARLY 300 BILLS, INCLUDING T O LOWER DRUG COSTS. WE NEGOTIAT ED LOWER PRICES SO MORE AMERICANS C AN AFFORD THE MEDICINE THEY NEED. LEGISLATION TO EXTEND F MLA PROTECTIONS TO LGBTQ FA MILIES.

PE TER, WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU, O PENIN G REMARKS TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. PETER: THAN KS. I'M GOING TO OU TLINE KEY ARGUMENTS I N JUDICIAL FO RTITUDE, THAT IS THE BOOK PE ERED THE FIRST LINE IN THE BOOK IS PROBABLY THE MOST IM PORT ANT. ""WE WILL LOSE O UR DEMOCRACY UNLESS WE C AN GAIN CO NTROL OF THE AGENCIES OF THE ADMI NISTRAT IVE STATE."" THE BOOK IS ABOUT TH E CONTINUOUS DRIFT TOWAR D GOVERNMENT BY UNELECTE D OFFICIALS I N WASHINGTON, WHICH WE CA LL GENERALLY THE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE, AND HOW WE CAN STOP THIS DRIFT. THE DRIFT I S HAPPENING B ECAUSE, SINCE THE NEW DEAL, C ONGRESS HA S BEEN GIVING THE AGENCY'S EXTRAORDINA RY POWER, THE POWER A LMOST TO M AKE LAWS T HEMSELVES. BUT CONGRESS WO N'T STOP ON ITS OWN DOING THIS, BECAUSE IT IS EASIER FOR THEM. T HEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS LEGISLATION REQUIRES. ALL THEY HA VE TO DO IS PASS TO THE AGEN CY THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, AND THEN THEY ARE HOME FR EE A ND NOT SUBJECT ANY ELECTIO NS T O HAVE TO JUSTIFY DECISIONS THAT ARE MA DE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE COMES UP TO A CONGRE SSMAN AND ASKS WHY HI S FARM PO ND, THE PONTE U SES TO FEED HIS AN IMALS , IS GETTING REG ULATED BY THE EPA, THE CO NGRESSMAN SAYS, I DID N'T VOTE FOR THAT, THAT IS THIS OUT-OF -CONTROL AGENCY. BUT IN FACT , THE CONGRES SMAN DID VOTE FO R THAT BY GIVING THAT POWER TO REGULATE FARM PONDS TO THE AGEN CY. SO IT IS A WAY CONGR ESS CAN BE UNACCOUNTAB LE, BUT ALSO AV OID A LOT OF THE THINGS WE WANT CONGRESS TO BE INVOL VED IN , MAKING THE MAJOR DECISIONS FOR ALL THE LEGISLATION THEY PASS. MORE IMPORT ANT, WHEN CONGRESS DELEGATES B ROAD, LAWMAKING POWER TO ADMINIST RATIVE AGENCIES, I T IS VIOLATING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTIT UTION VESTS ALL POWER T O MAKE LAWS I N CONGRESS . ARTICLE ONE OF THE CONS TITUTION SAYS CONGRE SS SHALL HAVE ALL POWER TO MA KE LAWS. ARTICLE II GIVES PO WER TO ENFORCE THE LAWS TO THE EXEC UTIVE BRANCH. AN ARTICLE III , AND ARTICLE III GIVES P OWER TO INTERPRE T THE LAWS TO THE JUDI CIA RY. THE FRAMERS THOUGHT LIB ERTY WOULD BE EN DANGERED IF THE SAME PERSON OR G ROUP HAD T HE OPP ORTUNITY BOTH TO MAKE THE LAW AND TO ENFO RCE THE LAW. THEY L OOKED AROUND THE WORLD IN THE LATE 1700S WHEN THEY WERE D EVELOPING THE CONSTITUTIO N, AND THEY SA W WH ERE A KING COUL D MAKE THE LAW AND ENFORCE THE LAW, TIERNE Y WAS THE RES ULT. FROM THEIR PERSP ECTIVE , THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN TH E CONSTITUTIO N WAS THE STRUCTURE, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. AND THEY WA NTED TO MAINTAIN THAT AS OFTEN AND A S LONG AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS EXA CTLY THE PROBLEM WE ARE HAVING TODAY, BECA USE THE POWERS ARE NO LONGER SEPA RATED I F THE CONGRESS IS GIVING, DELEGATING ITS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE LAW S TO THE EXECUTI VE BRANCH, PARTICULARLY TO THESE AG ENCIES MA DE UP OF UNELECTED OFFICIALS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS, HO W DO WE S TOP THIS CONSTANT DE LEGATION OF POWER TO UN ELECTED OFFICIALS W HO BASICALLY A LL LIVE AROUND WASHINGTON DC, REFLECT THE PRIORITIES OF THE PEOP LE AROUND WASHINGTON DC, AND NOT THE AMERICAN PE OPLE, WHO WOULD BE OR DINARILY REPRESENTED BY THEIR CONGRESS PEOPLE. AND THOSE V OTES BY CO NGRESS PEOPLE WOULD BE TH E VOTES O F THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT WHEN TH EY H ANDED OVER TO EXECUTIVE AGENCIES, T HEY ARE GIVING UP T HE RIGHTS OF T HE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO MAKE THE SE DECISIONS. THE SEPARAT IONS OF POWER , THE SEPARATION OF POWERS W AS SO IMPORTANT T O FRAMERS THAT THEY SET UP THE JUDICIARY TO PROTECT IT. AND THIS WE KNOW FROM A FEDERALIST PAPER, 70 E IGHT, BY ALEXANDER HAMILTON, W HO CALLED THE JUDICIA RY THE GUARDIANS OF THE CONS TITUTION. HE SAID JUD GES WERE GIVEN LIFETIME APPOINTMENT S SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE FORTITUDE, THE LANGUAGE I USE IN TH E BOOK, THE F ORTITU DE T O STAND UP TO THE E LEC TED BRA NCHES, T HAT IS THE CONG RESS AND THE PRESIDENT, IF THOSE BRANC HES WERE DOING THINGS THAT CHANGE D THE WAY THE CON STITUTIO N WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WE AR E EXAC TLY IN THAT SIT UATION TODAY, BECA USE WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING IS THE SYST EM BEING CHANGED. INSTEAD OF CONGRESS MAKING THE LAWS, T HEY ARE PASSING THE LAWMAKING OVER TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS WOULD HAVE APPALL ED OU R FRAMERS, AN D THE THI NG WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW WE C AN STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. THE BOOK AR GUES THAT THE WAY TO STOP THIS I S TO RESTO RE SOMETHING C ALLED THE NONDELEGATI ON DOCTRINE. THAT SOUNDS LEGA LISTIC. IT IS ACTUA LLY VERY SIMPLE. AND WHAT IT MEANS IS TH AT THE COURTS OF THE POWE R, THEY WERE GIVEN THAT POWER BY TH E CONSTITUTIO N. THEY HAVE T HE POWER TO DECLARE WHEN AN ACT OF CONGRESS VI OLATES TH E CONSTITUTIO NAL STRUCTURE. THIS IS DIF FERENT F ROM VIOLAT ING THE CONSTIT UTION WITH A POLICY OF S OME KIND. THE COURTS SHOULD OFTE N STAY OUT OF THAT SITUATION, BUT WHEN YOU WERE TALKIN G ABOUT CHANG ING THE CONSTITUTIO NAL STRUCTURE, THE WHOLE SEPARATION OF POWERS S TRU CTURE, AS WE HAVE TODAY, THEIR CONGR ESS, T HE COURTS, THE SUPREME COURT IN PARTICUL AR, SHOULD STEP IN AND DECLARE A LAW THAT DELEGATES POWER TO THE EXECUTI VE BRANCH TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT IS POS SIBLE NOW IN A PRACTICAL W AY, BECAUS E WE HAVE HAD TWO NEW JUSTICES AP POINTED TO THE SUPR EME COU RT, JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE CAV ANAUGH , KAVANAUGH. THEY JOIN T HREE OTHER JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COU RT WHO ALL CONSIDER TH EMSELVES CONSTITUTIONALISTS. WHAT THAT M EANS IS TH AT THEY B ELIEVE THE CONSTIT UTION, THE STRUCTU RE AT LEAST OF THE CONSTITUTIO N, SHOULD BE PRESERVED AT ALL COST S. SO I THINK AS WE APPROACH THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, W HEN CASES WILL START COME TO THE COURT WHERE THE I SSUE OF NO NDELEGATION CAN BE CONSIDER ED BY THE JUST ICES, W E HAVE A G OOD SHOT HERE THAT T HE NO NDELEGATION DOCTRINE WILL BE RES TORED. WHAT DOES T HAT D O? IT FORCES C ONGRESS, I F A LAW IS DECLARED IN VALID BEC AUSE IT IS DELEGATING AUTHORITY T O THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IT FORCES CONGRESS TO GO BACK AND RECONSIDER THAT LAW, A ND MA KE TH E BIG DEC ISIONS IN THAT LAW ITSELF. THAT IS WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABO UT. SAAGAR: ILY A, OPENI NG REMARKS AND THEN WE WILL GET TO QUESTIONS. ILYA: I WAN T TO TAL K ABOUT TWO CASES FROM THIS PAST TERM OF THE SUPREME COU RT THAT SHOW BOTH SIDES OF TH E SAME COIN, AND T HE PUS HBACK AGAINST THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. I WANT TO THANK THE S TEAMBOAT INSTITUTE, JENNIFER SC HUBERT- A KIN AND TH E STA FF HERE. THIS IS A GREAT ORG ANIZATIO N AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU FRESHLY OFF THE SKI SLOPE I N MY SWEAT Y SKI TOGS. W E WE RE BOT H ON THE PROGRAM AT THE PROGRAM OF THE ROCKIES , PETER AND I, EARLIER THI S YEAR, DELIG HTED TO DO THAT. THE TWO CASES I WANT TO MENTION OUR GUNBY A ND K AISER. GUNBY AT KA ISER IS A NON-DELEGAT ION CASE, ONLY EIGHT JUSTICES PA RTICIPATING, BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST WEEK OF THE TERM WHEN B RETT KAVANAUGH W AS STILL ANSWE RING Q UESTIONS TO THE SENATE, AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS A LO SS, 5-3, THE COURT REJECTED A CHALLENGE T O A STATUT E, A FEDERAL SEX OFFENDE R REGISTRY STATUTE, AN D REJECTED THE IDEA TH AT IT GAV E TOO MUCH POWER TO TH E ATTORNEY GENERAL TO WRITE THE REGULAT IONS. BUT JUSTICE GORSUCH WROTE A BLISTERIN G DISSENT, JOINED IN F ULL BY JOHN ROBERT S, SO ME PEOPLE ESSA Y IS HE GOING WOBBL Y ARCHERY ANGLE EATIN G, JOINED INFO , OR , GOING WOBBL Y OR T RIANGULATI NG, JOINED BY T HOMAS, ALITO DIDN' T AGRE E WITH THE RE ASONING OF THE LIBE RAL JUSTICES, A ND SAID WH EN THERE IS A MAJORITY WILLING TO RECONSID ER NOT DELEGATION, HE MIGHT GO IN ON TH AT. PRESUMABLY THAT MEANS IN THE NEXT CASE, WHEN KAVANA UGH I S PARTICIP ATING, ALITO MIGHT GO TH ERE AND WE MIGHT HA VE FIVE VOTES TO FORCE CONGRESS TO HOLD CON GRESS' F EET TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL FIRE AND TE LL THEM YOU CAN'T PASS THE TR UTH A ND BEAUTY ACTI VE 2019 AND LE T THE BUREAUCRACY FAILING WHA TEVER IT WANTS TO DO . THE FLIPSIDE IS THE KAISER CASE AND HOW MUCH DEFERENCE JUDGES GIVE ADMINI STRATIVE AGENCIES. ON ONE SIDE IS CON GRESS GIVING BROAD DISCR ETION TO AGENCIES. ON THE OTHE R SIDE IS JUDGES N OT HOLDING AGENCIES' FEET TO THE FIRE. DOCTRINES H AVE DEVELO PED OF JUDICIAL DE FERENCE TO AGENCIES , THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE, W HERE AGENCIES IN TERPRET THE STATUTES TH AT GIVE THEM POWER. WHAT WAS AT ISSUE THIS YEAR, THE A UER DOCTRI NE, A GENCIES REINTERPRET ING THEIR PAST REGULATIONS. THE COURT B Y A 5-4 VOTE DID NO T THROW OUT THE AUE R DO CTRI NE, BUT THE MAJ ORITY, THE LIBERAL S PLUS JOHN ROBERTS, TR IED TO TIGHTEN THE STANDAR DS, SAID WE WIL L ONLY DEFER TO AGENCIES IN THIS CON TEXT WHEN THEY S HOW EXPERTISE, WHEN THEY A RE ACTING AS E CONOMISTS OR SCIENTISTS, NOT SIMPLY AS L AWYERS, AGENCY LAWY ERS, WH EN THE ISSUE I S TR ULY TH AT THE REGULAT ION IS AMBIGUOUS A ND THEY COULD REINTERPRET IT. OTHER R EGUL ATIONS ARE TIGHTENING THAT SCRUTI NY LAND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPEN S IN LOWER COURTS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. GORSUCH, BL ISTERING, THIS TIME CONCURRENT BECAUSE THE Y THROUGHOUT THE LOWER C OURT DECIS ION, A DISSENT IN ALL BUT NAM E, SAYIN G WE SHOULD THRO W OUT THIS DOCTRINE ALTOGETHER. WE WILL SEE WHAT HA PPENS. THERE IS AN APPETITE ON THE COURT FOR R EINING IN AGENCIES IN TERMS OF JUDGES PUSH ING BACK ON THEM AND FO RCING CONGRESS TO BE MORE SPECIF IC AN D NARROWER IN TERMS OF AU THORITY AGENCIES ARE GIVEN. SAAG AR: THE DEBATE AROUND THE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE IS A DEBATE AR OUND POWER AND THE ROL E OF GOV ERNMENT, AND HOW CON SERVATIVES SHOULD APPROACH IT . A CURR ENT D EBATE IS ROILING CON SERVATISM. IT'S AS IF CORPORATION S AND THE MEDIA ARE A GAINST US, THAT TH EY ARE TRYING TO FORCE TH EIR WAY OF LIFE ON THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NO FORCE MORE POWERFUL THAN THEM B UT THE U.S. GOVERN MENT, AND DEFECT OVER THE AD MINISTRATIVE STATE TO ST EP IN ON BEHALF OF T HE CITIZENS AND UPHOLD THEIR WAY OF LIFE. I WANT TO G ET YOUR RESPON SE ON WHY THAT MAY BE THE WRONG T ACTIC? PETER: THE REAL DANGER IS T HE AMERICA N PEOPLE, IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS DRIFT OF POWER TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, T HE AMERICA N PEOPLE WILL DECIDE THE GOVERNM ENT IS NOT REPR ESENTING THEM. THAT IS WHA T THIS G ROUP IS SAYING. IF THAT HAP PENS, IT THREATEN S THE LEGITIMACY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. AND IT ALSO THREATENS THE WILLINGNESS OF PEOPLE TO O BEY THE LAWS. T HE AMERICA N PEOPLE ARE VERY LAW OBSERVING, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL OBEY THE LAWS, A ND THEY DO THAT BEC AUSE THEY BELIEVE THE 80Y HAV E MA DE , THEY BELIEVE THE Y HAVE M ADE THE LAWS THROUG H THE REPRESENTAT IVES. BUT IF THEY COME TO BEL IEVE THE LAWS ARE BEING M ADE BY THI S FACELESS GR OUP OF BUREAUCRATS AROUND WASH INGTON DC, THAT TH ERE IS MUCH LESS R EASON TO OBEY THE LAW, AND IT LOOKS AS TH OUGH I T I S A CASE FOR THEM NOT OBEYING THE LAW BEC AUSE IT IS AN ILLEGITIMATE LAW. THE GO VERNM ENT IS NOT LEGI TIMATELY BEHAVING. W E HAVE SEE N THIS H APPEN IN BREXIT IN E UROPE, BEC AUSE WHA T THE PEOPLE DATE IN THA T CASE WAS TO VOTE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU BECA USE THE REGULAT IONS OUT OF BRUS SELS, O UT OF THE EU G OVE RNMENT IN BRUSSELS, W ERE NOT THINGS THEY COULD CONTROL IN ANY WAY. THEY DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD A VOICE IN TH AT. WE SEE THE SAME DANGERS IN THE U.S., AND T HAT IS WHY IT IS IMPOR TANT FOR US TO STOP THI S DRIFT TOWAR D THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, A ND FORCE MORE OF THE DECISIONS TO BE MADE IN CONGRESS. ILYA: THERE ARE S EPARATE ISSUES HERE. ONE I S THE PROCEDU RAL ONE, HOW A LOT OF REGU LATE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWO RKS OR OTHER DRIVERS OF CULTURE, YO U COULD D RAW UP A LAW BY TAKING I NTO ACCOUNT FIRST AMEND MENT CONCERNS, I NTERSTATE COMMERCE, C ONSTITUTIONAL BELLS AND W HISTLES, A ND AVOID N ONDELEGATI ON PROBLEMS, N ARROWLY DRAWN AND ALL THIS SORT O F THING. DOESN'T MEAN IT WOULD ST ILL BE A GOOD LAW. I'M WARY WH EN M ARK ZUCKER BERG COMES TO CONGRESS AND SAYS, P LEASE REGULATE ME , THAT WE GIVE HIM THAT. THESE BIG C OMPANI ES H AVE ACCOUN TANTS AND LAWYERS IN COMPLIANCE OFFICIALS THAT DEAL WITH WHATEV ER CONGRESS GIVES THEM. I WOULD RAT HE R NOT GIVE TH E FC C, CONGRESS IT SELF, SOME OTHER AGENCY, THE POWER TO TELL US WHAT IS A P ROPER AMOUNT OF EVENHANDED WHAT HAVE YOU. T HE REAL IS SUE, THE FONT OF A L OT OF PUBLIC FRUS TRATION WITH BIG EVERYTH ING, GOVERNMENT, MEDIA, I.T., CORPO RATIONS OR ANYTHING, A S THE SERIOUS IMBALANCE O F POWER TH AT HAS CO ME ABOUT VERTI CALLY AND HORIZONTALL Y, MEANING SO MUCH POW ER HAS S WEPT INTO WASHIN GTON FROM STATES AND LOCALITIES AND WE ARE THEN WATCHING IT BE SWEPT TO THE EXEC UTIVE B RANCH, TO THE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE. THIS WAS TH E FOCUS OF BEN SASS E'S COMMENTS THAT THEY , COM MENTS AT THE KAVANAU GH H EARING, WH ERE HE SAID CON GRESS DOESN'T RES OLVE ANYTHING AN YMORE, CONGRESS IS THE PLACE WHERE , WH ERE WE ARE SUPP OSED TO HASH OUT PO LICY VIEWS OR WH AT HAVE YOU, A ND EVERYTHING IS BEING SW EPT TO WASHINGTON AND THEN CONGRESS ISN'T RESOL VING IT AND PUSHING IT TO THE A DMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES ENDED ULTIMATELY GETS PUT IN TO THE COURTS BECA USE YOU CAN ONL Y SUE THEM AND TH AT IS WHY THERE A RE PROTEST S IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT INSTE AD OF CONGRESS . I'M SKEPTIC AL OF NEW REGU LATORY TRENDS, BUT THAT IS SEPARATE TO WHETHER YOU CAN DRA W THOSE KINDS OF LAWS IN A W AY THAT IS PROPER IN T ERMS OF RE GARD FOR THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. SAAGAR: SO MUCH OF THIS DEBATE ARGUMENT, W E TALKED ABOUT NONDELEGATION IN THE SUPR EME COURT, AND IT SEEMS THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE IS AL MOST CERTAINLY A FUNCTION OF THE JUDICIARY. FROM THIS P ERSPE CTIVE, IT MATTERS QUI TE A BIT WHO IS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. HOW DO YOU THINK THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION HAS FARED I N RAINING IN THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE? PETER: AFTE R NOW, RAINING IN THE ADMINIS TRAT IVE STATE IS DI FFICULT, BECAUSE WE JUST GOT FI VE, A MAJORITY OF JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COU RT WHO WOULD BE INCLINED TO REIN IN THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. LET'S BE CL EAR, THE LEFT WILL NOT WA NT TO SEE ANY CHANGE. THE Y LIKE W HAT T HE AD MINISTRAT IVE STATE DOES. EVEN SOME PEOPLE NOT ON THE LEFT LIKE WHAT T HE ADMINIS TRATIVE STATE DOES. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE O UR CONSTITUTIO N REQUIRES THAT MOST OF THE SE MAJOR DECISIONS B E MADE BY CONGRESS , A ND TO THE EXTE NT THEY ARE MADE BY AGE NCIES, THAT IS NO LONGER O F A DEMOCR ATIC REPUBLIC WE THOUGHT WE HAD. THA T IS MAD E UP OF PEOPL E WHO ARE APPOINT ED TO BE EXPER TS AND DON'T P AY A NY ATT ENTION TO AND HAVE ANY DESIRE TO PAY ATTE NTION TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THIN K. AS FAR AS I AM CON CERNED, THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GO VERNM ENT OF THE UNITED STATES REMA INS, AN D THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, A LEGITIMAT E GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE THE Y ARE ELECTIN G REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE MAK ING THE LAWS FOR THEM, AND T O THE EXTENT THAT THAT I S NOT THE WAY THINGS ARE WORKING , WE ARE GOIN G TO BE IN TROUBLE OVE R TIME. I WOULD ADD ONE OTHER THING ABOUT WHAT ILYA S AID A ND THAT IS, THERE I S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHEVRON CASE AND THE AUER CASE. IN THE AUER DE CISI ON, T HE DECISION BY THE SUPR EME COURT, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, DID GO ALON G WITH THE ID EA TH AT THE COURTS SHOU LD DIFF ER TO ADMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES, B UT THE LIBERALS ON THE COURT, TO G ET THE VOTE THEY NEEDED , PUT SO MANY RES TRICTIONS ON HOW THE AUER DOCTRI NE COULD BE IM POSED, IF IT IS DE FERENCE A T ALL, A COURT WOU LD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF D ETAIL T O B E ABLE TO SAY IT WILL GIVE DEFERENCE T O AN AGENC Y. THE CHEVRON CASE, ON TH E OTHER HAND, WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTI CE SEPARATED F ROM THIS WHOLE AUER QUESTI ON, D EFERENCE TO ADMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES' REGULATION, HE SAID, HOWEVER I AM VOTING ON THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHI NG TO DO WITH MY VOTE ON CHE VRON. AN D CHEVRON IS A CASE THAT IS REALLY T ROU BLING, BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY GIVES THE POWER TO AG ENCIES . I T TELLS LO WER COURTS THAT THEY S HOULD DEFE R TO TH E DECISIONS AGENCIES MA KE ABOUT THE POWERS THEY HAVE B EEN GIVEN BY CONGRESS . THAT MEANS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT, IF YOU ARE TRY ING TO OVERTURN A REGULATION BY AN AGENCY, BEC AUSE THE JUDGE W HO YOU ARE ARGUING BEF ORE HAS BEEN TO LD BY THE SUPREME COURT HE SHOULD D EFER TO THE AGEN CY' S OPINION ABO UT ITS OWN POWERS. THA T HAS HA PPENED AN D IT HAS STRE NGT HENED THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE TREME NDOUSL Y. THAT IS SEPARATED FROM THE AU ER CASE, AND T HOUGH IT L OOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE LOST THE AU ER CASE I N THE SENSE THAT DEFERENCE HAS DOMAIN , T HAT DEFERE NCE HAS REMAINED, I THINK WE' RE GOING TO WIN CHEVRON THE NEXT TIME THE CA SE COMES BEFORE THE COURT. >> I DON'T KNO W IF THERE WILL BE FIV E VOTES TO THROW IT OUT ALTO GETHER, BECAUSE IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A POLITICAL O R EDDY ILLOGICAL THING CHEVRON ITS ELF , I DEOLOGICAL THING. CHEVRON ITS ELF WAS A DECISION OVERTURNING THE LEFT WING BENT OF THE D.C. CIRCUI T IN THE 1980'S THAT WAS TH WARTI NG R ONALD REAGAN'S DE REGULATORY INITIATIVES . WHETHER YOU DEFER T O AN AGENC Y OR NOT MIGHT B E A CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL WIN , DEPEND ING ON THE DECI SION THE AGENCY IS MAKING. THERE WAS AN ODD MOMENT DURI NG THE GORSUCH CONFIRMATIO N HEARINGS WHEN SENATO RS WE RE CRITICIZING GORSUCH FOR HIS OPINIONS, T HAT IN TUR N EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT CHEVR ON. TH EY WERE S AYING THAT THEY W ANTED TO GIVE RIC K PERRY AND SCOTT P RUITT AND BETSY DEVOS MORE POWER, BECA USE IF YOU HAVE STRONG CHEV RON DEF ERENCE, THAT MEANS AGENCIES HA VE MORE POWER. IT IS BIZARRE TO ARGUE, B UT THIS IS NOT SUPP OSE D TO BE A LEFT-R IGHT THING. SAAGAR: HOW DO YOU THINK THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION IS DOING SO FAR? PETER: THE INTERES TING REGULATION THAT SEEMS LIKE IT , ILYA: THE I NTERES TING REGULATION THAT SEEMS LIKE A GIMMICK BUT I THINK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS THE RULE THAT FOR EVERY NEW REGULATION PROMULGATED, TO HAVE TO BE WITHD RAWN , TWO HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN. THAT HAS AC TUALLY WORKED. WE HAVE SEE N A SLOWDOWN IN THE PAGE S ON TH E FEDERAL REGISTER. IF YOU GO T O SENATOR MIKE LEE'S OFFIC E, ON CAPITOL HIL L, HE HAS TWO STAFFS, ONE ON LEGISLAT ION , TWO STACKS, ONE OF LEGISLATION AND ONE OF REGULATIONS. THE LEGISLA TION IS SHORT AN D THE REGULAT IONS ARE SIX FEET TA LL. IT ALL THE STRAITS THAT WE ARE NOT GOVERNE D BY CONGRESS , BUT BY THIS FOURTH BRANCH. JUD ICIAL AP POINTMENT S ARE HELPING WITH THIS, NOT J UST, E VEN MORE I N THE LOWER COURTS THAN THE SU PREME COU RT, HAVI NG AN EFFECT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE D.C. CI RCUIT THAT HANDLE S SO MANY OF THE SE REGULATORY APPEALS IS STILL SK EWE D WITH OBAMA NOMINEES WHO ARE MOR E DE FERE NTIAL TO ALL SORT S OF AGENCIES. SAAGAR: I W ANT TO T HROW IT TO THE A UDIENC E. MAKE YOUR QUESTI ON ACTUALLY A QUESTION, 1 0 TO 15 SECONDS OR I WILL B E FORCED TO CUT YOUR OFF , CUT YOU OFF . WE HAVE THE MIC CIRCULA TING, PLEASE RAIS E YOUR HANDS. >> I DON'T MEA N FOR THIS TO COM E ACROSS AS TOO LAWYERL Y, C OULD YOU COMMENT ON WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT NEEDS TO BE REFOR MED , PARTICULARL Y THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE STANDARD IN TERMS OF REINING IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? ILYA : IKE - - PETER: I CA N'T GO IN TO DETAIL ABOU T THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE A CT, BUT THE CHE VRON CASE IGNORE S THE ADMINIS TRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. THAT I S THE PROBLEM WITH CHEVRON, AN D IT WAS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE COURT APPEA RED TO BECOME U NDE RSTANDI NG THAT WHAT THEY HAD DONE WAS, F OR YE ARS, LEFT OUT OF CONSIDERATI ON, AN ACT OF CONG RESS, T HE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE A CT OF 1946, TH EY IGNORED IT. SO IF THE ADMIN T O STRATA PROCEDURE A CT COMES BACK INTO EFFECT, AND TO THIN K IT SHOULD, THE EFFECT OF T HAT WOULD BE IF THE COURTS ENFORCE IT IS THAT ALL DECISIONS BY AGENCIES WOULD HAVE TO BE REVIEWED FIRST BY THE COURTS FOR THEIR A GREEMENT WITH THE IS THAT ALL DE CISIONS POWER THAT THE AGENCY HAS TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION IN THE CHEVRON CASE. THEY PUSH THAT ASIDE AND SAID THE COURTS HAVE TO DEFER, B UT THAT IS WRO NG. U NDE R THE C ONSTITUTION, THE COURTS SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST V IEW OF WHETHER CON GRESS HAS EMPOWER ED AN AGENCY TO DO SOMETHIN G. ILYA: THERE IS ENOUGH L ANG UAGE IN THE SUPR EME COU RT'S REC ENT HOLDINGS ON ENVIRONM ENTAL REGULATIONS AND OTHER T HING S, THA T A JUDG E COULD HOLD REGULA TORS' FEET TO THE FIRE, W HETH ER THROUGH SUB STANTIAL EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT S OR OTHERWISE. CONGRESS COULD STREN GTHEN THAT, BUT T HE POLITIC AL CAPITAL REQUIRED TO DO SOMETHING L IKE THAT WOULD NOT BE THAT MUC H MORE, IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME AS SOMETHIN G TO PASS THE RAINS ACT, WHICH WOULD HAVE CONGRESS APPROVE ANY MAJOR R EGULATIONS. BIG THINGS LIKE THAT ARE PROBABLY A BETTER US E OF ACTI VIST OR ACADEMIC RESOURCES T HAN TINKER ING WITH SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. S AAGAR: I S EE IN OTHER HAND, IN THE BACK . , ANOTHER HAN D, IN TH E BACK. >> WO ULD YOU P LEASE COMMENT ON THE FOLL OWING. I BELIEVE I T IS WRONG TO CALL CONGRE SS THE PROBLEM, BE CAUSE IN THE MIC LEE EXA MPLE , WE WILL GET MORE 2000 P AGE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S, BUT THE REA L PROBLEM IS THE U.S. JUDICIARY W ITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT ADMINI STRATIVE RULES ARE CORRECT. SO ANY FACT , T HE PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE. ILYA: I AGR EE THA T IT IS WRONG FOR THE COURT T O HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY S HOULD DEFE R TO TH E VIEWS OF THE AGENCIE S ABOUT THEIR POWER S. THAT VIOLAT ED TH E APA, AND IT VIOL ATES THE WAY THE FRA MERS SAW THE COURTS OPERATING IN THE CONS TITUTIONAL SYSTEM. FROM MY PER SPECT IVE , YOUR QUESTION IS JUSTIFIE D. PETER: I FI ND FAULT , ILYA: I FIN D FAUL T WITH COURTS AND A HOST OF WAYS. YOU ARE RIG HT, THE REASON CONGRESS PASSES THES E BROAD LAWS IS BECAUSE THE COURTS LET THEM. THAT IS THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL , A PROJECT A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN TRYING TO P USH, YO U WERE ALLUDI NG TO CONSTITU TIO NALITY, THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF LIBERTY AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAD TO , SHOUL D HAVE TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIONS AND REGULAT IONS RATHER THAN PRESUMING THAT THEY A RE VALID. THAT IS AN ACTIVE D EBA TE WITH IN FEDERAL SOC IETY CIR CLES AMO NG LIBERTARIANS AND CONSERV ATIVES AND LEGALLY-MINDED FOLKS, SO I THINK YOU RAISE A VALID POINT. >> I APPRECIAT E YOUR BOOK ON THE GREAT RECES SION, THE ORIGINS OF THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE FIN ANCIAL CRISIS. HOW COULD REVERSING THIS DEFERE NCE, COULD WE HA VE AVO IDED SOME OF THESE CRISES IN 2 007 DAN , 2007 AND 20 08, A ND HOW COU LD WE AVOID FUTURE FINANCIAL C RISES IF WE REVER SE THI S MOVEMENT OF DEFERENCE FROM CONGRESS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? PETER: I WR OTE A B OOK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2 008 AND BLAMED IT O N GOVERNMENT HOUSING POLICIES, AND NOT ON INEFFECT IVE OR THE LACK OF REGULATION OF THE BANK ING INDUSTRY. T HEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. THE Y PARTIC IPATED IN IT, BUT IT WAS GOVERNM ENT HOUSING POL ICIES THAT CREATE D THIS IN NORMA'S HOUSING BUB BLE THAT WE HAD THAT UL TIMATELY COLLAPSED AND CAUSED THE CRISIS. YES , IT IS POSSIBLE TH AT IF THERE WA S MORE ATTENT ION T O ADMINISTRAT IVE AGENCIES, T HE AGENCIES RE GULATING THE ECONOMY , AND THEY WE RE GIVEN LESS DEFERENCE, WHICH MEANS THEY WOULD HAVE TO JUS TIFY THINGS MUCH MORE C AREFULLY WHEN THEY MADE A REGU LATION, WE COULD HA VE PREVENTED THE CRISIS IN 2 008. BU T GOING B ACK TO LOOK AT HIS TORY AND REDO IT IS FRUITLES S. TO THE FUTURE, WE OUGHT TO BE SURE THAT W HEN AN AGE NCY IS M AKING A REGULATIO N, IT IS AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS TO DO THAT, AND I F THERE IS NO AUTHORIZATION, THEY SHOULD N'T DO IT. SAAGAR: MY FORMER C OLLEAGUE AT CATO'S FINANCIAL C ENTER NOW HEADS THE FEDERAL HOU SING FINANCE AGENCY. HOW IS HE DOING? PETER: I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. [LAUGH TER] BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRAT ION IS COOKING UP. THEY THINK THEY CAN KE EP FREDDIE MAE AND FRE DDIE MAC , FANNIE MAE AND FRE DDIE MAC IN BEING, T HES E TWO AGENCIE S UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR RE GULATOR, MARK CALABR O AT AT THE F EDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. THE Y ARE UNDER CONTROL OF THIS AGENCY, AND ALSO CO NTROL COMPLETELY, AND SUPPORT ED FINANCIALLY , BY THE FEDE RAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW. THE IDEA IS THAT THE Y CAN BE LET OUT INT O TH E PUBLIC AGAIN AND ALLOWED TO FUNCTION AS THEY DID BEFORE 2008 , WHEN THEY BECAME INSOLVENT. WE SHOULD C LOS E THEM DOWN. [APPL AUSE] AND IF YOUR FRIEND CALABRO YOU , CALABRIA, A GOOD CONSERVATIVE CONDIMENT - - CONSERVATIV E ECONOMIST, HAD HIS WAY, HE WOU LD DO THAT. BUT I'LL EAT , BUT I SEE A LOT OF STATEMEN TS FROM HIM SUGGESTING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRAT ION DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ON THE REAL ESTATE LOBB Y, AND WANTS T O ALLOW FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC , BECAUS E OF THE FINANCIAL C RISIS IN THE PAST, T O COME ALIVE AGAIN AND DOMINATE THE HOUSING MAR KET. THAT WOULD BE TOO BAD. SAAGAR: ANO THER QUESTION? I CA HAND , I SEE A HAN D. >> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEO PLE IN GOVERNMENT AND EVEN OU TSIDE GOVERNMENT THINK GOVERNMENT IS THE SOLUTIO N, WHEN GOVERN MENT IS SO SELDO M THE SOLUTION TO ANYTHING. F OR THAT REASON I TH INK YOU HAVE GOT MARK CA LABR IA TH INKING WE CAN USE THESE A GENCIES TO SOLVE ISSUES. I WONDER HO W WE CAN EFFE CT A CHANGE OF HEART AN D T AKE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF GOVE RNMENT AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE. I W ONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT? >> WE JUST NEE D A CONSTITUT IONAL AMENDMENT T O ADD AT THE END OF EVERY CLAUS E, AND WE MEAN IT. [LAUGHT ER] [APPLAUSE] >> THAT GOES T O AN INTERESTING QUESTION. HOW SHOULD CONSERVATIVES, WHEN THEY B ECOME PART OF THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE, ACT WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE? WHEN THEY ARE APPOINT ED? PETER: I WA S IN TH E REAGAN ADMINISTRAT ION. RONALD REAG AN WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE WAN TED. I WAS AT TH E TREA SURY DEPARTMENT IN THE EARLY P ARTS OF TH E ADMINISTRAT ION, AND WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT REAGAN WANTED. THA T'S AN I NTERESTING ISSUE, WHETHER REAGAN WOULD HAVE LIKED READING. HE MADE HIS POLICIES SO CLEAR WE HARDLY EVER HAD TO GO T O THE WHITE HOUSE FOR C LARIFI CATION ABOUT A DECISION, B ECAUSE REAGAN LAID OUT THE POL ICIES HE WANTED US TO FOLLOW. THAT IS NOT OFTEN THE CASE WI TH PRESIDENTS. THEY COME I NTO OFFICE WITHOUT HAV ING A CLEAR VIEW. HOWEV ER, IF A PRESIDENT LAYS OUT TH E KIND OF CONSERVATIV E OUTLOOK PRE SIDENT REAGAN HAD, THE GO VERNMENT WOULD BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT, PE OPL E IN T HE VARIOUS AGENCIES WOULD FEEL THAT THEY C AN'T MAKE ALL THESE REGUL ATIONS , AND IN FACT WOULD PROBABLY WI THDRAW SOME OF THE REGULATIONS , AS THEY ARE DOING I N THE CASE OF TRUMP RIGHT NOW. BUT I WOULD ADD I N THE CASE OF TRUMP, I N H IS FIRS T TWO YEARS, WE H AVEN'T REA LLY HAD A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF R EGULATIONS EVERY YEAR. SINCE 1993 WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO COUNT, THER E WERE MORE THAN 3000 REGULATIONS EVERY YEAR FROM T HE AGENCIES OF THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. AND THAT WA S ALSO TRUE I N TRUMP'S FIRST YEAR, 2017, AND CLOSE TO 30 00 REG ULATIONS IN 2018. I HAV EN'T S EEN 2019 YET BUT I C AN IMAGINE THERE ARE A LOT OF REGU LATIONS AND RULES COMING OUT, BECAUS E IT IS VERY HARD T O STOP THIS FLOW O NCE IT GETS STARTED. AND THE CAB INET OFFICIALS IN CHARGE O F MOST OF THI S ARE BUSY TE STIFYING AND TRAVELI NG ON MAKING SPEECHES, A ND THEY AL LOW THESE REGUL ATIONS TO GO THROU GH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD T HIS IS WHAT THE AGENCY HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR 10 YEARS, SO D ON'T STOP IT NOW. ILYA: THIS TIES B ACK T O THE QUES TION ABOUT THE JUDICIARY. IT DIDN'T H APP EN OVERNIGHT. I TRACE IT BACK TO CODIFICATIO N OF PROGRESS IVE POLICY VIEWS ON TH E ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN 19 37, SO IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME T O WIND THAT B ACK. THAT IS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. SAAGAR: WE HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES AND I WILL GIVE YOU BOTH A CHANCE FOR CLOSING REM ARKS AND WHERE EVERY BODY'S FOCUS SHOULD BE IN THE C OMING YEARS ON THE ADMINISTRAT IVE STATE. PETER: CONS ERVATIVES CANNOT LOSE BY FORCING MORE OF THE LAWM AKI NG POLICY INTO CONGRE SS. NOT ONLY DO ES THAT M EAN THAT MORE ATTENT ION WILL BE PAID TO MAJOR QUESTIONS, WHICH MEANS WE CAN ALL GET DEVOLVE D , ALL GET INV OLVED IN DECISION S THAT ARE MADE, THEY WILL BE DEBATED ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS , M EMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEC ISIONS THAT THEY MAKE, AND I F IT IS TOO DIFF ICULT FOR THEM TO ADOPT TH E LAW, GO OD. WE WANT FEW ER LAWS, AS WE LL AS FEWER RE GULATIONS. THE LEFT IS GOI NG TO SEE THIN GS DIFFERENTLY , BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IS MA DE UP OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT . AND WHEN WE HAVE SEE N THE FE W COMMENTS THEY HAVE MADE A BOUT THE N EW CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT, THEY HAVE B EEN, WELL, THE REAL DANGER HERE IS THAT THE Y W ILL STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM TEXTING US AGAINST THE ABUSES OF INDUSTRY GE T , GOVE RNMENT FROM PROTECTING US AGAINST THE ABUSES OF INDUSTRY . THAT IS THE ATTITUDE THE LEFT IS GOING TO HAVE ABOUT THESE CHANGES. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE T HAT THE FEWER L AWS THAT ARE MADE IN THE FEWE R REGULATIONS THAT ARE MADE, T HE BETTER OFF THIS COUNTRY WILL BE. [A PPLAUSE] ILYA: A LOT OF THESE ISSUES COME UP IN HIGH- PRO FIL E CASES THAT ARE SW AMPED WITH POLICY DEBATES. FOR EXAMPLE , TH E ISSUE OF TW O BROAD , O F TOO BROA D P OLICY COMES UP IN BORDE R P OLI CY, THE RE ARE SO MUDD Y STATUES THA T ARE SO BROAD THAT MAYBE THE P RESIDENT, TRUMP OR OBAMA, IS A CTING WITHIN THE LAW, BUT THE PRO BLEM IS THE LAW. WHEN WE WER E AT THE LEAD ERS HIP PROGRAM IN COLORADO SPRINGS, TH AT WAS ONE TRUMP G AVE HIS PR ESS CONFERENCE ON THE EMERGENCY WALL DECLAR ATION . I WAS WATCH IN G IN MY HOTEL RO OM AND I PUT OUT A STATEMENT WHILE WATCHING AN D THE UPSHOT WAS, POSSIB LY OR PROBABLY LE GAL BUT UNCONSTITUT IONAL, ACUTE WAY OF SAYI NG YOU CAN'T HAVE A LAW THAT IS LEGAL AN D YET UNCONSTITUT IONAL. I MEANT THE R ELEVANT STATUTES ABOUT MOVIN G MONEY AROUND ARE SO BROAD THAT IT COU LD BE THAT SMA RT WHITE HOUSE LAWYE RS FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS. BUT IF THAT IS THE CASE , T HAN THIS LAW IS IMPROPER, I T IS CONGR ESS GIVING AWAY APPROPRIATIONS POWER. OR T HE DHAKA - - OR THE DACA CA SE T HAT IS GOI NG TO BE ARGUED. IF PRESIDEN T OBAMA HAD T HE POWER T O PROVIDE TEMPORARY S TATUS AND WORK AUTHORIZATION TO PEOPLE B ROUGHT HERE ILLEGALLY AS CHILDREN , W HICH I SUP PORT, BU T IF HE H AS THAT POWER ALREA DY, THAN THE IMMIGRA TION LAW IS TOO BROAD. CATO IS FIL ING A BR IEF DUE ON MONDAY ON BEHALF OF D ACA-TYP E P OLICIES AS A MATTER OF POLICY BUT NOT AS A MATTER OF L AW BECAUSE EXE CUTIVE POWER IS NOT SO BROAD. T HESE ISSUE S CROP UP, SOMETIMES IT IS VERY TEC HNI CAL, AND IF THE SUPR EME COURT STARTS MAKING WAVE S, IT WILL BE ON TECHN ICAL T HINGS LIKE KAISER WITH VETERA NS BENEFITS RA THER THAN THESE CULTURE WERE THINGS.

[LAUG HTER] I WAS LOOKI NG THROUGH SOM E WASHIN GTON POST HEADLINES A ND MY FAVORITE ONE RECENTL Y WAS FROM LAST WEEK. THIS IS THE HEADLINE. THIS IS TRU E. TH IS IS NOT FAKE NEWS. THIS IS AN ACTUAL HEADLINE IN THE WASH INGTON POST LAST W EEK, IT SAID, CAN REPUBLICANS RELEARN HOW TO ACCEPT POLITICAL O UTCOMES TH EY DON'T LIKE? [LAUG HTER] THAT'S WHAT THE WA SHINGTON POST WAS WO NDERING LAST WEEK.

BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, THAT ONE MADE ME LAUGH. I WANT TO START WI TH A COUPLE OF L INES ABOUT THE PRESS. LET ME READ THIS TO YOU. THE AM ERICAN PRESS IS, TO A FEARFU L E XTENT, IN THE HANDS OF A COWARDLY PRINCIPLED CLASS OF ME N, WHO HAVE NO REGARD FOR TRUTH I N DEALING WITH WHAT IS UNP OPULAR, WHO CATER TO THE LOW WITH THE PASSIONS OF THE MULT ITUDE AND CARICATURE EVERY MOVEM ENT, AIMING AT THE OVER THROW OF ESTABLISHED WRONG, WHO ARE AS DESTITUTE OF FAIRNESS AND CONTROVERSY AS THEY ARE LACKING IN SELF-RESPECT, AND COLUMNS ARE CLOSE AGAINST ANY REPLIES THA T MAY BE PROFFERE D TO THEIR LIBELOUS AC CUSATIONS. THAT SOUND FAMILIAR? S OMEONE SAID THOMAS JEFFERSON IN FRONT. IT'S NOT THOMAS JEFF ERSON. IT'S WILLIAM BOY D GARRISON IN 1858. 1858. SO, W E'VE BEEN COMPLA INING ABOUT THE PRESS FOR A LONG TIME. THERE 'S ALMOST NOTH ING MORE AMERICAN THAN COMPLA INING ABOUT THE PRESS. AND SO, FOR THE NEX T THREE HOURS , [LAUGHTER] DON'T WORRY , I LIKE SAYI NG THAT AND SEEING THE LOOKS OF HORROR. TONIGHT, I WILL TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF JOURNALI SM WITH AN I TOWARD S EXP LAINING THE MOMENT WE F IND OUR SELVES IN RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO PUS H BACK AGAINST THIS INCREASINGL Y POPULAR FAIRYTALE T HAT THE PR ESS USED TO BE A LOT BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY, IN THE SENSE T HAT THINGS WERE SO MUCH BETTER A GE NERATION AGO. WASN'T IT W ONDERFUL WHEN WE HAD A COMPLETEL Y OBJECTIVE PRESS THAT ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH? RIGH T? I'M HEARING THAT MORE A ND MORE. I'M HEARING IT ESPECIAL LY FROM LIBERA LS IN THE MEDIA, WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE MERE EXISTENCE O F FOX NEWS. I'M A LSO HE ARING IT FROM MY OWN STUDENTS, W HO BOUGHT INTO THIS IDEA, THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS WRECKED EVERYTHING IN JOURNALISM AND MADE IT WORSE THAN BEFORE. I WANT TO P USH BACK AGAINST THAT. I THI NK THE TRUTH IS OR COMPLICATED . ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO S TAY ABOUT THE STATE OF JOURNALISM TODAY. IT'S NEVER BEEN WORSE AND ALSO NEVER BEEN BETTER. I'L L EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE, AS WELL. AL SO, RAISE WHAT I THINK ARE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR US TODAY, BOTH AS CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERTA RIANS, BUT REALLY EVER YBODY WHO IS AN AMERICAN WHO WANTS T O FOLLOW THE NEWS. SO, A QUESTION I LIKE TO ASK MY STUD ENTS , OFTEN AT THE START OF A SEMEST ER, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE NEWSPAPER? WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE NEWS PAPER? AND THEY'LL RAISE THEIR HANDS AND S TART T O GIVE ERNEST REPL IES , EARNEST REP LIES ABOUT INFOR MING THE CITIZENS AND PRESENT ING FACTS TO BE PUBLIC A ND SO FORTH. AND THESE ARE ALL GOOD ANSWERS AND THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN THEM. WH AT I ALWAYS SAY, THE PURPOSE OF A NEWSPAPER IS TO MAKE MONEY. IT'S A BUSINESS. I T'S A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE. WE NEVER CAN LOSE SIGHT OF TH AT FACT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE - - THERE ARE S OME STRENGTHS, BUT ALSO WE AKNESS AND VULNERABILI TY THAT COMES WITH THAT W HEN YOU'RE IN THE PRESS. WE C AN'T EVER FORGET IT. ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES TO THE FACT THIS I S A BUSINESS, YOU'RE ALWA YS CHASING AFTER READERS AND TRYING TO GET MORE OF THEM. TO DAY , WE HEAR ABOUT CLICK BAIT. ON TH E INTERNE T, RIGHT? CLICK BAIT IS SIMPLY TO GET ANOTHER , CLICK THE LINK BECAUS E IT'S A PROVOCATIVE HEADLINE OR PICTURE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THE WEBSITE WILL GET ANOTHER NICKEL FOR SOMEONE HAVING DONE THAT. NOT E VEN THAT, A FRACTION OF A NICKEL EVEN. CLICK BAIT. THAT' S ALL ABOUT MAKIN G MONEY. BUT JOURNALISM'S ALWAYS HAD A , HAD TH IS IN CENT IVE, WITH SENSAT IONALISM, A WORD WE G OT ATTACHED TO THIS IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS . OR YELLOW JOUR NALISM. ALL ABOUT SELLI NG COPIES OF NEWSPAPERS BY TELLING FIBS, BY RE PORTING FAKE NEWS, ETC. IT'S A LWAYS BEEN THERE. SO T HE PURPOSE OF THE NEWSPAPER IS TO MAKE MONEY. WE C AN'T LO SE SIGHT OF THAT AND THE INCENTI VE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND I T'S LE D TO ABUSES OF GOOD JOURNA LISM THROUGHOUT HISTORY. I WANT TO GO BACK IN TIME A L ITTLE BI T AND GO TO THE FOUNDING ER A OF OUR COUNTRY AND TALK ABOUT WHAT JOURNALISM WAS LIKE A LITT LE BIT THEN. I WIL L MENT ION THREE EXTRAORDINARY JOURNALISTS AND ONE INTERESTING, COLORFUL JO URNALIST FROM THAT TIME. ONE O F THE GREAT FOUNDING FATHERS OF JOURNALISM IN CERTAIN WAYS IN OUR COUNTRY IS BEN FRANKLIN. I NSTEAD OF GEORGE WASHINGTON , WASHINGTON IS FIRST IN WAR, FIRST IN PEACE COME OUT FIRST IN THE HEAR T OF HIS COUNTRYMEN. BEN FRANKLI N IS FIRST IN EVERYTHI NG ELSE. WHEN WE THINK AB OUT WHAT MAKES BEN FRANKLIN GREAT, WHAT COMES TO MIND? DIPLO MAT. SCIENTIST. INVENTOR. P OLITICIAN. I MEAN, ALL KINDS OF THINGS H E WAS REAL LY GREAT AT. THE FIR ST THING HE WAS, THOUGH, WAS A JOURNALIST. HE WAS A PRINTER, MA KING MONEY PRINT ING NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODI CALS. THIS WAS HIS BUSINESS. H E WAS AN AMUSING WRITER. HE PUBLISHED ONE OF THE GREA T PERIODICALS IN OUR AMERICAN HI STORY, POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC. AN D THESE THINGS MADE HIM WE ALTHY, THEN ENABLED HIM TO GO O N AND DO THE OTHER THINGS FOR WHICH W E REMEMBER HIM. BEN FR ANKLIN STARTED AS A GREAT JOURN ALIST, SOMEONE WHO WAS A MODEL , HAS ANYBODY REA D , HAVE YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE STEVE HAYES , ""THE DISPATCH"" T HEY'RE CALLING IT? THEY GO T THE NAME FROM THE WRITINGS OF BEN FRANKLIN. HE'S THE INSPIRATION FOR THEIR NEW MEDIA ENTERPRISE. ANOTHER GREAT JOURN ALIST FROM THAT ERA IS THOMAS P AYNE. WHO WROTE COMMON SENSE. THE DOCUMENT THAT, MORE THAN ANY OT HER, CONVINCED OF THE COLONIS TS TO DECLARE INDEPENDENCE AGAINST THE THRONE IN E NGLAND. AN D HE WROTE COMMO N SENSE AS A PAMPHLET. I T'S BASICALLY A N ESSAY THAT WAS PUBLISHED ON ITS OWN. AND THE PAM PHLET WAS A GREAT FORM OF JOURNALISM BACK THEN. WE LO ST IT. WE DON' T REALLY HAVE PAMPHLETS ANYMORE. IN THAT ERA, THEY W ERE PUBLISHING THEIR IDEAS IN PA MPHLETS. IT WAS A FANTASTIC M EDIUM FOR DEBATING IDEAS. AND THOMAS PAYNE WAS A GREAT PRACT ITIONER OF IT AND W ROTE THE MOST IN FLUENTIAL ONE IN AMERICAN HI STORY, THAT SPURRE D US ON TO THE FOURTH OF JULY. A THI RD GREAT JOURN ALIST FROM THAT ERA IS ALEXANDE R HAMILTON. FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK POST. YOU K NOW, T HE BEST NEWSPA PER IN NEW YORK, R IGHT? SO HE FOUND ED THE NEW YOR K POST, WHICH IS STILL WI TH US. ALSO, T HE AUTHOR OF THE FEDERAL IST PAPERS, ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE FEDE RALIST PAPERS. AND WHEN WE ENCOUNTE R THE FEDERALIST PAPERS TODAY, WHEN WE HAVE TO READ THEM IN SCHOOL, THEY COME T O US AS A BOOK. THEY WERE R EALLY NEWSPAPER O P-EDS. EVE RY MEMBE R OF THE FEDERALIST WAS A NEWSP APER OP-ED. IF ALEXANDE R H AMILTON AND JOHN JAY WE RE WRITING THE FEDERALIST PAPERS TODAY, THEY WOULD BE OP -ED IN THE JOURNAL. THAT'S HOW THEY WERE BACK THEN AND WE FORGET THAT. THEY WERE E SSENT IAL T O THE RATIFICATION OF BECAUSE THE TUITION AND REREAD THEM AND WO RKS NOW. BUT TH EY WERE JOURNALISM. WITHIN THOS E THREE GREAT EXAMPLES, W E HAVE BEN FRANKLIN THE PRINTER , A GREAT ENTERTAINER AND GREAT B USINESSMAN, MAYBE THE FIRST M EDIA MOGUL IN AMERICAN JO URNALISM. WITH THOMAS PAYNE, WE HAVE THE GREAT P OLEM ICIST, THE FIRST G REAT POLEMICIST, ALEXANDER H AMILTON, T HE GREAT PERSUADER I N OPINION JOURNALISM. YOU MIGHT S AY, IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AN D I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A GU Y NAMED J AMES CALENDAR, THE FIRST G REAT POLITICAL H ACK , HACK WRITER , HACK JOURNALIST IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND CALENDA R HAS THIS WO NDERFUL, COLORFUL, A PPALLING STORY, WHIC H IS HE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM SCOTLAND. ALEXANDER H AMILTON WAS HIMSELF AN IMMIGRANT YOU KNOW. CALENDAR IM MEDIATELY AND HEARD I NTO THE NEWS BUSINE SS , ENTERED IN THE NEWS BUSINE SS. THEY WERE C LOSELY ALI GNED WITH POLITICAL P ARTIES. THE PURPOSE OF A LOT OF POLITICAL P ARTIES WAS SUBSIDIZED BY THE PART IES TO A PRESEN T T HEIR IDEAS AND A TTACK THEIR RIVALS AND SO HE S IGNED UP FOR THAT AND BE CAME A JEFFERSONIAN IN THE 1790 'S. WE SOMETIME S PUT THE FOU NDING FATHERS ON A PEDESTAL FOR ALL THE GREAT T HINGS WE DID AND WE FORGET THE FACT THAT THEY - - A NUMBER OF T HEM DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER, THEY FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER. JEFFERSON V ERSUS HAMI LTON WAS ONE OF THE GREAT D IVID ES IN THE EARL Y REPUBLIC AND SO JAME S CA L LENDER SIGN S UP FO R THE JEFFERSONIAN SIDE. IN THE EARL Y 1 790'S, HE PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET WHICH HAD A BIZARRE LONG TITLE. IN IT HE AC CUSED ALE XANDER HAMILTON, T HE SECRETARY OF THE TREA SURY, ACCUSED HIM OF FINANCIAL AND PROPRIE TY. THE TREASURY, OF FINANCIAL I MPROPRIETY. HE BASICALL Y A CCUSED HIM OF ABUS ING HIS POSITIO N AS TREASURY SECRETARY TO ENRICH H IMSELF THR OUGH INSIDE TRAD ING. HE MAKES TH IS ACCUSA TION IN PRINT. WE DON'T HA VE ANY COPIES OF THE PAMPHLET HE DID THIS IN . IT APPE ARS ALE XANDER H AMILTON BO UGHT THEM ALL AND DESTROY ED T HEM. WE KNOW WHA T I T SAID, BECAU SE THE RE WAS A REACTION AN D PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IT. WE JUST DON 'T HAVE THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT. W HAT HAMILT ON SAID IN REPLY WAS Y OU ARE WRONG, I HA VE NOT BE EN ENGAGED IN INSIDER TRA INING, BUT I HAVE BEEN MAKING PAYO FFS TO THIS FIGURE IN NEW YORK . H E'S BEEN B LACKMAILING ME FOR HAVI NG AN A DULTEROUS AFFAIR WITH HIS WIFE. SO TH IS ACT UALLY DE MOLISHED HAMILTON'S REPUTATION. PEOPLE SAY HIS LIFE , PEO PLE SAY HE WAS ON TRACK TO BECOMING PRESIDENT, BUT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE RECOVERED F ROM THIS ACCUSATION, WHICH JAMES CALEN DAR REPORTED. H E DID A REPOR T PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED, B UT EXPOSED IT THROUGH HIS RUMORMO NGER ING JOURNALISM. THIS PARTIS AN HAT JOURNAL IST UNDID, IN M ANY WAYS, THE C AREER OF ONE OF THE GREAT FOUND ING FATHERS. HAMILTON RE MAINED AC TIVE IN POLITICS, BUT HE WAS DIFFERENT AFTER THAT. CALENDAR GO ES ON AND CONT INUES WRITING FOR THE JEF FERS ONIAN. IN THE LATE 17 90'S , HE RUNS AFOUL OF TH E SEDITION ACT. ESSENT IALLY , HE STARTED WRITING THI NGS SO C RITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ADAMS A DMINISTRAT ION, THAT THEY T HREW HIM IN PRISON. HE SPENT A COU PLE OF YEARS IN PR ISON FOR HAVING CRITICIZED THE GOVERNM ENT IN HIS WRIT ING. A LOT OF PE OPLE ARE WONDERI NG ABOUT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS A T THAT POINT. THE SEDITIO N AC T EXPIRED , THOMAS JEFF ERSON WAS ELECTED OUR THIRD PRESI DENT, AND CALENDA R EXITED JAIL AT THAT MOMENT. HE CAME UP THINKING I SPENT THE 1790'S WRIT ING AND FIGHTING FOR THOMAS JEFF ERSON, I WENT TO J AIL FOR HIS POL ITICAL PARTY TO AD VANCE HIS IDEAS, I DE SERVE A SWEET POL ITICAL APPOINTMENT. JEFFERSON D IDN'T GIVE HIM ONE. SO CAL ENDAR SWITCHED SI DES. HE WENT FRO M A JEFF ERSONIAN ATTACK DOG TO A FEDERA LIS T ATTACK DOG WHO WAGED WAR ON THE JEFF ERS ON A DMINISTRATION. HE MOVED DO WN TO RICHMOND AN D BECAME THE FIRST WRITE R TO P UT IN P RINT THE A LLEGAT ION THAT THOMAS JEFF ERSON W AS SLEEPING WITH A SLAVE CAL LED SALLY. YOU PROBABL Y HEARD THAT STORY, WHICH WE ARE STILL DEBAT ING TODAY. WHICH WE ST ILL DO N'T KNOW THE ENTIRE TRUT H ABOUT. BUT HE EXPO SED THAT, ALSO. A PAR TISAN ATTACK DOG JOURNAL IST. IS THAT THE BIGGEST SCOOP OF THE 19TH CENTURY? THAT'S WHAT HE DID. YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THOMAS CALENDAR IN MANY HIS TORIES OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM. HE IS A DIS REPUTABL E FIGURE. WHEN HE REP ORTED ON JEFFERSO N AND HEMMING S, A LL HE HAD WERE RUMORS . HE HAD NO PROOF. H E JUST HEA RD PEOPLE TALKING ABO UT IT, SO HE L EVELED THE ACCUSATION IN PRINT. TURNS OUT H E MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT. WE DON'T EN TIRELY KNOW. THE CIRCUMS TANTIAL EVIDENCE IS GOOD. TH AT'S WHAT JOURNALISM WAS LIKE BA CK THEN, FULL OF FAK E NEWS AND PERSONAL AT TACKS, AL SO SOMETIMES TRUTHFUL, M AYBE IN UN EXPECTED WAYS. AS WE MOVED INTO THE 19TH CENTURY, JO URNALISM REMAIN HIGH LY PARTISAN. NEWSPAPERS REMAINED TI ED TO POL ITICAL PARTIES FOR MOST OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY. YOU SEE VES TIGE S OF THIS, WHEN YOU SE E A NEWSPAPER SUCH AS THE ARKANSAS DE MOCRAT GA ZETTE, TH E NEWSPAPER IN LITTLE R OCK, ARKANSAS THAT HAS IT S OWN CONNECTIONS TO THE DEMOCRA TIC PARTY. IN SPRINGFI ELD , MASSACHUSET TS, THE SPRING , SPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN. I JUST LEAR NED SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA, THERE WAS THE SAN TA ROSA REPUBLICAN. THIS IS GOI NG BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN NEWSPAPERS HAD THESE P ARTISAN AL LIANCES. WE HAD GREA T OPINI ON JOURNALISM DURING THIS ERA. W E HAD THE FIERY A BOLI TIONIS T LEADER. HIS NEWSPAPER W AS THE GRE AT ABOLITIONIST PAPER OF TH E ERA. ANOTHER GRE AT JOURNALIST WAS FREDERI CK DOUGLASS. WE ALL REGA RD HIM AS ONE OF THE GREAT C HAMP IONS OF HUMAN FREEDOM IN OUR COUNTRY. MOST PEOPLE ENCOUNTERED HIS WORK TH ROUGH HIS NEWSPAP ER. THEY READ H IS SPEECHES AND WORK IN A N EWSPAPER ORIGINALLY CALLED THE NORTH STAR. KIND OF NIC E TO HAV E A NEWSPAPER N AMED AFTER YOU AFTER THAT. WHAT STARTE D TO HAPPEN IS W ITH THE PARTISA N DIVISION, SOME PEOPLE HAD AN INTERESTING IDEA ON HOW TO M AKE MORE MONEY IN JOURNALISM. THAT INVOLV ES THE BIRTH O F THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. IT P UBLISHE S WIRE SERVIC E ARTICLES IN NEWSPAPE RS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE ASSOCIA TED PRESS START ED 15 NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK DECIDED TO POOL THEIR RESOU RCES TO COVER THE MEXICAN WAR. IT WOU LD BE CH EAPER TO BRING RESOURCES TOGETHER AND GET THE SAME INFORMATION COMING OUT OF MEXICO. THE ASSOCIA TED PRESS FORME D TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT IT DID. A FEW YEARS LATER , ONE OF THE KEY WRITERS HAD AN INSIGHT. HE THOUGHT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE NEWSPAPERS THAT SUPPLY INFORMATION TO HAVE THE COUNTRY , AND THESE O THER NEWSPAPERS DO IT FOR T HE OTHER HALF BASED ON PARTISAN INFORMATION . WHAT IF THE RE WAS A COMPANY THAT SOLD O UR AR TICLES AND INFORMATION TO EVERYBODY? THE IDEA WA S OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM, NONPARTISAN JOURNALISM, REPORT WHAT'S HAPP ENING IN WASHINGTON, EVERY PAPER , NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICAL A LLIANCE, AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED. THEY ELIMIN ATED A LOT OF , A LOT OF THE OVER PARTISANSHIP THAT DOMINA TED A MERICAN PRESS. A LO T OF IT IS STILL AROUN D TODAY. THAT 'S WHER E THE IDEA OF OBJECTIVE J OURNALISM IS BORN. IT PICKS UP STEAM, E SPECIALLY IN THE 20TH CENTURY. WERE ALSO D EALIN G WIT H THE ER A OF YELL OW JOURNALISM, OF HEARST AND PULITZE R, T HE NEWSPAP ER WARS IN NEW YORK CITY. PULITZER, T HE MOST PR ESTI GIOUS AWARD IN AMERICAN JO URNALISM, IS NAMED AFTER THAT GUY. HE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST YEL LOW JOURNALISTS IN HIS TIME , M EANING FAKE NEWS O F THE 1890 'S. ARGUABLY, F AKE NEWS L ET US US INTO THE SPANISH-AME RICAN WAR, WHEN T HE USS MAI NE BLEW UP IN THE HARBOR OF HAVANA. THE ACCUSAT ION SPANIARDS BOMBED IT. IT TURN S OU T M AYBE THEY DIDN'T. MAY BE IT WA S JUST A BOILER EXPLOSION A ND A TRAGEDY. WE WENT TO WAR OVER THAT. THE NEWSPAP ERS LED US THER E. THAT IS FAK E NEWS, ARGUA BLY. AS THIS IS HAPPENIN G, THERE'S MOR E OBJECTIVE J OURNALISM, THE IDEA WE ARE NOT GOING TO SELL TO HALF OF THE COUNTRY . IT REALLY P ICKS UP ST EAM IN TH E 20TH CENTURY. THE NEW YOR K TI MES AND WASHINGTON POST ARE IM PORTANT FORCES IN T HIS EFFORT. HOW OBJECTI VE WHERE THEY REALLY? BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN YOU COULD GET YOUR NEWS F ROM O NE OF THREE SOURCES ON TV. THEY WERE P ICKIN G THEIR NEWS BASED ON WH AT THE NEW YORK TIMES PUT ON ITS FRONT PAGE THAT DAY. WAS IT AS O BJEC TIV E AS PEOPLE ARE CLAIMIN G? I DON'T THI NK SO. I'M REMINDE D OF WALTER CRON KITE, ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED MAN IN AMER ICA. HE MISREPORTED THE RESULTS OF THE TET OFF ENSI VE I N 1968, AN D POSSIBLY TU RNED AMERICANS AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR PERMANE NTLY BASED ON FA LSE INFORMATION. WALTER CRON KITE, W HO LATER SAID HE WOULD HA VE BEEN DELIGH TED IF GEORGE M CGOVERN IN 1972 ASK ED HIM T O BE HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE. FOR M EMBER HOW MUCH TROUBLE MCGOVERN HAD WITH HI S RUNNING MATE? HE FINALLY WAN TED UP WITH SARGEN T SHRIVER. THAT WAS TH E MOS T LEFT-W ING TICKET IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AT LEAST FOR 2008. M CGOVERN AC TUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT ASKING WALT ER CRONKITE ONTO THE TICKET, THE N DECIDED NOT TO, BEC AUSE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD SA Y NO. YEARS LATER WHEN THIS C AME OUT AND SOMEONE TOL D WALTER CRON KITE WHAT HE THOUGHT, CRONKITE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM UP IN A SECOND. HE WOULD HAVE JOINED THE MOST LEFT-WING T ICKET IN THE 20TH CENTURY. HO W OBJECTI VE IS THAT? ON WE GO. I 'M REMINDE D OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN. TERRIFIC MO VIE. IT'S ALSO H AD A BAD EFFECT ON JOURNALISM. IT ENCOURAG ES A LOT OF YO UNG PEOPL E TO GO INTO JOU RNALISM WHO THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF JOURNALI SM WAS TO BRING DOWN A GOVE RNMENT. THERE'S ALW AYS BEEN AN ADVERSARIAL SIDE TO JOU RNALISM. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ASK HARD QU ESTIONS. THAT IS ALL TRUE . IT BROUGHT IN A CRUSADER ELEMENT TO JOURNALISM. A LOT OF PE OPLE IN THAT ERA SW EPT A WAY BY WOO DWARD AND BERNSTEIN PORTRAYED O N FILM. IT 'S A TERR IFIC MO VIE, A FUN MOVIE TO WATCH. T HEY GOT SW EPT AWAY THINKING IT WAS THE JOB OF JOURNALI SM, TO BRING DOWN A GOVE RNMENT. THEY WENT I N AND STARTED TO THINK TH AT WAY AND INFLUEN CE THAT WAY. I F YOU THINK I'M OVERSTA TING THINGS, DO YOU REMEMBER DAN RATHER IN 2004 WITH B LOGGER GATE? THE SUCCESS OR TO WALTER C ONT RITE , CRONKITE, O NE OF THREE PE OPL E WHO THE MAJORIT Y OF AMERICANS GOT THEIR N EWS IN THE 80'S AND 90 'S. PUTTI NG THE BS BACK IN CBS. THEY CALLED IT BLOGGER GATE, BECAUSE THE SE ACCUS ATIONS WERE REPORTED TH AT PRESID ENT GEORGE W. BUSH DOD GED HIS MILITARY SERVICE. A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE IN THE HEAT OF AN ELECT ION SE ASON. IT CAME OUT IN LIKE SEPTEMBER O F 2004. THE KIND OF CHARGE THAT IF TRUE, WOULD HAVE ENDED A PRESIDENCY, AND MAYBE S HOULD HAVE, IF TRUE. HE REPORTED IT AS FACT, TH EN THE BLOGGERS FOUND OUT T HE TRUTH. THEY STARTE D LOOKING AT THE PREC ISE CLA IMS AND FIGURED OUT THINGS LIKE THE LETTER DAN RATHER WAS SHOWING US COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE AN ACTUA L DOCUMENT FROM THE ER A, BECAUSE IT HAD A ZI P CODE, A ND WE WERE NOT US ING ZIP CODES BACK THEN. THERE'S ALL KINDS O F FORENSIC EV IDENCE BLOGGERS WERE BRINGING IN TO THE ARGUMENT. E VENTUALLY, IT ENDED DA N RATHER' S CAREER, AS IT SHOULD HAVE. [APPLAUSE] >> BUT, IF THA T HAD HAPPENE D 10 YEARS EARLI ER, WH EN NO ONE KNEW WHAT A BLOCKER W AS , WHAT KIND OF EFFECT WOUL D THAT HAVE HAD? I DON'T TRU ST THIS IDEA T HAT THE PRESIDENT W AS ONCE SUBJECTIVE A GENERATIO N AGO. I THINK IT WAS THE OPPOSITE. THEY CLAIM TO BE, BUT IT WASN'T TRUE. THE D AN RAT HER EPISODE PROVES IT M ORE THAN ANYTHING EL SE. WHAT MADE T HAT POSSIB LE FOR PEOPLE TO F IGHT BACK ON THE WAY THEY DID WA S THE RISE OF THE INTERNET. T HIS GREAT DISRUPTIVE FORCE THAT HAD SUPPOSE DLY DIVIDED US MORE THAN ANYTHI NG EL SE, THAT MADE AMERICANS S CREAM AT EACH OTHER ON SOCIAL M EDIA. THIS WAS HA PPENI NG AMID A BIGG ER BREAKUP OF THE MAIN STR EAM MEDIA. WE H AD THE RISE OF TALK RAD IO IN THE LATE 80'S A ND EXPLODI NG IN THE 90'S , WHEN THEY REPEAL ED TH E FAIRNESS DOCTRINE AN D WE HAD THE RISE OF TALK RADIO, A NE W MEDIUM THAT WAS DO MINAT ED. THEN WE HAD FOX NEWS. THEN WE HAD THE INTERNET. SUDDENLY TH ERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT V OICES, CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERTA RIAN, THAT WARRAN T IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AND WE COULD HEAR THEM A LL. THIS DROVE THE LEFT CRAZY. LET'S NOT F OOL OURSELVES I NTO BELIEVING THE MEDIA W AS REALLY GREAT 30 YEARS AGO, WAS RE PORTING O NLY THE FACTS, EVERYTHING WAS SUBJECTIVE. WHEN I CAME OUT OF COLLEGE IN 1992 AS A R IGHT OF CENTER Y OUNG WRITER THINKING AB OUT COMPE TITIVE JOURNALISM AS A NIFTY CAREE R, WHE RE DOES SOMEON E LIKE THAT GO WORK IN 1992? THERE WAS A NATIONAL REVIEW AND I EVENTUALLY GOT A JOB. THERE WAS T HE WAL L STREET JOUR NAL EDITORIAL PAGE, AND H UMAN EVENT S. THAT WAS AB OUT I T. THERE W ERE REGION AL EDITORIAL PAGES, BUT OPTIONS WERE LIMITED. NOW THERE'S THI S WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF CONSERVA TIV E NEWS AND COMMENTARY, YOU KNOW THE NAMES. ANYTHING FR OM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER TO THE DAIL Y CALLE R, THE DAILY SIGNA L, THE DAILY WIRE. ON AND ON W E GO. THERE ARE A LOT OF PLAC ES TO GET INFO RMATION FROM. A LOT OF PLACES F OR YOUNG CONSERVATIVES TO WORK IF THEY WANT JOBS I N THE MEDIA. TODAY, WE H AVE AN UNPRECEDENT ED ACCESS TO INFORMATION. WHEN I FIRS T GOT TO WASH INGTON IN 1992, IF YOU WANTED A CO PY OF T HE SPEECH YESTERDAY BY THE SENATOR, YO U WOULD H AVE TO CALL THE SENATE OFFICE, HOP E TO GET ON T HE PHONE WITH A PRESS SECRETARY, BEGGED THAT PERSON TO FAX THE TRA NSCR IPTS , AND STAND B Y THE FAX MACHINE , WAIT FOR THE THING TO COME OFF IN THAT WEIRD SCROL LING PAPER IT CAME IN. THIS WA S LI KE THE AFTERNOON. HE REQUIRED TH E COOPERATION OF OTHER PEOPL E. YOU COULDN'T JUST DO IT ON YOUR OWN. NOW YOU CAN LOOK UP THE SPEE CH AND HAVE IT IN 10 SECONDS. IT'S A POWE R JOURN ALISTS AND ALL OF YOU HAVE, A ND ABILITY TO LEARN WH AT'S HAPPENING, WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T H AVE A GENERATIO N AGO. THE CONVENT IONAL POINT IS TO SAY THIS IS A TYPE OF T ECHNOLOGY WE HAVE, COMPU TERS IN OUR POCKETS , BUT IT'S AL SO WORTH STEPPING BACK AND EX PRESSING GRATITUDE A BOUT THIS FACT T HAT W E HAVE THIS AMAZIN G POW ER, THAT MOST O F US ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE BEE N A DULTS WHEN THERE WAS N O INTERNET. WE REMEMBER THE WORLD A S ADULTS WITHOUT INT ERNET. I LIKE IT B ETTER N OW. WOULD IT ME ANS IS WE HAVE INSTANT ACC ESS TO INFORMATION, A LOT OF IT G OOD, AC CURATE, A ND RELIABLE, AND A LOT MISLEAD ING. I PREFER TH IS WORLD TO TH E OTHER ONE. I LIKE THIS OPTION BETT ER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. IT HAS A LO T OF PROB LEMS , BUT A LOT OF BENE FITS. THAT'S TRUE FOR CONSERV ATIVES AND LIBERTARIAN S. WE HAVE A BIGGER VOICE IN THE MEDI A. IT'S EASIER TO GET OUR IDEAS OUT. IT HAS NEVE R BEEN EASY, IT'S NOT EASY NOW. WE'VE NEVER HAD A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SORT OF THING. I WELCOME T HI S ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES. IT'S AN IMP ROVEMENT OVER THE ON E THAT CAME FORTH. WE ALSO HAV E A LOT OF NE W THREATS, CA LLS FOR C ENSORSHIP, WE HEAR THE M ON CAMPUS ALL THE TIM E. WE ALSO HEA R THEM F ROM JOURNALISTS WHO CALL FO R LIMITS TO FREE SPEECH . THERE IS A JOURNA LIST WHO JUST PUBLISHED A BOOK CALL ED THE CASE AG AINST FREE SPEECH. IF A JOURNA LIST CAN'T STAND UP FO R FREE SPEECH, WHAT WE HAVE LEFT, CALLS FOR T WITTER AND FACEBOOK TO CENSOR CONT ENT. TH IS IS A T HING TO RESIST. ONE OF MY F AVOR ITE AC COUNTS ON TWITTER, A SATIRE ACCO UNT, TH E DPRK NEWS SERVIC E, THE PEOPLE' S , NORTH KOREA . IT IS A SAT URDAY OR ACCOUNT THAT HAS COMMENT S ON POLITICAL E VENTS IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD. ABOUT ONE Y EAR AGO, IT TWEETED ""CA LLS FOR PROHIBITION OF FAKE NEWS IN WES T SHOW WISDOM OF MARSHALL KIM JONG-UN , DPRK CITIZENS EN JOY TOTAL PROTECTION FROM FALSE JOURN ALISM. "" I CAN LIVE WITH FOSTER NOSE AND. IT DOES PUT A BURDE N ON US WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH OUT THERE. WOULD IT ME ANS IS WE HAVE TO KNOW OUR SOURCES LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE HAVE TO BE CAREF UL ABO UT WHAT WE READ, WHAT WE TRUST. HAVE YOUR R ELIEV ED SOMETHING B ECAUSE YOU HEARD IT ON THE I NTERNET? WE ARE ALL A L ITTLE SK EPTICAL, BUT WE HAVE TO BE SKEPTICAL C ONSTANTLY ABOUT WHAT WE HEA R. WE NEED TO REC OGNIZE GOOD NEWS SOURCES AND QUESTIONABLE NEWS SOURCES, WH AT IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED. TH AT'S A BU RDEN WE HAVE TO TAKE ON. WE ALSO HAV E TO KNOW OUR LANGUAGE, T HERE ARE TREMENDOUS ABUSES OF LANGUAGE. HERE'S SOME THING I READ LAST W EEK IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. A GREAT NEWSP APER, MY FAVORITE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE EDIT ORIAL PAGES. ON THE FRON T PAGE OF THEY HAVE THEIR NEWS BRIEFS . HERE'S WHAT ONE OF THEM SAID LAST WEEK. ""IRANIAN CONSERVATIV ES ON MONDAY C ELEBRATE THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. EMBASSY SE SIEGE."" IRA NIAN CON SERVATIV ES. THESE ARE THE ISLAMIC REV OLUTIONA RIES, AND WE ARE CALLING THEM CONSERVATIV ES. WHEN THE ME DIA T ALKS ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES, CONSERVATIV ES ARE ALWAYS THE BAD GUYS. T HIS WAS A POINT OF TR EMENDOUS CONFUSION W HEN I WAS A TEENAGER. GROWING UP IN THE 1980 'S, READING ACCOUNTS AB OUT THE SOVIET UNION, AND HEARING ABOUT CONSERVATIV ES IN THE KREMLIN , TH EY WERE HARDLI NERS, THE WORST GUYS. THEY WANTED TO G O BACK TO STALIN. I REMEMBER BE ING 15 AND READING ABOUT THIS AND THINKING I THOUGHT REAGAN WAS A CONSERVATIV E, SHOULDN'T HE BE FRIEN DLY? CONSERVATIV ES ARE ALWAYS THE BAD GUYS, EVERY WHERE. THEY ALWAYS DO THAT. HERE IT IS. THE WALL STREET JOUR NAL REFERRING T O IRANIAN CON SERVATIVES. THERE IS A KERNEL OF T RUTH, I N THE SENSE T HAT MAYBE THEY'RE THE MOST CONSER VATIVE OF A FUNDAM ENTAL IST BELIEF IN I SLAM. I THINK THE TERM IS DEL IBERATEL Y USED AND MISUSED TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. WE NEED TO WATCH OU R LANGUAGE VERY CAREFULLY. THAT BRINGS ME TO GEORGE ORWELL. ANOTHER GRE AT JOURNALIST. WE THINK OF HI M AS A NO VELI ST, THE AUTHOR OF "" ANIMAL FARM,"" AND HE WAS THOSE THING S. HE WAS HIS WHOLE LIFE A JOUR NALIST. HE MADE HIS LIVING BY WRITING FOR NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZIN ES A S A LITERARY JOURNALIST AND SO FORTH. H IS GREAT S UCCESS CAME AT THE END OF HIS LIFE, BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE IN JOURNALISM. I HAVE HEAR D HIM CALLED EVER Y CONSERVATIV ES FAVORITE LIBERAL, AN D EVERY LIBERALS FAVORITE CO NSERVATIVE. HE WAS A HI GHLY POLITICAL WRITER. IT' S HARD T O FIND POL ITICAL WRITERS WHO ARE ADMIRED ACR OSS THE POLITIC AL SPECTRUM. HE IS ONE O F THEM. HIS P OLITICS WERE A LITT LE BIT CONFUSING AT TIMES. HE D ID MAIN TAIN HIS WHOLE L IFE HE WAS A SOCIALIST. THE BEST DE SCRIPTION IS ANTI-TOTALITARIAN. WIDELY ADMI RED BY ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE. HE WROTE A BOOK IN T HE 30'S CA LLED THE HOMAGE TO COLLECT , CATALONIA. IN HIS LIFE TIM E, IT SOLD LIKE 700 COPIES. IT IS HIS M EMOIR OF T HE SPANISH CIVIL WAR. WHEN S PAIN WAS HAVING A CIVIL WAR IN A PROXY BAT TL E BETW EEN FASCISM AND COMMUNI SM, HE WENT TO FIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE SOCI ALISTS AND JOINED A MILITIA. HE GOT SHOT IN THE NECK AND WAS NEARLY KILLED. WHE N IT WAS OVER, H E WROTE HIS MEMOIR. IT WAS IN S PAIN THAT HE RECOGNIZ ED HE HAD ENEMIES TO HIS LEFT, THAT THE STALINI STS WERE UP TO NO GO OD IN SPAIN, C OMMUNISTS WERE UP TO NO GOOD, THEY WERE E NEMIES OF FREEDOM. IT WAS THE FIR ST TIME HE HAD THAT REALIZATION. THIS BOOK I S ESSENTIA L IN HIS OWN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. IT ALLOWED HIM TO WRIT E THE OTHER BOOKS WE ALL ADMI RE SO MUCH. HE HAS A GR EAT LIN E WHERE HE HAS JUST MET A RUSSI AN P ROPAGANDIST WHO HAS COME TO SPA IN TO SPREAD C OMMUNIST IDEAS AND SO FORTH. "" I WATCHED HIM WITH SO ME INTEREST, T HE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN A PERSON WH OSE PROFESSION WAS TELLING LIE S, UNLESS ONE COUNTS JOUR NALISTS."" HE WAS USED TO FAK E NEWS, HE ENCOUNTERED IT ALL THE TIME. HE TH OUGHT EVERY REPOR TER WAS GETTING THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR W RONG. HE THOUGHT THE BRITISH READING PUBLIC GOT MISINFORMAT ION CONSTANTLY ABOUT WHAT WAS RE ALLY HAPPENING. IT CHANGED THE WAY HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. HE WENT ON TO WRITE A LOT. ONE OF HIS GREAT E SSAY S IS P OLITICS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. I HAVE ALL OF MY S TUDENTS READ IT. I THINK I H AD GARRI SON READ IT TWICE IN DI FFERENT CLASSES. I MAKE ALL OF MY S TUDENTS IN JOURNALISM READ THIS E SSAY, BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT DOCUMENT ABOUT TRUTH TELLI NG AND THE WAY WE OFTEN MANIPULATE LANGUAGE IN POLITICS. WHAT HE FUN DAMENTAL LY SAYS HIS LANGUAGE SH OULD BE A TOOL USED TO COMMUNIC ATE THE TRUTH. ALL TOO OFT EN WHAT HAPPEN S IS WE BECOME TOOL S OF LANGUAGE, A ND LANGUAGE CO NTROLS THE WAY WE THIN K. THIS IS WHY CLICHES ARE BAD, BECAUSE THE RE ARE PHRASES WE HAUL OUT TO EXPRESS IN A LAZY FASHIO N. HE SAYS IN POLITICS , IT IS PARTI CULARLY DEADLY. THE IDEA FI NDS ITSEL F IN HIS NOVEL, SPEAKING IN 1984 AND ALL OF THAT. IN THIS ESS AY, HE HAS THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL OF THE WAYS TO ABUSE LA NGUAGE. WE ARE DOIN G IT RI GHT NOW, WHEN T HE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHOS E HISTORY I BRIEFLY REC OUNTED, A FEW YEARS AGO SAID IN THE AP STYLE GUIDE, THE STYLE GUIDE THAT DICTAT ES HOW 98% OF ALL JOURNALISTS RIGHT, THE STYLE GUIDE SAYS WE WILL NO LONGER USE THE TERM IL LEGAL ALIEN. BECAUSE PEO PLE CAN'T BE IL LEGAL AND SO ON. TELL ME THA T IS NOT A PO LIT ICAL CHOICE, NOT A CHOICE MEANT TO SHAPE THE W AY WE DEBATE T HES E SUBJECTS, BECAUSE IT IS. IT'S AN EXA MPLE OF USING LA NGUAGE TO CONTROL HOW WE THIN K, SAYING YOU CAN'T U SE T HAT TERM TO DES CRIBE TH IS THING, BECA USE IT MAY INFLUENCE WHAT YOU TH INK. THAT'S WHAT THEY A RE ABOUT, TREMENDOUS ABUSE OF POWER. THAT HAPPEN S IN OUR OWN WORLD. ORWELL HAS SOME GREAT EXAMPLES. USES THE WO RD PA CIFICATION. REMEMBER WH AT PACIFICATION WAS IN VIETNAM? TH E WORD PA CIFY MEAN S TO BRING PEACE TO. WHEN WE WER E PACIFYING IN VIETNAM, WE WERE BRINGING WAR TO IT. IT IS THE EXACT O PPOSITE OF WHAT THE WORD MEANS. WE DO IT IN PO LITICS ALL THE TIME. WHEN THE WO RD IS THE EXAC T OPPOSITE OF THE THING IT DESCRIBES. IT CONTROLS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT IT. I N THAT CON TEX T, IT MEANS BRINGING WA R. WE HAVE OTH ER EXAMP LES, IS EVERYBODY A GAINST THE DEATH TAX? MOST AMERIC ANS ARE AGAINST THE DEATH TAX. IF YOU PULL THEM ON THE ESTA TE TAX, THEY A RE FOR THAT. IT IS THE S AME. IF YOU CHAN GE THE QUESTIO N, Y OU CHANGE THE OPINION. EVERYBODY I S AGAINST THE DEATH TAX, BECAUS E IT IS UNFAI R TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY D IE. EVERYBODY I S FOR THE ESTATE TAX, BECAUS E IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AR E SOAKING THE MAN. IF YOU ARE SO WEALTHY YOU HAVE AN ESTATE, CER TAINLY Y OU CAN SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF IT. IT IS THE S AME. OUR VIEW CH ANGE S DEP ENDING ON WHAT TERM W E USE. THE POLITIC IANS KNOW THIS. THE JOURNAL ISTS DON'T ALWAYS KNOW IT. WHEN TH EY D O, TH EY SOMETIMES ABUSE IT. NEXT TI ME Y OU HE AR A STORY ON THE DEATH TAX, ESTATE TAX, TAKE A LOOK AT W HAT TERM THE JOURNALIST IS USING, H OW IT MIGHT SHAPE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT WHOLE DEBATE. THE DEBATE SURROUNDING ABORTION, WHENEVER A STATE LEGISLATURE IN ALABAMA OR GEORGIA PASSES A NEW LAW, WHAT W ORD DO THEY USE ? A RESTRICTI ON. A NEW RESTR IC TION, NEW ABORTIO N RESTRICTION. THAT IS PRO BABLY A FAIR DESC RIPTION , LIVING , L IMITING A RIGHT TO ABORTION. IT IS A RES TRICTION. THEY NEVER CALL IT A P ROTEC TION. WHAT PERSPE CTIVE ARE THEY WR ITING FROM? IT'S AN EXA MPLE OF HOW LANGUAGE CONTROLS WHAT WE THI NK ABOUT IN DEBATES. WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE, HYPERSENSIT IVE TO THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUE S, REA D ABOUT THEM, HOW JOURNAL ISTS DESCRIBE TH EM, SO THE LANGUAGE OF POLITICS DOESN'T CON TROL WHAT WE THINK. THAT WAS TR UE IN ORWELL'S TI ME, WAS TRUE IN JAM ES CALLENDER'S TIME, ALEXA NDER H AMILTON, A ND TRUE IN OUR TIME NOW. I WILL LEAV E YOU WITH ONE FINAL T HOUGHT ABOUT THE B URDEN ON ALL OF US AS WE TH INK ABOUT FREE SPEECH. ANO THER STORY ABOUT ALEXA NDER HAMILTON. THERE ARE L IKE 84 FEDERALI ST PAPERS. THEY SAY AL MOST NOTHING ABO UT FREE SPEECH. THAT'S PART LY BECAUSE ALEXANDER H AMILTON DIDN'T THIN K WE NEEDED A BILL OF RIGHTS. HE THOUGHT THE CONSTIT UTION WAS A PRETTY GOOD DOCUME NT. HE RESISTED THE IDEA OF A BILL OF RIGHTS. YOU ALL PRO BABLY KN OW THE STORY, WE G OT A BILL OF RIGHTS P ART LY AS A MECHANISM O F COMPROMI SE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE CO NSTITUTION RATIFIED. ONCE WE HAD THE BILL OF RIGHTS, PEOPLE WERE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO ENDORSE THE DOCUMENT AND IT BECAME SUPR EME LAW OF OUR LAND. HAMILTON DI DN'T THINK WE NEEDED IT. IN FEDE RALI ST 1980 , 80 4, 1 OF THE LAST ON ES, HE DOES ADDRES S THE QUESTION OF FREE SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS A ND ALL OF THAT. HE SAYS IT DOESN'T MAT TER WHAT ANY DOCUMENT SA YS, WHAT ANY AMENDMENT S AYS, THERE 'S ANOTHER LINE ABOUT PARCHMENT B ARRIERS, JUST BECAUS E YOU WRITE SOMETHING DOWN, HOW I MPORTANT IS IT? WHAT HE SAI D IN THIS CONTEX T, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONS TITUTION OR BILL OF RIG HTS WILL SAY ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF THE PRES S, ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHAT MATTER S IS WHETHER THE PEOPLE REALLY WANT IT. IF THEY DO, THEY WILL G ET IT. IF THEY DON 'T, THEY WON'T GET IT. IT'S ALL ON THE PEOPLE, NOT WHAT THE CONSTITUTIO N SAYS OR DOESN'T SAY. I THIN K HE' S RIGHT. I'M ALSO GL AD T HERE IS A FIRST AME NDMENT. I'M GLAD TH EY WENT AHEAD AND MADE TH AT COMPROMISE, JUST IN CAS E. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, AND I THINK IT'S TRUE. WE WILL HAV E FREE SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF THE PRE SS I F WE WANT IT. WE WILL STILL GET F AKE NEWS. WE WILL GET A LOT OF ON F AKE NEWS IF WE ARE VIGILAN T AN D CARE ABOUT WHAT WE CON SUME. WITH THAT, IN CONCLUSI ON, I WILL SAY EPSTEIN DIDN'T KILL HIMSEL F. [APPLAUSE] >> THANK YOU S O MUCH. TH OSE LUCKY STUDENTS. W HAT A GREAT STORYTELLER YOU ARE. WE KNOW THE DRILL, WE S EE THE USH ERS WITH THE CARDS W ALKING AROUND. I HAVE ONE TO GET US G OING. T HER E IS ON E QUES TION, I T WORKS OUT WELL. HE STARTED YOU R COMMENTS WI TH WHAT N EWSPA PERS NEED TO MAKE MONEY, BECA USE THEY ARE A BUSINESS. HOW IS A NO NPROFIT NEWS ORGANIZATIO N LIKE NPR, AND NO NPROFIT HAS DIFFERENT D EFINITIONS , DOES IT DISTORT THE MARKET FOR THE NEWS AN D REPORTING OF THE NEWS ? >> THE PURPOSE OF A NEWSPAPER IS TO MAKE MON EY. IT IS A BUSINE SS. IT'S OFTEN BEEN A MONEY-LOS ING BUSINESS. THERE HAVE OFTEN BEEN PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE NEWS NO T BECAUSE THEY WANT T O MAKE MONEY, BUT BECAUSE THE Y WANT TO INF LUENCE. YOU WILL FI ND NEWSPAPER P UBLISHERS WHO ARE OK WITH TAKING LOSS ES IN ORDER TO HAVE A PLATFORM. IT IS THE S AME TODAY WITH THESE NEW N ONPROF IT NEWS ORGANI ZATIONS. NPR BEING O NE OF THEM , AL SO SOME I NVESTIGATIVE REPORTING U NITS RAISI NG FOU NDATION DOLLARS TO REPORT THE NEWS. THERE IS AN AGEND A BEHIND IT. WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF TH AT. BILL BUCKLE Y ALWAYS SAID , NATIONAL RE VIEW WAS FOR MANY YE ARS OF FOR-PROFIT MAGAZINE. E VERYBODY KIND OF LAUGHED AT THAT. BILL BUCKLE Y SAYS IT EXISTS TO M AKE A POINT, NOT A PROPHET. HE WAS WILL ING TO SUSTAIN LOS SES IN ORDER TO DO IT. IT WAS TECH NICALLY A BUSINESS FOR MANY YE ARS, NOW IT IS OWNED BY A NONPRO FIT. >> THIS IS ALM OST THE OPPOSITE APPROACH. W HAT IS HERE OPI NION OF EXPANDING THE LIBEL L AWS AGAINS T NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNAL ISTS WHERE THERE IS A THING OF TOO MUCH FREE SPEECH ? >> I KIND OF L IKE AMERIC AN LIBEL LAWS, WHERE THEY ARE WEAK. WHEN I READ ABOUT THE USES OF LIBEL LAWS IN OTHER COUNT RIES, LIKE THE U. K., I T GIVES ME TH E SHIVERS SOM ETIMES THE WAY THA T CAN BE ABUSED. I LIKE OUR LIBEL LAWS THAT R EQUIRE REA L MALFEA SANCE, IN OTHER WORDS , NOT A MERE MISTAK E AND GROSS E RROR AT THE SAME TIME. >> WE SPOKE AB OUT THE POWER O F LANGUAGE, WHETHER YOU ARE RES TRICTING , PROTECTING, HOW DO WE FIGHT THOSE WHO DESCRIB E THANKSGIVING AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY ? >> I HEAR THAT MORE CONNEC TED TO COLUMBUS DA Y, BUT WH AT DO YOU DO? WE KEEP CAL LING IT THANKSGI VING, OR COLUMBUS DA Y, AND US E IT BY THAT NAME. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY STRIKES ME AS SOMET HIN G A FEW PEOPL E ON CAMPUS W ANT. >> HERE'S A TE CHNICAL QUESTION. S OMEBODY WOULD LIKE YOU TO REPEAT THE NAME OF ORBITAL' S ESSAY. >> ""POLITICS IN THE ENGL ISH LANGUAGE."" YOU WILL FI ND IT IN ANY COLL ECTION OF GEORGE ORWELL'S ESSAYS, BEC AUSE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT H E EVER WROTE. IT IS ALSO FRE E ON THE INTE RNET. YOU CAN LOO K IT UP AND GET IT THAT WAY. IT HAS GREA T GENERAL WRITING TIPS THAT A RE REALLY GOOD, AND T HE SECOND HALF IS ALL ABOUT POLIT ICS. I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER QUICK STORY . WHEN I WAS WORKING FULL-TIME W ITH NATION AL REVIEW, IN 1999 OR SOMETHIN G, WE WANTED TO PUT TOGE THER A LIST OF THE 100 MOST IMPORT ANT NONFICTION BOOKS OF TH E 20TH CENTURY. 19 99, EVERY ONE WAS MAKING THEIR 20TH CENTUR Y LISTS. WE WANTED T O DO THE 1 00 MOST IM PORT ANT NONFICTION BOOKS IN THE 20TH CENTURY. WE CONVENED A PANEL OF EXPERTS, HI STORIANS, SCHOLARS, AND OTHER P EOPLE. THEY WERE O F THE NATIONA L REVIEW FLAVOR. THE LIBERAL S WE RE GOING TO HAVE THE IR LIST, AND WE WOUL D MAKE ONE OF OUR OWN. I RAN THIS PROJEC T. WE SENT BAL LOT S TO PEOPLE, WE HAD NUMBERS , AL L OF THESE EQ UATIONS AND COMPLICATED SCORING SYS TEM. WE TALLIED THE RESULTS, THE 100 MOS T IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOKS OF TH E 20TH CENTURY. WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS NUMBER ONE? I HAVE N'T H EARD IT. IT WAS WINS TON CHU RCHILL'S SECOND WORLD WAR, THE SIX VOLUME MEMOIR OF THE SECO ND WORLD WAR. NUMBER TWO WAS THE GULAGS ARE BLAGO BY SO CIAL N EESON, HIS STORY OF TH E GULAGS IN THE SOVIET UNION. NUMBER 3 , THAT W AS ON THE LIST, BUT NOT IN THE TOP 10. NUMBER THRE E WAS A NO MATCH TO CATALONI A. I REMEMBER GETTING THA T RESULT . I HAD HEARD OF THE BOOK, I T HA S BECOME , I T HAS REALLY RISE N TO GR EAT POSTHUMOUS FAME. NUMBER FOUR WAS ROAD TO SERFDOM. NUMBER FIVE WAS GE ORGE ORWELL'S CO LLECTED ESSAYS. HE WAS TWO OF THE TOP FIVE. NOT B AD. >> YOU COMMENT ED T HE PRESS WAS BIASED TOWA RDS ATT ACKING PRESIDENTIAL POWER. WHER E WERE THEY D URING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION? >> WE ARE STIL L LOOKING. THEY'RE CUR RENTLY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH THE DE MOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. >> THERE'S A Q UOTE LIB ER ALS GO INTO JOURNALISM TO CHANGE T HE WORLD. WHAT MOTIVA TES CONSERVATIVE KIDS TO ENT ER THE FIELD? >> NOT ENOUGH DO. JOHN M.R.I. HE PUT THIS IN A GOOD W AY WHEN WE WERE TALKIN G ABOUT THIS AT DINNER. OUR FIRST T EAM, THE BEST AND BRIGHTE ST C ONSERVATIV E AND LIBERTARIAN KIDS, WHAT DO THEY DO PROFESSIONALLY? THEY GO INT O BUSINESS, MAYBE LAW M AY BE ENGINEERING , MEDICINE. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. WH ERE DOES THEIR FIRST TEAM GO? THEY DO SOM E OF THOSE THING S. THEY GO INT O ACADEM IA, THEY GO INT O JOURNA LISM AND THE MEDIA. FIRST OF AL L, NOT ENOUGH CONSERVATIV ES AND LIBERTARIAN KIDS ARE GO ING INTO JOURNALISM. ULTIMATELY, THAT'S THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF LIBERAL MEDIA BIAS, TO GET MORE AND DI FFERENT P ERSPECTIVES INTO THE NEWSROO M. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE JO URNAL ISM PROGRAM AT HILLSDALE C OLLEGE, ALSO THE COLLEGE FIX, AND TH ROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS. IT IS HARD TO DO. WIRE THOSE KIDS DOING IT? I WOULD LIK E TO THINK THAT ALTHOU GH SOME ARE IDEALISTIC AND WANT TO CHANGE T HE WORLD, BE A FORCE FOR G OOD, I WOULD LIK E TO THINK THEY WANT TO BE TRUTH TELLERS AND GO OUT AND FIND GR EAT STORIES TO CONVEY T O THE REST OF US. I HO PE THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES M OST OF THEM. >> WE TALKED B EFORE ABOU T ALL T HROUGH HIS TORY, JOURNALISM, AND REPORTERS WOULD MAYBE PUT A SPIN ON STORY. I T'S NOT SO WITH THE ST ORIES ARE TELLING , BUT WHAT THEY ARE NOT TELLING . THE FACT A LOT OF ST ORIES ARE IGNORED BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. IS THERE A PRECEDENT FOR THAT? > > ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PHENOMENON TO RECOGNIZ E I S YOU READ AN ARTICLE AND MAYBE YOU WILL DE TECT A BIAS, BUT P RIOR TO THE ARTICLE IS THE QUES TION OF WHAT STORIES WE ARE GOING TO COVER. ARE WE GOIN G TO TREAT BE NGH AZI AS AN IMPORTAN T NEWS STORY, OR U SE OUR JUDGMENT TH AT IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH? THERE ARE T ONS OF STORIES THAT DON'T GET COVERED AND WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT, OR W E HEAR ABOUT THEM ONLY I N CERTAIN PLACES. THE ABORTIO N DO CTOR, WHO REPORTED ON THAT? NO T THE MAI NSTREAM MEDIA. THEY DIDN'T REPORT ON THAT. TH AT'S NOT A NEWS STORY. BOY WAS THA T A CRIME STORY. THAT 'S WHAT THAT WAS. INDISPUTABL Y. I DON'T CAR E IF YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE. AT ANY RATE , S TORY SELEC TION IS WHERE TH E BIAS BEGINS. WHAT STORIE S ARE THEY CH OOSING TO TELL? ALL T HE NEW S IS FIT TO PRINT? NO. THEY PR INT WHAT THEY WANT AND IT STARTS AT ASSIGNMENT MEETINGS. > > I DON'T FUL LY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION, BUT I THINK HE WILL ALLOW YOU T O EXPOUND ON IT. HOW DOES YO UR COLLEGE WEBSITE WORK? I DON 'T KNO W IF IT IS A FIX OR SOME THING FOR HILLSDALE. >> I WILL TALK ABOUT THE COLLEGE FIX. I FOUN DED I T ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO. THE IDEA IS WE FIND STUDENTS ON CAMPUSES AC ROSS THE COUNTRY AND RECRUIT THE M TO BE JOURNALISTS AND TRAIN T HEM, AND GET THEM TO TELL TRUE S TORIES ABOUT WHAT' S GOING ON ON THEIR CAMPUSES. I HAVE A TE AM OF PRO FESSIONAL EDITORS WHO WORK WITH THEM. THEY DO STO RY ASSIG NING, MENTORING, TRAINING, T HEY GET TH EM TO DO REAL BITS OF JOURNALISM ABOUT THREA TS TO FREE SPEECH, INC IDENTS I NVOLVING POLITICAL C ORRECTNESS , CURRICULUM BATTLES ON CAMPUS. UNTIL WE GE T STUD ENT REP ORTERS TO WRITE ABOUT THIS. EVERY DAY O N THE COLLEGE NEWS SITE, YOU W ILL GET NEW STORIES FROM STUDENTS DE SCRIBING WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. SO IT I S A GOOD PLATFORM FOR NEWS EVERY DAY. SEPARATELY, WE OFFER INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS, W E TRY TO P LACE THE MOST TALENTED AND EAGER A T PR OFESSI ONA L NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THEY CAN TRY OUT A CAREER IN THE MEDIA AND D ECIDE IF THEY LIKE IT. WE ARE TRYING TO EXCITE THEM ABOUT , WHICH IS TR UE, AND I F YOU ARE INT ELLECTUALLY CURIOUS, TH IS IS A GREAT LIG HT OF WORK, AND, IN FACT, YOU CAN MAKE A DECE NT LIVING DOIN G IT, RUMORS TO T HE CONT RARY. THERE ARE J OBS, AND IF YOU REAL LY WANT ONE, IT IS THERE FOR YOU. ER IKA: OK. YOU MENTION ED FROM OUR HISTORY, WH O DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST IN FLUENTIAL JOURNALISTS OF THE 1700S? JOHN: OF TH E 1700 S? SO I WILL T ELL YOU WHO MY FAVO RITES WERE. JONATHAN SW IFT. YOU HAVE HE ARD OF HIM, RIG HT? ""GULLIVER'S TRAVELS."" H E WAS A JO URN ALIST. HE HAD A CO UPLE OF JOBS. HE WAS AN A NGLICAN BISHOP. ""MODEST PROPOSAL."" HAS ANYONE READ ""MODES T PROPOSAL,"" THE GREATEST IN SATIRE IN A MERICAN ENGLISH? IT WAS A PAMPH LET, L IKE THOMAS PAYNE' IS C OMMON SENSE, ""ABO UT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE , LIKE THOMAS PAYNE'S ""COMMON SENSE,"" ABO UT HOW TO DEAL WITH P OVERT Y. IT IS SUCH A GOOD AND COMPELLING ARGUMENT, W E ARE STILL READI NG IT TODAY, S O I WILL GO WIT H JONATHAN SW IFT, AND THEN I WILL SAY BEN FRA NKLI N, 1700S. BEN FRANKLI N, H E WAS A VERY FUNN Y WRITE R. ALSO, A MASTER OF T HE QUIP, T HE EPIGRAM. A LOT OF TH ES E STOCK PHRAS ES, ""EARLY TO BED, EAR LY TO RISE."" THAT IS BEN FRANKLI N. ""NO PAIN, NO GA IN,"" B EN FRANKLI N WROTE THAT. WHAT HE WAS DOING BACK THEN, A HIG HLY, HIGHLY READ ABLE JOURNALIST. ERIKA: WOUL D YOU CARE TO COMMENT ON HOW SOME JOURNALISTS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THEMSE LVES THE STORY? JIM ACOSTA. HAS THAT HA D AN EFFE CT ON THE PROF ESSION, OR IS HE JUST A ONE-OFF? JOHN: THERE ARE A LOT O F JOURNALISTS WHO LIKE TO BE A PART OF THE STOR Y. WHEN THAT I S DONE WELL, YOU G ET SOMEONE LIKE TOM WOLFE, SORT OF THE NEW JOU RNALISM, THAT CAN BE DONE WELL. OFTEN, IT I S DONE POORLY , AND YOU GET , YOU GET PEO PLE WHO WANT TO BE STARS AS OP POSED TO WRITERS AND TRUTH TELLE RS AND MAKE SPECTACLES OF THEMSELVES, AND JIM ACO STA IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CON TEMPORARY ABUSER OF THAT. ERIKA: YOU MUST HA VE ACCESS TO P EOPLE OF O THER ACADEMIC INSTITUTION S THAT DO WHAT YOU DO. DO YOU FEEL LIKE T HEY TRY TO TEACH JOURN ALISTS TO BE MORE NEUTRAL OR SHOW BOTH SIDES, OR IS IT JU ST DAM PER TORP EDOES, FULL SPEED AHEAD TO THE LEFT? , DAMN THE TO RPEDOES, FULL SPEED AHEAD TO THE LEFT? JOHN: THERE IS A MISSION S TATEMENT WHICH I REA D AND I BELIEVE IN. AND SO, WE STARTED DOING THING S THAT I THOU GHT MADE SENSE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO THAT I T HINK IS ESSENTIA L I S YOU LEARN JOURNALISM BY DOING JOURN ALISM. IN OTHER WO RDS, WE DO NOT WANT KIDS SITTING IN THE CLASSRO OMS, HEARING LEC TURES FROM ME. TH EY GET A LITTLE BI T OF THAT, BU T WE MOSTLY W ANT THEM WORKING ON THE CAMP US NEWSPAPER A ND WORKING AT THE CAMP US RADIO STATION, BE CAUSE WE WANT THE EX PERIENCE TO BECOME T HE TEACHER, AN D JOURNALISM IS A THING YOU LEARN BY DO ING. IT IS LIKE A T RADE THA T WAY, LESS A PREVENTION AND MORE OF A TRADE WHEN YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY , LESS A PROF ESSION AND MORE OF A TRADE WHEN YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY. I DO A HIST OR Y OF JOURNALI SM CLASS, AND INTENSIVE WRITING WOR KSHOP. YOU DO INTE NSIVE T HINGS. WE ALSO PUSH THEM OUT AN D HAVE THEM ENGAGE IN THE PRAC TICE. THE OTHER T HING WE DO AT HILLSDALE, JOURNALISM IS NOT A MAJOR. IT IS A MINOR, AND THAT HAS IT IT I S PROPER P LAC E. JOUR NALISM SHOULD BE A MAJOR NOW HERE, AND ONE OF THE GREA T THINGS ABOU T HILLS DALE, THE STUDENTS WILL COME AND WI LL MAJOR IN A TRADIT ION ACADEMIC SUBJECT, LE ARNING ABOUT BIOLO GY OR ECONOMICS AND HISTORY , AND THEY CAN BR ING THAT INTO THE PROFESSION WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE A JOURN ALIST, AS OPPOSED TO BEING A JOU RNALISM MAJOR, AND NOT KNOWING MUCH ABOUT THOSE SUBJECTS. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK STORY. A FEW YEARS AGO, I HAD A YOU NG LADY. SHE W AS A FRESHMAN, A ND SHE CAME INTO MY OFF ICE, AND I ASKED HER THE QUESTIO N I ALWAYS ASK THESE P EOPLE, ""WH AT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU GROW UP?"" ""WHAT JOB DO YOU WANT AF TER COLLEGE, FIVE YEARS OR 10 YEARS AFTER COLLE GE?"" AND SHE SAI D, ""I WANT TO BE A ""WALL STREET JOUR NAL"" RE PORTER,"" WHICH IS AM AZINGLY PRECISE, BU T I WAS DELIGHT ED TO HEAR THAT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD WOR K WITH THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD MAJOR IN? JOURNALISM? OK, SO SHE WENT ON AND MAJO RED IN ECONOMIC S. SHE MINORED IN JOURNALISM. SHE BECAME THE EDITOR OF OUR PAPER, WHIC H, BY T HE WAY, THE PR INCETON REVIEW CALLED THE NUMBER THREE COLLE GE NEWSPAPER IN ALL OF A MERICA. [APPLAUSE] JOHN: THANK YOU, EVEN THOUGH GARRISON NO LONGER WRITES FOR IT, AND , I AM NOT DONE, Y ES WHERE S HE IS WORKING TODAY? JOHN: "", E RIKA: THE WALL ST REET JOURNAL."" A GREAT SUC CE SS STORY. DO YOU HAVE AN Y COMMENT S ON INTERNATION AL PRESS, BBC, SKY NEWS? JOHN: YEAH, I DO NOT RE AD A LOT OF THE BRITISH PRE SS. I DO GET SO ME BR ITISH NEWSPAPERS FROM TIME T O TIME. I LIKE ""THE GUARDIAN"" A LOT, WHICH IS KI ND OF A LEFT OF CENTER, AND I ENJOY THE IR CULTURAL RE PORTING, AND OPEN BUT THE TEL EGRA PH,"" WHICH IS A RIGHT OF CENTER, ALSO GOOD, HARDER TO READ. THEIR PAY W ALL IS TOUGHER TO PENETRAT E. AND I WILL SAY TH IS, BUT I DO NOT HA VE A LOT OF EXPE RIENCE WITH THE FOREIGN PRE SS, AND I WILL SAY ON E THING. I HOPE WE C AN GET INTO THE HA BIT OF PAYING F OR JOURNALISM AGAIN, RIGHT? OVER THE LA ST GENERATION, WE HAVE GOT TEN THE IDEA THAT JOURNALISM IS FREE, RIGHT , THAT YOU CAN REA D EVERYTHING ONLINE FOR NOTHING , AN D NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZIN ES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE O UT HOW TO SOLV E THIS PROBLE M, HOW TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY FOR GOO D WRITIN G AGAIN, AND ""NATION AL REVIEW"" HAS BEEN DOING THIS. ""THE WALL STREET JOUR NAL"" IS MOSTLY BEHIND A PAY WALL RIGHT NOW, AND IF YOU WANT GOOD J OURNALISM, AND YOU RECOGNIZE T HE FACT THAT THE PURPOSE OF A NEWSPA PER IS TO MAKE MONEY, IF YOU WANT GOOD JOURNALISM, YOU'RE GOIN G TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AGAI N, AND I HOPE YOU ARE WILLING TO, BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT, YOU WILL NOT GE T IT. SO MAYBE TH AT IS A THING TO THINK ABOUT AREA IF YOU LET YOUR HOMETOWN , SO MAYBE TH AT IS A THING TO THINK ABOUT. IF YOU LET YOU R HO METOWN NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION LAPSE, WHIC H I DID A FEW YEARS A GO, BECAUSE THE QUALITY WAS DIMINIS HING. IS THERE SO METHING I CAN SUBSCRIBE T O THAT YOU FIND REWARDING? I WOULD LOV E TO SEE US GET INTO THE HABIT OF TH AT AGAIN. I FIND IT A MUSING. I WILL POST AN ARTICLE OF MINE ON TWITTER, SOMETHING I HAVE WRITTEN FOR ""THE NA TIONAL REVIEW"" ""OR OTHER, AND SOMEONE WILL SAY, "" I CAN NOT READ IT. IT IS B EHIND T HE PAY WALL,"" AND THE IMP LICA TION IS, ""HOW DARE YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,"" AND I ALWAYS SA Y, ""WELL, HAVE YOU CONSIDE RED A SUBSCRIPT IO N,"" BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US PAY FOR JOURNAL ISM AGAIN. ERIKA: EARL IER, WE WERE SPE AKING A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT ALEXA NDER HAMILTON. HAVE YOU SEEN TH E MUSICAL, AND IF SO, WHAT DID YOU THI NK? JOHN: I HAV E NOT, BUT I GATHER IT DEALS WITH THE AF FAIR. IS THAT CORRECT? YES, SO I H AVE HEARD THAT. IS JAMES CA LENDAR A CHARACTER? I HEARD A "" NO "" AND A ""YES, "" SO THE ANSW ER IS I DO NOT KN OW, B UT THE PLA Y ""HAMIL TON"" DOES DEAL W ITH THAT CONTROVERSY . THERE IS A BOOK BY , IT IS A NOVEL BY A LATE ""NEW Y ORK TIMES"" COLUMNIST WILLIAM SAFIRE, AND YOU GUYS MI GHT REMEMBER HIM. HE DIED BUT WA S A GREAT COLUMNIST FOR ""THE NE W YORK TIMES,"" AND THIS WAS ABOUT T HE JOURNALISM OF THIS PERIOD , AND IT TALKS ABOUT THE HAMILTO N AFFAIR. IT TALKS AB OUT JEFFERSON AND HEMMINGS AN D JAMES CALENDAR IS A MAJOR CHARA CTER, SO IT IS A WORK OF FICTION AND TAKES SOME LIBERT IES WITH WHAT HAPPEN ED, BUT IT IS ACTUA LLY , SAFIRE IS V ERY CONSCI ENTIOUS TO STICK TO THE FACTS OF HISTORY AS WE KNOW THEM, AND H E SORT OF RIG HTS I N THE SILENCE S AND USES HIS IM AGINATIONS , WRITES IN T HE SILENCES AN D USES HIS IMAGINA TION AND GIVES US AN IDEA OF WHAT THAT P ERIOD WAS LIKE. ERIKA: 95% OF THE NEWS MEDIA IS OW NED BY SI X CORPORATIONS. IS THERE TOO M UCH AM ALGAMATIO N? WE ALL UNDE RSTAND THE BENEFIT OF CONSOLID ATING FROM A FINANCIAL P OINT OF VIEW, BU T DOES TH AT HAVE AN EFFECT, PERHAPS? JOHN: I HAV E NOT HEARD THAT FIGURE , SO I DO NOT , I WO ULD WANT TO FACT CHECK THAT, FRANKLY, BU T I DON'T KNO W. I DO THINK IT SH OULD B E EASIER FOR TV STATIONS TOO NEWSPAP ERS AND VICE VERSA. I THINK THA T WOULD BE GO OD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE MEDIA, AND RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE SOME RULES AGAINST THAT. THAT IS A L AW , IT I S AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRICT TH IS SORT O F CONCENTRATIONS OF POWER AN D INFLUENCE, BUT I THINK, GIVE N THE STATE OF THE MEDIA, IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO LET SOME EXPERIMENTA TION WITH THAT TAKE P LACE. I WOULD BE FO R A LITTLE MORE CONSOLIDATI ON, BUT I AM SPIT BAW LING HERE. , SPIT BALLIN G HER E. ERIKA: IF Y OU ONLY HAD HALF AN HOU R A DAY TO GET YOUR NATIONAL NEWS, WHAT ARE THE TOP THR EE NEWS SOURCES YOU WOULD RECOMMEND? JOHN: SO I READ ""THE W ALL STREET JOURNAL"" EV ERY DAY. I ESPE CIALLY LIKE THE EDITORI AL SECTION, BUT I READ THE WH OLE THING. I CH ECKED OUT ""NATION AL REVIEW,"" PA RTLY BECA USE IT IS MY EMPLOYER, B UT I THINK IT IS A GOO D PRODUC T. ESPECIALLY, THE MAGAZIN E, I THINK, IS VERY GOOD, AND I READ ""THE NEW YORK TI MES"" EVERY DAY. I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I T IS SAYING. I ALSO THIN K IT IS REPORTING ON SCIENCE AND FOREIGN AFF AIRS AND SEVERAL OTHER SUBJE CTS , IS QUITE GO OD, AND IT REMA INS, FO R ALL OF ITS PROB LEM S, IT REMAINS A GREAT AMERICAN NE WSPAPER THAT WE CANNOT I GNO RE, SO THOSE ARE THREE STOPS I MAKE EVERY DAY.

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS AFFORD EACH OF YOU THE OPP ORTUNITY TO DO SO. LET ME INTRODUCE THE FOUR OF YOU AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO YOU , MR. GOMEZ. WE H AVE ALFREDO GOMEZ, DIRE CTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES E NVIRONMENT TEAM, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABIL ITY OFFICE. DAV E JONES, SENIOR DIRE CTOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AT THE NATURE CONS ERVANCY, INSTITUTE O F ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE HERITAGE FO UNDATION. DR. MICHAEL GREENSTONE, MILTON FRIEDMAN DI STINGUISHED SERVICE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMIC S AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, AND THE HONORAB LE S TEPHEN BENJAMIN, MAYOR THE C ITY OF COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROL INA. WITH THAT, DIRECTOR GO MEZ, YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED TO GIVE AN ORAL PRESENTATION OF YOUR TES TIMONY FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR . GOMEZ: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO DISCUSS OUR WORK TO LIMIT FISCAL EXPO SURE BY BETTER M ANA GING CLIMATE CHANGE RISK. THIS HAS BEEN ON OUR LIST SINCE FEBRU ARY 2013. THE C OST OF RECENT D ISA STERS HAVE SHOWN US THE NEED FOR PLANNING FOR RISK IN INV ESTING IN RESILIENCE. MY STATEMEN T TODAY DISCUSSES P OTENTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE U.S. , SEVER AL AREAS WHERE THE G OVERNMENT FACES EXPOS URE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE RISK AND TH E EXTENT TO WHICH THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT HAS INVESTED IN RESILIEN CE. THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC EF FECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE COULD BE SI GNIFICANT AND UNEVENL Y DI STRIBUTED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE , THE SOUTHEAST, MIDWEST, AND GREAT P LAINS REGIONS WILL LIKE E XPERIENCE GREATER COMBINED EC ONOMIC EF FECTS LARGELY BEC AUSE COASTAL PROPERTY DAMAGE IN T HE SOUTHEAST AND CHANGES IN CROP YIELDS IN THE OTHER TWO R EGIONS. WH ILE THE E STIMATES OF THESE EF FECTS ARE IMPRECI SE, THE ESTIMAT ES CAN HELP DE CISION-MA KERS BETTER MANAGE CLIMATE RIS K. EARLY THIS YEAR, WE REPORTED THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT FACES FISCAL EXPOSURE FR OM CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS IN SE VERAL AREAS. INCL UDING DISASTER AI D, FEDERA L INSURANCE PROGRAMS, FEDERAL PRO PERTY LAND. THE RISING NUMB ER OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND RELATED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE ARE A KEY S OURCE OF FEDERAL FISCAL EXPOSURE. S INCE 2005, FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DISASTE R ASSISTANCE IS AT LEAST 45 0 BILLION DOLLARS. AC CORDING TO THE U.S. GLOBAL CHAN GE RESE ARCH PROGRAM, DISASTER COSTS ARE P ROJECTED TO INCREASE AS CERTAIN EXTREME WEA THER EVENTS BECO ME MORE INTENSE. IN ADDITION , THE NATIONAL IN SURANCE PROGRAM AND THE FED ERAL CROP INSURANCE P ROGRAM ARE SOURCES OF FEDERAL FIS CAL EXPO SURE, DUE IN PART TO CROPS , TO THE VULN ERA BILI TY OF CROPS IN CL IMATE CHANGE. FROM 2013 TO 201 7, COSTS TOTALED $53 BILLION. AS OF APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE NATIONA L FLOOD INSUR ANCE P ROGRAM WAS $21 BIL LION IN DEBT TO THE TREASURY. W ITH REGARD TO FEDERAL PROPERTY, T HE GOVERNMENT OWNS AND OPERATE S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FACILITI ES, SUCH AS DEFENSE INS TALLATIO NS AND MANAGES MILLIONS OF ACRES OF LAND THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SEPTEMBER 2010, HURRI CANE F LORENCE DA MAGED CAMP LEJEUNE AND OTHER F ACIL ITIES IN NORTH CAROL INA, RESULTING IN A PRELIM INARY REPAIR ESTIMATE OF $3.6 BIL LION. ONE MONTH LATER, HURRICANE M ICHAEL DEV ASTATED THE AIR FORCE BASE IN FLO RIDA, RESULTING IN A REPAIR ES TIMATE OF $3 BILLION. ONE WAY TO REDUCE FEDERAL FISCAL EXPOSURE IS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE LONG-TERM R ISK TO PEOPLE A ND PROPERTY FR OM NATURAL HAZ ARDS, FOR EXAMPLE , IN SEPTEMBE R OF 2018, WE REPORTED TH AT ELEVATING H OMES AND STRENGTHEN BUILDING CO DES PREVENTING GREATER DAM AGES IN TEXAS AND F LORIDA DURING THE 2017 HURRICANE S EASON. CONGRESS AL SO PASSED A REFORM ACT OF 2018 THA T ENABLE D ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AT THE STAT E AND LOCAL LEVEL. WITH REGARD S TO RESILIENCE, THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT HAS MADE LIMITE D INVESTMENTS, HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT HAVE A STRATEGIC A PPROACH FOR INVESTING IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS. N O ONE IS IN CHARGE WHEN IT COM ES TO IDENTIFYING AND PRIORIT IZING CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT. NO FEDERAL ENTITIES ARE LOOKING HOL ISTICALLY AT HOW TO STRA TEGICALLY PRIORITIZE PROJECTS TO ENSURE THEY ADDRESS THE NATION'S MOST SIGNIF ICANT CLIMATE RISKS. IN S UMMARY, THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT COULD REDUC E ITS EXPOSURE TO CLIMATE CHA NGE BY FOCUSING AN D COORDINATING FEDERAL EFF ORTS. WE MADE A TOTAL OF 62 RECOM MENDATIONS AND AS A DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR, 25 OF THESE RECOMMENDAT IONS REMAIN OPEN. SOME OF THESE IDENT IFY KEY GOVERNM ENTW IDE EFFORTS NEEDED TO HELP PLA N FOR AN D MANAGE CLIMATE RIS K AND DIRECT FEDERAL EFFORT TO A COMMON GO AL, SUCH AS IMPROVIN G R ESILIENCE. THIS COMPLETES MY OPENING STATEMENT. REP. ROUDA: THAN K YOU. MR. JO NES: I'M DAVE JONES AND I SERVED AS T HE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR CONSERV ANCY . FROM 2011 T O 201 8 I H AD THE P RIVILEGE OF SERVING CALIFORNIA' S INSURANCE COMMISSIONE R. SCIENTISTS CONCLUDED GLOBAL TEMP ERATURE RISES CONTRIBUTIN G TO CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVE NTS, SEA LEVEL RISE, HURRICANES, COASTAL RIVER FLOODING, W ILDFIRES ARE MADE MORE SEVERE AND MORE FREQUENT BUT GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISE. THESE EVENTS ARE RESULTING IN LOSS-OF- LIFE AND DESTRUCTION . THESE EVENTS PRODUCE ECO NOMIC AND INSURANCE LOSSES. THE SE LOSSE S ARE RISING OVER TIME. DAMAG ES ASS OCIATED WITH EXTREME WEA THER EVENTS CAUSING $1 BILLION OR MORE IN DAMAGES ACR OSS U.S. ECONOMY. IN 2017, GLOBAL ECON OMIC LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES WERE $33 0 BILLION. IN SURED LOSSES WERE $138 BILLION. THE HIGHEST IN HISTORY. IN THE U.S., INSURANCE C OMPANIES R ESPONDING BY RAISING PRICES AND EXCLUDI NG O R LIMITING COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN RIS K WHEN T HE RISK OF LOSSES T O HIGH-PRICED LET INSURANCE P ROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW INSU RANCE COMPANIES MAY RESPOND. DE CADES AGO, HOME INSURANCE COMPANIES H AVE EXCLUDED COVERAGE FOR FLOOD R ISK. THAT IS FOR ALL STANDAR D INSURANCE POLICIES. TODAY, I WO ULD LIKE TO FOCUS MY TESTIMON Y ON EXTREME WILDFIRES. THE FOURTH NATIONAL CLIMATE US MESSES , ASSESSMENT STRESSES TH AT FIRES ARE INCREASING IN INTENSITY A ND FREQUENCY. BY MIDCENTURY, THE WESTERN U.S. WILL H AVE 2 -6 TI MES MORE WILDFI RES. IN 2017 TO 201 8, CALIFORNIA SUFFERED THE MOST DE STRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN HISTORY WHERE 158 LIVES W ERE LOST, HOMES WERE DESTRO YED, AND ASSURE SUFF ERED , ENSURES , INSURERS SU FFERED IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES TO BE , IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES. HOME INSURE RS HAVE RESPONDED TO THE LOSS ES BY RAISING PRICES FOR INSURAN CE AND DECLINING TO RENEW THEIR POLICIES, O R DECLINING NEW POLICIE S. C ALIFORNIA IS MARCHING STEADILY TO WARD AN U NINSURABLE FUTURE REGA RDING C OVERAGE FOR HOMES AT RISK FOR WILDFIRE. WHAT CAN WE DO? GREENHO USE GAS EMISSIO NS NEED TO BE REDUCED DRA STICALLY . ONE IMPORTA NT O VERLOOKED WAY OF DOING SO IS NATURAL CLIMATE SOL UTIONS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE 37% CARBON REDUCTION TO MEET THE GO ALS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT. WE NEED MORE INVESTMENT IN THESE AP PROACHES TO MEET THE TARGETS . AN D TO FURT HER RED UCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRE S, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THI S IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION. IN NOVATION AND FUNDING ARE THE MEANS TO RESILIENT LANDSCAPING COMMUNITIES . FUEL TREATMENTS HAVE PROVEN TO BE A SAFE AND CO ST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDU CE RISK, AND R EMOVING OV ERGROWN BRUSH AND T REES. FUND ING FOR THESE A ND OTHER PROGRAMS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK IS A C HALLENGE . THE 2018 FI RE FIX HELP TO STABILIZE THE BUDGETS , HOWEVER, THAT EFFORT MUST BE COUPLED WITH THE REINVES TMENT AND RESTORATION RISK REDUCT ION PROGRAMS. INSURERS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE BY OFF ERING PRODUCTS IN THEIR PR ICI NG AND UNDERWRITIN G AND OFFER P RODUCTS AND AREAS OF RI SK OF WIL DFIRES, WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUN T THIS REDUCTION BENEFITS. H OME INSURANCE PRICING AND AVAILAB ILITY IN THE FACE OF INCREASI NG WILDFIRE RISK IS AN EXAMP LE OF HOW INSURERS CAN RESPOND TO RISKS ASSOCIATE WITH CLIMAT E CHANGE. HURRICANE RISK, COAST AL AND FLOOD R ISK, DROUGHTS, ALL OF THES E AR E EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE- DRIVEN RISK THAT H AVE CONSEQUENCES FOR INSURANCE. THIS SECTOR CAN PLAY A ROLE TO MANAGE T HESE RISKS MORE FUNDAM ENTAL LY IT IS THE UNDE RLYING DRIVERS OF THESE RISKS THEN NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THAT IS INC LUDIN G GREENHOUSE GASES AND I NCLUDING USING NATUR AL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS A ND USING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS T O BUILD RESILIENCE. OTHERWISE, WE WILL FIND OURSELVES I N AN INCREASINGLY UNINSURABLE WORLD. REP. ROUDA: THAN K YOU. DR. GR EENSTONE YOU ARE RECOGNI ZED FOR YOUR COMMENTS. DR. GREENST ONE: THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON O R THE SEC IS THE COST OF SOCIETY APPROVED TO SEEING S EC TO THE ATMO SPHERE. IT ENABLES REGULATORS TO ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO LOWER CA RBON EMISSIONS. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME HISTORY. IN 2009 WHILE WORKING IN THE OBAMA A DMIN ISTRATION I CONVENED A GROUP TO DETERMINE A GOVERNMENT SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. AS OF 2016, GOVER NMENT ASSESSED TH E COST OF CARBON. SIN CE ITS INCEPTION, THEY HAVE B EEN U SED AS A FOUNDA TIONAL TOOL SETTIN G REGULATIONS TO COVER AR EAS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND FUEL ECONOMY STA NDARDS. TO DATE, TH E C OST WRITTE N TOTAL MORE THAN $ 1 TRILLION, HOWEVER, THERE ARE S EVERAL REASONS THE CURRENT ADM INISTRATION'S COST OF CARBON I S TOO LOW, AND AS A CONSEQUEN CE , UNDERMINES THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE. NUMBER ONE, IN 201 8 THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION INSTITUTED A SMALLER SOCIAL COST OF CARBON B ASED ON FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS . IT USES HIG H DISCOUNT RATES THAT ARE NO T SUP PORTED B Y ECONOMIC TH EORY OR F INANCIAL MARKETS. SE COND, IT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR DAMAGES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. THIS FAILURE DISCOURAGES OTHER COUNT RIES, WHO PRODUCE 90% OF CO2 EMIS SIONS, BY UNDERCUTTIN G THAT WOULD BENEF IT CITIZENS. THIS CAN PR ODUCE BENEFITS FO R U.S. CITIZENS AND WE ARE FAILING HERE. THE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL PROGRESS OF THE MADRID TALKS AS EV IDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHE N WE RETREAT. NU MBER TWO, THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IS NOT BASED ON THE FRON TIE R OF SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMI C UNDERSTANDING AS NOTED BY TH E 2017 REPORT. THA T WAS ISSUED BY T HE NATIONAL. PARTIALLY T O FILL THIS HOLE, I AM CO-LEADING AN IMPACT L AB TO UPDATE THE SOCIAL COST OF CAR BON. THE PRIMARY FIN DING IS THAT IT CHANGE T HE MORTALI TY RATE DUE TO TEMPERAT URE CHANGES ALO NE WILL LEAD T O A SOCIAL COST OF $24 PER METRIC TON. THAT I S 10 TIMES LA RGER THAN WHAT THE OB AMA NUMBER HAD AS A MORTALITY COST. IT IS ALMOST HALF OF THE ENTIRE MORT ALITY ESTIMATE. I T IS THREE TIMES TO 20 TIMES LARGE R THAN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENTIRE COST OF CARBON. NUMBER THREE, WHILE ESTIM ATING CLIMATE DAMAGES IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAI NTY WITH CLIMATE MODELS AND ESTIMATION, THIS UNCERTAINTY STRENGTHENS THE CASE FOR RE DUCING EMISSIONS. ECONOMICS AND CASUAL OBSE RVATION REVEALED THAT PEOPLE SHOW A PROPENSITY FOR RISK AVERSI ON. M Y FELLOW WITNESSES' ENTIRE INDU STRY AND INSURAN CE DEPENDS ON THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE DISLIKE RISK. THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY A PR EMIUM TO AVOID UN CERTAIN OUTCOMES. FOR THIS RE ASON, THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS COST OF CARBON F AIL ED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS RISK AVERSI ON IS TOO LOW. WHAT TO DO? GIVEN THE SCALE O F THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE IS THE URGE NT NEED FOR RESOURCES TO ADDRESS OTHER PRESS ING SOCIETAL CH ALLENGES, IT IS CRITI CAL THAT POLICY DELIVERS TH E CHEAPEST REDUCTIONS IN CO2 EMIS SIONS TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. THE SUREST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS , EXP ENSES TO DAY IS TO PRICE ADMIS SIONS WITH A CARBON TAX OR IMPL EMENT A PROGRAM. IT'S SET AT THE RIGHT LEVEL, THE PRICING APP ROACHES SOLVE THE M AIN PROBLEM, WHICH IS PE OPLE AND FIRMS DON'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DAMAGES THEY CAUSED BY ENGAGING IN ACTIVE THESE THAT , ACT IVITIES THAT RELEASE CO2 . THIS APPROA CH UNLEASHES MARKET FORCES TO U NCOVER THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAY TO REDU CE EMIS SIONS B Y INCENTIVIZING SWITCHES TO CHEAP COST TO ADMISSIO NS, THERE WILL BE BEN EFITS. IN CONTRAST , CURRENT, FEDERAL AND STATE P OLICY IS A HODGEP ODG E THAT TARGETS EMISSIONS I N DIFFERENT SECTORS IN DIFFEREN T WAYS WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF INTENSITY. A RECENT PA PE R BY SOME COL LEAGUES AT YALE AND HARVARD CONCLUDED THE RANGE O F COST OF CO2 MITIGATION POLICIES IS EXTREMELY WIDE, FROM LESS T HAN $10 PER TON TO OVER $1000 PER TON AND MOST OF THESE COSTS, MOST OF THESE EMISSION RE DUCTIONS ARE EXPENSI VE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY VASTLY EXCE ED THE U.S. GOVERN MENT'S 2017 SOCIAL COST OF CAR BON, SO WE ARE GETTING SMALL REDUC TION IN CO2 GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPEND ING. I N CONTRAST, P RICING CARBON WOULD PRIORITIZE ACTIVITIES WITH THE HI GHEST BAN G FOR TH E BUCK. T URNING TO FUTURE REDUCTIONS, THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON ITS OWN WIL L NOT INVEST ENOUGH IN RESOURCE DE VELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATI ON TO UNCOVER NEW APPROACHES TO REDUCING CO2 BECAUSE MANY OF THE RETURNS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS WOULD FLOW TO THEIR COMPETITORS . THE FACT THAT PRIVATE FIRMS LACK INCENT IVES TO ENGAGE I N ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT IS A MARKET FA ILURE AND A GOVERNMENT CAN ADDRESS THIS BY PROVIDING SUBSIDIES O R FUNDING RESEARCH DIRECT. IN CONCLUSION, THE UNITED STATES NEED S TO BALANCE THE COST OF MIT IGATING CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY WITH THE CLIMATE DAMAGES COMING. CAR BON PRIC ING USI NG THE BEST AV AILABLE EVIDENCE AL ONG WITH ROBUST RESE ARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING WIL L DELIVER THE INEXPENSIVE REDUCTIONS IN CO2 EMISSIONS N ECESSARY TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. REP. R OUDA: MAYO R BENJAMIN, YOU ARE REC OGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES OF COMMENTS . M AYOR BENJAMIN: C HAIRMAN, I WANT TO T HANK YOU AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE OPP ORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. OB VIOUSLY, YOU HAVE OU R CONDOLE NCES FOR THE LOS S OF CONGRESS MEMBER CUMM INGS. W E ALL MISS HIM A GREAT DEAL. MY NAME IS STEVE BENJA MIN. I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING FOR THE LAST 10 YEA RS AS MAYOR OF COLUMBIA , SOUTH CAROLINA. I N ADDITION TO SERVING IN GOVERNME NT, WE ALSO HOS T NEARLY 50,0 00 STUDENTS ATTENDING THE UNIVERS ITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA-COLUMBIA. WE ARE ALSO THE PR OUD HOME TO FORT JAC KSON WHI CH TRAINS APPROXIMATELY 45,000 SHOU LDERS , SOLDIERS A YEAR. CLIMATE CHA NGE IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST CHA LLENGE WE FACE AND I AM PLEASED THAT THE COMMITTEE IS HOSTING THIS HEARING. MA YORS ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE IM PACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOCAL G OVERNMENTS WANT TO MIT IGATE TH OSE IMPAC TS AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT. WE CANNOT TACKLE THIS ALONE. WE NEED A STRONG FEDE RAL PARTNER. I HOPE THIS 'LL BE THE FIRST STEP IN DEV ELOPING A ROBUST PR OGRAM THA T BOLSTERS THE EFFORTS OF MAYORS I N CITIES THAT WILL ADDRES S THIS EXISTE NTIAL CHALLENGE. IN COLUMBIA, W E WITNESSED FIRSTHAND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY IMPACTING I NFRASTRUCT URE. OVER THREE DAYS IN OCTOBER OF 2015, TH E REMNANT S OF HURRICANE J OAQUIN STA LLED OVER CENTRAL SOUTH CAROL INA, INUNDATING THE AREA WITH 30 INC HES OF RAIN IN OUR GREA T C ITY. THE I MPACT TOOK THE LIVES OF 19 PRECIOUS CI TIZENS AN D THE STO RM REALLY WIPE D OUT OUR CANAL WHICH SERVICES AR E MAIN WATER TREATMENT P LANT. IT CLOSED O VER 100 STREETS AND DAMAGED OVE R 400 HO MES AND BUSINESSES. SINCE THEN HAVE H AD SIX OTHER MAJOR RAIN EVENTS. IT WOULD NOT ONLY INCREA SE RAINFALL AN D MORE STORMS, BUT A REPORT IN 2018 SHOWS COLUMBIA WI LL EXPERIENCE ABOUT 46 DA YS PER YEAR OF ABOVE 90 DE GREES FAHRENHEIT. BY THE TIME I TURN 80, THAT IS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE. WE HAVE SEEN THOSE TREND S NOT FAR FRO M YO UR H OME T HE DOUBLING , OF THE NUMB ER OF DAYS ABOVE 90 DEGREES. THIS EXCESSIVE HEAT HAS AD VERSE IMPACTS ON EVERYONE, BUT CERTAIN LY THE ELDERLY, MANUAL LABO RERS AN D IMPACTS FOOD PROTEC TION AND AIR QUA LITY. LAST YEAR, I REPRESENTED MY COLLEAGUES, SERVING AS A CHAIRMAN FO R COALITION DEDICATED T O PRESERVI NG OF MUNICIPAL B ONDS. I HA VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO DO THIS AT A TIME WHEN MAYORS ARE TAKING RENE WED PROMINENCE ON THE NATIONA L STAGE TO REPORT PUBLIC POLI CY AND INNOVATION. OUR FLOODS THEN WERE A CALL TO ACTION FOR COLUMBI A. MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY OUTLINED TH OSE IN DETAIL AND HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR THE REC ORD. WE HAVE USED GRANTS TO H ELP SAVE OUR CITIZENS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY UPDATING OUR INFRASTRUCT URE. MY FIRST IN ITIATIVES WHEN I TOOK OFFICE WAS TO UPGRADE OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE ARE MOVING SIGNIFICANT LY. WE HAVE MOV ED TO THE NEXT STEP OF SET TING A TARGET OF POWERING OU R COMMUNITY W ITH 100% CLEAN RENEW ABLE ENERGY BY 2 035 IN ADDITION TO OUR EFFO RTS, WE HAVE BEEN A DDRESSING MITIGATION. LAST YEAR, WE MADE HISTORY BY ISSUING GREEN BONDS AND IMPROVI NG T HE STORM WATER SYSTEM. THIS IS TO ADDRE SS OUR CITY'S FLOODING AN D STORM WATER DRAINAGE IS SUES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COLLECT ABO UT 15% OF OUR NATION'S TAX REVENUE . WITH THAT 1 5%, WE WILL LEVY CORE , EXP ECTED TO DELIVER SER VICES TH AT WE ALL UNDERSTAND MAKE UP THE HEAR T OF THE CIVILIZED SOCIETY OF THE WESTERN WORLD. WE CANNOT TACK LE THAT TASK OF SLOWING CLIMATE CHA NGE ON OUR OWN. WE NEE D A STRONG FEDERAL LOW , LOCA L PARTNERSHIP. THERE HAS B EEN A CALL FOR CLIMATE ACTION I HAVE INCL UDED AN ATTACHMENT, SO I WON'T GO INTO DET AIL. BUT IT LAYS OUT A SIGNIFICA NT NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WE BEL IEVE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND PRODUCE QUICK RESUL TS UNDERSCORING THE EXISTEN TIAL THREAT THAT CLIMATE CHA NGE'S EC ONOMIC IMPACT. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTU NITY TO TESTIFY. RE P. ROUDA: THAN K YOU, MAYOR. THAN K YOU TO ALL OF Y OU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS BRI EFING. L ET ME EMPHASIZ E, PART OF THE REASON YOU ARE HERE IS THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRON MENT FOR OVERSIG HT COMMITTEE, WE ARE VERY FO CUSED ON THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN FACT, TH IS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE W E ARE TRYI NG TO TACKLE THIS YEAR A ND NEXT YEAR IN THE 116T H CONGRESS. IN THAT PROCESS, WE ARE LOOKING AT THREE PHASES OF H EARINGS, EACH PHASE HAVING MULTIPLE HEARINGS AN D BRIEFINGS. THAT IS PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE. PAS T, WHAT DID WE KNOW WHEN WE DO WE KN OW ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? WE HAVE HAD HEARING S AN D TESTIMO NY AND EVIDENCE WAS PROVIDI NG SHOWING THAT SHELL AND E XXON KNEW IN THE LATE 1970'S AND EARLY 1980'S ABOUT THE I MPACT OF EXTENSIVE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS WOULD HAVE IN CO2 EMISSIONS ANY IMPACT ON T HE ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS CLIMATE CHANGE IN MORE SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS. PRE SENT, THE PRESENT PHASE OF THESE HE ARINGS AND BRIEFIN GS, WHICH WE ARE IN R IGHT NOW. OUR GO AL IS TO HELP THE PUBLIC AS W ELL AS LAW MAKERS UNDERSTAND BOTH THE EC ONOMIC AND THE HUMAN IMPACT OF C LIMATE CHANGE. UNF ORTUNATE LY, MAYOR BENJAMIN AS YOU POINTED OUT, IT IS OFTEN QUITE EASY TO FIG URE OUT THE HUMAN I MPACT OF C LIMATE CHANGE. IT IS LITER ALLY COUNTING THE NUMBER OF P EOPLE WHO HAVE DIED FROM THAT E VENT. WE H AVE ALS O HAD TESTIMONY FROM OTHERS IN T ALKING ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPAC T FROM A HEALTH CARE COST. AND T HAT IS CERTAINLY MORE DIFFIC ULT TO ASCERTAIN, BUT ALSO QU ITE IMPORTANT THAT WE GET TO T HAT INFORMATION . THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE ECON OMIC IM PACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE REALLY HERE TODAY TO HELP THE PUBLIC BETT ER UNDERSTAND THAT CLIMATE CHA NGE, MORE SEVERE WEATHER EVE NTS, CAUSES MUCH GREATER DAM AGE AND GREATER ECONOMIC IM PACT THAN WE WOULD EXPER IENCE WITHOUT HAVING CLIMATE CHA NGE AT OUR DOOR STEP. T HEN WE WILL MOVE INTO T HE THIRD PHASE OF TH E HEARING, AND THAT WI LL B E NIRVANA AND A POP , AP OC ALYPTIC , AND , AND THAT WI LL BE ON THE FUTURE AND QUITE EARLY, WE W ILL PAINT TWO DIFFERENT PICTURES. O NE, NIRVANA AND ONE APOCALY PTIC, KNOWING IF WE DO NOTHING, WH AT TYPE OF WORLD WE WOULD BE LE AVING TO OUR CHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. IF WE DO TAKE ACT ION NOW, ON THE OTHER HAND, HOW W E CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPACT WHAT OUR WO RLD LOOK LIKE FOR FUTURE GENE RATIONS, KNOWING ALSO THAT EVEN I F WE TAKE DRAMATIC ACTION NOW, THERE IS GOING TO BE IMPACTS FRO M CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE CAN NOT S TOP IMMEDIATELY . THAT WE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR PAS T INACTION. S O, YOU BEI NG HERE TODAY IS EXTREMEL Y HELPFUL IN ALLOWING US TO EDUCA TE THE PUBLIC AND EDUCATE LAWMAKERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL, BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STATE AND THE MAY ORS AROUND OUR COUNTRY HAV E A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPA CT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WAYS TO ADDRESS IT. LET'S D IG INTO A FEW QUESTIONS. I AM GOING TO BOUNCE AROUND A LI TTLE BIT. WHEN W E TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC IM PACT, DR. GREENSTONE, YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE S OCIAL COST OF CARBON AND I WOULD LIKE TO TRY AND PIN YOU DOWN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE FROM YOUR COMMEN TS, T HERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF ESTIMATE S AS TO WHAT THE SOCIAL IMPA CT IS FROM CARBON. I A M CURIOUS, DO YOU HAVE A HARD NUMBER AS W ITH THE COST PE R TON SHOULD BE? DR. GRE ENST ONE: I THINK THE BEST ES TIMATE IS LEFT OVER F ROM THE OBAMA ADMIN ISTRATION WHICH IS ABOUT $51 P ER TON. IN PLAIN ENGLISH, WH AT THAT MEANS IS EV ERY TIME WE MET A TON OF CO 2 IN T HE ATMOSPHERE, WE ARE GIVING THE WORLD THE UNFORTUNATE GIFT OF $51 FOR THE DAMAGES. IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A VARIABILI TY AROUND THAT NUMBER, BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER , W HEN THINGS ARE UNCERTAIN, WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO IS ACTUALLY BUY INSURAN CE AGAINST THAT. THAT WOULD INCREASE HOW MUCH WE WOULD WANT TO SPEND TO PROTECT OURSELVES. REP. ROUDA: THE $51, JU ST TO BE CLEAR HERE, SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO THE CALCULA TION OF THAT $51 PER TON IS TO S HORTEN LIFESPANS IN HEALTH C ARE COSTS DUE TO AIR POLL UTION AS AN EXAMPLE. IS THAT CORRECT? DR . GREENSTONE: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. T HERE ARE SEVERAL BIG-TICKET CATEGORIES. HUMAN HEALTH IS AT THE T OP OF THE LIST. AND T HIS NEW RESEARCH I WAS TALKI NG ABOUT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY REVISE THESE COSTS SAYS WE ARE AND DOMESTIC AE RATING , UNDERESTIMATING IT, BUT THE RE WILL BE THE RE WI LL BE LARGE IN CREASES IN MORTALIT Y RATES. THERE WILL BE WIDE PAR TS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE GO ING TO BE SUBJE CT TO FLOODING AND TO STORM SU RGE, WHERE WE WI LL HAVE TO POP ULATIONS MOVE AND WI LL INVOLV E VERY THORNY SITUATIONS AND WHAT PA RTS OF THE U.S. WE WILL PROTEC T IN WHICH ONES WE WILL NOT. IT WIL L ALS O SHOW U P IN CROP YIELDS. REP . ROUDA: IF I RECALL MY BILL NUMBER CORR ECTLY, IT IS THE , I T I S THE H OUSE BILL ON THE CARBON TAX, WHICH I AM A COSPONSOR. IN YOUR MIND FROM AN ECONOMIC ST ANDPOINT, DOES THAT FEE, IF IMP LEMEN TED, NEED TO BE BROUG HT IN PROGRESSIVELY, OR DO WE GO STRAIGHT TO SOMEWHERE AROUND A $5 0 FEE? MR. GR EENSTONE: THE BEST ESTIMA TE WE HAVE IS $50. THERE IS A GOODS CAS E , A GOOD CASE FOR STARTING THERE. THE MOST IM PORTANT THING IS GETTING IT ABOVE ZERO, WHICH IT IS RIGHT NOW. FIGHTI NG AB OUT THE EXACT NUMBER IS N OT CRITICAL, B UT MY PROJECTI ON IS AS WE LE ARN MORE, THE $50 WILL LOOK A LITTLE SMALL AND WE MIGHT WA NT TO HAVE ROOM FOR ALLOWING IT TO INCREASE TO REFLECT THAT. REP. ROUDA: THE SENSE H ERE IS THA T THE TRUE COST OF BURNING FOSSIL FUEL S IS UNDERPRICED BY AT LEAST $50, THEREFORE THOSE WHO C REATE AND BURN AND USE FOSSIL FUELS SHOULD PAY THE APPROPR IATE PRICE ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, WHICH ALSO SUGGES TS A FASTER MOVE BY THOSE SAME OPERAT ORS AND MANUFACTURERS, AND COMPANI ES AND DEVELOP AND IMPLEME NT THIS, THAT THEY W OULD MOVE FASTER TOWARDS GREEN CLEAN INDUSTRIES AND FUEL, CORRE CT. DR. GREENST ONE: THERE IS VE RY LITTLE INNOVATION IN RESPONSE TO NO MARKE T. UNTIL THERE IS A PRICE SIGNAL, I T HINK WE'RE JUST HOPING FOR THE BES T IN TERMS OF INNOVATION. ONCE THERE IS A CLEAR PRICING, , PRICE SIGNA L, THE AMERICA N ECONOMY ARE EFFECTIVE AT RESPONDI NG AND I WILL HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THERE WILL BE NEW IDEA S THAT WILL GIVE US WHA T WE CAN IMAG INE , REP. ROUDA: THIS IS HOW CAPITAL ISM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK? DR. G REENSTONE: YES. REP. ROUDA: YOU ARE NOT SUGGEST ING THAT IT COULD WORK IN TAN DEM, CORRECT? DR. GREENST ONE: IT COULD. THE BEST CA SE WOULD BE TO CHOOSE ONE AND GO DOWN THAT PATH. REP. ROUDA: OK. DR. GRE ENST ONE: I THINK A LOT OF THAT PRO BAB LY DEPENDS ON WHAT ONE WANTS T O DO WITH THE REVENUE S, A ND IT CAN OFTEN BE EASIER TO D IRECT THE REVENUES. R EP. ROUDA: MR. JONES, WITH YOUR MANY Y EARS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORN IA, LET'S TAKE A FEW MINUT ES AND TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMI C IMPACT ON AVERAGE CIT IZENS AND HOMEOWNERS AS WE EXPER IEN CE MORE SEVERE WEAT HER EVE NTS AND THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE FOR HOMES, WHET HER IT IS FLOOD INSURANCE, PROPERTY IN SURANCE AND SO ON. CAN YOU SPE AK A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE IF WE DO NO T PROV IDE A GREATER CHE CK TO CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HOMEOWN ERS ACROSS AMERICA? MR . JONES: CERTAINLY. I THINK BAR RY 'S GEO GRAPHICA LLY, MR. GOMEZ P OINTED OUT, THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT THE PRICE OF HOME INS URANCE I N CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES, FOR CERTAIN RISKS, WILL GO UP. THOS E R ISKS ARE D RIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU SEE THAT IN CALIFORNIA, AS RECENTLY AS 2017. WE HA VE SOM E DATA THAT T HERE WAS A 50% D IFFE RE NCE IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS. SOME HOMES ARE PAYING 350% MORE FOR INSURAN CE IF THERE FA CING A HIGH FIRE R ISK. THE DEPARTM ENT OF INSURANCE SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE HAD 10 0 RATE FILINGS THIS YEAR. THOSE WILL BE APPROVED IN ALL LIKE LIHOOD BECAUSE OF THE JUSTIFI CATION DUE TO EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES IN 2 017. WE ARE SEEING AN A VAILABILITY PROBLEM AS WELL. AT SO ME POINT, THIS APPLIE S BRO ADLY TO ALL INSU RANCE, IF THE RISK IS SO EXTREME THAT THERE ISN'T A PRICE THA T THE INSURER CAN'T ACCEPT IN O RDER TO COVER THAT RISK, AND W E HAVE SEEN THAT WITH F LOOD INSUR ANCE IN THIS COU NTRY. 50 YEARS AG O OR SO, HOME INSURERS STOPPED WRITING FOR THOSE R ISKS. STAN DARD HO ME POLICI ES DO NOT HAVE THAT. WE ARE HEAR ING THA T IS BEGINNING TO HAVE AN IMPACT I N REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN THOSE AREAS. WE D ON'T HA VE DATA ON THAT YET, BUT TH E IMPLICATION IS THERE. AS T HE PRICE GOES UP, IT BECOMES DIF FICULT FOR THOSE ON FIXED INCOM ES AND SOME LOWER INCOMES TO AFFORD INSURANCE. THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR A BILITY TO HAVE INSURANCE. THAT MEANS THEY MAY GO WITHOUT INSURANCE, SO IF A CATASTROPHIC EVENT OCCUR S, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FALL BAC K ON TO HELP RECOVER. AL L OF THOSE ARE CONSEQUENCE S OF CLIMATE- DRIVEN RISK THAT P LAY OUT THROUGH THE INSURANCE S ECTOR. REP . ROUDA: ALON G THOSE LINES, MR. GOMEZ, NOT LONG AGO, I WAS IN MIAMI AND SAW A NEIGHBORH OO D WHERE THE G ROUNDWATER WAS COMING UP AND CAUSING FLOODING ON AN AVERAGE SUNNY DAY. THE IM PLICATION S FROM FLOOD INSUR ANCE, FROM THE MARKETA BILI TY OF THESE PROPE RTIES, YOU START TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF WH AT COULD OCCUR IN MA NY MUNICI PAL AREAS AROUND THE COUNTRY . CA N YOU SPE AK A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT THE EC ONOMIC IMPACT WOULD BE IF WE SE E A DETERIORATION OF THE REAL ES TATE MARKET IN MANY PARTS OF OU R COUNTRY? MR . JONES: FROM THE STUDY WE LOOKED A T, THERE ARE SOME REGION S OF THE COUNTRY LIKE THE CO ASTAL REGIONS, THEY WILL HAVE HIGH E CONOMIC IMPACTS, PRIMARILY D UE TO FLOODING AND SEA LEVEL R ISE. WE'RE SEEING THAT FROM THE ST UDIES THAT ARE TE LLING US THAT. REALLY, I T HINK AS MERE BENJAMIN NO TED, IT IS THE LOCAL FOLKS THAT ARE SEEING THE IMPACTS BEC AUSE THAT IS WHAT IS TAKING P LACE. FROM THE FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE , IT IS UP TO US TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ASSI ST THAT AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE, WHETHER IT IS THROUGH INFORMATION, HELPING THE M INTERPRET AND TRANSLA TE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY C AN USE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS, WHETHER IT IS TO BUILD A SEA WALL HIGHER , OR BUILDING CODES AND STANDARDS. THERE ARE MANY OP PORTUNITIES FOR THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT AND WE RECOMMEN DED MANY THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT CAN DO TO HELP STATE AND LOCALS. REP . ROUDA: LET' S TAKE THIS S TEP FURTHER. WH AT HAPPEN S IF DUE TO SOME OF THESE EVENT S, LIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN CALIFORN IA WITH THE WILDFIRES WHERE YOU H AVE AN APOCALYPTIC EVENT AND M ANY PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOMES . OFTE N THE F EDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A BACKSTOP FO R THOSE SITUATIONS. IS THERE A CON CERN WE MAY COME TO A DAY WHERE THERE'S SO MANY CATACLYSMIC EVENTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT WON'T BE IN A POSITI ON, O R UNWILLING TO BE IN A POS ITION TO BACKSTOP THOSE SITUATIONS? MR. JONES: THAT IS A GOOD QUESTI ON. A GAIN WE HAVE MANY AREAS WE PL ACE ON THE HIGH RISK LIST, AREAS WE WANT TO BRING ATTEN TION, AND ONE OF THE AREAS T HAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS TH E NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE P ROGRAM. IT HAS ITS OWN HIGH RISK DESIGN ATION BECAUSE THAT PROGRA M AND THE CROP INSURANCE PROGRAM WER E NOT DESIGNED TO GENERATE EN OUGH REVENUES TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSE S. I NOTED THE NATIONAL FL OOD INSUR ANCE P ROGRAM, THEY OWE THE TRE ASURY ONE $1 BILLION ALREADY. CO NGRESS WROTE OFF AN AMOUNT RECE NTLY. T HESE ARE EXPOSUR ES THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT FACES AND T HEY ARE UNSUSTAINAB LE. REP. ROUDA: MAYOR BENJAMIN, I WANT TO C IRCLE B ACK TO A COUPLE OF C OMMENTS FR OM YOUR NARRATIVE. YOU TALK AB OUT HOW YOU PREPARE AND PLAN FO R CLIMATE CHA NGE-RELA TED EVENTS. HELP ME UND ERSTAND THAT. WHAT DO YOU AND YOUR CITY COUNCI L, HO W DO YOU BUDGET AND PLAN TO ADDRESS FUTURE CLIMATE CHA NGE-RELATED EVENTS IN YOUR CIT Y? MAYOR BENJAMIN: SURE. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. W ITH INCREASED FOCUS ON RESILIEN CY AND MITIGATION, WE RUN A TI GHT SHIP FISCALLY. W E FINISHED THE LAST NINE Y EARS WITH A BALANCED BUDGET. WE HAVE CLEAN BOOKS. WE R ECOGNIZE THAT A SMART INV ES TMENT IN INFRASTR UCTURE, THAT NOW BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE WE ALSO HAV E TO INVEST IN R ESILIENCY AND MITIGAT ION, AND THINKIN G LONG-TERM, THE COST OF THA T DEB T. ALL OF THE COSTS HAVE TO BE BORNE BY OUR TAXP AYERS AND RATE PAYERS . WE DECIDED AND WE VOTED UNANI MOUSLY ON THIS INV EST MENT ADDRESSING THE TOP FLOODING AR EAS IN OUR CITY, BUT THE CONSTAN T INVESTMENT OVER THE LAST SIX YE ARS, WE HAVE INVESTED $750 MILLION IN WATER AND SEWER INFRA STRUCT URE PROTECTING OUR THREE R IVER S, BUT IT HAS GOTTEN MORE EXPENSIVE AS WE BUILD IN THE COST OF RESILIENCY AND MITIGAT ION. WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS DECISIONS M ADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MITIGATE SOME OF THO SE COSTS. I ME NTIONED T HE BLOCK GRANT . IT IS A SIG NIFICANT OPPORTUNITY . WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE PROGRAM AND TARGET INVE STMENTS IN CLIMATE INFRASTRUCT URE, BEING A SMART MOVE. CERTA INLY, ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALL ENGES WE FACE IS THE ROLE THAT M UNICIPAL B ONDS ALLOW US TO MAKE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCT URE IN WATER, SEWER, STORM WATER . MOST OF THA T INVESTMENT IS BORNE BY LO CAL GOVER NMENTS. NOT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EVERY SINGL E DECISION WE MAKE SIN CE 2015, CERTAINLY INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL COST THAT WILL H AVE T O BE BORRO WED OV ER SOME TIME AFFECT ING LOCAL GOVER NMENTS. THAT IS DRI VING THE ECONOMIC EX PERIMENT. IT WILL BE WONDERFU L TO FIND CREATI VE WAYS AND LAID OU T IN OUR STAT EMENT. WE WOULD LIKE TO REP ATRIATE SOME OF THOSE DOLLA RS BACK HOME TO MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS . REP. ROUDA: IT WOULD BE HE LPFUL TO HAVE LEADERSHIP FROM WASHIN GTON, D.C. RECOGN IZING, NOT JUST TH E IMPACT AND SERIOUSNESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT WORKING TO PASS INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS THAT CAN HELP LOCAL MUNIC IPALITIES AND STATES BETTER ADDR ESS THESE ISSUES? MAY OR BENJA MIN: ABSOLUTELY. SINCE 2005, THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT SPENT OVER 400,00 0 , $400 BILLION IN RELIEF FUNDING. IF WE HAD THAT IN VESTMENT ON THE FRONT END, IT WOU LD BE AMAZING WE COULD DO TO MITIG ATE DAMAGES. REP. ROUDA: DR. GREENSTONE, AND OTHERS CAN WEIGH I N ON THIS AS WELL, MY UNDERSTA NDING IS WALL STREET IS LOOKING MORE AND MORE AT PRI CING IN THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE INTO THE PRICING OF BONDS. I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE COME ACROSS A TY PE OF INFORMATION AS WELL BEC AUSE ULTIMATELY, AS MERE , AS THE MAYO R T ALKED A MINUTE ABOU T THE GREEN BONDS THAT HIS CITY HAS ISSUE, IF THERE IS ADDITION AL 25 BASIS POINT S THAT HAVE TO BE PRICED INTO BONDS AT THE MUNI CIPAL LEVEL, THE PRICING MIG HT DICTATE BASED ON TH E GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, T HAT IS A COST THAT IS PASSED O NTO THE CITIZEN S OF THOSE AR EAS, SO DR. GREENST ONE, WOULD YOU L IKE TO TALK ABO UT THAT, AND M R. GOMEZ, AS W ELL? DR. G REENSTONE: THANK YOU, MR. CH AIRMAN. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE. WE ARE NOT DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT WE S HOULD HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE ANYM ORE. WE NOW HAVE IT. AND THE IMPACTS ON MITIGATED C LIMATE CHA NGE ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW UP. TH E MAYOR WAS T ALKING ABOUT THE WAYS IT IMP ACTS A FUNCTIONAL CITY AND YO U POINTED OUT HOW IT SHOWING UP IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. IM PORTANTLY , IT SHOWING UP IN INSURANCE RATES, AS M R. JONES HIGHLIGHTED, AND THAT IS CAUSING PEO PLE TO M AKE DIFFERENT D ECISIONS. NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING RECOGNITION OF WALL STR EET, AND IT IS SHOWING UP IN BOND PRICES AND WILL SHOW U P IN OTHER ASSET CLASS ES AS WELL. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPACT SHOW ING UP VERSUS P OLICY SENDING A CLEAR SIG NA L, WHICH WOULD ALSO AFFECT MARKETS. TH AT WOULD AFFECT MARK ETS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IT WO ULD REDUC E IN MISSIONS , EMISSIONS T HAT ARE OC CURRING, WHEREAS THE PRICES YOU ARE POINTING TO ARE ALL MORE SENDING SIGNALS FOR HOW PEO PLE SHOULD ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND TREAT IT AS IF IT CA NNOT BE CHANGED, BUT SENDING A PRICE SIG NA L WOUL D ALSO AFFECT FINANCIAL MARKETS, AN D WILL BE VERY, VERY POWERF UL AT REDUCING THE AMOUNTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE. REP. ROUDA: MR. GOMEZ? MR. GOMEZ: I WO ULD AGREE WITH THAT. IN TH E INSURANCE S ECTOR, FOR EXAMPLE , WE'RE SEEIN G LOTS OF ACTIVITY IN THAT ARE A. ONE T HING I WAN TED TO MENTION IS YEARS AG O, OUR CO MPTROLLER GENERAL CON VENED A FORUM OF PRIVATE- SEC TOR COMPANIES TO TALK ABOUT THE A DAPTATION SIDE, WHAT WERE THEY D OING TO DO WITH THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT IS REAL. THIS IS A V ARIETY OF PRIVATE-SEC TOR COMPANIES. WE HAD OIL AND GAS, FOOD AND BEVERAG E, INSURANCE COMPANIES, ALL TALKING ABOUT THE KINDS OF TH INGS THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE THE Y WERE ALREADY SEEING THE IMPACTS , WH ETHER IT WAS OIL AND GAS, OR FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPANIES F IGURING OUT WHERE THE M ATERIALS WERE COMING FROM. IT WA S REAL LY TO SHOW HOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN REACTI NG TO THESE IMPACTS. TH AT IS WHAT WE SHOWED I N THAT REPORT. REP . ROUDA: MR. JONES? MR. JONES: THE STABILI TY BOARD IN 20 16 CONCLUDED THAT CLIMAT E CHA NGE POSES A RIS K TO THE FINANCI AL S YSTEM, AND IT WAS LED BY THE PRIV ATE SECTOR WHIC H ISSUED A RE PORT IN 2017 SAID WITH REGARD TO W HAT THEY SHOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO EXPOSURE, T HAT IS NOT HAPPENING SUFFICIENTL Y. SECOND THEY RECOMM ENDED THAT THE FINANCIAL S ECTOR UNDERTAKES STRESS TEST ING AND ANALYSIS OF ITS PORT FOLIOS TO TEST THE ROBUSTN ESS OF PHYSICAL TR ANSITION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMAT E CHANGE. THA T IS NOT HAPPENING WITH SUFFIC IENT UPTAKE. ANOTHER CHALLENGE W E HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL R EGULATORS, INCLUDING CENTRAL BAN K REGULATORS LIKE THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND OTHERS, OR TAKING O F , ARE T AKING UP T HESE RE GULATIONS. BLACKROCK I SSUED A REPORT IN MARCH OR APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THEY UNDERT OOK TO LOOK AT THE AT THRE E REGULATORS AND WERE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN T HE DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL RISKS OF THE ASSE TS UNDERLYING IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS AND THERE WAS WIDE VARIANCE. T HE UTILITY ON THE COASTS IS FACING E XTR EME RISKS OF FLOODING , I NLAND, NOT SO MUCH, BUT Y ET, TH E FISCAL RISKS WERE NOT BO RNE O UT IN ANY DISCERNIBLE PRICE DIFFE RENTIATION IN EACH OF THO SE THREE SECTORS. TH AT IS A B IG PROBLEM. CE RTAINLY, THE NATURE CONS ERVANCY SUPPORTS A CARBON PRIC E, A CA RBON TAX, MECHANISM T O ADOPT THAT, BUT CLIMATE CHA NGE IS ALREADY BAKED INTO OUR SY STEM. PHY SICAL IMPACTS ARE ALREADY OCC URRING. AND THOSE RISKS OF THOSE IM PACTS ARE NOT BEING BORN OUT WI TH FINANC IAL MARKETS AND THAT HA S TO DO WITH THE LACK OF DISCLOSU RE, A LACK OF A NALYSIS. T HE RATING AGENCIES AR E BEGINNI NG TO TAKE ON CAP ACITY TO LOOK AT THESE IM PACTS, BU T THEY ARE YET TO MAINSTRE AM THEIR RATIN GS INTO CORE, FINAN CIAL RATINGS. TH ERE HAS BEEN A LARG E CLOUD CAST OVER W HETHER THE FILING SHOULD INCLUDE THESE RISKS , AND THAT IS A HUGE MISTAK E. TH ERE IS ANOTHER SET OF RISKS WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT YET, WHAT ARE TR ANSITION RISKS, WHICH ARE ASSOCIA TED WITH MARKET S, TECHNOLOGIES, AND GOVERNM ENTS MOVING AWAY FROM A FOSSIL FUEL-BASED ECONOMY. TH AT IS WHE RE WE NEED TO GO. THAT POSES A RISK FOR ASSET IN THE ECONOMY THA T ARE LARGELY GREENHOUSE GAS-EMITTIN G. THAT POSES A RIS K FOR INVESTO RS T HAT IS ANOTHER KIND OF RISK THA N INVESTORS NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AN INSURANCE C OMPANIES N EED TO BE LOOKI NG AT. SO WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE WITH REGARD TO THE FINA NCIAL RISKS. THIS IS A B IG AREA OF EXPOSURE. R EP. ROUDA: WHILE YOU HAVE THE MI CROPHONE, ALLOW ME TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION AS WELL. THERE HAS BEEN A FEW ONGOING BAT TLES BETWEEN THE TRUMP ADMIN ISTRATION AND THE STA TE OF CALIFORN IA, ONE HAS BEEN OV ER THE TA ILPIPE EMISSIONS, WHERE CALIF ORNIA HAS HAD THE ABI LITY TO DEMAND H IGHER STANDARDS FROM AUTO M ANUFACTURERS, WHICH 13 OT HER STATES AND THE COUNTRY OF CANADA FOLLOW AS WELL. AND T HE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING T O O VERTURN CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT AS WE LL AS THOSE OTHER STATE S, AND CANADA CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION. WHAT IS THE IMPACT FOR NOT JUS T THE PEOPLE IN THOSE STATES, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH THE INCREASED P OLLUTION WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT, IF THAT IS ENACTED? MR . JONES: THE IMPACTS ARE NEGATIV E AND MULTIPL E. O NE IMPACT IS MORE EMISSIONS G ENERALLY W ITH THE RELATED HEALTH EFFE CTS. A SIZABLE P ORTION OF WHAT CAL IFORNIA IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH THOSE STANDARDS IS A SIGNIF ICANT REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORT S ECTORS. SO UNDERCUT TING CALIFORNIA' S ABILITY TO ADMINISTER A SEPARATE ST ANDARD WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE BATT LE AGAINST GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIO NS. REP. ROUDA: IT IS WORTH NO TING FOR THE PUBLIC, 40% OF THE IMPORTS OF THE UNITED STAT ES THAT COME IN BY SHIP COM E IN BY LOS ANGE LES AND LONG BEACH PORTS. 25% OF OUR EXPORTS GO OUT. CAL IFO RNIA WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR AND SET APPROPRIATE LEVELS FOR ADMISSI ONS, IF THOSE GO ODS REACH ALL O F THE DISTRICTS I N THE U.S. DR. GR EENSTONE, WOULD YOU L IKE TO COMMENT? DR . GREENSTONE: I APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS TOO FAR AFI ELD, BUT THIS IS A T ERRIFIC EX AMPLE OF WHAT I THINK IS A HODGEP ODGE APPROACH RE GULATING CO2. THE TE XTBOO K SOLUTION TO THIS, WHICH THE B ILL REFLECTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMY WIDE PRICE ON CARBON. INS TEAD, WE HAD THESE KIND OF SECTOR B Y S ECTOR THINGS THAT DON'T DIREC TLY TARGET CARBON. AND IN THE CASE OF CAFE, WE ARE GETT ING REDUCTIONS OF CO2 AT THE COST OF $100 TO $200 PER TON. IF IF INSTE AD, WE WERE ABLE TO RELY ON CLEAR PRICE SIGNALS. I THINK THERE ARE REDUCTI ONS OF COT AVAILABLE THAT COST $ 10 OR $15 PER TON. WE ARE PAYI NG 10 TIMES WHAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR USI NG A MORE DIRE CT MECHANISM. REP. ROUDA: VOTES ARE A BOUT TO BE CALLE D AND I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORT UNITY TO ASK ALL FOUR OF YOU, IS THERE ANYTHING EL SE YOU WOULD L IKE TO ADD? OFT EN, IN THESE HEARI NGS AND BRIEFIN GS, YOU HEAR SO MEBODY EL SE SAY SOMETHI NG OR QUESTION WAS ASKED THAT YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO, SO THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO JUMP IN AND FILL IN ANY HOLE S YOU MIGHT'V E SEEN. >> GE RMAN. >> I AM WELL A WARE OF PU SHING CAR BON PRICES, WHICH YOUR BILL D OES, THE P OLITIC S OF THAT ARE COMPLICATED , AND ONE KEY PICKUP IN THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN ABOUT DISTR IBUTIONAL ISSUES AND WHAT WILL H APPEN UNTIL LOWER MIDDL E-CLAS S FAMILIES. I WANT TO HIG HLIGHT ONE THING. THE CARBON TAX CREATES REVENUE THA T CAN BE DIRECTLY REFUNDED TO CONSUMER S AND CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE STANDING OF LOW AND MIDDLE INCO ME CLASS FAMILIES. W HILE OFTEN THAT IS BROUGHT UP, I THINK THAT IS NOT A TRUE IMPEDI MENT. REP. ROUDA: THE DIVIDEND PORTION OF THAT LEGISLATION, THANK YOU. MR. JO NES? MR. JONES: WE WOULD LI KE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADER SHIP, MR. CHAIRMAN, A ND THANK THE COMMITT EE FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT SERIES OF H EARINGS. W E URGE YOU, AS YOU HAVE HISTOR ICALLY, TO CONSIDER NATURAL CLIMATE AND NATURAL-BASED SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I U RGE YOU TO CONSIDER DELVING INT O THE PO TENTIAL RISK TO THE FINANCI AL S YSTEM THAT WE TAL KED A BOUT EARLI ER. THERE IS ONE BRIG HT SPOT AMONG U.S. FINANC IAL REGULATORS, AND THAT IS THE INTEREST TRAINING , TRADING COMMISSION. THEY HAVE E STABLISHED A SUBCOMMIT TEE CLIMATE RISK AND WILL BE MAKING A RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARD TO ALL U.S. FINANC IAL REGULATORS AS TO WHAT STEPS THEY SHOULD BE TAKING TO ADDRESSE D T HE RISK. FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO INSURANCE. INSURANCE IS A VERY I MPORTANT MECHANISM TO HELP MAN AGE RISK AND TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIE S AND INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINES SES RECOVER FROM CATAST ROPHIC EVENTS. BUT IF WE DON'T DRAMATICALL Y AND QUICKLY REDUCE THE UNDERLY ING DRIVER OF THAT RISK, INSUR ANCE WILL NOT SOLVE THESE PROBL EMS. REP. ROUDA: THANK YOU. MR. GO MEZ? MR. GOMEZ: MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO THA NK YOU FOR BRI NGING AT TENTION TO OUR WORK . REP. ROUDA: THAN K YOU. AGAIN, WHILE WE WE RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL HEARING, I CANNOT THAN K EACH OF YOU ENOUGH FOR ATTENDI NG A ND PROVIDI NG YOUR COMMEN TS. AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WITH THE ADDITIO NAL HEARINGS ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHA NGE, AND WEIGHING OUT ONE OF TWO ROADS WE ARE FACE D W ITH, OUR HOPE IS TO PROVIDE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW W E CAN ACHIEVE A R OAD THAT R EDUCES THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WHA T ARE THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WE CAN PULL OUT AND MAK E A DIFFERENCE? RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE TOOL THAT IS GOING TO AD DRESS THIS ISSUE, BUT IT WILL TAKE M ULTIPLE TOOLS TO ACCOMPLI SH THE OUTCOMES WE DESIRE. SO YOUR COMMEN TS HERE TODAY WILL BE APA RT OF THAT FINAL REPOR T THAT WE TAK E FORWARD. IN ADDITION , DON'T BE SURPRISE D IF WE MAY CALL ON YOU AGAIN TO ATTEND ANOTHER HEA RING DOWN THE ROAD, AND WE CERTAINL Y HOPE YOU WILL CO NSIDER PARTICIPATI NG IN DOING SO . FINALLY , ALONG THE L INES AS WELL, AS WE CONTI NUE TO UNDERSTA ND THE TRUE EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF C LIMATE CHANGE, WE NEED TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE TH OSE TOOLS , WHAT ARE THE EMERGIN G TE CHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP US IN OUR Q UEST? IF Y OU ARE AWARE OF EMERGING TE CHNOLOGIE S OR ECONOMIC TOOLS, INCE NTIVES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDER ED IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE US IN THE R IGHT DIRECTION, MOVE OUR COUNTRY IN THE RIGHT DIREC TION, PLEASE BRING THAT TO OUR COMM ITTEE'S ATTENTION.

FORE STS ARE A KEY A LLY, MAYBE EVEN THE KEY ALL Y IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BUT FORESTS NEED US TO BE THEIR AL LIES. WE CANNOT SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITHOUT PROTECTING FORESTS. FO RESTS ARE CLIMATE STABILIZING SYSTEMS. THEY REGULATE EC OSYSTEMS, PROVIDE HABITAT AND PROTECT BIODIVERSIT Y. THEY PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART IN CAR BON CYCLES. IN FACT, LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE AFFIRM ED THAT PROTECTING FORESTS AND RESTORING FORESTS ARE JUST AS IMP ORTANT AS ENDING FOSSIL FUEL USE. [APPLA USE] YOU SEE WHE N FORESTS ARE HEALTHY , THEY ABSORB THE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT WHEN TH EY'RE BURNED, IT RELEASES CO2 BACK IN TO THE ATMOSPH ERE AND THE FORESTS ARE BEING B URNED AND CLEARED TO MAKE WAY FOR DESTRUC TIVE AGRICULTURA L PRACTICES A ND TO GROW BIOFUELS AN D THAT AL SO RELEASES CO2 AND CLIMATE CHA NGE IS ACCELERATED AND OUR EXP ERTS ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN THI S IN MORE DETAIL, BUT IT'S TH IS S IMPLE, TO MAXIMIZE THE CLIMATE BENEFIT OF FORESTS, WE HAVE TO KEEP MORE FOREST LAND SCAPES INTACT, MANAGE FORE STS SUSTAINABLY, AND RESTORE THO SE THAT WE'VE LOST. AND W E MUST PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF I NDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND LOCAL T RADI TIONAL COMMUNITIES WHO LIVE IN AND DEPEND ON FORESTS. TH ERE ARE MANY, MANY STUDIES THA T SHOW THAT FORESTS ARE THE HEA LTHI EST WHEN THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENO US PEOPLE AND LOCAL C OMMUNITIES ARE HONORED AND RESPECTED. AND INSTEAD, THOSE COMMU NITIES ARE TOO OFTEN T HREATENED. IN BRAZIL BETW EEN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBE R OF THIS YEA R, SEVEN INDIG ENOUS LEADERS HAV E BEEN MURDERED AS THEY SEE K TO PROTECT FORESTS THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE. NO T ONLY IS THE AMAZON IS AT RISK, BU T THE ENT IRE , WHERE THERE IS ALSO PER SECUTION OF THE INDIANS. SO TO START US OFF TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO HA VE HANNAH HEINEKEN.

PLE ASE WELCOME HANNAH HEIN EKEN. > > HI, EVERYONE, HOW ARE YOU DOING T ODAY? SO I JUST WANTED TO START WI TH A QUOTE FRO M GRETA, SOME OF YOU SAW THE SPEECH YESTERDAY, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT T O REMIND OURS ELVES THAT OUR HO USE IS ON FIRE, RIGHT? MY H OME STATE OF CA LIFORNIA THIS YEAR, 250,000 ACRES BURNE D. FORTUNATELY, MY HOUSE DI DN'T BURN , BUT A LOT O F PEOPLE SUFFERED AND THAT'S JUST A SMALL SEGMENT OF WHAT HAP PENED THIS YEAR. RIGHT ? IN T HE AMAZ ON, INDONESIA, CONGO, AUSTRALIA. THE ARCTIC, RIGHT? MILLIONS OF ACRES HAVE BURNED. BIL LIONS OF TONS OF CO2 HAVE BEEN R ELEAS ED. T HIS IS UNPRECEDENT ED. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? WHY IS OUR PLANET BEING DESTR OYED LIKE THIS? IT AL L COMES DOWN TO CORPORATE G REED. SO T HE EARTH IS SENDING US AN IMPOR TAN T MESSAGE. IT 'S SENDING US A MESSAGE T HAT WE NEE D TO CHANGE THE WAY WE EXIST ON THIS PLANET. TOO MANY COMPANIES RIGHT NOW A RE UNWILLI NG TO CHANGE THEI R BUSINESS AS USUAL. BANK S AND INVESTORS CONTINUE TO POUR MON EY, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INT O FOSSIL FUELS AND T ROPICAL DE FORESTATION, EVEN WHEN T HEY KNOW I T IS DESTROYI NG THE PLANET, AND IT'S HA RMING PEOPLE. COM PANIES ARE BUYING PRODUCTS, N OT KNOWING THE ACTUAL , OR NEGLECTI NG THE ACTUAL IMPACT IT IS HAVIN G ON F ORESTS, ON BIODIVER SIT Y, AND PEOPLE. THE BRANDS AND BANKS ARE WILLING TO BE COMPLICIT BECAUSE IT'S PROFIT ABLE AND THEY'RE WILLING TO VIOLATE INDIGENOUS RIGHTS, EVE N WHEN IT'S CLEAR AS JANE SAID T HAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECT IVE WAYS TO STOP DEFORE STATION BECAUSE THEY ARE AM AZING STEWARDS OF THE FOREST AND THE LAND. SO TH IS IS UNACCEPTABL E. THIS IS IMMORAL. TH IS IS UNSUSTAINAB LE. IT IS RUINING THE ONLY HO ME WE HAVE. AN D W E NEED TO STAND UP AN D REJECT THE STATUS QUO. SO I G REW UP IN JAPAN. T HAT'S WHY ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES IS THE JAPANES E MARKET AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRACTICE TH ERE CALLED FORE ST BATHING? AN D IT COME S FROM THE RECOGNI TION THAT FORESTS ARE AMAZING HEA LERS RIGHT? THEY HEAL T HE HUMAN BODY, BUT THEN WE ALL KNOW THEY'RE ALSO THE HA BITAT FOR ESPECIALLY , RAIN FOREST S ARE THE HABITATS OF THE MAJO RITY OF LAND BASED BIODI VERSIT Y. THEY'RE THE HOMES OF AL L THESE INDIG ENOUS PEOPLE. NOT ONLY THAT THEY ABSORB IMME NSE AMOUNTS OF CARBON, THE Y REGULATE RAINFALL, THEY PRODUC E OXYGEN. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OU T , THEY'RE INC REDIBLY IMPORTANT T O THE PLAN ET AND TO THE CARBON STORAGE, BUT PAPER AND P ALM OIL THAT CO MES FROM INDONESIA, IT'S MOST L IKELY LINKED TO PEATLAND DE STRUCTION . COMPANIES ARE DESTROY ING THESE FORES TS, RELEASING A LOT OF CA RBON I NTO THE ATMOSPH ERE AND MEANWHI LE DESTROYING ONE OF THE MOST EF FECTIVE WAYS WE HAV E TO STORE TH E CARBON, RIGHT? THIS IS NONSENSI CAL . SO WE NEED TO STAND UP AGAINST THE SE CORPORATION S. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR INDIGEN OUS FRIENDS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES DEFEN SE THESE COMPA NIES. WE NEED TO KEEP THE FORESTS STA NDING. W E NEED TO KEEP THE FOSSIL FUELS IN TH E GROU ND AND WE NEED TO UPHOLD H UMA N RIGHTS. ESP ECIALLY THE RIGHTS OF THE LOCAL A ND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FIGHTING THIS FIGHT TO SAVE THE FORESTS. AND JUST ON E THING ON THE BANK, YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS LATER. THEY 'RE BAD ON FORESTS TOO, RIGHT? SO A LOT OF THESE BANKS LIKE J.P. M ORGAN CHASE AND I DON'T KNO W HOW MANY OF YOU ARE FROM CA LIFORNIA, UNION BANKS, UNIO N BANK IS OWNED BY A JAPANESE COMPANY. TH EY'RE ONE OF THE WORS T FINAN CEERS OF PALM OIL AND PAPER. LOOK AT WHAT YOUR B ANK IS DOING AND YOU CAN MOVE YO UR MONEY AND WE CAN CHANGE THE STATUS QUO. LET'S DO THIS TOG ETHER. > > THE DIVESTM ENT MOVEMENT HAS BEEN UN BELI EVABLY SUCCESSFUL. ALREADY WE' VE TAKEN $11 TRILLION OU T OF BANK S THAT ARE UNDERWR ITIN G FOSSIL FUEL EXPANS ION. SO IF WE KEEP DOING THAT, IT CA N REALLY WE EFFECTIVE. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS A SENIOR FO RE ST AND LAND COMPARISON AT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH UNITED STAT ES. HE ADVOCATES FOR INVESTO RS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION S TO STOP FINANC ING CLIMATE CHAOS THROUGH DEF ORESTATION, LAND GRABBI NG AND HUMAN R IGHTS ABUSES. HE WORKS TOWARDS THE RECOGNI TION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND LOCAL COMMU NITIES AND LAND RI GHTS. PLEASE WELCOME. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WAN T TO TALK A LITT LE BIT ABOUT WHY WE ARE HERE TO DAY. WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE FACING A CRISIS. DEF ORESTATION AFTER FOSSI L FUEL EMISSI ONS IS THE SECO ND LARGEST CON TRIBUTOR TO THE GREE NHOUSE GASES RESPO NSIBLE FOR THE CLIMATE CRI SIS. WE KNOW WHA T WE MUST DO. WE MUST PHASE OUT OIL, GAS AND COAL AND MAKE FO SSIL FUELS INDUS TRIES OF THE PAST, BUT WE ALSO MUS T P ROTECT THE WORLD'S FOR ESTS. TH EY GO HAN D IN HAND. IF WE DO NOT DO ONE, WE WILL NOT SUCCEED . IF WE DO NOT DO BOTH WE WILL NOT SUCCEED IN MITIGATING THE WORST E FFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT PROTECTI NG THE WORLD'S FORESTS, WE'VE JUST HEARD HOW THEY SEQUESTER B ILLIONS OF TONS OF CARBON FOR THE PLA NET. BUT THEY ARE ALSO HOME TO IND IGENOUS AND LOCAL COMMU NITIES AND ALSO COUNTLESS S PECIES OF WILDLIFE . T HE REALITY IS THE CLIM ATE CRI SIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF INTE RSEC TING AND OVERLAP PING CRISES THAT WE'RE FACIN G TODAY. DEFORESTATION IS NOT ONLY FUELING CLIMATE CRISIS; IT IS ACTUA LLY FUELING UNPRECEDENTED SPECIES EXT INCTION AND GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORLD'S FORESTS ARE AT THE EPICENT ER OF THESE IN TERSECTIN G AND OVERLAM MING CRISES. WHE N WE LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE MAIN DR IVERS OF DEFOREST ATION IN THE WORLD? IT I S THE DEVELOP MENT OF INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURA L COMMODITIES. THAT IS COM MODITIES LIKE PALM OIL, PULP AND PA PER, SOY, AND CATTLE. THE SE FOUR COMMOD ITIES ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 80% OF DEFORESTATI ON AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE TEN S OF THOUSANDS OF CONSUMER GO ODS YOU AND I AND ALL OF US B UY A ND AT THE FRONT LINES OF IN DUSTRI AL AGRICULTURA L COMMODITY E XPANSION TO GROW THESE COMMO DITIES TO PRODUCE THE M REQUIR ES HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND S O F HECTARES OF LAND, OF FO RESTS THAT ARE CLEAR AND CUT DOW N AND THAT ARE HOME TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND COUNTLESS SPECIES. AT THE FRONTED LINES OF TH IS INDUST RIAL AGRICULTURA L PRODUCTION ARE LOCAL, OFTE N INDIG ENOUS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RI GHT N OW FACING A GLOBAL EPID EMIC OF VIOLENCE AND MURDER. JUS T LAST YEAR IN 2018, TH REE LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENDERS W ERE MURDERED EVERY SINGL E WEEK FOR DE FENDING THEIR TRADI TIONAL LANDSEN. IM AGINE THAT. THREE PEOPLE KILLED EVERY SINGLE WEEK FOR DEFENDING WHAT IS THEIRS, FOR DEFENDING THEIR WAY OF LIFE, TH EIR FAMILY AND THEIR FUTURE. AND AGRI BUSINESS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DEADLIEST SECTORS FOR COMMUNI TIES AROUND THE WORLD. I TH INK WE CA N BEST PICTURE THIS AND WE HAVE SEE N THIS WITH THE CRISIS THAT HAS BE EN GOING ON IN THE AMAZ ON. THI S PAST Y EAR WE HAVE SEEN THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST BURN AT THE HANDS OF BR AZIL'S REGIME. WE HAVE SEE N THE AMAZON KNOWN AS THE LUNG S OF THE EARTH SET FIRE FOR THESE V ERY COMMODITIES, FOR THE SOY SEC TOR AND CATTLE SECT OR. HUN DREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HECTACRE S BURNED TO THE GROUND TO P RODUCE THESE PRODUCTS. AND THIS PR OBLEM IS NOT LIMITED TO SOUTH AM ERICA. WE SEE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD'S FOREST JUST AS WE HEARD FROM INDONESIA TO LIBERIA TO BRAZIL. SO WHO IS FUNDING THIS? WHO I S ENABLING THIS TO HIP? THE SE ARE THE VERY BANKS AND I NVESTO RS WE HEARD ABOUT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY FINANCING R AIN FOREST DESTRUCTION . IT IS THE SAME BA NKS AND INVESTORS THAT ARE ALSO FI NANCING THE OIL, COAL AND GA S INDUSTRIES. WE WERE JUST OUT HE RE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, MANY O F US HERE, WE WERE WITH AUNTIE JANE, AND SHUT DOWN D.C. AND WE TOOK THIS MESSAGE TO BLACK ROCK AND MATTER OF BANKS AND I NVESTORS RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGT ON, D.C. AND I WANT TO TALK ABO UT BLACK ROCK FOR A SECOND. B LACK ROCK IS THE LARGEST WALL STREET INVESTOR, T HE LARGEST INVESTOR ON THE PLAN ET. NOW, WE KNOW WAL L STREET HAS ALREADY WRECKED OUR ECONOMY. WE SEE DAY IN AND DAY OUT HOW WALL STREET IS C ORRUPTING OUR DEMOCRA CY B Y FUNNELING DIRTY MONEY INTO OUR ELECTIONS AND NOW, WE ARE SEEING CLEARLY, CRYSTAL CLE ARLY HOW WALL STREET IS FUELING CLIMATE DISASTER. N OW, BLACK ROCK, LIKE I SAID, IS TH E LARG EST FINANCIER ON THE PLANET, THE LARGEST INVESTOR. T HEY ARE THE LARGEST INVESTOR IN OIL PIPELINES, THE LARGEST INV ESTOR IN GAS POWER PLANTS AND THE LAR GEST INVESTOR IN COAL MINES, BUT IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH OF THEY'RE NOT ONLY THE LARGEST INVESTOR IN FOSSIL FUELS, THEY ARE THE LARGEST INV ESTOR IN RAIN FOREST DEST RUCTION ON THE PLANET. THE Y ARE LITERALLY FUELING AND FINANCING CLIMATE CRISIS AND I WANT TO P OINT OUT A LITTLE THIN G ABOUT BLACK ROCK'S HYPOCRISY B ECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'RE A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTOR, B UT THE REALITY IS THIS IS STRAIGHT HYPOCRISY. THEY ARE PUMPING ALL OF OUR MONEY I NTO DESTROYING OUR PLANET. AND SO WHEN WE THINK AB OUT BLACK ROCK, I MEAN, YOU C AN SEE THIS HYPOCRISY THERE, THE BIGGEST NAME IN THIS COUNTR Y THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT'S F UELING CLI MATE AS FAR AS. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR VO TING RECO RD WHEN IT COM ES TO SHARE HOLDE R RESOLUTIONS , ON CLIMATE THEY VOTE WITH M ANAGEMENT 90% OF THE TIME . THEY ONLY SUPPOR T 10% OF SHAREHOL DER REGULATIONS. WHEN IT COM ES TO HUMAN RIGHTS IT'S EVEN W ORSE. THEY VOTED LAST YEAR FOR 0% OF HUMAN RIGHT S RESOLUTIONS. AND SO WE K NOW WE ARE HERE TODAY, WE H AVE TO HOLD OUR ELECTED OFF ICIALS AUTOMOBILE. WE ALSO HAV E TO HOLD THE FINANCIAL S ECTOR ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROTECTING OUR PLANET AND DOING THE RIGHT T HING. [APPLAUSE] SO I WANT T O CLOSE ON A PERSONAL NOTE. >> WE ARE ALL HERE FIRST IN SOLIDARI TY ON THE FRONT LINES OF TH IS GLOBAL EXPANSION OF AGRICULT URAL COMMODITY WHO ARE RESISTI NG DAY IN AND DAY OUT THE TAKEOVE R OF THEIR LAND. WE AR E IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR SI STERS AND BROTHERS IN THE MIDWEST WHO ARE FIGHTING THE EXPANSI ON OF PIPELINES AND WE STAN D HE RE WITH ONE ANOTHER, BU T WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE, YOU KNOW, THIS SPRING I WI LL BE WELCOMING MY FIRST CHILD INTO THIS WORLD AND I THINK THAT MAKES THAT A LITTLE MORE URGENT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE F UTURE I WANT HER TO GROW UP IN, THE FUTURE FOR HER TO HAVE . IT SHOULD BE ONE WHER E EVERYONE IS TREATED WITH DIGNIT Y AND WE HAVE A S AFE AND LIVABLE PLANET.

THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS ESTIMAT ED THAT CRIMINAL CARTELS CON TROL SOM EWHERE AROUND 80% OF THE COUNTRY IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE L OWER ESTIMATES. EVEN IF YOU GO L OWER, THE FACT TH AT CRIMINAL CARTELS ARE CONTROL LING ANY PART OF MEXICO SHOULD BE C ONCERNING AND IT MAKE S EVERYTHING DANGEROUS. THAT IS A REASON BORDER PATROL AGEN T GET FRUSTRATED WITH POLITICIANS THAT SAY IT IS OK TO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.

YOU WRITE T HAT ALMOST EVER YONE HAS AN OPINION OF NATIONAL ISM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT IS. GUES T: A LO T OF PEOPLE THINK PATRIOTISM IS THE APPR OPRIATE WORD FOR EVERYTH ING GOOD ABOUT NATIONAL FE ELING OR NATIONAL LOYALTY AND NATIONALISM IS THE WORD FOR EV ERYTHING BAD ABOUT IT. THAT IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY TO LOOK AT IT OR THE CORRECT DEFINITION IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNIC AL. PATRIOTISM COMES FROM A LATIN WORD, SAME AS PATRIARC HY. LOYALTY TO YOUR OWN. N ATIONALLY IS A MORE SPECIFIC DO CTRINE TH AT THE SAME PE OPLE UNITED BY COMMON HIST ORY AND A COMMON LANGUAGE SH OULD GOVE RN A DI STINCT TERRITORY. IN A NUTSHE LL, THAT IS NATIONALISM . THAT WE SHO ULD BE INDEPENDENT AND SELF-GO VERNING. THIS IS THA T THE RO OT OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, THE INSIGHT THAT WE HAVE OUR OW N RIG HTS AND CLAIMS AND SHOULD BE A PART OF OUR OWN BRITISH EMP IRE. IT RUNS THR OUGHOUT EXAM , AL IS IN A HAMILTON, FDR, AND RE AGAN AS W ELL. A COUPLE KEY PROJECTS. ONE IS THAT WE SHO ULD HAVE A STRONG CAPA BLE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. HAMILTON IN WASHINGT ON BELIEVE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WILL COLLAPSE AND DISCRED IT THE WHOLE AMERICAN PROJECT AT THE OUTSET UNLE SS IT I S STRONGER AND MORE CAPABL E. LIMITED IS A WELL , A S WELL. WE SHOULD H AVE A STRONG MILI TARY, ESPECIALLY A NAVY, DUR ING IMPORTANT H AMILTONIAN PROJECTS.

YOU CAN HAV E AN ARG UMENT ABOUT WHAT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE IN A ND OUT. OUR BORDERS ARE VERY IM PORTANT AND WE SHOULD PROT ECT THEM.

HOST: YOU M AKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN AMERICAN AN D CIVIC N ATIO NALISM, ETHNIC NATIONALISM . WHAT DO THO SE TERMS MEAN? GUEST: CIVI C NATIONALISM IS USED FOR ANOTHER WORD FOR PA TRIOT ISM, QUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. ETHNIC NATU RAL , NATIONALISM IS THE BELIEF THAT A CERT AIN RACE OR TRIBE SH OULD GOVE RN OVER AND ABOVE ANY OTHER ETHNI CITIES . AMERICAN NATIONALISM MINISTRY FO RM IS DEE PER THAN JUST C IVIC NATIONALISM. THOUGH THAT IS A KEY PART OF THE AMER ICAN PROJECT. IT IS HIGHE R A ND ABOVE E THNIC NATIONALISM.

THIS IS NATIONALISM. HOST: YOU B ROUGHT UP A LOT OF TOPICS. GUEST: THE BASIC P REMISE OF THE CALLERS CON , COMM ENTS IS THAT OUR LAWS SHOULD GOVERN US AND NO O NE ELSE'S LAWS SHOULD. THIS GETS T O THE REASON WHY EMPIRES HAVE NEVER BEEN DEMOCR ATIC. A NATION IS T HE MOST NATION AL , NATURAL FOR M OF ORGANIZATION TO CREATE A SENSE OF UNITY TH AT WE ALL CAN LIVE TOGETHER UNDER THE S AME SET OF RULES AND LAWS. YOU HAVE VA RIOUS PEOPLES AND NATIONS AND PART OF A LARGER CORRECT , COLLECTION. THE CULTURE WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE LANG UAGE WILL BE DOMINANT. NO ONE ELSE IN THE EMPI RE WILL LIKE THIS.

GUEST: IT H AS BEEN IMPORTANT THROUGHOUT HISTORY THA T WE ASSIMILATE IMMIGRANTS. I THINK PEO PLE LOOK AT THE CLICHE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF I MMIGRANTS AND BELIEVE WE ALWAYS HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF IM MIGRATION. THAT IS NOT TRUE. IMMIG RATION LEVELS HAVE GONE UP AND DOWN . THE BARGAIN IS YOU COME HERE A ND EM BRACE OUR IDEALS AND ASSIMILATE INTO THE BROADER CULTURE. TH AT HAS BEEN TRUE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. THIS COUNTR Y CAN ASSIMIL ATE A LOT OF IMMI GRANTS. I WOULD LIK E TO SUE THE U.S. ADOPTE D SYSTEM THAT IS MORE DRE SSE D TO DO MORE OF IT OF HIS US ON SKILLS R ATH ER THAN LEGAL IMMIGRANTS WE ARE TAKI NG. I ALSO WANT TO SEE A ROBUST CU LT URE OF THE SIMULATION. ONE THING I S WE HAD AN ENORMOUS WAVE OF IMMIGRAT ION . YOU HAD EVERY E LITE INSTI TUTION CONCERNED A BOUT A SIMULATING IMMIGRANTS.

HOST: DO YO U THIN K AMERICAN NA TIONALISM IS WHAT PRESID ENT TRUMP MEANS WHEN HE SAYS AME RICA FIRST. ? GUEST: I DO . I THINK IT IS AN INSTINCTUAL EXPRESSION OF THE BELI EF THAT WE PUT OUR INTERESTS F IRST. I THINK TRU MP, WHEN HE IS ON THE TELE PROMPTE R, IT IS UNASSAILABLE. SOME OF THE NATI ONALISTIC STATEMENTS HE MADE THE U.N. AND THE SPEECH HE GAVE, TH E BEST SP EECH OF HIS PRES IDENCY, VERY NATIONALISTIC SPEECH. ALL THAT IS TER RIFIC.

HE WR OTE IT SE EMS PART OF A LARGER EF FO RT ON THE RIGHT TO CREATE AN AFTER-TH E-FACT FRAMEWORK FOR TRUMPIS M TO CONTORT THE PRESIDENT'S IMPULSES IN TO A COHE RENT WO RLDVIEW THAT CAN OUTLAST HIM.

WHEN THE NE W LEFT TOOK O VER THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 70'S , T HIS WAS A MOVEM ENT YOU COULD SEE ON THE STRE ETS AND VARIOUS DISSIDENT L EADERS. TRUMP COMES OUT OF NOWH ERE. THERE HAS B EEN AN EFFORT TO THINK THROU GH WHAT HE MEA NS AN D W HAT I ATTE MPTED TO DO IN THE BOOK, IT IS NOT A BO OK ABOUT TRUMP. IT IS A BOO K OCCA SIONED BY TRUMP, WHERE HE HAS HIT ON AN I MPORTAN T FACTOR IN OUR POLITICS AN D HISTORY THAT HAVE B EEN RELATIVELY NEGLECTED A ND OFTEN M ISUNDERSTOOD. WHAT I WOUL D LIK E PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY BOO K IS THERE'S SOM ETHING TO THIS NATION ALISM THAT IS DEE PER THAN TRUMP AND O NE TRUMP IS GONE ONE WAY OR THE OTHE R, AS T HE REPU BLICAN PARTY SHOULD NOT TURN IT S BACK ON NAT IONALISM AND IT SHOULD BE THOUGHTF ULL Y INTEGRATED INTO THE PROGRAM GOI NG FORWA RD. HOST: CHRIS , A REPUBLICAN, GOOD MORNING. CA LLER: THANK YOU, YOU ARE ONE OF OUR BEST DE FENDERS OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE BIRTHRA TE THING BEING BORN MEANS YOU A RE TAUGHT OUR HISTORY.

GUEST: IT I S IMPOR TANT TO FOCUS ON TH E HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND JIM CRO W IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK CON SERVATIV ES HAVE FALLEN DOWN OVER T HE DECADES AND WANTED TO LOOK PAS T AND SUGARCOAT IT. THE LEAD ES SAY IN THAT SERIES SAID THE AMERICAN RE VOLUTION WAS ABOUT PROTE CTING SLAVERY AND THAT IS COMPLETE LY UNTRUE. IT SUGGESTS THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTED P ROPERTY IN MAN WHEN AC TUALLY, BETWEEN THE OFFICES OF JAMES MADIS ON, THE PHRASE WAS EXPLICI TLY LEFT OUT OF THE CONSTITUTIO N WHICH REPRESENTED A COMPROMIS E BUT THE IDEA WAS THE CON STITUTION SHOULD NOT AFFIRMA TIVE LY DEFEND SLAVERY TOW ARD LONG-TERM GOALS. OF BEING TR UER TO ID EALS A ND ELIMINATING SLAVERY. YO U HAD A T URNING AWAY OF SLA VERY IN THE NORTH A T TH E TIME OF THE REVO LUTION.

AT THE CORE OF IT IS THE E NGLISH LANGUAGE. L ANGUAGE IS VERY PRI MORDIAL. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. WITH SOME E XCEPTIONS LIKE SWITZERLAND , WHEN YOU HAVE WI THIN A NATION LA RG E PARTS OF THE POPU LATION THAT SPEAKS SOME OF THE LINE WHICH, YOU WILL HA VE A PROBLEM. TWO YEARS A GO NEARLY TORN APART BY A DRIVE FOR QUEBEC INDE PENDENCE BECAUSE THEY SPEAK FRENC H AND HAVE THEIR OWN CULTURE ON THAT BASIS. YOU CAN SEE SPA IN NOW. IT IS AT TH E CORE OF AME RICAN CULTURE. TH EN IT IS ALL THES E INFORMAL MORES, OUR CUISINE AND THE WAY WE DRESS, P RED ILECTIO NS AND ATTITUDES A ND IMMIGRA NTS CAN ADOPT THIS CULTUR E AND HAVE OVER O UR HISTORY ADO PTING THIS CULTURE.

THIS IS FRE NCH P RESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON FROM NOVEMB ER 12 OF 2018. >> TH IS VISION OF F RANCE, A GENEROUS NATION WITH A VISION TO CARRY UNIVERSAL V ALUES HAVE IN A D ARK TIMES EXACTLY THE OPPOSIT E OF THE SELFISH NESS OF A PEOPLE, WHICH ONLY LOOKS AT ITS OWN INTERESTS B ECAUSE PATRIOTISM IS THE EXACT O FFSE T OF NATIONALISTS. , NATIONALISM . NATIONALISM IS A BETRAY AL. BY PURSUING OUR OWN INTERES TS FIRST WITH NO REGARD TO OTHERS, WE ERASE THE VERY THING THE NATION HOLDS MOST PRECIO US, T HAT WHICH GIVES IT LIFE AND MAKES IT GREAT, IT'S MORAL VALUES. GUEST: I TH INK IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG. HE B OTCHES THE DEFINIT ION OF PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM, AS WE TALKE D ABOUT AT THE TOP. THE ID EA TH AT FRANCE DOES NOT PU RSUED ITS , PURS UE ITS NATIONAL IN TERESTS IS COMPLETELY ABSURD. THE RE IS NO T INHERENTLY AN OPPOSITION BETWEEN IDEALS AND NATIONALISM . THE BEST NA TIONALISMS ARE INFUSED WITH IDEALS. THEY BOTH H AVE AN ATTACHME NT TO THE PARTICU LAR AND A BELIE F IN THE UNIVERSAL. YOU JUST LO OK AT FRE NCH NATIONALISM , WHICH A COU PLE OF CENTURIES AGO WAS BAS ED ON THE IDEA THAT FRANCE HAD THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING, AND S UBSEQUENT TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WAS ACQUIRE D BY A ZEALOU S IDEALISM AN D UNIVERS ALIS M. I SPEND A S ECTION OF MY BOOK DIS CUSSING JOAN OF ARC, WHO I THINK IS A FIGURE THAT REPRESENTS THE POWER. IT I S NOT E XACTLY NATIONALISM. YOU COULD A RGUE IF TH E TERM APPLIES IT CERTAINL Y NATIONAL LOYALTY AND FEELING , SH E HAS A VISION THAT SHE SH OULD FREE THE FRENCH LAND FROM T HE ENGLISH AND THAT TH E FRENCH SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE FRENCH. AND SHE WIL L AS A TEENAG E GIR L UNDERTAKE THIS EXTRAORDINA RY ENTERPRISE TO CHASE TH E ENGLISH FROM FRANCE. THE ENGLISH , TO ERASE ALL MEMORY OF HER, TO SCA TTER HER ASHES IN THE RIVER, THEY CANNOT ELIMINATE THE MEMORY OF H ER BECAUSE SHE HAS BEC OME A SYMBOL OF THE NATION AND HAS AN INCREDIBLE POWER THROU GHOUT FRENCH HISTORY IN PARTICULAR AND THROUGHOUT ROSE HISTORY. I THINK MAC RON WOULD DO WELL TO RECONSID ER THIS. HOST: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOS E WHO SAY NATIONALISM WAS THE CAU SE OF TWO WORL D WARS? THIS IS CON GRESSWOMAN VAL DENNINGS ON NOVEMBER 10 . SHE SAI D, S HOWING A PICTURE OF A JEWISH NESS SYNAGOGUE , JEWISH SYNA GOGUE B URNING, TH IS IS WHERE NATIONALISM AND ANTI-SE MITISM LEADS. ALWA YS.

I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN T HE TIME OF THE NAZIS, BUT THEY CLEARLY HAD NATIONALIST IC APPEAL AND USED NATIONALIST IC SYMBOLS, BUT HILLER WAS NOT JUS T A NATIONALIST . WHAT MADE HIM ON E OF THE MOST EVIL F IGURES IN ALL OF WORLD HISTORY WAS THE UNIQUE ASPE CTS OF MOXIE AL I , IDEOLOGY, A BLOODSOAKED VISION OF S O-CALLE D BIOLOGICAL RACISM WHER E THEIR HANDS SHOUL D RULE GERMAN Y AND ALL OF EURO PE B Y C ONQUEST . THIS WAS NO T TRULY A NATIONALIST PROJECT. BY THE END, HE WAS HAPP Y TO SEE THE GERMAN NATION DEST ROYED AS WELL. IT FAILED T O LIVE UP TO HIS LUNATIC VISION. CALLER: GOO D MORNING.

A BASIC QUE ST ION AS WITH EVERY OTHER POLIC Y IS, DOES IT SERVE OUR INTERES TS, IS IT IN OUR NATIONA L IN TERESTS? THE ATTACHMENT TO THE CLICHE THAT WE ARE A NATIO N OF IMMIGRANTS OF SKEWERS ALL RATIONAL THINKING AB OUT IMMIGRATION .

MY PO INT IS WE SHOUL D BE CHOOSIER AN D GET IMM IGRA NTS WHO ARE PRE PARED TO THRIVE IN THIS COUNTR Y AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE. I PUT MORE EMPHAS IS ON ENGLISH SPEAKING. IT DOES NOT MEAN THERE WOULD NOT BE A HUMANI TARIA N ELEMENT. I THINK THEY'RE ALWAYS SHOULD BE I N THERE SHOULD BE A ROBUST REFUGEE PRO GRAM. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH M ORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON SKILLS JUST BECAUSE IT IS A DIF FERENT COUNTRY AND A DIFFE RENT ECONOMY THAN IT WAS IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, WH ERE YOU CAN HAVE IMMIGRANTS COMING IN B Y THE BOATLOAD AN D YOU COULD BASICALLY P LUG THEM INTO THE FACTORY LIN E AND TR UST THAT EVERYT HING WILL BE OK.

IT IS THE L AST IN STALLMENT OF OUR WEEKLY AUTHOR SERIES ON "" THE WAS HINGTON JOURNAL."" THIS IS PAT RICK, A REPUBLICAN. CALLER: GOO D MORNING. MY QUESTION FOR YOU, RI CH LOWRY, WITH THE NATIONA LISM AND , IN SANCTUARY C ITIES. ELECTED OFF ICIALS OF THE SANC TUARY H OLDINGS AR E TELLING THE FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT, LEAVE MY PE OPLE ALONE. AND YET THE Y ARE TALKING ABOUT GIVING ALL OF THESE IL LEGALS DRIVERS LIC ENSE. TH AT IS A F REE TICKET AT ALMOST EVERY VOTIN G REGISTRATION BOOTH IN AM ERICA. A PHOTO ID, B ASICAL LY BASED ON A DRIVERS LICENSE. I WOULD LIK E YOU TO THINK ON THAT. GUEST: I TH INK SANCTUARY CITIES ARE A DISGR ACE AND THE IDEA LOOKOUT WOU LD NOT COOPERATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY HAVE IMMIGR ANTS IN JAIL WHO COMMITTED C RIMES, THA T THEY WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINDING OUT WHAT EL SE THEY ARE GUILTY OF O R HAND THEM OVER TO FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IF DEPORTATION OR ANYTHING EL SE IS CALLED FOR, IS TER RIBLE. WE HAVE SEEN T HE DO WNSID ES OF THE CRIMES COMM ITTED B Y THE PEOPLE SPRU NG WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN H ANDED OVER TO FEDERAL AUT HORITIES. I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT THIS I S WRONG AND A PRACTICE TH AT SHOULD STOP. SOME LOCALI TIES HAVE DOUBLED DOW N ON THIS AS A WAY TO THUM B TH EIR NOSE AT PRESIDEN T TRUMP. HOST: A STO RY FROM THE WASHING TON EXAMINER IN THE PAST FEW DA YS. LEADERS URGE RESISTANCE TO GUN WAS AN COMP ARED TO THE REVOLUT ION. GUEST: I DO NOT THINK WE AR E AT , I N A REVOLUTIO NA RY PERIOD IN T HIS COUNTR Y AND THAT IS A GROSS RHETORICAL OVERREACH. I DO NOT SU PPORT AS A GENERAL MATTER GUN CONTROL . PART OF THE DEBATE IN T HIS COUNTRY OVER MASS SHOOTI NGS, REALLY ALL OF THE GUN-CONTROL MEASURES OF FERED AS A MEANS TO CO MBAT OR D ISCOURAGE OR EVEN ELIMINATE M ASS KILLINGS HA VE ZERO I NTERACTION WITH MASS KILLING'S. IF YOU LOOK AT BAC KGROUND CHECKS, THE MOST BASIC OF THESE ID EAS, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, SO- CALLED, THE PROBLEM IS ALMOST ALL OF THES E SHOOTERS HA VEN'T BEEN GUILTY OF A CRIME PRIOR TO THESE HEINOUS ACT S. THEY PASS B ACKGROUND CHECKS. I DO NOT TH IN K T HIS AGENDA MAKES ANY SENSE. HOST : VIRGI NIA. CALLER: I S EE IT FROM MORE OF A BIBLIC AL PERSPECTIVE. MAYBE WITH THE PR OPHECY OF THE ONE WORLD G OVERNMENT UNDER THE ONE WORLD R ULER. GUEST: I CA NNOT SAY I'M HIGHLY FAMI LIAR WITH THAT. CALLER: OK, ACCORDING TO THE PROP HECY, T HERE WILL BE A ONE WO RLD RULER AND A ONE W ORLD RELIGION AND A ONE W ORLD GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN SEE WE ARE ON THE VERG E OF THAT WIT H A LL OF THE CORRECTION , CORRUPTION AND HATRED IN THE WORLD. GUEST: I WI LL SEGUE OFF OF THAT TO SAY I DISCUSS I N THE BOOK TH E BIBLICAL ORIGINS OF NATIONAL ISM. WHEN PEOPLE STARTED REA DING THE BIBLE IN THE VERNACU LAR, THEY ALL KI ND OF IMAGINE THEMSELVES, INCLUDING E NGLAND AND , SUBSEQ UENTLY, US, AS A SUCCESSOR T O ANCIENT ISR AEL, WHICH WAS A NATIO N, NOT A MODER N NATION. THE BORDERS OF ANCIENT ISR AEL HAS ITS OWN LAWS, H AS A VERY STRONG SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS AND MISSION . TH IS NOTION REALLY PUT AN IMPRINT ON THE MODE RN WESTERN WORLD AND THE NAT IONS THAT MAKE IT UP. HOST: WE SP ENT OU R PROGRAM TODAY TALKING ABO UT EVANG ELICAL VOTERS ONLY. ON PRESIDEN T T RUMP. ISN'T THE E VANGELICAL RIGHT ACTING LIKE A CONT ROLLING ELITE IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA? GU EST: I DO N'T SEE THAT AT ALL. PART OF THE SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT T RUMP, YOU READ THE TWEET THAT I HEAR D EARLIER. THAT HE WILL PROTEC T THEM FROM A CONTROLLING ELITE. EVANGELICAL SUPPORT FOR TRUMP I S MORE A POPULIST IN THAT SENSE. MOST EVANGE LICAL S I TALKED TO S UPPORT TRU MP BUT ARE FULLY AWARE OF HIS FLAWS IN THE DOWNSIDES O F HOW HE CONDUCTS HI MSELF AND WHAT HE SAYS. IT IS JUST THAT THEY DON'T SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE AND WHAT TH EY ARE OFFERED FROM THE OTHER SIDE, A PAR TY THA T SUPPORTS ABORTION ON DEMAND I N E VERY CIRCU MSTANC E, THAT HAS VE RY LITTLE REGARD FOR CONSCIE NCE RIGHTS, THI NKS THE CONSTITUTION IS A LIVING DO CUMENT THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED IN KEEPING WITH POLITICAL AGENDAS. TH EY ARE RE ALLY THROWN INTO THE AR MS OF TRUMP. SOME EVANGELICALS ARE VERY ST RONG TRUMP TESTS. TRUMP , TR UMPISTS. PEOPLE WHO GO ON TV AND DEFEND EVERY WORD AND EV ERYTHING HE SAYS ARE DISGRACING THEMSELVES AND THEY SHOULD NOT DO IT. AND THEY SH OULD BE AN AWARENESS AND KNOWLED GE MEN OF THE DOWNSIDES. MAKING THE CASE IN THIS WORLD OF GR AYS, HE IS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. HOST: BRITT HUME SAYING PEOPLE MYST IFIED B Y EVANGELI CAL SUPPORT FOR TRUMP DO NOT SEE THE REASON WHY. IT IS NOT THAT EVANGE LICAL'S APPROVAL OF HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT. TH EY THINK HE IS THE E NEM Y'S ENEMY AND H E IS WILLING TO FIGHT. IT S HOULD B E AVAILABL E ON THE WEBS ITE IN THE MEANTIME. SOUTH BEND, INDIA NA, A DEMOCRAT, GOOD MORNING. CA LLER: OK. I WILL BE Q UICK. A COUPLE TH IN GS I WANT TO S EE. NATIONALISM AND PHRASES LIKE NATIONALISM AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, WE SHOULD J UST BURY. THEY TAKE O N A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. ANOTHE R THI NG , THING I WANT TO S AY, I THINK THE REASON HE WROTE THIS BOOK I S BECAUSE YOUR PARTY OR TRUMP SUPPO RTERS, THAT TRUMP HAS R EALLY GONE AGAINS T CLI MATE CHANGE. YOU GUYS KN OW THERE WILL BE AN INFLU X , I NFLUX OF REFUGEES POSSIBLY CO MING INTO THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE NOW POL ICY , C LIMATE CHANGE. YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT GUE ST: , O N THAT. GUEST: ANY U.S. POLICY WOULD BASICALLY M AKE NO DIFFEREN CE IN THE GLOBAL TEMP ERATURE. EVEN THE GR EEN NEW DEAL WOULD MAKE NO DIF FERENCE BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES THAT IS FEEDING GLOBAL EMISSIONS. A BUNCH OF OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING C HINA. THE HOST , THE HOPE OF CLIMATE ACTIVISTS T HAT YOU CAN MAKE EV ERY COUNTRY ON THE WORLD TURN ITS BA CK ON ITS OWN NATIONAL AND ECONOMI C INTERESTS, YOU WILL NOT DO IT. IT IS A FANTASY. CHINESE , CHINA IS OPERATING GULAGS NOW. DO YOU THIN K THIS REGIME, THA T YOU CAN TRUST T O FOLLOW THROUGH ON CLIMATE COMMITMENTS? IT SEEMS CO MPLETELY ABSURD TO M E. THE BEST APPROA CH IS TO TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY, STUDY IT, RESEARCH IT . WE DON'T KN OW AS MUC H ABOUT IT, I THINK, AS S OME OF THE MORE INFLAMED ACTIVISTS ON THE SIDE , ON THE OTHE R SIDE BELIEVE WE DO. AS W EALTHY AND TECHNOL OGIC ALLY ADVANCED AND DYNAMIC AS POSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM 80 YEARS FR OM NOW WH EN AN D IF IT E MERGES IN THE MANN ER THAT THE AC TIVISTS SAY IT WILL. HOST: BILLY FROM BOSTON TAKES ISSUE WITH EMPIRE. THOUSANDS O F TROOPS , TROOPS IN EUROPE A ND MORE THAN 100,000 TROOPS IN A SIA. GUEST: WE A RE OBVIOUSLY A GLOBE SPANNING PO WER. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT FROM EMPIRES IS THEY ARE BY CHOICE WELCOMED BY COUNTRIES T HAT WANT US THERE. C OUNTRIES ON THE PERI PHERY OF CHINA WANT A U.S. PRESENCE. COUNTRIES T HREATENED BY EUROPE, I'M SORRY, BY RUSSIA, WHETHER IT IS THE BALTICS AND UKRAINE WANT. I DO NOT TH INK BY TR ADITIONAL DEFINITIONS, THIS IS AN EMPIR E. CER TAINLY NOT THE KIN D OF EMPIRE I WAS REFERRI NG TO EARLIER OR THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND R ULING OTHER PEOPLES. HOST: LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LEFT WITH RICH L OWRY. AUTH OR OF THE BOOK ""T HE CASE FOR NATIONALISM ."" WE ARE TAKI NG YOUR PHONE CALLS IN THESE LA ST 10 MINUTES. THIS IS GIANT , JOHN IN VIR GINIA , A REPUBLICAN. CALLER: WE WERE TAUGHT NATIONALISM IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YEARS AGO. ALSO A TERM CALLED CENTRALISM. I BELIEVE C ENTRALISM WAS WHEN YO U WOULD ROOT FOR YO UR LOCAL SPORTS TEAM OR STA TE, AS OPPOSED TO NATIONAL ISM , TO YOUR COU NTRY. IN THE LIPIDS, YOU WOULD R OOT FOR THE UNI TED STATES TO WIN THE GOLD EVEN I F YOU WERE AN IMMIGRANT. ONCE A SIMU LATED , YOU WOULD N OT ROOT FOR THE COUNTRY YOU CAME FROM, BUT F OR THE UNI TED STATES. WHEREAS CEN TRALISM, YOU ARE PROUD OF YOUR STATE. TRUM P'S FAV ORITE STATE, EVER Y , HIS FAVORITE STATE IS TH E STATE HE IS IN. GUEST: THE TERM IS CENTRALISM? CALLER: THI S IS WHAT THE Y T AUGHT US 60 YEARS AGO. CENTRALISM VERSUS NATI ONALISM. GUEST: I HA VE NOT HEARD THE USE OF THAT TER M IN THAT SENSE. ROOTING FOR YOUR STATE, THAT IS KIND OF A LOCAL OR STATE PAY JUDAISM. AN D THEY BA SIC EXPRESSION WOULD BE RO OTING FOR HOST: S AYIN G IS VERY IMP ORT ANT T O DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NATIONALISM AND WHITE N ATIONALISM AND HOW OPPRESSION AND DISCRIMINAT ION PREVENT ASS IMILATION THE GUEST HAS D ESCRIBED. GUEST: NO D OUBT AB OUT IT. THIS NATION HAS OFTEN FALLEN DOWN BY THAT STA NDARD. IF YOU LOOK AT CHA RLOTTESV ILLE, THEIR DNA GOES BACK T O THE KKK AND DOMESTIC TE RRORIST GROUPS. THIS IS NOT THE MAINSTR EAM OF AMERICAN NATIONALIST TRADITION. ANOTHER IRONY IS, IF YOU THINK A BOUT IT, T HE AVE RAGE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THIS COU NTR Y PRO BABLY HAS A LINEAGE G OI NG BACK MUCH FURTHER THAN ANY WH ITE EUROPEAN-AM ERICAN MARCHERS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THIS GOES A GAIN TO THE 1619 PR OJECT. ONE THING I S IT DOES EMP HASIZE HOW AMERICA N AFRICAN-AME RICANS ARE. , GUEST: THIS IS A P HRASE TH AT COMES FROM FASCIS T ENDS NOT TO MOVEMENTS IN EUROPE. THIS IS ANA THEMA TO THE AMER ICAN TRADITION. IT IS TRUE , IT IS TRUE THAT FOUNDERS WERE BLINKERED O N THE ISSUE OF RACE AND TH E ISSUE OF SLAVERY. THAT THEY W ERE NOT NEO-NAZIS. HOST: NEW Y ORK, TONY, AND INDEPENDENT. CALLER: WHE N MY FAT HER'S FATHER CAME FROM I TALY IN 1906, HE ENDED UP FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR I. HE HAD THRE E SONS WHO ALL FOUGHT IN W ORLD WAR II. THEY DID NO T JUS T FIGHT BECAU SE THEY WERE ITALIANS. T HEY WENT TO FIGHT FOR AMERICA . THEY DID NO T FIG HT FOR ITALY. THEY FOUGHT FOR AMERICA AND BECAME AMERICANS. EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER'S FATHER WAS SENT BACK TWICE, BACK TO ITA LY, ONCE BECAUS E HE COULD NOT SPEAK E NGLISH AND THE SECOND BECAUSE HE HAD PINK EYE. HE KEPT COM ING BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN AMERICA. THE NEW IMMIGRA NTS OF TODAY, L ET'S START A DRA FT AND SEE JUST HOW MANY OF THEM WILL FIGHT FOR AMERICA. OR WILL THE Y GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY UNT IL THE WAR IS OVER? PATRIOTISM COMES FROM BEING AMERICAN, FROM BEING HERE IN FIGHTING AN D PROTECT ING NEIGHBORS. IT ALWAYS H ASN'T BEEN 100%, BUT I T HAS WORK ED AS BEST AS ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORL D. GUEST: A MA SSIVE F ORCE FOR ASSIMILATION IN THIS COU NTRY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ANOTHER THING I THI NK IS VERY IMPORTANT T O NOTE IN THE DISC USSION IS A LOT OF PEOPLE S AY THERE I S A HUGE INFLUX AND THAT TURNED OUT OK. IN MASSIVE INFLUX GOING FORWARD AND THAT IS OK AND ANOT HER FACTOR IS T HE 19.4 IMMIGRATION LAW, WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MALIGNED INTENT IN S UPPORTING THAT RESTRICTION , LEGISLATION. BUT IT DID DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY, WH ICH PRESE NTED THE CREATION OF AN DOHRING ETH NIC ENCLAVES, ONE THING YOU W ANT TO AVOID. THE ITALIAN -AMERICANS, TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE FROM THE CALLER'S BACKGROUND AND EXPERIE NCE, THEY COULDN'T JUST ASSOCI ATE WITH OTHER ITALI ANS, S ULLI COMIN G OVER BECAUSE THE FLOW STOPPED. THEY WERE A BSORBED INTO THE BR OADER SOC IETY AND I THINK THAT IS A P ROCES S WE ALWAYS WANTED TO S EE HAPPEN. I THINK THE RE ARE PARTS OF AM ERICA WHE RE YOU C OULD GET BY JUST SPE AKING SP ANISH. I THINK THA T IS A VERY BAD THING. HOST: INDEP ENDENT, GOOD MORNIN G. CALLER: I'M AN INDEPEND ENT AND I GENER ALLY L EAN LIBERAL. I CAN'T BEL IEVE I A GREE WITH YOU ON ANYTHING. GUEST: IT H APPENS OCCASIONALL Y. CALLER: I B ELIEVE A N IDEOLOGI CAL CONSISTENCY. THE REASON I SUPPORT NATIONALISM IS BECAUSE I AM A POPU LIST EC ONOMICALL Y, AND I GO BA CK TO THE LABOR MOVEM ENT OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTUR Y AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE LABOR OR AN TI-IMMIGR ANT BECAUSE THE Y WERE T AKING JOBS. I THINK IT IS IDEOLOGICAL LY CONSISTENT TO SAY, NO NEW WORKERS COM ING INTO THE COUNTRY UNT IL ALL AMERICANS WHO WANT A JOB CAN GET A JOB. WHAT I WANT TO S AY IS I REALLY WISH THE DEMOCRA TIC PARTY WOULD OPEN THEIR EYES TO PEO PLE LIKE ME. A LOT O F AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO CALL C- SPAN WHO ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND VOTED F OR TRUMP, I AM NOT A TRUMP. I' M NOT THAT STUPID. I COULD NEV ER VOTE FOR SOMEBODY THAT ERRATI C TO HAVE HIS FINGER ON THE NUCL EAR BUTTONS. BUT I WANT TO SAY I WISH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WOULD NOT BE AS L IBERAL AS IT IS ON IMMIGRATION. YOU MENTIONED T HE 1924 IMMIGRATION ACT. THE ONE THAT BOTHERS ME, EVEN TH OUGH IT PROCEEDS MY BIRTH, I S THE 1965 IMMIGRATION ACT. I BELI EVE I T DOES NOT HAVE TO DO WITH ETHNICITY. IT HAS TO D O WITH IMM IGRANTS IN THIS COUNTR Y WHO ARE ELITES, WHO ARE DOCTORS, WHO ARE PEO PLE WHO HAVE NEEDS AND THAT IS WHY THEY COME T O THE COUNTRY . TH EY MAKE MORE MONEY AND TAKE IT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY. TH EREFORE, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND INDIGEN OUS PEOPLE IN THE COUN TRY AND POOR WHITES GET OVERLOOKED. GUEST: A SL IGHT DIST INCTION. YOU SAID, I BELIEVE, ACCIDENTALL Y, ANTI-IMMIGR ANT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHO ULD BE ANTI-IMMIGRANT. I DO THINK DEMOCRATS ARE BETTER SERVED TO CASH , CAS T A MORE SKEPTICAL EYE TOWARD IMMIGRATION . GOING BACK TO THE LABO R MOVEMENT IN THE 20 CENTURY, BERNIE SANDERS REPRESENTS THAT AS WEL L. A FAM OUS INTERVIEW H E HAD IN 2016 THAT I DISCUSSED IN THE INTERVIEW HE HAD IN 2 0 THAT I DISCUSSED IN THE BOOK WH ERE THE EDITOR OF T HE POLICY WEBSITE VOX SAID ""S ENDE R SANDERS YOU SUPPOR T IMP ROVING T HE LIVES OF POOR PEOPLE, WHA T IS THE BEST THING YOU C AN DO FOR POOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD?"" LET THEM CO ME HERE. IT WOULD CERTA INLY B ETTER THE LIVES OF IMMIGRANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SANDERS HAD A NEGAT IVE REACTION ""W E CANNOT DO T HAT THA T IS A LIBERTARIAN IDEA, WE NE ED TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE IN TEREST OF OUR WORKERS AND OUR PEOPLE FIRS T."" SAN DERS WAS ROUNDLY ATTACKED FOR THIS, YOU D ON'T HEAR HIM EXPRESSING THAT SENTIMENT A NYMORE. I THINK DEM OC RATS WOULD BE WE LL SERVED SUBSTANTIVELY AND POLITIC ALLY TO THINK MO RE IN THOSE KINDS OF TERMS. T HE LAST TH OUGHT I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH, T HE TRUMP P HENO MENON DOES MEAN T HERE IS MO RE RUNNING ROOM FOR THE DEMOCRA TS TO GO LEFT ON ECO NOMICS, TO GO POPULIST ON ECONOMICS. WHAT THEY S HOULD LEARN FROM TRUMP AND THEY ARE NO T IS THAT THE Y NEED TO GO TO CENTER O N S OME CULTUR AL ISSUES, WHETHER IT IS GUNS OR ABORTION OR IMMIGRAT ION , TO GIVE VOTERS IN T HE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY A SENSE THA T THEY GET IT AND THEY AR E NOT HOSTILE TO CULTURAL ATTITUDES A ND ARE NOT RADICAL CULTURALLY. THE REACTIO N TO TRUMP LARGELY. I THINK THE LEFT IS OFFENDED AN D THE DEMOCRA TIC PARTY IS PUSHING THA T WAY AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. TRUMP FAVOR S A WALL, WE HAVE TO BE IN FAVOR OF TEARING DOWN A WALL. THEY WANT T O GO TO THE OPPOSIT E END EXTREME OF TRUMP. I THINK THA T IS A THREAT TO THE DEMO CRATS E LECT ORAL PROSPE CTS AND THIS YEAR C OMING UP - - >> TH IS IS A G REAT TRA NSITION TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT. THE BOOK IS ""THE CASE FOR NATIONA LISM."". THE AUTHOR IS RICH LOWRY. UP NEXT WE WILL TAL K ABOUT CAMPAIGN 20 20. WE WILL BE JOINED BY A DEMOCR ATIC STRATEGIST, STICK AROUND FOR THAT DISCUSSION. (music) C-SPAN LIVE 2020 COVERA GE CONTINUES.

WE ARE JOIN ED BY PHILIP STUT TS, A R EPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND THAT FO R NOW, DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANT. DOUG STARTS BY LOOKING BAC K AT 201 9, WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT WHERE WE ENDED UP IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY? >> THE FIRST T HING THAT SURPRISED HE WAS KAMA LA HARRIS'S EX IT. I FELT LIKE SHE HAD ONE OF THE CLEARER PATHWAYS TO THE NOMI NATION AND I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT HER E ARLY EXIT. THE OTHER T HING THAT MAY NOT BE THAT SUR PRI SING IS THE REMA RKABLE STABILITY OF JOE BIDE N AND BERNIE SANDERS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. BIDEN HAS R EMAINED CONSISTENT IN NATIONAL POLLING. DIFFERENT I N IOWA AND NE W HAMPSHIRE. BERNIE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT. THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MAY OR PETE, EMERG ING AS A VERY VIAB LE CANDIDATE COMING OUT OF BASICALLY N OWHERE. THE MAYOR OF SO UTH BEND AND NOW HE IS LEADI NG THE POLLS IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE HAS A RE AL GOOD CHANCE TO WIN BOTH OF THOSE STATES. THOSE ARE S OME THINGS THAT SURPRI SED ME THE MOST. HOST: WHO D O YOU THINK HAS THE EAS IEST PATH RIGHT NOW? >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOMINAT ION I THINK IT IS BIDEN. I THINK BID EN HAS DEMONSTRATE D THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE BROADES T COALITION O LDER AFRICAN-AME RICAN VOTERS, AFR ICAN-AME RICAN WORKING-CLA SS WHITE VOTER S, BLUE-COLLAR WHITE VOTER S. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HIS STRENGTH NA TIONALLY HE IS STILL THE FRONT RUNNER NATIONALLY. >> IT MAY NOT BE THE CASE IN IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT I THINK THAT MAY NOT PRE VENT HIM FROM WINNING THE NOMINAT ION. MOVING INTO SOUTH CAROLINA AND THOSE SUPER TUESD AY STATES WHERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF A FRICAN AMERICANS WILL VOTE, THAT FAVORS BIDEN. HOST: I WAN T TO C OME BACK TO THAT. PHILIP, FRO M A REPUBLICAN PERSPECTIVE. YOU ARE SKE PTIC AL O F THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD, WHAT SURPRI SED YOU THE MOST? PHILLIP: I THINK ABO UT ALL OF OUR OPEN PRIMARIES FROM 2008 A ND TH E RISE AND FALL OF CANDIDAT ES, THE RISE OF WARREN AND KAMALA HARRIS EARLY IN THE SUMMER. I T HINK THAT BIDEN AND BERNIE ARE STANDING IN THE SAME PO SITION NATIONALLY THEY WERE A YEAR AGO TODAY WHICH IS CRAZY AFTER ALL THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN SPENT. THE ONLY OT HER WILD CARD MICHAEL BLOOMBERG'S ENTRY INTO THE RACE. W E SAW THIS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WITH G IULIANI WITH LESS MONEY. HE N EVER MA DE IT REALLY. BLOOMBERG H AS MORE MONEY AND C ONFIDENCE BECAUSE HE HAS DONE TH IS BEFORE. THA T WILL BE AN INTEREST ING PLAY. HOST: ON BL OOMBERG AND HOW HE IS IMPAC TING THIS RACE. DOUG: RIGHT NOW H E IS SPEND ING AND CONCENTRATING HIS SPENDIN G ON THE SUPER TUESD AY THI NGS, HE IS BYPASSING THE FOUR EA RLY CAUC US STATES. THERE IS A BIT OF AN UPTICK NATI ONALLY FOR BLOOMBERG. HIS BUYS OU R NATIONAL CABLE BUYS SO THA T IS HELPING HIS NATIONAL POLLING. HE IS AROUN D 4% OR 5% WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHO HE IS HURTI NG IF HE IS HURTING ANYONE. EVE RYONE TH OUGHT IT WOULD BE BIDEN WHEN HE CAME IN BUT THAT IS NOT CLEAR FROM ME , CLEAR TO ME . THE VOTERS FOR BIDEN WOULD BE DI FFERENT THAN THE VOTERS FOR BLOOMBERG. I AM NOT SU RE IF THO SE OF THE TYPE OF PEOPLE M ICHAEL BLOOMBERG WILL BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER. I AM NOT SURE WH O HE IS HURTING. HOST: WHAT IS A C OALITION T HAT I DEMOCRATI C CANDIDATE PUTS TOGETHER TH AT YOU ARE MOST WORRIED ABOUT? DOUG : THE W ORKING -CLASS WHITE VOTERS IN THE MIDW EST. I THINK THE G ENERAL ELECTION COMES DOWN TO WOR KING WHITE CLASS AMERICANS. , PHILLIP: I JUST SIMP LY DO. IN WISCONSI N, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, M AINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, MINNESOTA, THEY ARE ALL OVER 50%. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CANDIDATE THAT CAN AP PEAL TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. T HAT IS REA LLY THE FUNDAMENTAL PLACE OF WH ERE THIS RACE WILL COME DOWN T O. CAN HE SWIN G THOSE STATE S, IT WAS IN WISC ONSIN OR MICHIGAN OR PENNSYLV ANI A, 28% OF TWO-TIME OBAMA VOTER S VOTE D FOR TRUMP IN 20 16. WHO WILL CO ME IN ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND TA KE THAT VOTE? >> WHAT ISSUE APPEALS TO THEM AND HOW DOE S LOOKING AHEAD TO THE IMPE ACHMENT TRIAL IN THE SENATE, DO THOSE VOTER S , ARE THEY WATCHING TH E IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? DOES THAT H ELP OR HURT? PHILLIP: I THINK IT IS THOSE VOTER S. IF YOU LOOK IN THOSE STATES YOU HAVE TH E HARD RIGHT AND THE HARD LE FT AND THEY ARE NOT MOVING ANYB ODY. THERE ARE I S A VE RY SMALL PERCENTAGE THAT WILL M OVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF I WAS FL IRT ING WITH THE LE FT ORAL MAP, H ILLARY GOT 232 ELECTOR AL VOTES. RIGHT NOW T HE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL S ITTING AT 232, HOW CA N THEY GET WHATEVER CO MBINATION IT IS? CONGRESSION AL DISTRICTS I N MAINE, MICHIGAN, W ISCONSIN, WHAT DO THEY NEED T O DO TO GET THOSE VOTES? THAT 'S WHERE ALL T HE MONEY WILL BE SPENT. THER E WILL BE SECONDAR Y STATES THAT COME INTO PLAY THAT T HAT IS WHERE IT SITS RIGHT NOW. WHEN IT COM ES DOWN TO IMP EACHMENT , WE ARE LOOK ING AT THE INTE RNAL NUMBERS IN THE STATES RIGH T NOW. INDEPENDENT S IS WHAT WE ARE PAYING ATTE NTION TO. FOR THE MOS T PART T HE NATIONAL PO LLS ARE SAYING INDE PENDENT S ARE 44% FOR IN THE IMPEACH MENT. I'M LOOKING AT THE LIKELY VOTE RS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT THAT COULD BE SWUNG. FOR THE MOST PART - - WE SAW THIS 22 YEARS AG O WITH THE 19 98 MIDTERM ELECTIONS DURING THE IMPEACHMENT. THE MORE DE MOCRATS PLAY THEIR HAND THE MORE TRUMP WILL BE LOOKED AT LIKE THE VICTIM TO T HE SWING V OTERS IN THE STATES. PHILLIP: ON THAT POINT PEOPLE , DOUG: PEOPLE LIKE TO REF ERENC E 9 8, WE HAD AL GORE RUN NING WITH A VERY STRONG ECONOMY THA T BILL CLINTON GAVE HIM AND HE LOST. A LOT OF TH AT HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO RUN SEPARAT E FR OM BILL CLINTON AND HIS ACCOMPL ISHMENT ON THE ECONOMY BEC AUSE OF THE STAIN OF IMPEACHMENT AND SOME OF HIS PERSONAL ISSUES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHE N NIXON RESIG NED, G ERALD FORD RAN AND LOST TO JIMMY CARTE R. THE EVIDENC E HERE CAN BE SPUN BOTH WAYS. YOU C AN LOO K AT WHAT HAPPENED IN 98 WITH THE MIDTERMS BUT YOU CAN ALSO LOOK A T WHAT HAPPEN ED IN 2000. I AM NOT SE EI NG A LOT OF EVIDENCE TH AT IMPEACHMENT IS MOVING EITHER WAY. WE DON'T EV EN KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A TRIAL IN THE SENATE AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE VULN ERABLE HOUSE DEMOC RATS, THEIR STAND INGS R EMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE IN T HEIR DISTRICTS. THERE HAS N OT BEEN MUCH OF AN IMPAC T. THEY ARE FA CING A TON OF ADVERTIS ING AGAINST THE M FROM A TRUMP SUPER PAC, FROM T RUMP, FROM AAN, F ROM S UPER REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATIO NS. IT HAS NOT HURT THEM. I HOPE TO S EE MORE OF A DEFENS E FROM OTHER ORGAN IZATIO NS, BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEE WHAT TH E IMPEACHMENT WILL DO TO THIS A REDUCTION. , TO THIS ELE CTION. HOST: AS WE MOVE FORWAR D INTO 2020 WE ARE LOOKING AHE AD TO TH E LANDSCAPE OF CAMPAIGN 2020. IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THE CONVERS ATION REPUBLICANS (202) 748-8001. D EMOCRATS ( 202) 748-8000. I NDEPENDENT S (202) 748-8002. D OUG AND PH ILIP JOINING US THIS MORNING. THIS IS A S EGMENT WE LIKE TO DO AT THE E ND OF THE YEAR. WE HAD TO G EORGIA, GO OD MORNING. CA LLER: JOH N, LOVE C-SPAN BEEN CALLING FOR 30 YEARS. HOST : I KNOW YOU HAVE. CALLE R: I T HINK DONALD TRUM P IS THE BEST LEADER IN HISTORY. I AM A STOC K MAR KET MAN AND MY STOCK PORTFOLIO IS UP. I HA VE NEVE R BEEN SO FIR ED UP AND ENERGIZED. I THINK HE IS IN TH E BEST , I T HINK HE IS THE BEST IN HISTORY. WE HAVE GOO D CANDID ATES FOR CONGRESS SO I THINK WE WILL TAKE OVER O UR HOUSE AND INCREASE OUR MAJORIT Y TO THE SENATE AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL WIN T HE BIG GEST LANDSLIDE IN HISTORY. WE HAVE NEV ER HAD A N ECONOMY LIKE THIS. MY STOCK MA RKET HAD , MY S TOCKS H AVE HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. I WIL L RUN TO THE POLLS A ND VOTE FO R DONALD TRUMP. YOU DO A GR EAT JOB ON C-SPAN, YOU AND STEVE, YOU HAVE A GREAT NETWORK. HOST: DIDN' T YOU HAVE A BIRTHDAY RECENTLY? C ALLER: YES I WAS 8 0 YEARS OLD. I WALK AND WO RK OUT EV ERY DAY, I HAVE TO BE IN GOOD SHA PE TO HE LP DONALD TRUMP. HOST: HAPPY BIRTH DAY TO YOU. HAVE A GREA T DAY. HE THINKS R EPUBLICANS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE. PHILLIP: I LOVE THE EXCITEMENT AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN CALLING IN, I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE BACK THE HO USE. THEY NEED T O WIN 20 SEATS, T HERE ARE FOUR TH AT ARE NOT OCCUPIED BY ANYONE R IGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR REPUBLICANS. I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSION AL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, I SPENT , DOUG: THEY HAVE D ONE A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF RAISING MONEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR FUNDR AISING IN SEPTEMBE R THEY OUTRAISED THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THE RE PUBLICANS WERE TRUMPE TING HOW GREAT THE IMPEACH MENT WAS FOR THEIR FUNDRAISING . THE FRONT L INERS ARE THE CAN DIDATES IN THE MOST DIFFICULT DISTRICT. THERE ARE A BOUT 43 OF THEM. ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE ABOUT A MILLION DOL LARS CASH ON HAND SO THEY ARE VE RY GOOD FINANCIALLY. THEY HAVE B EEN A BLE T O CARVE OUT S OME INDEPENDENT PROFILES IN THEIR DI STRICT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TWO WEEKS T HE IRONY WITH IMPEACHMENT IS THAT THE PR ESIDENT W AS IMPEACHED IN THE HOUSE BUT THEY AL SO PASSED A TRADE DEAL. THEY PASSED A PRESCRIPT ION DRUG DEAL AND AN END OF T HE YIELD , AN D OF THE YEAR GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL. THEY PASSED A DE FENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL. THEY HAVE B EEN ABLE TO PROVE TO VOTERS T HAT WE WILL HOLD THE , WE W ILL HOL D T HE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE BUT WORK WI TH HIM WHEN IT WORKS FOR OUR DIS TRICT. HOST: THE FIVE MO ST UNDERSOLD STORIES OF 2019 AND ONE OF THEM IS HOPE FOR BI PARTISANSHIP, BRINGING UP THE DEALS YOU JUST BROUGHT UP. SOME 29 OF THE 31 HOUSE DEMOCRATS W HO SIT IN DISTRICTS THAT DONALD TRUMP WON I N 2016 VOTED FOR IMPEACH MENT , ARE THEY NOT WORRIED ABO UT IMPEACHMENT IN 2020? PHILLIP: I THINK THE AND RCC WILL TARGET 55 D IFFERENT RACES, WHERE THEY WERE TRUMP DISTRICTS IN 2018 AND DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER. IT IS ALL I N THE ENTHUSIASM. WE CAN TALK ABOUT ECONO MIC ISSUES, HEALTH CARE ISSUES. I TALK ABOU T INTERNAL FOALS , TH E REASON I TRUST THESE MORE THAN POLITI CAL NEWS MEDIA POLLS IS THAT IF WE GET IT WRONG OUR C ANDIDATES LOSE SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY LIKE , REALLY RIGHT. IF Y OU ASK ANY DEMOCRAT WHY THEY AR E VOTING AND WHAT THEIR TOP I SSUE IS IT IS NOT THE ECONOMY , HE ALTH CARE , ENVIRONMENT, IT IS BEATI NG TRUMP. THAT IS THE ONLY THING YOU CARE OF , ONLY THING THEY CARE A BOUT. CAN TRUMP G ET ENOUGH DONE TO TOU T HIS RECORD ENOU GH TO G ET THE ENTHUSI ASM UP LIKE THE REPUBLICANS DID IN 2016 ? WHETH ER IT IS A NET TH REE SEEK THE REPUBLICANS NEED IN THE SENATE, EVE RYTHING COMES DOWN TO THAT ENTHUSIASM GAP. HOST: YOU S AY WE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION WORK. DO YO U WANT TO LET FOLK S KNOW ABOUT THE MEDIA COMPANY AND WHAT YOU DO? PHILLIP: WE ARE A DI GIT AL T RADITIONAL MARKETING COMPANY FOR POLITIC AL CAMPAIGNS. HOST: DOUG, WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORK?

REPUBLICAN, CHARLES, GO AHEAD. CALLER: I L OVE THE C-SPAN CHANNEL AND I WATCH A LOT, I AP PRECIATE THE INSIGHT. I HAVE A QU ESTION THAN A COUPLE OF COMMENTS . WHEN I SEE THESE POLLS ON THE MAJO R NETWO RKS AN D IN THE NEWS PAPERS THEY SAY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOP LE ARE AGAINST TRU MP, IMPE ACHMENT IS AFFECTING THEM, THEY WON'T IMPEACH THEY WANT TO RUN TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. IT SEEMS TH AT THERE ARE CERTAIN STATES THAT ARE HIGHLY POPU LATED W HERE EVERY SINGLE PERS ON IN THAT STATE, WHETHER CAL IFORNIA, OR NEW YORK CO ULD VOTE AGAINST TRU MP AND TRUMP STILL WINS. WHEN YOU SA Y THAT YOU NEED TO GO MICRO AND T RY TO SAY WHAT DO PEOPLE IN THESE OTHER STATES , H OW DO THEY FEE L? THE OTHER C OMMENTS AR E ""ISN'T THE ECONOMY STUPID , L ATER ON IN 2020 IF YOU ARE BETTER OFF IN 2020 ISN 'T THAT A COMPELLIN G CASE? I WANT TO K NOW WHERE IS HU NTER BIDEN? HOST: PHILI P, WHY DON'T Y OU START? PHILLIP: HE MAKES A VALID POI NT. IF TRUMP RU NS ON HIS RECO RD OF 7 .2 MILLION NEW JOBS, 500,000 MANUFACTURI NG JOBS, THIS IS APPEALING T O THE MIDWESTERN VOTER, THE LOWEST UNEM PLOYMENT RATE WITH AFRICA N-AME RICANS, ASIAN AMERI CANS, WOMEN, VETE RANS , THE ECONOMY ACROSS THE BOARD IS COMPLETELY INSANELY GO OD. THEY HAVE TO TELL THA T STORY. WHEN YOU LO OK AT THE SE POLLS , TH EY FACTOR IN OTHER STATES. , HOST: THE N ATIONAL POLLING AVERAGE HAS JOE BID EN AT 28 .3%, BER NIE SANDERS 18.9%. MAYOR PETE 8.3 AN D SO ON. YOU GO TO I OWA IT IS MAYOR PETE AT 22% AND SANDERS AT 20. WARREN AT 1 6. YOU GO TO NEW HAMPSHI RE, SANDERS AT 19 MAYOR PETE AT 17 AND BIDEN AT 14.

THIS IS THE HARD PART FOR BLOOMBERG, WHOEVER WINS IOWA T HEY W ILL BE THE PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE A ND NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL BE THE WHIT E WORKING CLASS CANDIDATE, NEVADA WILL BE THE UNION CANDI DATE, SOUTH CAROLINA WI LL BE THE ONE THAT WON THE AFR ICAN-AMERICAN VOTE. ALL THE STO RYLINES WILL BE DRU MMED UP BY THE MEDIA. I WOULD LOO K AT THIS, TH E S TATES RATHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. HOST: DOUG YOU HA VE OFTEN TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT AND WRONG P OLLS. DOUG: I AM A BIG BELIEVE R, I LOVE 538, I GO THERE AN D THEY AGGREGATE A WHOLE BUNCH OF HO LES . I DIRECT PE OPLE THER E, IT IS NONPARTISAN , A VERY RESP ECTED SITE. THEY HAVE G REAT POLLS BASED OFF OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND METHODO LOGY. TO JOHN'S P OIN T, THE CALLER' S PO INT I THI NK SIG NALS ARE IMPORTANT. THE NATIONA L PO LL ON IMPEACHMENT IS DIFFEREN T THAN ONE FROM WISCONSIN. A NATIONAL POLL SHOWED 47 PEOPLE SUPPORTING IMPEACHMENT , 47% OF PEOPLE SUPPORTING IMPEACHMENT . IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRES IDENT'S APPROVAL NUMBER IN 2 016 VERSUS THE KEY STATES HE IS RUNNI NG IN FOR REELECTION, HE IS DOING WORSE NOW V ERSUS WHAT HE GOT IN 2016, SO TH AT WILL BE A PROBLEM FOR HIM. YE S THE ECO NOMY IS STRONG. THE ECONOMY WAS STRONG UNDER PRESIDENT O BAMA. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHEN WE HAVE THESE PARTI SAN BACK-AND-FORTH, I WILL ADMI T THE ECONOMY IS STRONG U NDER TRUMP. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO ADMIT TH AT IT WAS STRONG UNDER OBAMA AS WE LL, HIS F IRST FOUR YOUR GAINS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOW JONES WERE GREATE R THAN WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS EXPERIE NCED. HOST: HAVE YOU HAD ANY SUCCESS GETTING REPUBLICANS TO ADMIT TH AT? DOUG: NO BU T IT I S PART OF HAVING A CO NVERSATION IN POLITICS. CAN TRUMP B E DISCIPLINED ENOUGH TO T ALK ABOUT IT. WHEN YO U LO OK AT HIS TWIT TER FEED AND ADVERTI SING AND THE STUFF H E IS DOING ON SO CIAL IT IS ALL A BOUT ANYTHING BUT THE ECONOMY . IF HE IS GO ING TO MA KE THE ECONOMY THE FOCUS OF HIS CAMPAIGN HE HAS TO BE T ALKING ABOUT IT MORE REGULARLY A ND CONSISTENTLY. RIGHT NOW T HERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE CAN MAINTAIN THAT MESSAG E. HOST: YOU T ALKED ABOU T WISCONSIN, LET'S GO TO WISCONSI N. THIS IS TIM , GOOD M ORNING. CALLER: THA NK YOU F OR PUTTING ME ON. THE ONE CALLER MADE A GOOD POINT , WE ARE FROM CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE 65 MILL ION VOTERS IN THAT STATE. IF T HE DEMO CRA TS HAD FOCUSED MORE ON 65 MILLI ON VOTERS IN THE HEARTLAND IN THE SOUT H WHERE THE STANDARD OF LIVING , T HEY CAN GE T 24 SENATORS 65 MILLION VOT ES I THINK , THEY ARE NOT , I DO NOT SU PPORT THE IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE IT IS GOING NOWHERE BECAUSE REP UBLICANS CONTROL THE SENATE. THE Y ARE GO ING TO TA RGET W ISCONSIN BECAUSE OF THE DAIR Y FARMERS THA T ARE HURTING. WALL STREET AND MAIN STREET ARE SEVEREL Y DISCONNECTED. I GUESS THA T IS MY POINT . PHILLIP: IT GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAID. I T HINK WIS CONSIN S OMETHING LIKE 56 TO 60% WORK ING-CLASS WHITE VOTERS. I THINK THI S IS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABO UT. THIS IS THE RURAL VOTER THAT FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. OVER 3 0% IN WISCONSIN VOTED FOR OBAMA T WICE THEN VOTED FOR TRUMP, WHY? I DON'T DIS AGREE, DOUG, THAT TRUMP' S NUM BERS AREN'T AS GOOD AS THEY WERE IN 16. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID IN T HE POLLING TO SAY THAT THEY SUPPORT DONALD TRUM P. WE OFTEN KN OW THAT IN SOM E STATES WE A RE LOOKING AT, SOME OF THE SE KEY STATES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GE T A LA RGE NUMBER OF HISPANIC OR AFRICAN- AMERICANS. IT IS A LAR GER PE RCENTAGE THAN WE HAD UNDER ROMNE Y RIGHT NOW F OR TRUMP. IF YOU CAN GET ENOUGH OF THOSE VOTES AND CARRY WORKING-CLA SS WHITE VOTERS AMONG THE S TATES THAT ARE IN PLAY RIGHT NOW T HAT IS THE COALITION TRUMP HAS TO WIN. HOS T: THE C ALLER TALKED ABOUT WHAT DEMOCRATS A RE FOCUSING ON. FOCUSING ON THIS COMING OUT AMID THE IMPEACH MENT VOTE IN THE HOUSE. THIS IS JOE BIDEN RELEASING T HIS AD DURING THE IMPEACHMENT VOTE WEEK. >> AMERICAN HI STORY IS NOT A FAIRYTALE . THOMAS JEFF ERSON W ROTE WHAT MANY BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT D OCUMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY. HE WAS A SLAVE OWNER. HE N EVER LI VED UP TO OUR AMERICA N ID EALS, JEF FERSON HIMSELF DID, BUT WH AT HE WROTE , IT 'S A BATT LE THAT IS NEVER FU LLY FINISHED. IF DONALD T RUM P IS REELECTED H E WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAME NTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THIS NAT ION. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE Y EARS THIS WILL N OT BE THE COUN TRY ENVISIONED BY WASHINGTON, THIS WILL NOT BE THE NATION BOUND TOGETHER BY LINCOLN , T HIS IS NOT THE NATION LIFTED UP BY ROOSE VELT INSPIRED BY KENNEDY, IT WILL NOT BE THE NATI ON THAT BARACK OBAM A BENT TOWARD JUSTICE. WE CAN'T LE T THIS MA N BE ELECTED REE LECTED - - HOST: JOE B IDEN'S PRE SIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AD. HERE IS ONE MORE FROM B ERNIE SANDERS FROM THE PAST WE EK. SENATOR SAN DERS: MY OPPONENT S WOULD TELL ME THAT CAM PAIGN CO NTRIBUTIONS FROM THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL DON'T HAVE AN IMPACT. WHY DO YOU THINK THE C EOS ARE MAKING THE CONTRIBUTIO NS? BECAUSE THE Y ARE FI RST IN LINE TO GET THEIR CONCERNS TA KEN CARE OF. I BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. OUR CAMPAIG N IS FUNDED B Y THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THE COUN TRY. WE NEED TO TAKE ON THE CORPORATE HE LEADS. , CORPORATE E LITES. I A M BERNIE SANDERS AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. HO ST: ONE L AST AD FROM MAYOR PETE. >> I THINK ALL OF US WANT THE SAME THING AT TH E END OF THE DAY , WE KN OW WHAT A GIFT IT WOULD BE TO THE FUTU RE AND THE COUNTRY FOR LITERALLY ANYBODY APPEARED TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [AP PLAUSE] I DON'T KNO W HOW MA NY NOW, WE ARE UP TO 25 SOMETHIN G H AVE RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE DEMO CRATIC PARTY. THE MOMENT WE H AVE A NOMINEE, 24 WHO ARE NOT THA T NOMINE E ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RALLY AROUN D THE ONE WHO DOES. LET'S MAKE SURE T HERE IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS FOR BY THAT TIME. HOST: A TAS TE OF SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN AD S ON THE AIR RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW W E ARE LOOKING AT THE MESS AGES AND WHAT PLAYS THE BEST. D OUG: JOE B IDEN IS PR ESENTING HIMSELF AS A HEALER , SOMEONE WHO CAN COME IN AND CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT T RUMP HAS CREATED. HE CAN RETU RN US TO A SENSE OF NORMALCY AN D HE IS TRUSTED. A LOT OF HI S ADS USE VISUALS OF HIM AS V ICE PRESIDENT. SANDERS IS USING THAT ATTACK , THAT WAS AN IMPL ICIT ATTACK ON MAYOR PETE AND BIDEN. THERE HAS B EEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION IN THIS RACE A BOUT MILLIONAIRE S AND BILLIONAIRES WHICH IS WH AT BERNIE SANDERS LIKES TO TA LK ABOUT. THERE IS TH E FIGHT BETWE EN ELIZABETH WARREN AND MAYOR PETE ON CONTRIBUTORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT GETS INT O THIS Q UESTION OF INFLUENC E IN POLITICS AND BERNIE SAYING I'M GOING T O GET ALL OF THESE BAD ACTORS OUT OF HERE. MAYOR PETE PRESEN TS HIMSELF AS A UNITER. SOMEONE WHO IS AFFABLE AND LAUGHABLE - - LIKABLE. HE IS NOT J UST A TECHNOCRA T, HE IS TRYIN G TO SHOW THAT HE IS A LIK ABLE PERSON THAT CAN AL SO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER. H OST: THAT BRINGS US T O THE CRITICAL IOWA VOTE. >> IT IS INTER ESTING. I THINK BID EN'S AD IS HOLIN G T O DEMOCRAT VOTERS ESPECIALLY THE FIREWALL , FOR ME I AM LOOKING AT THAT AND THINKING YOU ARE TARGETING A FRICAN-AMERICANS RIGHT NOW. I SEE THAT AS SHORING UP HIS FIRE WALL. MAYOR PETE REMINDS ME OF JOHN KERRY IN 2004. I WAS IN IO WA RUNNING AROUND WATC HING ALL THE DEMOCRATS S PEAK AND I SAW JOHN EDWARD S. I SAW HOWAR D DEAN , JOHN KERRY WAS BORING EVERYONE TO DEATH. FOR ME I AM THE BORING GUY THAT EV ERYBODY ELSE CAN YELL AND SC REAM BUT IF YOU WANT SOLID AND B ORING I AM THE GUY. FOR BERNIE, HE IS GOING AFTER THE POPULIST WING. HE IS GOING FULL POPULIST. I HAVE SAID FOR A WHILE THA T BERNIE'S CE ILING IS ALSO HIS FLOOR, THAT THERE IS A NUMBER HE C ANNOT GET BELOW OR ABOVE. P IS TRENDI NG NO W THAT WAR AND HAS FALLEN, HER VOTERS HAVE SWUNG OVER TO BERNIE. THAT IS A W AY OF SOLIDIFYING HIS BASE WITH THE POPULACE. H OST: LESS THAN A HALF HOUR L EFT IN THIS PROGRAM, THE SUNDAY POLITICAL ROUNDTABLE, LOOKING AHE AD TO 2020. IF YOU LIKE WHAT D OUG IS SAYING GIVE HIM A FOLLOW ON TWITTER. PHILIP IS A LSO ON TWITTER. THIS IS ISA AC OU T OF BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON. CALLER: GOO D MORNING, THANK YOU FOR C-SPAN. I JUST WANT ED TO P USH BACK ON A COUPLE OF T HINGS, ONE BEING THE E CONOMY IS INSANELY GOOD RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNO W WHOM IT'S I NSANELY GOOD FOR, M AY PEOPLE AT THE TOP WHO HAV E MASSIVE PORTFOLIOS OF STOCKS. A LOT OF US A RE STRUGGLING WITH STUDENT DEBT AND ME DICAL BILLS. I DON'T THI NK IT IS GOING INCREDIBLY GREAT. I AM 36 YEA RS OLD AND ALM OST FOUR OUT OF 10 ELIGIBLE VOTERS WILL BE YOUNGER THAN I AM I N 2020 SO I T HINK WE NEED TO START FOCUSING MORE ON THE M, 39 .1 % IS T HE PERC ENTAGE OF WHITE VO TERS THAT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIA L CANDIDATES HAVE GOTTEN SINCE LBJ , THERE IS NO POINT IN GOING AFTER THESE MYTHICAL WHITE SWING VOTER S, THEY DO NOT EXIST. IF YOU READ ""B ROWN IS THE NEW WHITE"" HE P OINTS O UT THAT THERE IS ALREADY A PROGRESSIVE MAJORITY, 2 3% OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO A RE PROGRES SIVE S AND 28% PROGRESSIVE WHITES, THA T IS 51%. THE VO TER S UPPR ESSION IN MICHIGAN, W ISCONSIN, AND PENNSYLVANI A WAS THE REASON THOSE STATES FLIP PED, IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHITE VOTERS FLIPPING. Y OU HAVE MASSIVE SUPPRESSION OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO VOTE RS WITH RESTRICTIVE VOTER ID LAWS. THE ELECTOR AL COLLEGE IS BROKEN AND STUPID THAT WE ARE STUC K WITH IT. HOST: YOU B RING UP A LOT OF POINTS. >> THE BOTTOM 25% OF ALL WAGE EARNERS IN THIS COUNTRY HAD THE LARGEST INC REASE IN WAGE GAIN, I THINK IT WAS 4.5% WA S TH E LAR GEST GAIN THEY HAD IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. I UN DERSTAN D THAT THERE ARE POCKETS OF PEOPLE AND EXCEPTIONS FOR EVERYTH ING. THE NATIONA L ST ATISTICS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. I AM NOT AT L IBERTY TO SIT THERE A ND T ALK AB OUT VOTER SUPPRESSION, I HAVE NO I DEA WHAT THAT IS. IN FLORIDA IN 2016 FOR TRUMP ON A SUPER PAC, THESE WERE STATES THAT LARGE PARTS OF SWUNG A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE OF THE POPULIST MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET UP 100% OF THOSE VOTERS. THERE IS A COALITION YOU HAVE TO WIN , IT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN EVERY KEY T ARGET STATE. IN 2004 THE RE WAS T HIS POCKET OF STATES A ND THAT WAS ALL THAT MATTERED. M ICHIGAN WA S OUT OF PLAY FOR TRUMP AND N OW IT IS BACK IN PLAY. WORKING CLA SS WHITE VOTER S HAVE STARTED MOVING IN HIS DIRE CTION. IT MAY BE I MPEACHM ENT, A ECONOMY, THE ECONOMY IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE LOOK ING THROUGH THA T DATA RIGHT NOW. CALLER: , DOUG: THE E CONOMY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS MARGINALLY IMPROVED, WHEN PEOPLE ARE SITTING AROUND THEI R KITCHEN TABLE AND T HEY ARE GE TTING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILLS AND HEALTH CARE BILLS AND ENERGY BILLS, THEY ARE PA YING A LOT MORE NOW. THE COST OF LIVING H AVING KEPT UP WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY. I'M SEEING THIS IN THE RACE IS THAT I AM DOING. F OCUS GROUPS WHER E PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE BI LLS ARE TO DAM HIGH. THAT IS CAU SING AN IMPACT ON LONG-TERM A NXIETY THA T PEOPLE STILL HAVE ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND HOW THE Y ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THEIR R ETIREMENT AND PUT THEIR KIDS THROUG H COLLEGE. I THINK THA T IS AN AREA WHERE DEMOCRATS A RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUT E A CAMPAIGN ON THE ECONOMY. TH EY DID TH IS IN 2018 18, IT WAS A KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE. THEY TALK A BOUT REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE PRESCR IPTION DRUG PRICES. I THINK THA T WILL BE A PLACE WHERE DEMOCRATS H AVE TO MAKE THIS ARGUME NT TH AT THEY A RE BETTER STEWARDS OF THE ECON OMY THAN REPUBLICANS. THE EVIDENC E BACKS THAT UP. HOST: 2018 IS SEEN AS THE TIME WHERE DEMOCRATS RAN AND ONE ON HEALTH CARE. DOES IMPEAC HMENT SUCK UP ALL THE OXY GEN IN THE ROOM OR IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE SENATE TRIAL PHASE AND NOVEMBER IS FAR AWAY? > > RIGHT NOW N ATIONAL COVERAGE OF IMPEACHMENT WILL BE OVERWHELMIN GLY FOCUSED ON THE TRIAL AND T HE COVERAG E OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL NOT BE WHAT IT TYPICALLY WOULD BE. FOR SHORT-T ERM, YES. THERE WILL BE MORE TENSION ON IMPEACHMENT. THE QUESTIO N IS LONG-TERM HEALTH, WHA T IMPACT WILL THAT HAVE ON THE RACE FO R PRESIDE NT IN THE RACE FOR CONGRESS AND I THINK IT RE MAINS TO BE SEEN. HOST: WE HA VE TOM FROM HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, INDEPENDENT . CALLER: GOOD MORNING. I THINK THE PROBLEM WIT H THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH I USE D TO BE A PART OF, I'M SEE ING THES E OTHER BRAIN LESS - - HIJACKED PA RTY. DONALD TRUM P'S PLA TFORM WAS THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM IN THE 80'S AND 90'S AM ERIC A FIRST. IF P RESIDEN T O BAMA RAN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY HE COULD NO T WIN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. TH AT IS HOW FAR LEFT THE DEMOCRATS OF GONE. PH ILLIP: I AGREE. IT I S A WEA R OF WORLD WHERE REPUBLICANS ACT LIKE DE MOCRATS AND DEMOCRA TS - - DOUG: WHAT ISSUES ? TRUMP DOES. PHILLIP: TH E REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BEHIND HIM. THE PRESIDE NT HAS NOMINATED FIVE OPENLY GAY AMBASSA DORS , WOULD THAT HAVE HAPPEN ED IN A 2004 ADMINISTRATION? PROBABLY NO T. HE SIGNED T HE FIRST STEP ACT WHICH I S MANDATORY M INIMUMS WH ICH AFFEC TS A LARGE PROPORTION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THAT WAS SO METHING I DON'T BELIEVE A R EPUBLICAN WOULD HAVE SIGNED IN T HE PAST. IT IS A SOR T OF BIZARRO WORLD IN A GOOD WAY. THESE ARE G OOD STEPS THE REPUBLI CAN PARTY NEEDS TO TAKE. >> ONE THING I S AVERTING A TOUCHDOWN W ITH , SHUTDOWN , >> THE DEMOCRA TS SHOULD GET SOME C REDIT FOR THAT, THAT WAS A BIPARTISAN LOOK AT HOW DEMOCR ATS A ND REPUBLI CANS CAME TOGETHER. >> THAT THE DE MOCRATIC PARTY IS BE ING HIJAC KED AN D MOVED FURTH ER TO THE LEFT IS A MYTH. IF YOU LOOK AT 2016 AND TH E CANDIDATES THAT RAN AND WON THEY WERE ALL PR ETTY MODERATE AND CENTRIST. T HE PARTY H AS NOT BEC OME MORE LIBERA L OR MORE LEFTIS T, IT HAS BECOME MORE CENTERED BECAUSE OF THE NUMB ER OF NEW CENTRIST DEMOCRATS T HAT HAVE ENTERE D THE PARTY. HOST: 60 FR ESHMEN DEMOCRATS J OINED THE HOUSE, I TH INK 58 IS THE NUMBER ON JANUARY 3 O F 2019. THE CALLER BRINGS UP A LEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORT EZ, THERE IS AL SO ILHAN OMAR. >> MAX ROSE, Y OU HAVE LA UREN UNDE RWOOD IN ILLINOIS , KATIE PORTE R IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS ALL OVER TH E COUNTRY. WE WON SEAT S I N OKLAHOMA AND GEORGIA. >> DOES IT FRU STRAT E YOU HOW MUCH ATTENTION THE SQUAD G OT? DOUG: I THI NK IT WAS A DE LIBERATE STRATEGY BY REPUBLIC ANS TO FOCUS ON THEM FOR PO LITICAL REASONS. WHICH IS ES SENTIALLY USING GOING AFTER FOUR WOMEN OF COLOR IN A WAY TO CREATE THIS PERCEP TION OF THE PARTY THEY COULD USE TO MOTIVATE TH E VOTERS THEY NEED T O MOTIVATE WHICH IS PRIMARILY W HITE WORKING-CLA SS VOTERS AND CREATE THIS SENSE THAT THIS I S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS AN D THEY ARE OUT OF TOUCH. AOC AND THE SQUAD ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND ON A LOT OF ISSUES THERE IS SU PPORT FOR WHAT AOC IS PUSHING ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PARTY AS A WHOLE, THER E IS NO WAY AROUND THE FACT THAT IT HAS MOVED IN A MORE CENTER ED POSITION THAN HOUSE REPUBLICANS . THE HOUSE R EPUBLICANS ARE RUN BY THE FREEDOM CAUCUS. PHILLIP: DO UG IS 100% RIGHT RIGHT NOW. IF TRUMP WE RE TO WIN IN 2020 , WE HA VE SEEN THE TEA PAR TY AND TRYING TO T HROW OUT MITT ROMNEY FOR A MORE MODERATE CANDIDATE. AFTER 2020 YOU MA Y SEE THAT THE GROUP - - TH E SQUAD T HAT THEY B ECOME THE LEADERS OF THE PARTY BECAUSE PEO PLE ARE SO FED UP WITH LOSING THAT THE PROGRESSIVE S HAVE A LARGER TAKE OF THE PART Y. DONALD TRUM P'S MOST DISRUP TIVE MOVEMENT IN POLITICS , THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATION REPUBLICANS HAD THAT STARTED UNDER THE A DMINISTRATION. IT CULMINAT ED IN THE TEA PARTY AND THEN GREW A FTER LOSIN G IT W AS A TAKEOVER OF OUR PARTY. I WILL SAY LET'S SEE HOW IT LOOKS AFTER 2020. DOUG: IF YO U WERE JUST WATCHI NG FOX NEWS YO U WOULD THINK THE SQUAD I S RUNNING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF Y OU ARE LOO KING AT A BROADE R SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND NEWS MEDIA I THINK YOU WOULD H AVE A CLEA RER SEN SE OF WHAT THE PARTY LOOKS LIKE. IT IS A DIVERSE PARTY. WE H AVE ALW AYS BEEN A DIVE RSE PARTY. I AM PROUD OF TH E DIVERSI TY WITHIN OUR PARTY AND THE PRESIDE NTIAL CANDIDATES. WHEN YOU LO OK AT THE FORM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THERE IS A CLEAR CENTR IST, MIDDLE LANE THE VOTERS THAT BELIEVE THE PARTY SHOULD BE PRAGMATI C, THEIR MOST IMPORTANT C ONCERN , THEY DON'T NECES SARILY BELIEVE IN RADICAL REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE. HOST: WE PL AYED SOME DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIA L CAMPAIGN ADS. I WANTED TO P LAY ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S RECENT CAMP AIGN ADS. THE TRUMP C AMPA IGN TRYING TO DEFINE W HAT THE PR ESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FIELD IS AN D WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT. >> IT WAS MORE LIKE A STUDENT COUNCIL DEBATE. >> YOU WOULD TURN 82 AT THE E ND OF YOUR TURN. YOU'D BE TH E OLDEST PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HI STORY. I WOULD LOV E TO GIV E EACH OF YOU A COPY OF MY BOOK. >> I SHOULD PR OB ABLY SEND MY BOOK AROUND. >> I WAS ON TR EV OR NOAH 'S SHOW ONCE. >> I MEET FAMI LIES EVERY DAY. >> COULD YOU D O 100,000 SELFIES WITH PEOPLE ? THOSE SELFI ES COST OF NOBODY ANYTHING. >> DO THE MAT H O N THA T. >> A WINE CAVE FULL OF CRYSTALS. $900 A BOTTLE WI NE. >> GO SHAKE TH E MONEY TREE IN THE WINE CAVE. >> I THINK SHE IS A GOOD SIZE FOR THE PRE SIDENT. >> I CAN'T HEL P BUT FEEL THAT WAS DI RECTED AT ME. >> IT IS AN HO NOR AND D ISAPPOINTMENT TO BE THE L ONE CANDIDATE OF COLOR ON THE STAGE TONIGHT. >> DID YOU CAL L MY NAME? IS >> THER E IS SO MEONE WHO IS LOVING THIS CONVERSATION AND HIS NAM E IS DONALD TRUMP. >> LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM BUT NOBODY BRAN DS LIKE DONALD TRUMP. FOUR YEARS AGO LOW ENERGY JOE, LITTLE MARC O, HE K NOWS HOW TO BRAND. I MA KE ADS, W HAT IS GREAT IS YO U LAUGH NO MATTER W HAT FOR THE MOST PART. YOU HAVE EN DORPHINS GOING, YOU ARE LAUGHIN G, T HE BRAND IS IN SERTING ITSELF INTO YOUR HEAD A ND IT IS VERY EFFECT IVE. IF THEY ARE BRANDING THEM AS CHA RACTERS THEY ARE NOT TO BE T AKEN SERIOUSLY. LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK. PEOPL E LOVE TO CRITICIZE THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN FROM 2012. OBAMA SPENT FIVE YEARS RUNNI NG FOR REELECT ION, THEN ROMNEY DID NOT GET THE NOMINAT ION UNTIL NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION DAY. THE AM OUNT OF MONEY THAT OBAMA WAS ABLE TO RAISE, T HE AMOUNT OF ACCOMPLI SHMENTS YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT OUT, ROMNEY HAS NINE MONTHS TO MAKE A CASE TO THE AMERICAN PE OPLE. THIS IS WHA T TRUMP IS DOING. T RUMP HAS H AD THREE YEARS WHERE HE IS MAKING THE CASE. HE HA S ALL THE MONEY, HIS SUPER PAC HAS THE MONEY. THE DNC DOE S NOT HAVE A TON OF MONEY RIGHT NOW, I THINK THEY ARE IN DEBT. THERE ARE A DVANTAGES TO INCUMBEN CY. THE ADVERTI SEMENT RIGHT HERE IS TO RAISE MONEY MORE THAN ANYTHING EL SE AND GET PEOPLE EXCITED. I DO NOT TH INK IT WILL SWA Y A LOT OF VOTERS, IT WILL GET THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING HIM TO GET MONEY THAT THEY CAN USE TO RUN ADS ELSEWHE RE. >> I AM NOT SU RE TH IS IS UP ON TV ANYWHERE. IT IS TARGE TIN G B ASE REPUBL ICANS. THIS IS NOT A PERSUASION ADDED THAT HE IS RUNNI NG. THIS IS INT ENDED TO RAISE MONEY AND A LL CAM PAIGNS AIMED AT THE BASE TRY TO CREATE THESE DEBATE MOMENT VIDE OS. PETE HAS ON E AS WELL. I DON'T KNO W HOW EFFECTIVE THIS WILL BE FOR ACTUAL AVAILABLE VOTERS. IT IS A CLE VER FUNNY THING , THEY CAN HAVE AS MUCH FUN IF NOT MORE CLIPPING TO GETHER THE CRAZY THINGS TRUM P SAYS AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCES. CALLER: GOO D MORNING, THANK YOU C-SPAN. I AM CALLIN G BEC AUSE I W ANT TO HEAR ANY COMMENT S FROM YOUR GUESTS ABOU T GOVER NOR WELLS CHALLENGE T O PRESIDENT T RUMP. I KNOW THAT C-SPAN HAS HAD THE M ON A BUNCH OF TIMES BU T O THER THAN YOU GU YS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE NEW STA TIONS, G OVERNOR WELLS IS NO T GETTING A LOT OF PUBL ICITY. THERE ARE S OME ST ATES THAT WILL N OT HAVE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. FORTUNATELY I LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THERE IS A REPUBLICA N PRIMARY AND I WILL BE VOTING F OR GOVERNOR WELLS IN THAT PRIMAR Y. ANYTHING AB OUT HIM AS A CA NDIDATE O R ABOUT NOT HAVING REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN ANY STAT E. HOST: THE C -SPAN VIDEO ARCHI VES, BILL WELLS WITH 102 VIDEOS INCL UDING H IS SIT-DOWN CO NVERSATION ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDE NT ON OCTOBER 25 THAT VIEWER S CAN WATCH. >> DONALD TRUM P HAS 9 0% OF THE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIV ES OR ART CORE. THAT IS A V ERY LARGE NUMBER. I BELIEVE H E WILL END UP GETTING THAT NUMBER HIGHER BEFORE ELECTION DA Y. WELLS IS A GOOD M AN AND HAS GOO D POLICY IDEAS. THERE IS NO OXYGE N FOR HIM. HOST: DOUG, DO YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN? DOUG: I AGR EE. I THINK THE BIGGEST THR EAT THE TRUMP CAMPA IGN HAS TO WORRY ABOUT IS A REPUBL ICA N RUNS AS A THIRD PARTY. AND THEY SH AVE OFF H ALF A POIN T IN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND PENNSYL VANIA. DOUG: , P HILLIP: DE MOCRATS W ERE WORRIED ABOUT BLOOMBERG F OR A WHILE. DOUG: YOU T AKE JI LL STEIN OUT OF THE EQUATIO N AND 2018 , 201 6 ARE TA LKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S R EELECTION CAMPAIGN. HOST: FROM MASSAC HUSETTS, GO AHEAD. CALLER: GOO D MORNIN G. A QUICK EDITORIAL QUESTION. I LOVE WHEN Y OU COME UP WITH THE TAX LINE BU T LO TS OF TIMES I DON'T GET CONFIRMATIO N ON IT. I DON'T KNO W IF THERE IS A REASON OR NOT. HOS T: ON TH E TEXT LI NE AS I UNDERS TAND IT USUALLY THERE IS A CONFIRMATIO N TEXT THAT C OMES BACK TO SAY THAT WE RECEIVED IT. IF NOT I CA N CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT. (202) 748-8003 IS OUR TEXTING SERVICE THA T WE HAVE JUST BEGUN IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. GO AHEAD. C ALLER: I A PPRECIATE THAT. MY QUESTION AS I TEXTED, C ON TRARY TO POSTELECTION RHETORIC TH E SUPREME COURT WAS NOT A M AJOR ISSUE ON THE LAST ELECTION AN D I REALLY DON'T HEAR A TON ABOUT IT THIS ELECTION EITHER. TWO QUESTIO NS TO EITHER GENTLEMAN, WHY NOT? HO W MANY PI CKS DO YO U THINK MIGHT COME UP BEFORE 2024 ? I DON'T IMA GINE GINSBURG WI LL BE SERVING AT THE END OF THE NEXT ELECTION AN D I AM HOPING THAT THOMAS, IF TRUMP GETS ELECTE D, MIGHT TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM AN D LET TRUMP N OMIN ATE SO MEONE. DOUG: TRADI TIONAL LY THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN A STRONGER DEVICE THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE USED TO MOTIVATE THEIR VOTERS. PARTICULARL Y IN SENATE RACES. BUT ALSO THE PR ESIDE NT C AME OUT WI TH HIS LIST OF PEOPLE T HAT HE WIL L NOMINATE TO THE COURT BACK IN 2016. THAT WILL H ELP BRING IN SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE ON THE FENCE. THEY HAVE T RADIT IONAL LY DONE A BETT ER JOB OF USING THE COURT A S A POLITICAL TOOL, NOW T HAT MAY BE CHANGING. YOU ARE SEE ING A LOT OF ANTI-CHOICE LAWS EATING BROUGHT ABOUT. MOVING TOWA RDS THE SUPREME COURT. THAT IS GOI NG TO BE AN ISSUE IN CE RTAIN PLA CES. AS FAR AS S PECULAT ING WHO IS GOING TO RETIRE I REALLY DON'T KNOW. THAT MAY HA VE TO DO WITH WHO WINS IN 202 0. I CANNOT RE ALLY SPEAK TO THAT. PHILLIP: IT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR REPUBLICANS . TRUMP HAS N OMINATED AND CONFIRMED O VER 150 OR MAYBE 180 JUDGES, THI S IS A B IG ISSUE INTERNALLY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS A G REAT BRANDING TOOL. WE DO TALK ABOUT THIS WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT I S TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. TO TRUMP PU TTING ON HIS , I T W AS A VERY TRANSPARENT MOVE, HERE IS WHO I'M GOING TO NOMINATE AN D IT HAD A BIG EFFEC T. IF I WAS A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST I WOULD SAY, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. D EMOCRATS H AVE GAINED TRAC TION BY SAYING ""HE RE IS MY LIST OF JUDGES."" TH AT WOULD BENEFIT THE CANDIDA TE OVER TIME. HOST: THERE IS ST ILL A LOT OF CAMP AIGN YOU CAN WATCH AND 2019 AND YO U CAN WATCH IT ON THE C-SPAN NETWORK INCLUDING TODAY. JOE BIDEN H OLDING A T OWN HALL IN PET ERSBURG, NORTH CAROLINA.

IT IS UNFAI R AND UNJUST THAT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY TRASH ED TUL SI GABBARD WHO IS A GOOD WOMAN, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT AGREE WITH HER POLITICALLY. MY POINT IS TH E VICTORY FOR PRESIDENT T RUMP AND F OR BORIS JOHNSON IN ENGLAND WAS A VICTO RY FOR LOW TAXES, LOWER TAXES, MORE JOBS, COMMO N SENS E WHICH IS IMPORTANT, SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT , SUPPORT FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION , AND A DEFEAT FO R THE CORRUPT FAKE NEWS MEDIA HERE AND IN ENGLAND WHO FAVORED THE VERSION OF THE DEMO CRATIC PARTY WHICH LOST HISTORIC LO SSES AND A DEFEAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS E XTREME ABORTION, A LLOWING BA BIES TO BE KILLED WHILE THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING BORN. AND THE DEMOCRA TS, A DEFEAT FOR THEIR EARLY RELEA SE OF CRIMINALS LIKE CALIFO RNIA HAS BEEN DOING AND THE CRI ME RATE HAS BEEN GOING UP, L IKE NA NCY PELOSI'S SAN FRANCIS CO D ISTRICT WI TH THEIR HOMEL ESSNES S DRUG INFESTATION CRIME AND D ISEASE S. HOST: YOU B RING UP A LOT OF TOPICS, JUS T ABOUT TWO MINUTES LEFT IN OUR PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL SPLIT THEM.

AN D WITH TH E FIRST L INE OF QUESTIONING , STEPHEN , , ASSISTANT M ANAGING EDITOR OF THE ""WASHIN GTON TIMES."" >> BRANDON, BO RDER APPREHENSION NUMBERS ARE DOWN DRAMATICALLY FROM THE PE AK OF THE SURGE IN MAY AND JUNE. I'M W ONDERI NG, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY ARE THO SE N UMBERS DOWN AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHO GETS CREDIT FOR THAT? MR. J UDD: Y OU FIRST H AVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT T HE DRIVING FACTOR THAT PULLS PEOPLE TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY, AND THE MAIN MA GNET THAT WE CALL IT IS THE CATC H AND RELEASE PROGRAM. AN Y TIME TH AT PEOPLE CROS S THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND KNOW TH EY ARE JUST GOING TO BE RELEASED IN TO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES TO WAIT FOR AN ASYLUM O R DEPORTATION HEARING THEY , PEO PLE TEND TO CROSS OUR BORDERS ILL EGALLY IN LARGE NUMBERS. EV ER SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STARTED THE MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS OR THE WEIGHT IN - - WAIT IN MEX ICO P ROGRAM THOSE NUMBE RS HAVE DECREASED D RAMATICALLY, BECAUSE PEOPLE DON' T WANT TO WAIT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY PENDING THEIR ASYLUM OR D EPORTATION PROCEEDING. SO ONCE WE TURNED THAT MAGNET OFF, ONCE W E ENDED THAT MAGNET, THE NUMBERS DROPPED EXPONENTIALLY. AND FRANKLY , THE ADMINISTRAT ION, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES T HAT YOU CAN GIVE CR EDIT TO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONE S WHO CUT THIS DEAL WITH T HE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A DEAL THAT ANY AD MINISTRATION PRIOR TO THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HA VE HAD BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT'S G OING TO ALLOW TO US , ALLOW US TO CONTROL THE BORDER, BUT YOU HAVE TO ALS O UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DEAL C OULD END A T ANY TIME IF THE MEXI CAN GOV ERNMENT STOPS IT. A ND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE CON GRESS STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND D O THEIR JOB. STEPHE N: WH AT WAS IT ABOUT THE TRUMP A DMINISTRATION THAT, AS YO U SAID, ANY PREVIOUS AD MINISTRATION COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS DONE , WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRAT ION THAT MANAGED TO GET THIS DO NE? MR. JUDD: THE MAIN THING IS TH E TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO ACCEPT NO FOR AN ANSWER. IF YOU LOOK AT ANY PREV IOUS ADMINISTRATION, THERE IS AL WAYS ROAD BLOCKS THAT GET TH ROWN IN, IN THE WAY OF TRYING T O ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING TH AT'S DONE ADMINISTRAT IVELY. IN THIS PAR TICULAR CASE, THE TRUMP ADMIN ISTRATION SAW A PROBLEM. PRESIDENT T RUMP RAN ON A CAMPAIGN TH AT HE WAS GOING TO SECURE THE BORDER, AND HE REFUSED TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, CONTINUED T O PUSH FORWARD, AND FRANKLY , WAS ABLE TO GET A HISTORIC DEAL DONE. STEPH EN: LE T ME FOLLOW UP W ITH , >> LET ME FOLL OW UP WITH THE BORDER ISSUE WITH CONGRESS ALLOCATING WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. WH AT WILL T HE BORDER LOOK LIKE A YEAR FROM N OW? MR. JUDD: I THI NK WHAT YOU'RE GOIN G TO SE E IS WHAT THE EXPERTS HAVE CONSTA NTLY TOLD CONGRESS WE NEED. WE NEED INFRASTRUCT URE. WE NEED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TECHNOLO GY. WE NEED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MANPOWER . P ART OF THA T INFRASTRUCTURE, IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING T HAT IS GOI NG TO BE VISIBLE, IS GOING TO BE PHYSICAL BARRIERS IN STRATEGI C LOCATIONS. WE'RE NOT T ALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL BA RRIERS FR OM CALIFORNIA TO TEXAS. W E'R E TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL BA RRIERS IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS T HAT ALLOW US TO CONTROL SPE CIFIC PARTS OF THE BORDER AND DICTATE WHERE ILLEGAL BORDER CROS SINGS TAKE PLACE AS WELL AS ILLEGAL NARCOTICS. IF WE CAN DICTATE THAT, THEN WE CAN BE MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR JOBS . >> AN D WHAT ROLE IS THE PRESIDE NT'S SON-IN-LAW JARED KUSHNER GOI NG TO HAVE IN ALL OF THIS, IN TH E CONSTRUCTION OF THESE SELEC T BORDER WALLS? >> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO , MR. JUDD: I DON 'T KNOW IF HE'S GOI NG TO HAVE ANY , I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE ANY ROLE AS FAR AS CONS TRUC TING THE BORDER WALL. I DO KNOW THAT J ARED KUSHNER HAS PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN ENSURING TH AT THESE DEALS HAVE GOTTEN DONE . NOT ONLY WITH MEXICO BUT WITH GUATEMALA AND NOW HON DURAS AND EL SALVADOR. H E HAS PLAY ED A HUGE ROLE IN THA T. NOW, WHETHER HE PLAYS ANY ROLE WH ATSOEVER IN THE CONSTRU CTION OF THE WALL S, I HAVE NO IDEA. >> NB C NEWS IS REPORTIN G HE'LL PLAY A BIG ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE CONSTRU CTION OF THE WALL? MR. JUDD: I THI NK THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YO U LOOK AT HIS BUSINESS BACKGROUND. I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER T HINGS YOU HAVE TO LOO K AT AS FAR AS THIS ADMINISTRAT ION GOES, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, AT LEAST THE SEGMENT THAT VOTED FOR P RESIDENT TRUMP, THEY WANTED A BU SINESS-MINDED INDIVIDUAL IN OFFICE. THE Y DIDN'T WANT THE TYPICAL POL ITICIAN THAT WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TI ME AG AIN AND JARED K USHNER DOES HAVE A HUGE EXPERTISE IN THE BUSINESS WO RLD, SO IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF SO MEBODY WITH A BUSINESS MIND RATHER THAN A POLITICAL MIND DID OV ERSEE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE AGA IN, THAT'S A BUSINESS ASPECT. >> LET'S TURN TO REBEKAH MORIN. REBEKAH: HI , IS THE NATI ONAL BOARD PATRO L COUNCIL GOING TO ENDORSE PRESIDENT T RUMP IN 2020? MR. JUDD: WE HA VEN'T MADE THAT D ECISION YET. WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT F ACTORS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE VERY PLEASED, TH E NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL IS VERY PLEASED WIT H WHAT T HE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO A CCOMPLISH, WITH WHAT HE IS CURRE NTLY ACCOMPLISHI NG. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TAKING A LO OK AT THAT AS WE SPEAK. REBE KAH: AN D DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS ABOUT WHEN THAT WILL COME OUT? OBVIOU SLY T HE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED YOU A VERY GOOD FRIEND, SO YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHI P WITH THE PRESIDENT. SO I WAS WO NDERING I F THAT'S GOING TO CO NTINUE ON TO 2020? MR. J UDD: I HAVE TO T ELL YOU THAT MY OWN PERSONAL RELATIONSHI P IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT W HAT MY ORGANIZATION NEEDS DONE. I WIL L WORK FOR MY ORGANIZATION THE BEST TH AT I POSSIBLY CAN, AND I WILL DO THE BEST FOR THOSE THAT I REPR ESENT, THE BEST THAT I POSSIBLY CAN. I WOUL D IMA GINE THAT A DECISION WI LL BE MAD E ON WHOM WE'RE GOING TO EN DORSE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE EVEN GOING TO. I MEAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THE FIRST P ERSON THAT WE EVER ENDORS ED FOR PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE BACK IN 2016. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE DECISIO N WOULD BE MADE IN FEBRUARY. R EBEKAH, TO BE COMPLETELY FRANK AND H ONEST WITH YOU, OBVIOU SLY WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT T HE PRESIDENT H AS DONE. WHAT HE CONTINUES TO TRY TO DO FOR B OTH AGENTS AND BORDER SECU RITY AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AS F AR AS BORDER SECURITY IS RELATED. SO THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE WE STAND ON WH AT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. S TEP HEN: SO QUICK FOLLOW UP - - IS TH ERE ANY REASON WHY YOU WOU LD NOT ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP? MR. JUDD: THERE ARE, AGAIN, THERE ARE A LOT O F FACTORS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK INT O. WE HAVE TO SPEAK WITH OUR ME MBERS. WE HAVE TO SPE AK WITH OUR LOCAL ELECT ED REPRESENTAT IVES. WE HAVE TO SPE AK WITH ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND WE HAVE N'T DONE THAT Y ET. BUT AGAIN, I DO THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY P USHBACK? I F THAT IS THE DIRE CTION WE THINK WE SHOULD GO? NO, I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY PUSHBACK. STEPHEN: BR ANDON, I KNOW A CO UPLE OF YEARS AG O, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, THERE WAS SOME FRUSTR ATION AMONG AGENTS ABOUT THE PACE OF ACTIVITY ON THE ADMINISTRAT ION'S PART. YOU AND I HAVE ACTU ALLY TALKED AT S OME POINTS ABOUT, THINKING TH E ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE PUSHED HARDER AND FASTER, AFTER THAT INITIAL DROP IN NUM BERS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS INAUGUR ATED . WHAT IS THE CURRENT, I GUESS, SENT IMENT AMONG AGENT S? ARE THEY , IS THERE STILL A FRUSTRATION ? WHAT'S YOUR SENSE FOR THE AGENTS AND THIS WH ITE HOUSE AND THIS PRESIDENT T O THIS POINT? MR. JUDD: N O. AT THIS POI NT RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NO FRUST RATION BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THE PROGRAMS COME TO FRUITION. W HERE WE WE RE VERY FRUSTRATED IS IF YOU L OOK ED AT THE LEAD ERSHIP THAT WE HAD AT D HS, THE MOVEMENT WA S VERY SLOW. WE KN EW WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN. WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO AS A , WE KNE W THAT WE NEEDED TO START THE M IGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOLS VERY EARLY ON, AND, FRANKL Y, THE DHS KEPT PUSHING BAC K, AND IT WASN'T THE ADMINIS TRATION. THE ADMINIS TRATION CONTINUED T O PUSH FOR WARD BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SEGMEN TS OF GOVERNMENT, AS WE'VE SE EN, YOU'VE GOT CAREER EMPL OYEES THAT PUSH BACK ON POL ITICA LS, AND THAT'S JUST THE FA CT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT WE CUR RENTL Y HAVE. BUT WE HAVE SEE N PRESIDENT TRUMP DID, IN FAC T, GET WHAT HE NEEDED TO G ET DONE, AND SO THAT IS NOW GOING F ORWARD. ST EPHEN: ON E QUICK NOTE ON THE BORDER WALL. THE C OST OF THIS BORDER WALL IS COMING IN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE WALL BUILDING AT THE END OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRAT ION AND WHAT WALL WAS BUILT OR FE NCING WAS BUILT UNDER PRESIDENT O BAMA. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT COST SITUATION? AND WE'VE SEEN SOME R EPORTING R ECENTLY AB OUT EVEN THE NEW DESIGN, THE CURRENT DES IGN, BEING ABLE TO BE BREACHED. I KNOW THERE ARE C ERTAINLY VIEWERS OUT THERE W HO ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE E FFICACY OF A WALL SYST EM THAT CAN STILL BE BR EACHED. I WOULD BE CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGH TS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO BREACH THIS FROM YOUR E XPERIENCE, AND SORT OF HOW IT PLAYS IN TO THE WALL SY STEM? MR. JUDD: OK. S O, I'M GOI NG TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION FIRST. SO, YES. TH ERE WAS A REPOR T OUT THERE THAT NEW SEGMENTS OF THE WALL HAD BEEN BREACHED. Y ET, WE HAVE GON E OUT AND LOOKED AT A LL OF T HE NEW SECTIONS OF THE WALL AND I HAVE YET TO FIND ANY NEW SECTIONS OF THE WALL THAT H AVE BEEN BREACH ED. OLD SECTIONS, Y ES, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY BREACH ES AND HAD THE ADMINIS TRAT ION CONTINUED TO BUILD SE CTIONS OF WALL LIKE WHAT WAS BU ILT UNDER THE BUSH ADMINI STRAT ION, THOSE WALLS WERE BREACH ABLE, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF RESE ARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS GO NE INTO THE NEW WALLS THAT ARE CURRENT LY BEING BUILT. THAT RESEAR CH AND DEVELOPMENT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE MUCH, MUCH MORE DIFFIC ULT TO BREACH, AND AGAIN, WE J UST HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BREACHE S. N OW THAT RE PORT THAT WAS DONE, THERE WAS A COMPLETE DIAGRAM THA T WAS GI VEN TO SHOW HOW THESE BOLLA RDS ST YLE FENCES COUL D BE MO VED. THER E WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT STUFF BUT A LL OF THAT WAS BASED UPON THE OLD MODEL. THE NEW MODEL, AGAIN, WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BR EACHES IN THAT. >> RE BEKAH MORIN. REBE KAH: HI , YES. SO THE RE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE, O BVIOUSLY, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS - - GOT INTO OFFICE HE ASKED FO R AN INCREASE OF BORDER PATR OL AGENTS ALONG THE BORDER, UP TO 5,000 . AND THERE H AS BEEN A STRUGGLE WITH THAT, OF COURSE, DUE TO FUNDING FRO M CONGRESS, BUT I WANT TO K NOW FROM YOU WHAT KI ND OF FUNDING IS NEEDED TO TRAIN AN D H ELP KEEP ETHICA L TRAINING ALONG THE BOARD T HESE BOARD , BORDER PATR OL AGENTS, ESP ECIALLY WITH NEWER, YOUN GER AGENTS COMI NG IN. MR. JUD D: YES, I ACTUALLY STOOD WITH RESPECT TO TRUMP ON JANUARY , WITH PRESIDENT T RUMP ON JANUARY 25 OF 2017 WHEN HE SIGNED THE BORDER SECU RITY EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLING FOR 5,000 NEW BORDER PATROL AGENTS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN AB LE TO ADD TO OUR RANK S VERY MUCH B ECAUSE WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGH EST ATTRITION RATES IN TH E ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE A LOT O F FACTORS THAT GO INTO WHY OU R ATTRITION RATES ARE S O HIGH. BUT O NE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IS THE CONSTANT DEMONIZING OF OUR AGENTS FOR DOING T HE JOB CONGRESS SET US UP T O DO. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK , THERE HAVE BEEN S PECIF IC CO NGRESSMAN , , CONGRESSMEN , CONGRESSWOM EN, WHO HAVE TA KEN THEIR SHOTS AT US AND A LL WE'RE DOING IS ENFORCING THE LAW THA T CONGRESS PUT INTO PLACE. THAT THAT BODY, THAT THEY ARE NO W A PART OF, PUT INTO PLACE AND W HEN WE'RE DEMONIZED BY BOTH THE MEDIA, BY CONGRESS, AND BY OUTS IDE ENTITIES, IT'S NOT , IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR A CONDUCIVE P LACE TO WO RK THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFOR TABLE WITH WHAT THEY ARE DOING. AND SO WE'V E GOT TO GET RID OF THAT. WE'VE GOT T O UNDERSTAND THAT BORDER PATR OL AGENTS ARE SIMPLY OUT THERE D OING, ENFORCING THE LAWS TH AT CONGRE SS ENACTED. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYIN G TO S ECURE THE BORDER FOR THE AMERICA N PEOPLE. WE GET CALL ED RACIST. WE GET CALL ED NAZIS, AND IT'S RIDICU LOUS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE WHOLE R ACIS T THING, BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW WE'RE THE ONLY FEDERA L LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN T HE ENTIRE NATION THAT HAS MORE MI NORITIES THAN WE DO WHITES, YET WE'RE CALLED RACISTS SIM PLY BECA USE WE'RE ENFORCING THE LAWS TH AT CONGRESS ENACTED. >> STEPHEN. ST EPHEN: I ACTUALLY WANTED TO FOLLOW UP. SOME OF THAT CRI TICISM, THERE WAS ONE IN PART ICULAR THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTIO N OVER THE SUMMER, THE ALLEGATION THAT, I GUESS, AG ENTS IN A FACILITY IN TEXAS HA D TOLD A MIGRANT WOMAN TO DR INK WATER OUT OF A TOILET. AND I'M WONDERI NG, THAT SPECIF ICALLY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THAT ALLEGATION AND MORE BR OADLY, I KNOW THE INSPECT OR GENERAL HAS DONE SEVERAL REP ORTS ON THE CONDITIONS AT THOSE BO RDER FACILITIES. MONEY WAS PUMPED INTO THOSE BORDE R FACILITIES IN AN EMERGENC Y SUPPLEMENTAL EARLIER THI S YEAR TO TRY AND EASE THE OV ERCROWDIN G. I'M CURIOUS, FIRST OF ALL, YOU R THOUGHTS ON THE OVERALL SIT UATION AT THOSE BORDER FACI LITIES, AND THEN THE BROADER SENSE OF SOME OF THESE COMPLAINTS OF TREATMENT. MR. JUDD: SO TH E ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE MADE THAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS TOLD INDIVIDUALS TO DRINK OUT OF A TOILET, I BELIEVE T HAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE PROVEN C OMPLETELY AND TOTALLY FAL SE. WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS TO UNDERSTA ND IS THAT WE DO HAVE CAMERA S THAT ARE IN THES E FACILITIES. NOW, WE OBVIOUSLY C ANNOT SEE INTO TH E RE STROOM PORTION OF THE FACI LITIES, THAT'S OPEN TO EVE RYBOD Y, BUT WE HAVE CAMERAS THR OUGHOUT THESE FACIL ITIES AND THESE CAMERAS CAN SEE WHA T IS TAKING PLACE IN THERE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT E VER HAPPENED. I WILL DISPUTE THAT 100%. I HAV E SPOKEN WITH AGENTS MULT IPLE TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A FALSE NARRATIVE. BUT IT'S VERY E ASY, IF YOU'RE IN CUSTODY, TO MAKE ALL EGATIONS AGAINST BORDER PATR OL AGENTS, AND AGAIN, THOSE ALLEG ATIONS WILL BE INVESTIG ATED AND THEY WILL B E INVESTIGATED IN FULL, BU T THAT ALLEGATION, I AM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE WILL COME O UT TO BE A FALSE ALLEGATION. THESE FACIL ITIES, THERE IS AN ISSUE TH AT I WILL ABSOLUTELY 100% AGREE WITH CONGRESS ON. OUR FAC ILITIES WERE NOT MADE TO HOLD IND IVIDUALS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. IN FA CT, WE'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO HOLD PEOPLE FOR 72 HOURS. YET WE ENDE D UP HOLDING PEO PLE FOR DAYS ON END. I MEAN, IN SO ME CASES, WE WERE HOLDING PEO PLE FOR 30 DAYS IN THESE FACIL ITIES THAT WERE ONLY MADE T O HOUSE AND HOLD PEOPLE FOR 72 HOURS. AND THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAD NOWH ERE TO TURN THEM OVER TO. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DIDN'T HAVE ANY ROOM FOR THESE INDIV IDUALS . ICRO DIDN'T HAVE ROOM FOR TH ESE INDIV IDUALS , AND SO WE HAD TO HOLD ON TO THEM UNTIL HHS, COULD MAKE ROOM FOR THESE PEOPLE. OR ICRO COU LD MAKE ROOM FOR THESE PEOPLE. SO WE WERE PUTTING INTO A NO-WIN SI TUATION. CONGRESS WASN'T GIVI NG US THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED , NEEDED. THE Y WEREN'T GIVING US THE FACI LITIES AND YET THEY TURNED AROUND AND BLAMED US FOR DOING T HE NECESSARY JOB THAT WE HAD TO D O UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY P UT US UNDER. THAT WAS , AGAI N, THAT WAS DEMORAL IZING AND COMPLETELY WRONG. >> I 'M CURIOUS, WHAT YOU JUST DE SCRIBED AS SO DIAMETRICAL LY OPPOSED TO WHAT WE DID HERE OUT OF SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO VISITED THESE FACILITIES, I'M STRUCK BY THE DIFFERENCE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BORDER WALL. THERE ARE FOLKS ON CAPITOL HIL L WHO SAY THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFEREN CE, AND I KNOW THAT Y OU AND FELLOW AGENTS SAY THAT IT DOES MAK E A DIFFERENCE. WHERE DID W E GET TO THIS POINT OF TH IS DISCONNECT? AND HOW ARE VIEWERS SUPPOSED TO SORT THR OUGH THESE COMPETING C LAIMS? MR. JUDD: THIS IS STRICTLY PO LITICS. Y OU'VE GOT , AND AGAIN, IT HAPPENS ON BOTH THE RIGHT A ND THE LEF T, SO LET'S NOT BLAME O NE SIDE. BUT P OLITICS BEING WHAT THEY ARE, Y OU'VE GOT THE LEF T THAT ARE SAYING THAT THE BO RDER WALL JUST ABSOLUTELY DOESN'T WOR K. NOW, I WILL REFUTE THAT EVERY SINGL E DAY. I SPEN T A LARGE MAJORITY, A ND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS I'M , ABOU T THIS , I'M SPEAKING FO R AND ON BEHALF O F THE NATIONAL BOARD PATROL COUN CIL RIGHT NOW, BUT I CAN BRING I N SPECIFIC CASES OF WH EN I WAS A BORDER PATROL AGENT. BUT WHEN I WAS A BORDER PATROL AGEN T IN AR IZONA, I WORKED TH ERE PRE-WALL AND THE NUM BERS WERE ABSOLUTELY ASTRONOMICA L. A SMALL STR ETCH OF BORDER THAT WAS AB OUT 56 MILES TH AT WE COVERED AT THAT PAR TICULAR BORDER PATROL STATION , WE WERE ARR ESTING O VER 100,000 PEOPLE A YEAR IN THA T SMALL LITTLE STRETCH. THAT WAS PR E-WALL. W E THEN BUI LT THOSE WALLS IN THE STRATEG IC LOCATIONS IN THAT AREA, AND T HOSE NUMBERS DROPPED TO LESS THA N 20,000 PER YEAR. SO YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY SEE THAT WA LLS IN STRATEGI C LOCATIONS WORK. AND T HEY WORK V ERY, VERY WELL. BUT A GAIN, POLI TICS BEING WHAT THEY ARE, POLITI CIANS PANDERING T O THEIR BA SE INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT'S RIGH T FOR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE, THAT'S WHER E YOU GET THIS AR GUMENT CO MING IN, INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING, THIS IS WHA T WE NEED FOR BORDER SECURITY. T HIS IS WHA T WE HAVE TO DO TO GET THE JOB DONE, AND WE JUST HAVEN' T BEE N ABLE TO COME TO A CONSEN SUS YET. STEPHE N: MR . JUDD, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT M EDICAL WAIVERS. WHAT IS THE PROCESS AND HAS IT CHANGED IN ANY WAY IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO, WITH REGARD TO THOSE WHO WANT A MEDICAL WAIVER , E SPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN? MR. JUDD: S O TH E BORD ER PATROL DOESN'T DEA L WITH MEDICAL WAIVERS, SO I CAN'T INTELLIGENTLY SPEAK TO TH AT. THAT' S GOING TO GO TO ICRO THAT D EALS WITH THAT. WHAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS DO, THEY TA KE INDIVIDUALS INTO CUSTODY THA T CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. WE THEN PROCESS THEM ACCORDINGLY AND TURN THEM OVER TO EITHER C ITIZENS AND IMMIGRATION SERVICE, HEALTH AND HUMAN S ERVI CES, OR ICRO, AN D T HAT'S WHER E THOSE DETERMINATIONS ARE BEING M ADE. BUT W HAT I CAN TELL YOU , AND I SAID, I C ANNOT SPEAK COMPLETELY TO THIS, BU T I CAN TELL YOU THAT MEDICA L WAIVERS CONTINUE AS FAR AS I 'M AWARE. THEY CAN CONTINUE TO ASK FOR MED ICAL WAIVERS. PE OPLE CAN CONTINUE TO ASK FOR ASYLUM. ALL OF THESE THINGS STILL EXIST , BUT THE WAY WE'RE IMPLEMENTIN G THESE POLICIES ARE DIFFERE NT THAN WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE O BAMA A DMINISTRATION, SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOL ES THAT HAVE DRAWN SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY. STEPHEN: SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW THAT YOUR AGENTS ARE DOING MORE OF IS INVOLVEM ENT AT THE FRONT END OF THAT ASY LUM PROC ESS, WITH AGENTS BEIN G TRAIN ED TO HANDLE SO-CALLED B EEN , HAN DLE WHAT HAS BEEN CA LLED CREDIBLE FEAR CLAIMS , HAVING A FEAR OF BEI NG RETURNED TO THEIR HO ME COUNTRY. I' M CURIOUS HOW BIG THAT PR OGRAM IS, HOW MANY AGENTS ARE INVOLVED, IF YOU HAVE A SENSE FOR THE EARLY OUTCO MES FOR THAT, WHETH ER IT'S CHANGI NG, THE NUMBERS , OR THE PERC ENTAGES, WHO ARE CRO SSING THAT INITIA L THR ESHOLD, AND THEN, O BVIOUSLY, ALONG WITH THAT, THIS IS TRADITIO NAL LY A DUTY THAT U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRA TION SERVICES HAS DONE, A ND I KNOW GOING INTO THIS, THERE WAS A NUMBER , THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OR SPECULAT ION THAT BOARD PATROL AGEN TS WOULD BE TOO HARSH IN HANDLING THESE CLAIMS. I W OULD BE CU RIOUS AS TO YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW I T'S PLAYING. MR . JUDD: SO TH E PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY VERY SMALL, COMPARATIVE LY SPEAKING. W HAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE DOING IS THEY ARE FILLING IN FOR CITIZEN SHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICE, CI S, WHERE THEY NEED HELP. THE R EASON THAT CIS DE TERMI NED THIS WAS THE PATHWAY FORWARD IS BECAUSE THIS PUTS PEOPLE INTO THE ASYLUM PROCEEDINGS IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN WAITING FOR A COUPL E OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BE PUT INTO THE ASYLUM PROCEEDING. ONCE SOMEBODY IS GIVEN A CREDIBLE FEAR INTERVIEW, IF THEY FAIL T HAT CREDIBLE FEAR INTERV IEW A ND THEY ASK FOR REDETER MINATION, WHICH IS THEIR RI GHT TO DO, THEN AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE, BY REGULATION, MUST HEAR T HE CASE WITHIN 10 DAYS. SO THERE IS A MUCH QUICKER CLOSURE TO THE PROCESS WHICH ALLEV IATES THE IMMIGRATION JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CR OSSIN G THE BORDER AND CLAIMIN G AS YLUM, IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM CLOSURE MUCH QUICKER, RATHER THAN BEING , HAVING TO WAIT IN LIMBO ON WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN D OWN THE ROAD. I THI NK THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ASSET. I TH INK IT'S WORKED EXACTLY AS INTENDED. E VEN, YOU KNOW, THE CRITICI SM THAT BORDER PATROL AGEN TS WOULD BE TOO HARSH, THERE IS AN OVERSIGH T PROCESS TO THIS, TO ENSURE T HAT BORDER PATROL AGEN TS AREN 'T TOO HARSH, BUT THAT CRITICISM, AGAIN, STEP HEN, THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF CRITICIS MS, THAT, AGAIN, TAKES US RI GHT BACK TO THE POLITICS OF THIS ISSUE. THAT CRITICISM, THE LAW SPE CIFICALLY SAYS THE IM MIGRA TION OFFICERS AR E THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN GIVE CR EDIBLE FEAR INTERVIEWS. BORDER PATROL AGEN TS ARE IMMIGRA TION OFFICERS, T HEREFORE, BY THE LAW, THEY CAN CO NDUCT THESE CREDIBLE FEAR INTERV IEWS. IF THE PUBLIC OR THE MEDIA, WHICH WAS THE OUTCRY, AND CERTAIN POLITICIANS , IF THEY WANT T O PROVE THAT BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE CORRUPT OR THAT THEY REFUSE TO D O THEIR JOB CORRECT LY, THEN THEY NEED TO DEAL WIT H THOSE SPECIFIC BORDER PATROL AGEN TS. BUT THE BORDER PATROL AS A WHOLE, THEY DO THEIR JOB, THEY D O IT HONORABLY AND THAT CR ITIC ISM JUST ISN'T JUSTIFIED, AND THE NUMBERS HAVE BORNE IT OUT, AND THE PROGRAM IS WORKING VERY WELL. >> AS YOU KNOW , LAST MONTH, NINE AMERIC AN CITIZENS WERE KILLED IN A HORRIF IC SHOOTOUT BY AT LEAST ONE M EXICAN DRU G CARTEL. JUS T HOW BA D OF A PROBLEM IS IT? HOW WIDESPR EAD ARE THESE CARTELS ALONG THE B ORDER? MR. JUDD: N OTHI NG CROSSES THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. THAT DOES N OT MATTER IF IT'S INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER TO CLAIM ASYLUM. IT DOESN'T MAT TER IF IT'S NARCOTICS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S COUNTERFEIT GOODS. NOTH ING CRO SSES THE SOUTHWEST B ORDER ILLE GALLY WITHOUT THE SAY SO OF C RIMINAL CARTELS. TH EY CONTROL EVERY SINGLE FACET OF IL LEGAL CRIME ON THE BORDER. THE SE CRIMINAL CA RTELS OPERATE IN EVERY SI NGLE TOWN ON THE SOUTHWE ST BORDER AND THEY ARE VERY VI OLENT. TH EY ARE VERY DANGEROUS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE MURDER RATE IN MEXICO TO UNDERSTA ND JUST HOW BAD IT IS. THE UNI TED STATES INTELLIGENC E COMMUNITY HAS ESTIMATED THAT CRIMIN AL CARTELS CONTROL SOM EWHERE AROUND 80% OF THE COUN TRY , IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW. NOW, T HAT AGAIN IS ON THE HIGH EN D. THERE ARE LOWER ESTIMATES, BUT EVEN IF YOU GO LOWER, THE FACT TH AT CRIMINAL CARTELS ARE CONTROL LING ANY PART OF MEXICO S HOULD BE CONCERNING, AND IT MAKE S EVERYTHING VERY, VERY DANGER OUS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BORDER PATR OL AGENTS GET SO FRUSTRATED WITH POLITICIANS THAT SAY IT'S OK FOR PEOPLE TO CROSS TH E BORDER ILLEGALLY. THEY ARE ENCOURAGING , POLITICIANS ARE ENCOURA GING A VERY VULN ERABLE SEGMENT OF POPULATI ON IN SOUTH AM ERICA TO PUT THEM SELVES IN THE HAND S OF CRIMINAL CARTELS. TH ESE INDIVIDUALS AT TIMES ARE RAPED. THEY ARE EN SLAVED. T HEY ARE EVEN MU RDERED BY THE CRIMINA L CARTELS AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE WE DO NOT E NFORCE OUR LAWS TH E WAY THE LAW S ARE WRITTEN AND WE GLAMORIZE I LLEGAL ACT IVITY RATHER THAN , AND I'M SORRY, WE GLAMORIZ E ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND VILIFY OUR BORDER PATR OL AGENTS RATH ER THAN PROPPI NG UP OUR BORD ER PATROL AGENTS AND GOING AFTER THE CARTELS AND TRYING TO SHUT DOW N THIS ILLEGAL SYSTEM THAT EXISTS FOR A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. I H AVE NOT HEARD ONE POLITICIAN, WHETHER IT' S REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT , T HAT IS AGAINST A LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. I H AVE HEAR D AN AWFUL LOT THAT ARE AGAINST AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. >> FINAL QUEST ION, BACK TO STEPHEN DINAN. STEP HEN: YO U MENTION ED THE CARTELS CONTROLLING THAT TRAFFIC AND ONE OF THE THIN GS THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING, NOW THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN SU RGE HAS DISSIPA TED, IS A GROWTH IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO ITSE LF. AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHETHER THA T TIES INTO THE CARTELS, WH Y THAT'S HAPPENING AND SORT OF THE TRAJECT ORIES. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE EARLY NEXT YEAR ON THOSE BORDER NUMB ERS? MR. JUDD: T HIS SHOULD BE PROOF POSITIVE TH AT CRIMINAL CARTELS CONTROL EVE RYTHING THAT'S ILLEGAL. CRIMINAL CA RTELS, THEY KNEW THAT A LOOP HOLE EXISTED AS FAR AS OUR ASYL UM CLAIMS. PUT ONE FOOT INTO THE UN ITED STATES, CLAIM ASYLUM, GET RELEASED UNDER THE CATCH AND R ELEASE PROGRAM. ON ES THAT SHUT D OWN, NOW CRIMINAL CARTELS ARE , THEY ARE SELLING THEIR SERVI CE TO THE MEXICAN CITIZENS, T HE MEXICAN POPULATION, INSTEAD OF IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CO UNTRIES. AND SO WE'R E SEEING A HUGE INCREASE IN PEOPLE F ROM MEXICO THAT ARE CR OSSING OUR BORDER ILLEGALLY, WHEREAS WHEN THE CRIMINAL CA RTELS WERE SELLING IT TO THE C ENT RAL AMERICANS, WE SAW VERY FE W MEXICAN CITIZENS CROSSING TH E BORDER. NOW IT'S BA SICA LLY THE CRIMINAL CARTELS ARE NOW SELLING THEIR SERVICES TO THE MEXICAN CITIZENS AN D THAT'S THE MAIN POPULATION THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. STEPHE N: QU ICK FOLLO W UP. DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE? W HAT DO YOU EXPECT EARLY NEXT YEAR A ND DO WE EXPECT ANOTHER RES URGENCE OF CENTRAL AMERICANS N EXT YEAR, OR DO YOU BELIEVE THA T'S BEEN SOLVED? MR. JUDD: A S LO NG AS THE PROGRAMS CONTINUE IN PLACE, A S LONG AS THESE AGREEMENTS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, GUATEMALA, AS LONG AS THESE PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO EXIST, N O, I DO NOT FORESEE A R ESURGENCE OF CENTRAL AMERICANS. AS LONG AS THE CARTELS CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR LOOPHOL ES TO EXPLOIT, THEY ARE GOING T O BRING AC ROSS WHOMEVER THEY NEED T O. THEY AR E IN THE BUSINESS OF CREATING A PROFIT, AND YES, IT 'S AN ILL ICIT BUSINESS, BUT IT'S A BUSINESS. THEY CREATE AND GENERATE PROFIT, AND SO THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK FOR THOSE THAT CAN GET THE M PROFIT S AND THEY ARE GOING T O SELL THEIR SERVICES TO THEM. >> BR ANDON JUDD, JOINI NG US FROM MONTAN A ON THIS HOLIDA Y WEEK, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATI ONAL BORDER PATROL COUN CIL. THANK YOU FOR BEING W ITH US. HAPPY NEW YEAR. MR. J UDD: MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY N EW YEAR TO BOTH OF YOU, REBEKAH AND STEPHEN , TH ANK YOU VERY MU CH. >> IF YOU READ THE POLITIC AL TEA LEAVES IT SEEMS THAT AN END ORSEMENT IS IN THE OFFING FOR PRESIDE NT TRUMP. REBEKAH: YES. DEFINI TELY. HE SAID AROUND FEBRUARY, I BELIEVE. SO HE'S, AGAIN , THAT'S THE FIRST PRESI DENT THAT THE NA TIONAL BORDER PATR OL COUNCIL HAS EVER ENDORSED. I T SOUNDS L IKE THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN . I EX PECT TO H EAR IT SOON, AND MAYBE P OSSIBLY WI TH PRESIDENT TRUMP BY HI S SIDE. >> ST EPHEN, LE T ME FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT. YOU BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF TH E DRUG CA RTEL S AND JUST HOW PREVALE NT T HEY ARE ALONG THE BORDER, AND A PROBL EM THAT IS NOT GOING A WAY. STEPHEN: IT 'S INTERE STING. I'VE SEEN A HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIAL IN THE LAST CO UPLE OF WEEKS THAT ESTIMATED THAT DROP I N THE NUMBER OF CENTRAL AME RICANS COMING IN HAS LITERALLY T AKEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF THE CARTELS' PROFITS, WH ICH IS WHY YOU HEARD BRAND ON JUD D SAY THAT THE CARTELS ARE NOW LOOKING INT ERNALLY TO MEXICO, REC RUITING, THEY LITERALLY A DVERTISE FOR PEOPLE THROUGH SOC IAL MEDI A IN PARTICULAR, ADVERTISE A ND SAY, HEY, WE CAN GET YOU TO THE U.S., HERE'S THE PATH THAT W E'LL TAKE AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. PAY US OUR MONEY AND WE'LL TAKE YOU AN D HERE'S THE LOOPHOLES T HAT YOU EXPLOIT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE L OST THAT CUSTOMER BASE IN CEN TRAL AMERICA. TH EY ARE NOW TURNING TO MEXICO A ND THEY ARE ACTUALLY TURNING TO FURTHER AFIELD. GOI NG EXTRA CONTINENTAL IS THE WORD THAT HOMELAND SECURITY IS USING NO W, LOOKING AT AFRICA, ASI A, AND OTHER PLACES TO REPLACE THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY H AVE L OST F ROM THE CENTRAL AMERICA. >> VERY QUICKL Y FOR EITHER OF YOU, THE FUNDING ISSUE THAT CONGRE SS PUT INTO PLACE, WHER E DOES THAT STAND RIGHT NOW? WHAT I S THE NEXT STEP? STEPHEN: SO THE MONEY, $1.375 BILLION INC LUDED IN THE APPROPR IATIONS BILL THAT T HE PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED, SO HE HAS A CCESS TO THAT MONEY FOR WALL BU ILDING. WHAT IS UNKNOWN IS WHETHER HE'LL DO WH AT HE DID LAST YEAR A ND ATTEMPT TO SLICE IN MONEY FR OM THE PE NTAGON AGAIN INTO MORE WALL BUILDING. I 'VE BEEN TOLD BY WHI TE HOUSE OFFIC IALS THAT THEY A RE , THE PRESIDE NT HAS ASKED FOR $ 5 BILLION. WH ITE HOUSE OFFICIALS T ELL ME THAT THE $1 .375 BILLION IS ACTUALLY ALL , GIVE N ALL THE MONEY THEY WERE G IVEN LAST YEAR THEY ARE BUMPING UP AGAINST THEIR CAPACITY FOR WALL BU ILDING RIGHT NOW. SO THE Y DON'T NECESSARILY NEED MORE T HAN $1.375 BILLION FRO M CONGRESS, BUT THERE I S A VERY BIG SY MBOL HERE TO THE PRESIDENT O N THE CAMPAIGN TR AIL, HE TALKS ABOUT, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 450 MI LES OF WALL COM PLETED BY THE END OF 2020. BASIC ALLY, AS I GO TO FACE THE VOTERS, SO HE'S , HOMELAND SE CURITY IS VERY AWA RE THAT HE'S SET TH AT GOAL FOR TH EM, AND THE MOST RECENT WE H EARD OUT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WA S THAT THEY , THEY , THE Y'LL COME CLOSE. THEY'RE NOT SURE THEY WILL ACTUALLY MEET HIS GO AL. BUT THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL B E VERY CLOSE TO IT. >> AND WE CAN CONCLUDE ON THIS POINT. IS T HIS ALL ABOUT 2020, SOMETHING T HAT THE PR ESIDENT C AN TELL VOTERS? BEC AUSE HE CLEARLY RAN ON THIS IN 2016 ALTHOUGH HE DID SAY MEX ICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL. REBEK AH: YES. THIS I S DEF INITELY GOING TO BE A LARGE POINT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT IS S OMET HING THAT HE CAN TURN TO AND SAY, HEY, LOOK, THERE'S ACT UAL STAT ISTICS SHOWING THAT THE NU MBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS IS GOING DO WN DUE TO HIS PROGRAMS. H E HAS THIN GS THAT HE CAN SHOW VOTERS LIKE HEY, THIS IS WHAT'S HAPP ENING. THIS IS WHA T I'M DOING. AND THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING HE'S GOING TO TOUT ON THE TRAIL. >> W E WILL LOOK FOR YOUR WORK AT USA TODAY.CO M. BAND AT THE WASHINGTON TIMES.

SHE WAS ABLE TO STEP DOW N FROM H ER POSITION IN CONGRESS TO SERVE AS A SOLDIER. SHE IS SOME BODY WHO OFTEN D OES NOT FOLLOW THE CURRENT . SHE SPEAKS UP, AND HAS THE STR ENGTH TO DO THAT. AND I BELIEVE S HE COULD BE A VERY S TRONG VOIC E IN TH E WHITE HOUSE, TO B E ABLE TO BECOME A BEGIN OF DE MOCRACY AND DECENCY IN THE WHITE HOUSE .

IS GRACE HE RE AS WELL? GRACE , THER E YOU A RE. SORRY I MISSED YO U ON THE WAY IN. NICE SHIRT. WE WILL BE MATCHING. [LAUGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: TH ANK YOU BOTH. HOW MANY OF YOU WERE HERE WHEN WE WER E SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LAST TIME B UT THERE WAS, I WAS SICK. THIS WAS RIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE. RIG HT? I HAD GOTTE N A BA D COUGH. SOME OF YOU HAD GATHERE D. RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU WERE HERE F OR THE LAST ONE? A COUPLE OF Y OU, WHEN I SKYPED IN F ROM ATLANTA. I THINK WE WERE IN ATLANTA. TH ANK YOU FOR DOING THAT, AND THANKS FOR BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE , AND THANKS TO ALL OF Y OU FOR COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO OUR HOST HE RE, JOSH AND HIS DAD RAY IN THE BACK. THANK S FOR INVITING US AND GIVING US THIS SPACE TO GATHER T OGETHER. J USTIN, PAR T OF THE TEAM, THANK YOU S O MUCH. RAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SE RVICE TO OUR COUNTRY IN THE UNIT ED STATES NAVY. WE HA VE AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF VO LUNTEERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY TO LIS T BY NAM E, BUT I'M SO PROUD OF TH E CAMPAIG N THAT WE HAVE AND TH E PEOPLE-POWERED CAMPAIGN WE ARE BUILDING. W E TAKE NO PAC MONEY, NO L OBBYIST MONEY. AND REALLY, WE ARE FUEL ED AND BEING M OVED BY OUR VOLUNTEERS WORKING HARD EVERY DAY. VOLUNT EERS, IF YOU CAN RAISE AND WAVE YO UR HANDS. THER E WE GO. THEY ARE AL L GATHERED IN THE BACK, WORKING HAR D. [APPLAUSE] REP. GABBAR D: THANK YOU. I'M REALLY, REALLY GRATEFUL. I T'S GATHER ING TOGETHER IN SPACES L IKE THIS WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU ACROSS THIS COUNTR Y THA T GIVES ME SO MUCH HOPE FOR OUR FUT URE, FOR OUR FUT URE, BEC AUSE WE ARE THE CHANGE. THE RE'S A REASON WH Y OUR FOUNDIN G FATHERS CHO SE THOSE THREE MOST IMPORT ANT WORDS TO BEGIN OU R C ONSTIT UTION, ""WE, THE PEOPLE. "" TW O REASONS . SO THAT WE THE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER FORGET THE RESPONSIBIL ITY WE HAVE, TO BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND INFORME D AND INVOLVED IN THIS DEMOCRACY, BUT ALSO SO THAT THE LE ADERS WHO WE CHOOSE TO ELECT NEVER FORGET WHO THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING. ""W E, THE PEOPLE. "" SO AS WE LO OK AT THE MANY CHALLE NGES WE FACE, AS WE TALK THROUG H HOW WE WANT TO SOLVE THESE PROBL EMS, I THINK IT IS MOST IMPORT ANT THAT WE STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, WHO IT IS REALLY FOR. IT'S A BOUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. IT IS ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN. I T IS ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES, YOUR NEIGHB ORS, YOUR COMMUNITY, OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. ABOU T 161 YEARS AGO, ABRAHAM LIN COLN GAVE A SPEECH THAT WAS ENTITLE D ""A HOUSE DIVIDED AGA INST ITSELF CANNOT STAND."" AND DURING THAT TIME, I WAS JUST GO ING BACK AND READING ABO UT WHAT WAS SURROUNDING HIM AT THAT TIME AS HE DELIVERED THE SPEECH. MAN Y OF HIS COLLEAGUES WERE TELLIN G HIM THIS WAS VERY CONTRO VERSIAL, THIS WAS NOT A S PEECH YOU SHOULD DELIVER. BU T HE DELIVERED IT, TO DELIVER A W ARNING ABOUT HOW DIVISIVE TH INGS WERE THEN. BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY LOUDLY AND CLEARLY TO US AS A COUNTRY, AS WE LOOK AT THE CHAL LEN GES WE FACE TODAY. ""A H OUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITS ELF CANN OT STAND."" AND SADLY, THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE, AS A COUNTRY. OU R COUNTRY IS DEEPLY D IVIDED. WH ETHER IT BE BASED ON PARTISAN LI NES, ONE GROUP VOTIN G FOR THIS PARTY OR THIS PERSON, ANO THER GROUP VOTING FOR A DIFFE RENT PARTY OR DIFFEREN T PERSON, OR IF IT IS BA SED ON RACIAL L INES, ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS, ALL THESE D IFFE RENT THINGS THAT ARE UNFORTUNATELY BEING USED TO TEAR US APART AND DIVIDE US. WHEN TH AT ACTUALLY GOES COUNTE R TO THE VISION THAT OUR FO UNDERS HA D, FOR OUR COUNTRY , YOU KNOW? AS TH EY WERE WORKING THR OUGH A LOT OF DI VISIONS, AS THEY WER E TRYING TO HEAL THI S NATION AND BRIDGE THESE DIVID ES, RECOGNIZING THAT, AS WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, A S WE COME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES IN O UR OWN EXPERIE NCES AND BACKGRO UNDS AND FAMILY STOR IES, TH AT ULTIMATELY WE ARE STRONG WHEN WE STAND TOGET HER, WHEN WE, EV ERY ONE OF US, ARE FIRMLY ROOTED IN THAT FOUNDA TION OF OUR CONSTITUTIO N THAT SERVES AS THE BEDROCK FOR OUR COU NTRY, SO THAT WE CAN REMEMBER TH AT OUR OBJECTIVE REALLY IS T HE SAME. WE AR E GATH ERED HERE TODAY, AS MANY PEO PLE ARE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF TH E COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE CARE. WE CA RE FOR EACH OTHER. WE C ARE FOR OUR COUNTRY. AN D WE CARE FOR THE FUTURE, OUR FUTURE. NOT ONLY FOR THE ONE THAT LIES BEFORE US, BUT THE ONE THAT WE WILL LEA VE BEHIND, FOR THOSE WHO COME AF TER US. AND IT IS THIS FOCUS AND THIS CARE T HAT ALLOWS US TO SEE PAST SO MUC H OF THE DIVISIVENESS, AND INSTEAD HAVE THE DIALOGUE AND THE CON VERSATION BUILT ON THIS FOUNDA TION OF RESPECT THAT WE REALLY N EED TO HAVE TO SOLVE PROBL EMS, TO WORK SIDE-BY-SID E, TO BUILD THIS BRIGHTER FU TURE. AS ALEJANDRO SAID, TO MAKE SURE T HAT OUR COUNTRY, OUR WHITE HOUSE CAN ONCE AGAIN BECOME A BEACON OF LIGHT, OF HOPE, OF OPPORTUN ITY, OF RESPECT. TH ESE THINGS ARE SO IMPORTANT T HAT WE CANNOT TAKE FOR GRANTED , AN D WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT C AN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN BRI NG A BOUT THIS CHANGE. SOM E CRITICS WILL COME T O ME AND EXPRESS THEIR CYNIC ISM ABOUT, IS THIS REA LLY POSSIBLE? I SPOKE TO A COLLEGE STUDENT NOT LONG AG O, ACTUALLY SHE JUST GR ADUA TED FROM COLLEGE, AN D SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WA S. THAT T HE LINES ARE SO DEEP LY DRAW N IN THE SAND, ONE S IDE AGAINS T THE OTHER SIDE, THAT WASHIN GTON IS SO DIVID ED, IT IS SUCH A H YPER-PARTI SAN ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE HOW IT IS P OSSIBLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AG AIN, BECA USE INCREASINGL Y, YEAR AFTER YEAR, IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE. WHO HERE DISAGREES W ITH THIS? YOU D ON'T THINK OUR C OUNTRY IS DIVIDED? IT IS. RIGHT, YOU AGREE W E CAN FIX IT. THERE Y OU GO. YOU DISAGREE WITH THE COLLEGE STUDENT. GO T IT. [LAUGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: I WAS ABOUT TO TR Y TO UNDERSTAND, WHERE ARE Y OU LIVING? NO, NO, YOU ARE RIGHT, THOUGH. YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS IS A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH HER. IT MADE ME SAD THAT SHE HAD LOST ALL HO PE THAT W E COULD COME TOGETH ER IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT'S BECOME. BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, AND THIS IS WHAT I CONVEYED TO HER. NUMBER ONE, FAILUR E IS NOT AN OPTION. AND THIS WA S HOW ABRAHAM LINCOLN CLO SED THAT SPEECH ABOUT A HOUSE DIVID ED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. HE S AID, ""WE SHALL NOT FAIL, IF WE STAND FIRM, WE SHALL NOT FAIL."" AND THAT ""WE"" HE IS TALKING ABO UT IS ""WE THE PEOPLE."" WE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BRING ABOUT THIS CHANGE, BOTH IN SELECTIN G WHO WE WANT TO SEE LEADING OUR COUNTRY, LEADERS WHO WILL PUT SE RVICE ABOVE SELF, WHO WILL PU T THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICA N PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY ABO VE ALL ELSE, LEADERS WHO WILL TR EAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT, AN D INSPIRE THIS POSITIVE CHANGE WITH IN OUR COUNTRY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNI TY. REMEMBERING WHO WE ALL ARE, AS AMERICAN S, WHAT IT IS THAT CON NECTS US. THIS CO MMON GROUND WE STAND UP ON IN THIS COUNTRY, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NO W, WHERE I COME FROM IN HAW AII, WE HAVE A WORD, ""ALOH A."" IT IS A WOR D OFTEN MISTAKENLY UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN HEL LO OR GOODBYE, BUT IT MEANS NE ITHER. SO MEBODY SAID, I WAS IN SE COND GRAD E AND MY TEACHER TOLD ME THAT WOR D MEANT HELLO AND GOODBYE. AR E YOU TELLING ME SHE WAS WRONG? I SA ID YEAH, UNFORTUNATE LY, SHE WAS WRONG. [LAUGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: IT IS A WORD T HAT WE USED TO GREET EA CH OTHER, BOTH IN THE BEGINNING O F CONVERSATIONS AND WHEN WE ARE LEAVING, BECAUSE OF ITS SPECIAL AND POWERFUL MEANING. WH AT ""ALOHA"" REALLY MEAN S IS ""I COME TO YOU WITH RESPECT."" I COME TO Y OU WITH AN OPEN HEART, WITH CARE, WITH COMPASSION, AND SEEING EACH OTHER, SEEING YOU FOR WHO WE REALLY ARE, AS BRO THER AND SISTER, AS FAMILY, AS CHILDREN OF GOD, AS PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL CONNECTED. AND THEREFO RE, AS WE ARE HAVING CONV ERSATIO NS AND LIVING OUR LIVES, OUR RELATIONSHIPS PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONA LLY, WE ARE ABLE TO SEE PAST ALL OF THESE DIFFERENCES THAT CAN SOMETIM ES GET IN THE WAY OF REAL DIALOG UE AND CONVERSATIO N. THIS IS SOM ETHING I HAVE DONE M Y BEST TO LIVE BY IN MY OWN LIFE, TO LE AD WITH, AND TO BRING TO WASHINGT ON. WE NEED A LOT OF ALOHA IN WA SHINGTON. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN AN D MUST BE APP LIED IN A VERY PRACTICAL W AY. SO I W ANT T O SHARE WITH YOU A STORY OF HOW I DID THAT, I N A VERY PRACTICAL WAY. I KNEW GOING INTO WASHINGTON AS A NEW FR ESH MAN DEMOCRAT, ELECTED IN 2012, WITH A STRONG MA JORITY OF REPUBLIC ANS IN THE HOUSE O F REPRESENTATIVES AND A VERY PARTIS AN ENVIRONMENT, TRYING TO T HINK, O K, HOW CAN I P RACTICE TH IS ALOHA IN MY WORK IN CONGRESS? H OW CAN I BEGIN TO REACH OUT W ITH RE SPEC T TO MY COLLEAGU ES, START TO BUILD THESE RELAT IONSHI PS NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO MY JO B, THE JOB I WAS HIRED TO DO BY MY CONSTITUENTS IN HAWAII, TO SERVE TH EM AND DELIVER RESULTS FOR THEM. I T WO ULD BE EA SY TO JUST TURN MY BACK AND SAY, WE LL, THE OTHER TEAM IS IN CHARGE SO I WILL JUST HUNKER DOWN AND HANG OUT WITH MY TEAM AND JU ST WORK HARD UNTIL WE GET ENOU GH SEATS IN CONGRESS TO WIN, AND TH EN THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THINGS DONE. THAT PROBAB LY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASIER PATH TO TAKE, BUT IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT PATH TO TAKE, BECAUSE THA T'S NOT WHY I RAN FOR CONGRESS AN D NOT WHAT PEOPLE , A ND THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR M E. THEY VOTED FOR M E TO DO A JOB, TO SERVE THEM, TO WO RK FOR THEM, TO BE THEIR VOICE IN WASHINGTON. AND SO I HA D AN IDEA IN HOW TO BEGI N TO DO THIS OUTREACH. I CALLED MY MOTHER IN HAWAII, WHO MAKES THIS INCREDIBLE MACADAMIA NUT TOFFEE. I T HOUGHT, WHAT BETTER WAY THAN SPEAKI NG THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL L ANGUAGE OF FOOD, TO BE ABLE TO OPE N SOM E HEARTS, AND BEGIN T O ESTABLISH THESE RELATIONSHI PS. SO I ASKED HER I F SHE COULD MAKE 434 BO XES O F HER TOFFEE. [LA UGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT ? SHE AND MY DAD CELEBRATED 51 YEARS OF MARRIAGE YESTERDAY. THEY RAISED FIVE KIDS. I KNO W, IT IS A RAR E THING THESE DAYS. [APPLAUSE] REP. GABBAR D: MY MOM THOUGHT IT WAS A GR EAT IDEA. SHE S AID YEAH, I AM IN. I WANT TO HELP. I ACT UALLY HAVE ONE MORE FA VOR TO ASK. FOR AL L OF THE MOMS HERE, YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU R CHILDREN GET, THEY ARE AL WAYS CALL ING HOM E, RIGHT ? SAYING HEY MOM, I NEED SOME HELP. I ASK ED IF SHE WOULD M AKE ANOTHER 435 BIGGER BOXES OF TO FFEE FOR THE STAFF OF EVERY ME MBER OF CONGRESS. A GAIN, SHE'S AN AM AZING WOMAN. SHE PAUSED, I THINK ONL Y TO START PROCE SSING HOW MUCH LONGER THAT WOULD TAKE HER, HOW MANY MORE POUNDS OF M ACADAMIA NUTS SHE WO ULD NEED, BUT S HE UNDERSTOOD WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT. SHE GOT TO WORK IN HAWAII, SHE IS STIR RING BOTH POTS AT THE SAME TIME. CHOPP ING THE NUTS, P OURING THE TOFFEE. SHE HAD MY DAD ASSISTING HER IN THE JOB HE CHOSE FO R HIMSELF, TO BE THE QUAL ITY CONTROL OFF ICER. [L AUGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: SUPERVISING, TAKING A SL ICE OUT OF EVERY PAN. I NOT EVEN JOKING. AMA ND WHILE THEY WERE D OING THIS AND WRAPPIN G THE TOFFEE IN HAWAII, I W AS HAND-WRITING PERSONAL NO TES TO EVERY ONE OF MY NEW C OLLEAGUES. GOING ONLINE, LOO KING UP INFORMATION, SEEING WHAT THEIR BACKGROUNDS WERE, GETTING BET TER INFORMED AB OUT WHO THEY ARE AND SIGNING EVE RY SINGLE ONE OF THESE NOTES SAYING, I LOOK FORWAR D TO SERVING WITH YOU. THE IN CREDI BLE THING, AS WE BEGAN TO DE LIVERING THESE LITTLE , T O DELIVER THE SE LITTLE GIFTS OF AL OHA, HOW QUICKLY I GOT A RESPO NSE. O N THE HOUSE FLOOR AS WE WERE CASTING VOTES, THE ONLY TIME ALL 43 5 OF US ARE ALL IN THE SAME RO OM AT THE SAME TIME. THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I NORMALLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE OP PORTUNITY TO WORK WITH, CHAIR MAN AN D WOMEN OF IMPORTANT COMMITTEES IN CONGRESS, STARTED TO MAKE THE LONG WALK FROM T HE REPUBLICAN SIDE TO THE DEMO CRA T SIDE, FINDING ME AND JUST SA YING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MANY OF THE M SAYING, I ATE ALL THE CANDY, I NEED MORE BEFORE I CAN GO HO ME THIS WEEKEND. AN D MOST IM PORTANTLY, WHAT ARE SO ME IS SUES YOUR CONSTITUENT S ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU ARE COMING HERE AND WANT TO TACKLE? I AM THE CH AIR OF THIS OR THAT COMMITTEE, THIS IS HOW MANY YEARS I HAV E BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS OR THAT. LET'S WORK TOGETHER. I WANT TO HELP. THAT SIMPLE GESTURE OF REACHING OU T WITH ALOHA, WITH RESPECT, WI THOUT PRECONDITIONS, WITHOUT PUR ITY TESTS, WITHOUT PIC KING AND CHOOSING, I WILL TALK AND WORK WITH THIS PERSON BUT NOT THAT PERSON. REA CHING OUT WITH RE SPECT TO EVERYONE , FOCUSED ON THIS MISSION THAT WE ALL SHARE TOGET HER OF SERVICE, OF PUTTING SER VICE ABOVE SELF, PUTTING THE INTERES T AND THE WEL L-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PE OPLE AHEAD OF POLITICS, HEAD OF PRO FITS, AHEAD , AH EAD OF PR OFITS, AHEAD OF SP ECIAL INTERESTS AND CORPORA TIONS. PUTTING THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF O UR COUNTRY FIRST. AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS OUTREACH, T HE SLAYING OF A , THIS LAYING OF F OUNDATION BASED ON RESPECT, THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE THROUGHOUT MY TIME IN CONGRESS. AT A TIME O F A STRONG REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, I WAS ABLE TO PASS LEGISL ATION, SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE S AID WAS IMPOSSIBLE, THAT I SHOULDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME TRYING TO D O FROM THE BEGINNING. THAT, YOU K NOW, I NTRO DUCING AMENDMENTS TO SOME OF THE LARGER BILLS THAT GET THROUGH CONGRESS, B EING TOLD, REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER SUPPORT IT, DON'T EVEN TRY. A ND TH E LEADERSHIP OPPOSING MY BILL OR MY AMENDMENT. IT IS BECAU SE OF THOSE RE LATIONSHIPS I HAD, I HA D MY PHONE CALLS RETURNED. W HEN I AM TEXTING COLLEAGUES TO SAY, MY BILL IS COMING UP F OR A VOTE, I NEED YOUR SUPPORT, TH EY WILL RESPOND AND SAY, OK, TE LL ME WHY. INSTEA D OF JUST GOING ALONG WITH THE PARTY LINE, WHICH IS OF TEN WHAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON. IF IT IS A REP UBL ICA N BILL, REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR IT, DEM OCRATS VOTE AGAINST IT. A DEMOCRATI C BILL, DEMOCRATS V OTE FOR IT, REPUBLI CANS VOTE AGAINST IT. THAT IS THE NORM, RATHER THAN EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS LOOKING AT THE SUBS TANCE O F EACH PIECE OF LE GISLATION AND SAYING, WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS, W ILL THIS HELP PEOPLE OR WILL THIS HURT P EOPLE? SO INSTEAD OF JUST TOEING THE PARTY LINE, I WAS ABLE TO HAVE THESE CONVE RSATIONS WHERE MY COLLEAGUES KNEW AND TRUSTED BEC AUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHI P THAT I WOUL D TELL THEM THE TRUTH. I WO ULD MAKE MY CASE, BUT I WASN'T GO ING TO TR Y TO SCRE W THEM OVER O R SET THEM UP FOR FAILURE. AN D NO, NOT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM CAME M Y WAY, BUT ON MANY OF THESE CASES I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE EN OUGH PEOPLE, TAKING , M AKING THE CASE BA SED ON TH E SUBSTANCE O F MY LEGISLATION, TO SUPPORT IT, BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT T HING TO DO. THIS IS THE LEAD ERSHIP THAT I WILL BRIN G AS YOUR PRESIDENT AND COMMAND ER-I N-CHIEF. REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE. TREA TING EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WI TH RESPECT. NO T SEEING ONE GROUP OF AMERICAN S AS PART OF MY TEAM, AND T HE REST AS DEPLORABLE. SEEING EVERY SINGLE AMER ICAN, W ITH RESPECT, AND BRINGIN G ABOUT THE K IND OF LEADERSHIP THAT PUTS Y OUR W ELL-BEING AND YOUR INTERE STS A HEAD OF ALL ELSE, EVERY SINGL E DAY. AS WE GO ON HERE, WE HAVE OUR VOLUNTE ERS WHO WILL PA SS AROUND SOME GOLD-WRAPPED MACADAMIA N UT TOFFEE, MY MOM'S RECIP E. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] REP. GABBAR D: SO YOU CAN GET A L ITTLE TASTE OF HOW MY C OLLEAGUES FELT, WHEN I FIRS T GOT ELECTED AND THE MAG IC OF THIS STU FF. IT I S DANGEROU SLY ADDICTIVE. SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. [LAUGHTER] REP. GABBAR D: BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALK ING ABOUT ON A VERY PRACTICAL L EVEL, AND THIS IS WHAT I SHAR ED WITH THAT COLLEGE STUDENT, HO W WE CAN AND MUST MOVE FORWARD TOG ETHER. A ND HOW I W ILL LEAD AS PRESIDENT. NOT ACCEPTI NG F AILURE AS AN OPTION. BEI NG INSPI RED BY THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND SO MANY OTHER LEADERS WHO CAME BEFORE US, FACING VERY DIFFICULT C HALLENGES IN DIVISIVE TIMES BUT A LWAYS LEADING WITH LOVE AND WITH CA RE, AND COMPASSION, PUTTING THE WELL-BEING AND INTERES TS O F THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOVE ALL E LSE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT I SSUES THAT WE WILL TACKLE, TOG ETHER. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE ON AND HOLD TO ACCOUNT BIG PHARMA. THO SE WHO ARE PERPETRATING THIS OPIOID EPIDEMIC ACROSS OUR COUNTRY . TH OSE WHO HAVE LIED AND CHEATED , AN D INTENTIONALLY DECEIVED PE OPLE, JUST TO MAKE MORE M ONEY. RUIN ING PEOPLE'S LIVES. TAKI NG PEOPLE'S LIVES IN TH E PROCESS . I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT BEGINS THIS PROCES S, OPIOID ACCO UNTABILITY ACT, THAT W OULD HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE AND WOULD T AKE THOSE FINES AND THE DOLLARS THA T WOULD COME FROM THESE CASES AND EARMARK THEM SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE S URVIVORS OF THIS EPI DEMIC, TO HELP THEM T HROUGH REC OVERY, TO HELP PROVID E THOSE DESPE RATELY-NEEDED RESOURCES T O THOSE WH O ARE STRUGGLING WITH ABUSE AND ADDICTION, TO GET THE HELP TH AT THEY NEED AS THE Y WALK THIS LONG PATH TOWARDS REC OVERY. I WILL HOLD BIG PH ARMA AND BIG INSURAN CE ACCOUNTABLE , AND TAKE THEM A WAY FROM THE PO LICY-MAKING TABLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SO MANY OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLAT ION RELATED TO OUR HEAL TH CARE THAT H AVE COME BEFORE CONGRESS, YOU SEE IN THIS PAY TO PLAY CULTURE IN WASHINGT ON HOW THEIR P OWER ED AND , THEY ARE HI GH-POWERE D, HIGH PAID , THEIR HIGH- POWERED, HIGH PAID L OBBYISTS HAVE A TREMENDOU S AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OVER THE LE GISLATION THAT AFFECTS OUR EVERYDA Y LIVES. I WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE AARP, WHO I S HERE. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT ALMOST EVERY MEETING WE HAVE, AN D I KNOW OTHER CAMPAIGNS AS WELL, TH ERE ARE AARP VOLUNTEERS WITH THE RE D SHIRTS AND JACKETS, AND I JUST LOVE THE ME SSAGE. I DON'T KNO W IF YOU WANTED TO STAND UP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE YOU HERE FOR A SECOND, AND I CAN GIVE YOU THE MIC IF YOU WANT TO SAY A WORD OR T WO. [APPLAUSE] REP. GABBAR D: THANK YOU. BUT YO U SEE HER JACKET, IT SAYS ""STOP GREED."" >> WE ARE EVER YWHERE. REP. GABBAR D: YO U ARE EVE RYWHERE, A NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATIO N FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE. EXACTLY. EX ACTLY. IT SAYS ""STOP GREED."" >> [INAUDIBLE] REP. GABBAR D: EXACTLY. ST OP THE GREED. YOUR MESSAGE IS SO CRYSTAL CLEAR, BECAUSE IT CUTS TO THE HEART OF WHAT IS WRONG WI TH OUR ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW. IT'S B EING DRIVEN BY GREED AND PROFITS RATHER THAN HOW TO BETTER T AKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE, WHE THER IT IS OUR GRANDPARENT S, OUR PARENTS, US, OUR CHI LDREN, A T EVERY SINGLE AGE. AND SO , WHE N WE HAVE THESE CONVE RSATIONS IN OUR COMM UNITY ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE HEALTH CARE , THE NUMBER ONE THING W E HAVE TO DO IS TAKE AWAY T HE CRONY CAPITALISM AND THE GRE ED THAT HAS INFECTED TH IS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT UNFORT UNATELY REALLY ISN'T ABOUT HEALT H AT ALL, REALLY. IT IS SICK-CARE, RIGHT? WE A RE NOT PLACING HIGH LEVELS OF IMPORTANCE ON PREVENTI ON AND WELLNES S, AND DOING M ORE TO BE BE ABLE , MOR E TO BE ABLE TO ENC OURAGE A HEALTHIER SOCIETY AND PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM GETTING SICK IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO, YOU, EVERY ONE O F YOU HAVE MY PERSONAL COMMITMENT THAT IN A GABBARD ADMINISTRAT ION, BIG PHARMA AND BIG INSURANCE W ILL HAVE NO SEAT AT OUR TABLE AS WE FORM POLICIES GU ARANTEEING QUALITY HEA LTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGL E AMERICAN, T HAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE WHO, IF YOU HAVE GREAT PRIVATE INS URANCE OR IF YOUR EMP LOYER IS OFFERING ONE, IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE, YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE. BUT FOR THE SINGLE MOM OF FOUR WHO I MET EARLI ER TODAY JUST DOWN T HE WAY AT COOKIE'S CAFE, WHOSE SON I S 25 YEARS OLD AND WAS BOR N WI TH SEVERE DISA BILITIE S, AND WHO NEEDS A LUNG TRAN SP LANT, HE DOESN'T KNOW IF HE CAN G ET IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH $30,000. HE'S ON MEDICARE . HE'S ON MEDICAID. T HEY WILL C OVER JUST THE COST OF THE SURGERY ITSELF. BUT ALL THE OTHER THINGS HE NEEDS AROUN D THE SURGERY TO MAKE SURE I T IT IS SUCCESSFUL, $35,000. $35,000. SO YOU KNOW , HER BOSS, THEY HAVE A DONA TION CAN IN THE COMMUNITY T O CHIP IN, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS Y OUNG MAN'S LIFE CAN BE SAVED. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN RAISE I T. I ASKED , DO YOU HAVE A GOFUNDME PA GE? BECAUSE I W OULD LOVE TO SPREAD THE WORD AN D GE T MORE PEOPLE TO CHIP IN. WHETHER IT IS $20 OR WHATEVER YO U CAN. YOU KN OW WHAT SHE TOLD ME? NO, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT, BE CAUSE IF WE HAVE A GOFUNDME PAGE, THEY COUNT THOSE DOLLA RS AS INCOME AND HE WILL LOS E H IS APARTMENT AND HIS HEALTH CARE.

[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANT TO B E ON TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS. I WANT TO HEAR WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND IN JUS T A FEW MOMENTS. I WILL WRAP U P. AS I KNOW W E W IL L BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT MANY OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES, WHETHER IT IS CLIMATE CHA NGE, IMMIGRATION REFORM, NO JUSTICE REF ORM, THE RE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES W E NEED TO ADDRESS. I WANT TO C LOSE ON ONE ISSUE THAT IS CENTRAL TO ALL OF THESE OTHER ISSUE S, AND THAT IS THE COST OF WAR. FOR EIGN POL ICY IS DOMESTIC POLICY. VER Y RARELY IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OR EVEN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS I N THE PAST DO YOU SEE A M AJOR FOCUS ON FO REIGN POLICY, WHICH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR TWO BIG REA SONS. THE MOST IM PORTANT RESPONSIBIL ITY THE PRESIDE NT HAS IS TO SERVE AS COMMANDER-I N-CHIEF. I WOULD THI NK AS VOTERS Y OU WOULD WANT TO BE BEST INFORM ED ABOUT WHO IS MOST QUA LIFIED TO SERVE AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. NUMBER TWO, THOSE DECIS IONS T HAT ARE MADE RE LATED TO OUR FORE IGN POLICY HAVE DIRECT IMPACT ON E VERY SINGLE ONE OF US IN OU R E VER YDAY LIVES, WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT. I HAVE SERV ED AS A SOLDIER I N THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD FOR A LMOST 17 YEARS. I HAVE DEPL OY ED TWICE TO TH E MIDDLE EAST. MY FIRST DE PLOYMENT IN A MEDICAL UNIT, WHERE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE WERE CONFRO NTED WITH THE TE RRIBLY HI GH HUMAN COST OF WAR . I HAVE SERVED IN CONGRESS NO W SEVEN Y EARS , GOING ON EIGHT. ON T HE HOMELAND SE CURITY COMMITTEE, THE ARMED S ERVICES COMMITTEE, GAINING EXP ERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDI NG RELATED TO OUR NATIONAL SE CURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY. SEEING FIRS THAND W HO ACTUALL Y BENEFITS MO ST FROM O UR COUNTRY 'S L ONG-STANDING POLICY OF W AGING REGI ME CHAN GE WARS , TOPPL ING DICTATORS, FOLLOW ON N ATIONBU ILD ING MISSIONS. I T IS NOT O UR COUNTRY THAT BENEFITS. O UR NATIONAL SECURITY IS MOST OFT EN UNDER MINED AS TERRORIST GROUPS LIKE ISIS A ND AL QAEDA AR E STRENGTHENED. IT IS THE M ILITAR Y-IN DUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND A LOT O F FANCY WASHINGTON CONSULTANTS WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OF F OF THIS CONTINUED P OLICY. THE COST OF WAR TAKE S A TOLL ON EVERYONE OF US AS AM ERICANS BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WH O ARE PAYING THE PRICE. JUST IN AFG HANISTAN ALONE, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE PAYING FOR BILLION DOL LARS A MONTH , $4 BILLION A M ONTH. WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR OUR MONEY? WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLI SH? THAT IS $5. 5 MILLION AN HOUR. $5.5 MILLION IN OUR GOIN G TOWARDS A WAR AND N ATIONB UILD ING MISSION THAT SOME O F THE HIGHEST LEADERS IN THE PENTAGON, NOW IT HAS BEEN REVEAL ED BEHIND CLOSED DOOR S, THEY ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS SAYIN G WHAT ARE WE TRYI NG TO ACCOMPLISH? WHAT DOES W INNING LOOK LIKE? THEY CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTI ON. I HAVE LONG ADVOCA TED FOR BRINGIN G OUR TROOPS HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN TO TOP BACK STOP WASTING AME RICAN TA XPAYER DOLLARS THE RE AND INSTEAD REDIRECT TH OSE DOLLA RS TOWARDS SER VING THE NEEDS OF OUR PEOPLE NATI ONBUILDING RIGHT HERE AT HOME. TH IS IS THE CHAN GE THAT I WILL BRING ABOUT AS PRESIDEN T, GETTING OUR PRIORIT IES STRAIGHT, ENDING THES E REGIM E CHANGE WARS, THIS NATIONBUILD ING MISSION, TH IS NEW AR MS RA CE. TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERAN S AN D MAKING SURE WE ARE REDIRECTING OUR TAXPAYE R DOLLARS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. WE NEED A C OMMANDER IN CHIEF WH O WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECIS ION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND FREEDOM OF THE AMERICAN PE OPLE AND OUR COUNTRY. I BRING THE EXPERIENCE NECESSARY T HAT HAS PREPARED ME TO DO TH AT JOB ON DAY ONE. EVERY SINGL E ONE OF US PAYS THE PRICE FOR W AR. I AM NOT A PACIFIST. I DON'T LIVE IN A DREAMLAND. I LIVE IN T HE REAL WORLD WHERE I UND ERSTAND THAT SOMETI MES WAR MAY BE NECESSAR Y TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN PE OPLE, BUT AS COMMANDER-I N-CHIEF, I WILL LEAD AND MA XIMIZE ALL DIPLOMATIC MEASURES, BUILDING RELATIONSHI PS, LEADING WIT H COOPER ATION RATHER THAN CONFLICT, M AKING SURE WE ARE SENDING MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS INTO HARMS WAY, THAT W E ARE SENDING THE M ON MISSIONS THAT ARE WORTHY OF T HEIR GREAT SACRIFICE, AND THAT WA R SHOULD ALWAYS BE T HE LAST RESORT . IF YOU AGRE E W ITH THIS LEADER SHIP THAT WE NEE D IN OUR COUNTRY, TH EN I WANT TO P ER SONAL LY INVITE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU HERE TO JOIN ME, JO IN OUR CAMPAIG N, JOIN THIS MOVEMENT TOWARDS THI S BRIGHT FUTU RE, WHE RE WE AR E SERVED BY A GOVERN MENT THAT IS TRU LY OF, B Y, AND FOR THE PEO PLE.

WE WILL STA RT WITH YOU. >> GOOD AFTERN OON. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING OVER THE CHESSBOARD, AND IT SEEMS THAT TRUMP WON IN FLOR IDA, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANI A, AND WISCONS IN WITH A MINORITY OF THE VOTE. HE WON BY 1 1,000 VOTES IN MICHIGAN WHILE THE LIBERTA RIANS GOT 16 TIME S THAT NUMBER OF VOTES. >> I N MICHIGAN ? I DID NOT K NOW THAT. >> IF THE LIB ERT ARIAN S HAVE BEEN A LLOWED IN THE PRESIDE NTIA L DEBATE, THE Y PROBABLY WO ULD HAVE TAKEN MORE VOTES AWAY FROM T RUMP, AND THE DEMOCRATS MAY HAVE WO UND UP WINNING IN THOSE STATES. IF YOU FIND AN ORGANIZA TION THAT WOULD RUN P RESIDENTIA L DEBATES AND ALLOW T HE LIBERTA RIAN S TO PARTICIPATE AND INVITE THE REPUBLI CANS IF THEY CHOOSE OR N OT TO, I W OULD LIKE THAT J UST BECAUS E HE GETS DON ALD TRUM P OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE , AND BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW THE LIBERTA RIANS TO PRESENT THEIR SOLUT IONS TO MORE VOTERS, AND I THINK YOU WOULD LIKE THAT C HESS MOVE BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP GET YOU ELECTED. >> FAIR ENOUGH . [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. WHAT IS YOU R NAME? >> I AM TOM. > > THANK YOU, TOM. I WANT TO G ET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE Y OU ARE RAISING, WHICH IS TH AT WE NEE D A F AIR AND IMPARTIAL S YSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE THAN J UST T HE TWO PARTIES TO BE REPRESENTED , AND THAT WE ABOUT VOTER S TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE VOICES OF THOSE WH O ARE SEEKING TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY . I THINK THA T THE CONCENT RATION OF POWER THAT EXISTS WITH IN THESE TWO P ARTIES THAT IS FUELED B Y M ONEY DO ES A DISSERVIC E TO THE AMER ICAN PE OPLE IN A LOT OF WAYS AS WE SEE HOW THA T IMBALANCE O F POWER EX IST S AND THE NEGATIV E CO NSEQUENCE S THAT COME FROM THAT.

WHAT DO YOU THIN K ABOUT THE AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS THAT ARE COMING OUT AND THE WHOLE INDUSTRY, T HE TRUCKING IN DUSTRY IS REALLY FALLING APART. >> T HANK YOU. I HAVE GRAV E CONCE RNS ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THIS AUTOMA TION REVOLUTION WILL HAVE. I THINK THE RE IS NOT ANY ONE SIN GLE ANSWER TO THIS. I THINK THE RE ARE A LOT OF SAFETY CONCERNS AN D OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THESE CH ANG ES. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS A MATTER OF TIME. I WOULD LOV E TO HEAR MORE OF YOUR THOUGH TS ON THIS. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF BUT W HEN, AND W E AS A COUNTRY NEED TO BE BEST PRE PARED TO EMPOWER THOSE WHO A RE IN A SITUATION LIKE YOURSE LF, T HOSE WHO H AVE NOT BEEN DRIVIN G THEIR WHOLE CAREERS, BUT OUR DEE P INTO THAT, AND THEIR FAMILY DEPENDS ON THEIR INCOME TO SURVIVE, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEX T. I DON'T KNO W IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. >> ALSO, I WAN T TO ADD BECA USE OF THE REAL STRICT REGULATIONS OUT THERE AND E VERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS COME OU T IN THE LAST 15 YEARS THAT REALLY PUT A DAMPER ON THE TRUCKIN G INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE RATES H AVE FALLEN DRASTICALLY . >> THE RATES O F WHAT YOU ARE BEING P AID?

THE WORK TH AT YOU ARE DOI NG TO RAISE MORE AWARENESS ABOUT THE C HALLENGES ALL ARE FAC ING, I T HINK THIS IS A BIG TOPIC. I'M NOT GOING TO CL AIM TO HAVE THE AN SWER IN EVERY RESPECT ON THIS, BUT O NE THING T HAT CAN HELP THOSE WHO ARE MAK ING THIS TRANSITION IS UNIVERSA L BASIC INCOME. I THINK THA T WILL HELP T O PRO VIDE A LAYER OF EC ONOMIC SECURITY FO R THOSE LIKE YOURSE LF WH O MAY BE FACED WITH THIS S ERIOUS AND MASSIVE CHANGE IN YOUR LIVES ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN S NEXT.

WE H AVE GOT TO GET TO THE REALITY OF THE SITUATI ON AND RECOGNIZE I N SOME WAY S THE INEVITABILI TY OF WHAT IS COMING, BUT MAKING SURE WE ARE STANDING UP OR OUR B ROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WALKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. >> I WANT TO A SK A SERIOUS QUESTION RE LATED TO YOUR VOTE ON IMPEACHM ENT THAT TOOK PLACE RECENTLY. AS MOST PEO PLE KNOW, YOU HAD A UNIQUE VOTE . YOU VOTED P RESE NT ON BOTH ARTICLES OF IMPEACHM ENT. THE QUESTIO N I HAVE FOR YOU, IF THERE WAS I NCONTR OVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF A HIGH CRIME OR MISDEMEA NOR , WOULD YOU H AVE VOTED YES O N THOSE ARTIC LES OF IMPEACHMENT ? >> YES. THIS I S PAR T OF THE PROBLEM . THROUGHOUT THIS PROCES S, IT WAS AND CONTINU ES TO BE EXTRE MELY PARTISAN. THIS IS SOM ETHING THAT THE FOUNDERS WA RNED AGAI NST IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. THE Y FEARED THAT THE PROCESS WOULD RESULT IN A CONCLUSION THAT WAS BASED O N TH E STRE NGTH OF ONE PARTY O VER ANOTHER RATHER THAN AN OBJ ECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF INNOCENC E OR GUILT AN D T HAT SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD ONLY FURTHER DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS WHY I VOTED PRE SE NT, TO TAKE A S TAND FOR OUR COUNTRY , TO TAKE A STAND FOR THE PEOPLE. WE CAN AND SHOULD DEFEAT DONA LD TRUMP FOR H IS MULTIPLE WRONGDOINGS AND ABUSES OF POWER AN D THROW HIM OUT OF OFFICE T HERE SO THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTR Y AND MOVE FORWAR D TOGETHER. IT IS ALSO WHY I INTRODUCED A CENSURE R ES OLUTION THAT LISTED MANY OTHER AREAS THAT WERE NOT IN CLUDED IN ANY IMPE ACHMENT ARTICLES OR EVEN DISCUS SED THROUGHOUT THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF DECISION S THAT DONALD TRUM P HAS MADE THAT W ERE CLEARL Y UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL , TA KING MILI TARY ACTION, DROPPING BOMBS IN AN OTHER COUNTRY WITHOUT CONGRESSION AL APPROVAL. THE TOWING THE WAR POW ERS RESOLUTION IN CONGRESS TO STOP SAU DI ARABI A'S GENOCIDE IN YEMEN. THER E ARE M ANY OT HER AREAS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN D ISCUSSED BUT WEREN'T. GIVEN THE R EALITY OF THE SITUATION, I DO NOT WA NT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP FURTH ER EMB OLDENED AND STRENGT HENE D AS HE WILL BE, AS THE SENATE WILL EXONER ATE TRUMP, PROC LAIM HIS INNOCENCE, AND HE WILL TAK E T HAT MESSAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AN D WE ARE LIKELY TO S EE HIS SUPPORT GROWTH AS A RESULT OF THAT. >> BY THE ABSE NCE OF YOUR YES VOTE, DO YO U BELIEVE THERE WAS NOT INCONTR OVER TIBLE EVIDENCE? >> I'M SAYING THE PROCESS WAS FLAWED. THE ENTIRE PROCESS WAS FLAWED, WHICH IS WH Y I COULD NOT V OTE EITHER YES OR NO. DROP HAS , DONALD TRUMP HAS C OMMITTED M ANY ACTS O F WRONGDOING THAT I BELI EVE HAV E NOT SERVED THE INTERESTS OF THE AMER ICAN PEOPLE. IT IS WHY I AM CO MMITTED TO DEFEATING H IM AND WOR KING TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO WE CAN REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE NOVE MBER 2020. >> BUT NONE RI SING TO THE HIGH CR IME OR MISDEMEA NOR LEVEL. >> THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE PROCESS. THAT IS THE ISSUE. IF THE PROC ESS ITSELF IS F LAWED, THEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE A CLEAR LOOK AT WHA T HAS HE DONE AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE OR COULD HAVE BEEN I NCLUDED. THAT IS WHY I DECID ED TO TAKE THE VOTE I DID. [APPLAUSE] TAKE ONE FR OM THE SIDE. Y ES, SIR. >> I WAS WONDE RING IF YOU COUL D E LABORATE ON THE THIN GS THAT PRECEDE THESE FOREI GN REGIME CHANGE WARS , AND THAT IS COV ERT ACTI ONS TAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT. A LOT OF PE OPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IN 1949 IN SYRIA, T HE U.S. BA CKED A COUP, AND I RONICA LLY ENOUGH THE GUY WHO WRO TE T HE AFGHANISTAN PAPERS IN THE WASHINGTON POST ALSO WROTE AN AR TICLE ON APRIL 17 20 11 ABOUT THE U.S. IN VOLV EMENT IN SYRIA IN 20 06.

THAT WAS SOMETHING T HE U.S. PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW MA NY Y EARS LATER. THAT IS WHAT THE ISSUE HERE IS. MY POSITION THAT THE U.S. SHOULD NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS ROLE OF BEING THE P OLICE OF THE WORLD, AND WE SHOU LD NOT BE IN THE BUSI NESS OF GOING AND OVERTHR OWIN G DICTATORS THAT WE DON 'T LIKE EVEN W HEN UNDER THE GUISE OF HU MANITA RIANISM BECAUSE WHE N WE LOOK AROUND MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD A ND THROUGHOUT HISTORY, IT HAS RESU LTE D IN MORE SUFFERING AND STRUGGL ES FOR THE PEOPLE IN THOSE CO UNTRIES. IT HAS UNDE RMI NED THE INTERES TS OF OUR COUN TRY , WH ETHER WE ARE TALKING ABO UT IN TH E RECENT PAST , IRAQ, LIBYA, SYRIA, AFGHANISTAN . YOU CAN GO ON AND O N DOWN THE LIST.

T HIS IS A Q UESTION I HAVE DEALT WITH BEFORE , OBVIOUSLY NOT AS PRESIDEN T OR IN THE POLI TIC AL C APACITY, BUT DURING MY SECOND APPO INTMENT TO THE MIDDLE EAST, I DEPLOYED AS A PLATOON LEADER. ONE OF OUR PLATOONS MISSIONS WAS TO COND UCT COU NTERTERRORISM TRAINING WI TH THE KUWAITI ARMY. AS A LIEUTE NAN T, I HAD MY SERGEANT, A ND WE BROUGHT SOME OF OUR SOLD IERS. WE WENT TO THEIR CAMP TO BEGIN TH IS TRAINI NG, AND FROM THE OUTSET I WAS TOLD, T HEY DO NOT ALLOW WOMEN ONTO THEIR CAMP. OBVIOUSLY, I HAD A MISSION. I WENT ANYW AY. THE GUARD A T THE GATE WHO LOOK AT OUR ID C ARDS, HE WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED AS HE LOOKED AT ME, BUT HE WAVED US THROUGH. AS WE WENT DOW N THE LINE AND ST ARTED MEE TING THE KUWAITI SOLDIERS TH AT WE WOULD BE TRAINING, H ALF OF THEM COM PLE TELY DID NOT ACK NOWLEDGE THAT I EXISTED AT ALL. THE Y WOULD NOT SHAKE M Y HAND. IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE INVISI BLE TO THEM SIM PLY BECAUSE I AM A WOMA N. THE WAY I T REATED THIS WHOLE SITUA TION WAS, I GET THEIR CULTURAL BA CKGROUND AND DIFFERE NCES AND WHATEVER IT IS WHERE TH EY ARE COMING FROM , BUT I KNEW WHAT MY MISSION WAS. I LET MY ACTI ONS SPEAK LOUDE R THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE WENT. WE DID THIS TRAINING. WE DID IT A FEW DAYS AWAY - - DAY S A WEEK. WE SHOWED T HEM HOW TO SHOO T THEIR FIREARMS. WE SHOWED T HEM HOW TO CONDUCT BASIC COUNT ERTERRORISM TACTICS, HO W TO CLEAR BUILD INGS, HOW TO DEAL WITH C IVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND RIOTS A ND A LL THESE THINGS. I FOUND AS TIME WEN T ON, TH EY SAW ME NOT AS A WO MAN WITH WHATEVER THEIR PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS WER E, BUT A S A FELLOW SOLDIER THAT THEY G REW TO RESPECT BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE AND LEADERS HIP I BROUGHT TO THE TABL E. WHAT THIS R ESULTED IN WAS ON GRADUATION DAY WHEN THEY WERE DONE WITH T HEIR TRAINING CO URSE, THEY GATHER TOGE THER IN A ROOM NOT UNLIKE THIS , AND THEIR COMMANDER, WHO WAS A VERY CONSERVATIV E MUSLIM MAN, HE CALLED ME UP TO TH E FRONT IN FRONT OF HIS SOLDIER S AND PRESENTED ME WITH AN AWARD FOR A PPRECIATION FOR THE TRAININ G I AND MY SOLDIERS HAD GIVEN TO HIS UNIT. AS WE LEFT, THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THERE WHO HAD BEEN WORKING WITH THESE GUYS FOR A LONG TIME. HE SAID, I HOP E YOU UNDERST AND WHAT JUST HAPPENED. WHAT IT TOO K FOR THIS COMMAN DER TO RECOGNIZ E A WOMAN IN FRONT OF HI S SUBORDINATES, AND FRONT O F HIS SOLDIERS. AND WHAT KI ND OF HISTORIC TH ING THAT WAS. WHATEVER TH E OBSTACLES ARE, WHOEVE R IT IS THAT I AM DEALING WITH, IT IS MY PRACTICE TO SAY, MY ACTIONS IN MY LEADERSH IP , MY ACTIONS AND MY LEADERSH IP WILL ALLOW ME TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACL ES THAT OTHERS MAY PLACE B EFORE US.

IF YOU EXPE CT TO GET RECOVER RES PECT FRO M YOUR P EOPLE AND THE WORLD, IF YOU SEEK STABILITY AND PROSPER ITY FOR YOUR ONCE GREAT NATION, YOU MUST EXPECT THE COMMITM ENTS AND RESPECT HUM AN RIGHTS. THIS SYMPOSIUM, THIS GATHER ING CANNOT COME AT A M ORE IMPORTANT TIME. IT CL EARLY SIGNALED TH E IRANIAN PEOPLE JUST HAD ENOUGH AND WERE FED UP WITH THE ECONOMI C FAILURES AN D WITH THE REGIME THAT DENIES THEM BASIC FUNDA MENTAL HUMAN DIGNITY THA T COMES FROM EACH OF US. IT IS NOT O NE AGE GROUP OR CLASS OR GE NDER L IFTING THE IR VOICES. IT IS STUDE NTS IN Z, TEACH ERS , YOUNG MEN. ONE OF THOS E YOUNG MEN W AS AN ELECTRIC AL ENGINEER WHO LOVED F ULL OF LIF E, WHO L OVED S INGING THE ELVIS S ONG ""I CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WIT H YOU."" HE WAS SICK OF CRIMINAL AND CORRUPT IRANIAN LEADERSHIP AND . LAST MONTH, HE JOINED HIS COUNTRY MEN ON THE STREETS OF PROTESTS. T HEY PROMIS ED THEY WOULD HOLD HANDS TO STAY TOGETHER. BUT AS HE W ATCHED THE VIDEOS, THERE WAS C HAOS. WHEN THE SE CURITY FO RCES ATTA CKED THE CROWD, THEY BECAME SEPA RATED. THEN HE EXP ERIENCED EVERY PARENT'S WO RST NIGHT MARE. SHE SAW FEL LOW PROT ESTERS HOLDING HER SON'S L IFEL ESS BO DY AFTER BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD BY THE REGIME. TODAY, SHE GRIEVES WIT H SO MANY OTHER PARENTS. SO MANY OTH ER AMAZING PEOPLE ACROSS IRAN . BUT SHE ALS O SAYS, NOW, I WANT HIS ID EALS ARE MINE. I WANT TO W ITNESS AND CELEBRATE T HE PEOPLE OF IRAN. TODAY MANY IRANIANS ARE ANGRY AT . IT IS A FEE LIN G THA T HAS BEEN BUILDING FO R A LONG TIME. THE AYATOLLAH A ND THE BAND OF THUGS THAT PLANTED THEIR RAGE 40 YEA RS AGO. THEY IMPOSE D THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION ON THE OPEN -MI NDED ENTREPRENEURIAL AND THE AMA ZING IRA NIAN PEOPLE. TO THIS DAY, THE IR ANIAN REGIME IS D ESPERATE TO CONTROL IDEAS IN AN D SPEECH AND INDEED LIFE ITSELF . JUST A FEW EXAMP LES FROM THE LAST YEAR. THREE WOMEN HANDE D OUT FLOWERS ON THE TEHRAN METRO ON IN TERNAT IONAL WOMEN'S DAY IN MARC H. T HEY WERE NOT WE ARING THE HIJACKED. THEY WERE S ENTEN CED 16 TO 23 YEARS IN PRISON F OR MORAL CORRUPTION. TWO MONTHS LATER, THE IRANIAN GOV ERNMENT BANNED RELIGIOUS MINORITIES FROM WORKING AT CHILDCAR E CENTERS WITH MUSLIM CHILDREN. T HE COMMUNITY O F JOURNALISTS REPORTED TH IS PAST WEEK, A FEW DAYS AGO, T HERE ARE 1 1 JOUR NALISTS CURRENTLY IMPRISONED. IRAN IS ON A CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATIO N AGAINST FAMILY MEMBERS OF IRANIAN JOURNALISTS. THESE HANDF UL OF EXAMPLES AR E BUT A GLIMP SE. A GLIMPSE INT O 40 YEARS OF DISRESPECT FOR ITS PEOPLE AND DESTABILIZI NG IRAN'S INTE RNAL ORDER, WEAK ENS ITS ECONOMY IN THE EYES OF FREEDOM LOVING PEOP LE ALL ACROSS THE WORLD. THER E IS A TOWERING HYPOCRISY. IN THIS MIS TREATMENT. SO MANY OF THESE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOL ATIONS DEFIED ITS OWN DOM ESTIC LAWS. 40 YEARS AG O, THE REGIME ADOP TED THE CONSTITUTION THAT IS STI LL IN EFFECT. ARTICLE NIN E SAYS NO INDIVIDUAL GROUP OR AU THORITY HAS THE RIGHT TO INFRINGE IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY UPON TH E PO LITICAL A ND CULTURAL AND ECONOMI C AND MILITAR Y DEPENDENCE OR THE TERRITO RIAL INTEGRITY I N IRAN. BUT THIS IS PRECISELY W HAT IRAN HAS DONE TO THE M. WHAT ENORMO US HYPOCRISY. ARTICLE 14 OF THE C ONSTITUTION SAYS THE GOVERNM ENT AND ALL MUS LIMS ARE DUTY-BOUND TO TREAT NON-M USLIMS IN CONFORMITY WITH ETHNIC ETHI C NORMS . BUT ALL LEGALLY REC OGNIZED GROUPS HAVE THEIR FREEDOMS. WITH CHRISTMAS J UST WEEK AWAY I CANNOT HELP BUT THINK OF VICTOR. HE IS A CHR ISTIAN PASTOR WHOSE HOME WAS RAIDED DURING A CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO. HE AND HIS WIFE AND SON ALL ARE OUT ON BAIL APPEALING PRISON SENT ENCES. I'M GLAD HIS DAUGHTE R IS HERE WITH U S HER E TODAY. THANK YOU F OR BEING WITH US. [APPLAUSE] SEC. POMPEO : THA T SAME DOCUME NT, THE CONSTITUTIO N SAYS ALL TH E PEOPLE OF IRAN THAT THEY AND CA N ENJOY E QUAL RIGHTS. BUT SO MANY ETH NIC MINORITIES ARE TREATED AS SECOND O R T HIRD CL ASS CITIZENS. ARTICLE 27 ALLOWS PUBLIC GATH ERINGS AND MARCHES BUT WHEN CI TIZE NS SPEAK UP, THE REGIME' S HAMMER COMES DOWN. THINK OF TH E THOUSANDS. YOU KNOW THEM. THINK OF THE THOU SANDS OF IRANIANS EXECUTED IN PRISON F OLLOWING P ROTESTS IN 1988 THOSE . THO SE STUDE NTS THAT WERE SLAUGH TERED IN 1999. WE ALL REME MBER THE CRIES OF ""W HERE IS MY VOTE?"" T HOSE PROTESTERS WERE MET WITH MO RE BLOODSHED TO BE SERVED. IT'S THE SA ME STORY TODAY. THE REGIME HAS KILLED HUNDREDS AND HUNDRED S OF PROTESTERS AND SINCE M ID-N OVEMBE R, POSSIBLY MORE THAN 1 000. AND THE REG IME CUTS OFF THE INTERNET, B ASIC COMMU NICATION TOOL, TO TRY TO STOP THE WORLD TO SEE THE HORRORS THAT WERE TAKING PLAC E INSID E OF THEIR COUNTRY. I CAN IMAGI NE, BU T DOES TH E REGIME REALLY THINK THIS IS PAT H THAT LEADS TO PROSPERITY AND STRENGT H? I THINK NOT . I THIN K THEY KNOW DIFFERENTLY. I ASKED THE SAME QU ESTI ONS ON IRAN'S INTE RNATION AL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS. IRAN IS THE FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE NATI ONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION , BUT THE REG IME STEALS MONEY, DRAINS THEIR PENSI ONS. THIS MONEY IS TAKEN FROM THE CITIZENS FO R THEIR USE TO CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AN D TURNS IT INTO SHELL CASINGS IN THE SAND OF SYR IA AN D YEMEN. LABO R ORGANIZERS ARE ROUNDED UP AND IMPRISO NED AND TORTURED. THE UNIVERS AL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RI GHTS STATES NO ONE SHALL B E SUBJECT TO TORTURE OR ARREST DETE NTION OR EXILE, B UT THINK O F THE MINORIT IES ARE OR NONRELIG IOUS PERSONS OF FACING T ORT URE AND EXECUTI ON FOR THEIR FAITH AND T HE BASIC BELIEF SYSTEM. IRA N IS PAR T OF THE CIVIC A ND P OLITICAL RIGHTS. IRONIC TO SAY IT. YET IRAN PE RMIT S THE USE OF THE DEATH PENAL TY FOR GIRLS STARTING AT AGE NINE AND BOYS AT AGE 13 . TWO 17 -YEAR -OLD BOYS WERE S ECRETLY EX ECUTED JUST THIS PAST YEAR. WE HAVE SEE N P ROTES TERS GUNNED DOWN AT RANDOM IN T HE STREET IN THE LAST 30 DAYS. WE GR IEVE T O SEE A CORRU PT G OV ERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE. UNJ UST RULE RS. BUT AS DIFF ICULT AS THE SITU ATION I S AS I HAV E J UST RECOUNTED, I HAVE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE . THE IRANIAN PEOPLE HAVE A STEA DFAST F RIEND. THE Y ARE GO OD PEOPLE . AND THEY HAVE SPIRIT . THE FRIEND IS THE NORT H STAR FOR THOSE OPPRE SSED IN THEIR ID EALS PRESS, WRIT INGS, FAITH, IDEALS. THE UNITED STATES WILL STAND AND HAS STO OD U NDER PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] SEC. POMPEO : OUR PUBLIC SUPP ORT AND MORAL SUPPORT IS IMPORTAN T. OUR CALLS FOR JUSTICE MATTER. WE CALL FOR A NATION WITH REAL A CCOUNTABILITY. IT IS UNFOR TUNATE IN 2009 WHEN T HE OPPORTUNITY AROSE AND AMERICANS D ID NOT DO THAT IT'S . IT I S NOT P OLITICAL. IT IS ABOUT THE BEST AND WHAT WE WANT FOR THE IRANIAN PEOPLE THE . LOOK. THE A PPEASE MENT OF THE REGIME SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK. WE HA VE DONE SOMETHING C OMPLETELY DIFFERENT I N THIS ADMINISTRAT ION. WE HAVE ASKED THE IRANIAN PEOPLE TO SEND EVIDENCE OF REGIME B RUTALITY. WE ARE BRIN GING TO LIGHT WH AT THE AYATOLL AHS ARE DESPERATE T O KEEP IN THE DARK. SO FAR, WE HAVE RECEIVED MO RE THAN 36,000 PIECES OF I NFORMATION AND WE ARE WORKING EAC H AND EV ERY ONE OF THEM . WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN TH E STORIES AND SEE THEIR FACES OF TH E VICTIMS THAT WILL N OT BE FORGOTTE N A ND THE PERPETRATOR S WILL BE PUR SUED. IRAN'S HUMAN RIGHT S VIOLATIONS ARE WORSE T HAN UNACCE PTABLE THEY . THEY ARE EV IL AN D THEY ARE WRONG . THE Y FUNDAM ENTAL LY REPRESS THE FUNDAME NTAL ENERGY, ENT REPRENEURSHIP, AND SPIRIT OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT PEOPL ES . SO TODAY, W E C ALL ON THE IRANIAN REG IME TO FULFILL THE FIRST DUTY OF ANY GOVERNM ENT. TO TREAT YOUR PEOPLE WITH BASIC DIGNITY TO WHICH EVERY MEMBE R OF THE FAMILY OF MANKIND IS ENTITLED. UPHOLD YOUR COMMITMENTS UNDER YOUR OWN CO NSTITUTION AND INTERNATION AL LAW. ACT LIKE A NORMAL COUNTRY. UNLEASH YOU R PEOPLE 'S VA ST POTENTIAL. WE SEE THES E THINGS AND URGE TH ESE THINGS OUT OF TROO P POTENTIAL A ND ALSO AS A MESSAGE OF COMMON S ENSE TO THE REGIME . TRUE PROSPE RITY WILL ONLY C OME TO IRAN WHEN YOU CEASE T ERRO RIZING YOUR PEOPLE AND JAILING THEM. INDEE D I WOULD URG E THE REGIME , TO FOLLOW THE WORDS O F THE PERSIAN POE T. THEY LOWERE D WHO LAYS WA STE WILL ONLY SEE THE PROSPERITY FOR HIS DOM AIN. I'M ANNOUNC ING SEVERAL NEW ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. FIRST, I HA VE READ DESIGNATED AS IRAN A C OUN TRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. TH E WORLD S HOULD KNOW IRAN IS ONE OF T HE WORST VIOLATORS OF BASIC FUNDA MENTAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. S ECOND, TOD AY, THE UNITED STATES DEPA RTMENT OF TREASURY WILL SANCTION TW O IRANIAN JUDGES. [APPLAUSE] SEC. POMPEO : AMO NG THE HEINOUS ACT S WAS TO SENTENCE A HUMAN RIG HTS LAWYER AND A WOMAN 'S RIGHTS DEFE NDER TO 33 YEARS IN PRISON AND 140 LAS HES. THEY SENTEN CED AN AMERICAN CITIZEN FOR 10 YEARS IN PRISON ON F ALSE CH ARGES OF ESPIONAGE. WE ARE GLAD WE WON THE REL EASE BUT HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN SENTEN CED OR JAILED IN THE FIRS T PLACE. THEY HAVE S ENTEN CED H UNDREDS OF POLITICA L P RISONERS. HE IS THE G O TO GUY. HE SENTENCE D JOURNALISTS, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTI VISTS TO PRISON OR TO WORSE, T O D EATH. HE IS A TOO L OF THE REGIME'S OP PRESSION NOT AN IMPARTIAL P ART OF JUSTICE AND NOW HE IS NOT T ODAY, HE I S SANCT IONED BY THE UNITED STATES OF A MERICA. [APPLAUSE] SEC.

[APPLAUSE] SEC. POMPEO : KIL LING PEO PLE'S CH ILDREN WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SEND THE IR OWN CHILDREN TO STUDY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [C HEERS AND APPLAUSE] S EC. POMPEO: THE SE ARE SERIOUS AND THOUGHT FUL MEASURES THAT TOOK U S A L ITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT TO GET TO T HE RIGH T PLACE, BUT I WANT THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO KNOW IT DOES NOT HA VE TO BE THIS WAY. IF THE REGI ME RESPECTS THE RIGHTS OF THE IRANIANS, A BIDES BY ITS COMMITM ENTS , IT CAN SHED THE BL ACK LABEL OF BEING OU TLAWED RE GIME IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD A ND VERY IMPORTANTLY CAN ENJOY S USTAINED PROSPERITY AND PEACE FOR ITS PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDI NG IT. THE PAST TW O PROSPER ITY FOR EACH TO PROSPERI TY BEGINS AT H OME FOR FOR EAC H CO UNTRY BEGINS AT H OME. [APPLAUSE] SEC. POMPEO : THE PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPIER.

[APPLAUSE] DIVING RIGH T IN, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION, C ECILIA, AB OUT THE PLACE Y OU COME FROM AND THE CON NECTION IT HAS FOR YOU. BECAUSE YOU AND I S HARE SOMETHING. WE ARE BOTH DESCEN DENTS OF PEOPLE W HO ARRIVED A LONG TIME AGO IN WHAT IS NOW TEXAS. YOUR FAMILY USED TO CONTROL PADRE ISLAND IN S OUTH TEXAS . TELL US ABO UT THAT AND HO W IT INFLUENCES YOUR COVERA GE OF THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER. CECELIA: WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT LAN D. I DON'T EVEN OWN A CONDOMINI UM ON PADRE ISLAND. THE RE IS A LONG HISTORY OF DISPOSSESSION OF LANDS HE LD BY MEX ICANS WHO BECAME MEXICAN-AME RICAN CITIZENS AFTER THE MEXICAN WAR. BUT ON MY M OTHER AND FATHER'S SI DE, OUR F AMILIES CAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 18TH CENTURY AND WERE PART OF THE SE INITIAL SETTLEMENTS THAT EMERGED ALO NG THE RIO GRANDE. THE RIVER W AS A SOURC E OF SUSTENAN CE AND LIFE AND TH ESE C OMMUNITIES EVENTUALLY WERE ON EIT HER SIDE OF THE RIVER. WHEN THE RI VER BECAME OUR BORDER AFTER THE U .S.-ME XICO WAR, THE FA MILIES ENDED UP ON EITHER SIDE. SO I ONLY H AVE ONE GR ANDMOTHER WHO IS FROM MEXICO, THE INTERIO R, B UT MY OTHE R THREE GRAND PARENTS ARE FROM THIS REGION . I DON'T HAV E FAMILY IN T HE INTE RIOR OF MEXICO OR THE U.S.. P EOPLE DON' T KNOW MY LAST NAME I N OTHER COUNTRY, SO REALLY I AM FROM THE BORDER, IT IS A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME. AND I T DOES N'T FEEL LIKE THE ED GE OF ANYTHING , IT FEELS LIKE THE CENTER OF THIS LONG STORY, THIS LONG H ISTORY OF US BEING THERE. WE W ILL BE DIS CUSSING HOW THAT HAS CHANGED , BU T I GREW UP WIT H A STRONG SENSE OF RO OTEDNE SS IN THIS PLACE THAT IS NOW UNDER SO MUCH DIS PUTE. SIMON: ANGE LA, YOU GREW UP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORD ER, SO YOU HAD THAT AB ILIT Y TO MOVE BETWEE N BOTH WORLDS, AND A WAY. HADDAD THAT INFLUE NCED YOU TO MOVI NG INTO JOURNALISM AND WORKING ON THE BORDER ITSELF? ANG ELA: I'M GRATEFU L TO MY MOTHE R. SHE DID RAISE ME ON BOTH SIDES OF TH E BORDER. I WAS BORN IN MEXICO C ITY, RAISED IN GUADALAJ ARA , AT 10 YEARS OLD MOVED BACK TO THE U.S. . MY MOTHER IS F ROM THE U.S., THE S AME PLACE WHERE CECIL IA GREW UP, RIO GRANDE VALLEY. AS A 10-YEA R-OLD, IT WAS CONFUSING ON THE BORD ER, WHE RE PEOPLE LOOK MEXICAN TO ME BUT D ON'T SPEAK SPANISH, AN D I HAD TO UN DERSTAND THIS UNIQUE LANG UAGE, S PANGLISH, AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT OVER TI ME, THE B ORDER IS THE ONLY PLACE I FEEL TRUL Y AT HOME. IT IS A PLA CE WHERE I AND MANY PEOPLE GO BACK AND FORTH, NOT TALKING ABOUT INFRA STRUCTURE, BUT THE BILINGU AL, BICULTURAL, BINATIONAL NATURE OF THE BORDER AND I FEEL I'M FORTUNATE T O HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE. IT HAS SHAP ED WHO I AM AN D HELPED INFO RM ALL THE REPORTING. I TRIED TO SERVE AS A BRIDGE OF UNDERSTANDI NG IT IS A PLA CE I LIKE TO SAY AT AS, WE D ON'T THINK OF OURSELVES AS EITHER/OR, BUT MORE. I LOV E THE BORDER. SIMON: ALFR EDO, TELL US ABO UT EL PASO HISTORY AND ITS HIS TORY OF WELCOMING I MMIGRANTS, AND FUNCTIONING IN , AND F UNCTIONING AS A KIND O F ELLIS IS LAND FOR THAT PART OF THE STATES. HOW DID THAT EMERGE : , HOW DID THAT EMERGE? ALF REDO: I WAS BORN IN MEX ICO. MY FATHER T ALKED ABOUT SOMED AY MOVING TO THE U.S. NO NE O F US, MY B ROTHERS AN D MY MOTHER, NON E OF US WANTED T O COME NORTH. WE CAME BEC AUSE OF THE LAND MARK IM MIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT SIGNED BY P RESIDEN T JOHNSON IN 1965, SO I REMEMBER CO MING TO T HE CITY OF ARE AS, WAI TING FOR MEN WIT H EV ERGREEN C ARDS, STARING AT THE MOUNTAINS A ND SEEING THE BIG STA RS. IT WAS THE CHRISTMAS S EASON, SO THAT'S WHERE WE WA NT TO GO AND THEY ARE FORCING US TO GO, AND LOOKING BAC K, WE CA ME THROUG H AN EL PASO NEIGHB ORHOO D WHICH I WOULD SAY M ILLIONS OF IMMIGRAN TS, THAT WAS OUR ELLIS I SLAND IN THE SOUTHWE ST. WE CAME THROUGH THE IR ON TH E WAY TO THE CALIFOR NIA CENTRAL VAL LEY , BUT I REMEM BER MY MOTHER A S A KID WOULD N EVER REALL Y BY B EDSHEETS O R TOWELS OR A NYTHING SHE WOULD P ULL HER MONEY AND L OOK FORWARD TO MOVING B ACK TO THE BORD ER. THE BORDER AT THAT TIME TO US WAS LIKE A HOLY LAND, THE A NNUAL PILGRIMAGE WHERE WE WOULD GO BACK TO EL PASO AND JUAREZ. AND IT WAS ALWA YS COUN TING THE DAYS TO SOMEDAY WHEN WE WOULD MAKE THE PE RMANENT MOVE. I WAS INSPI RED BY SALAZAR, WHO LATER BECAME A CORRESPON DENT FOR THE LOS ANG ELES TIMES, WHER E YOU COULD BRING BOTH SIDES TO THE READER THRO UGH JOU RNALISM. TODAY I DON 'T FEEL COMPLETE AS A PERSON OR A JOURNALIST AS REPORTING F ROM BOTH SIDES ON THE BORDER, THA T IS THE ULTI MATE FEELING, WH EN YOU KNOW YOU CA N CRISSCROSS AND HOPEFULLY T RY TO MAKE MEXICA NS AND AMERICANS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO BE BINATIONAL, BILINGUAL AND BICULTU RAL. SIMON: AS A LL OF US IN TH IS ROOM K NOW, IT HA S BEEN A VERY EVENTFUL YE AR ON THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER. WE HAVE ALL BEEN CO VERING ISSUES LIKE FAMILY SEPA RATION, IMPRISONMEN T OF MIGRANT CHI LDREN,, AND THE SHO CKIN G, S HATTERING MASSACRE IN EL PASO IN AUGUST, WHEN A GUNM AN WENT INTO THE WALMART AND TARGETED PEOPLE BECA USE OF THEIR ETHNICITY. ANGELA, HOW DOES THAT COMPAR E WITH THE OTHER COVERAGE YO U HAVE DO NE OF DIFFICULT E VENTS ON THE BORDER? WHAT MADE T HIS YEAR STAND OUT F OR YOU? ANGELA: THE RE HAVE BEEN D ARK DAYS ON THE BORDER, ESPECIALLY EL PASO, FO R ALL THE REA SONS YOU SAID. T HE SHOOTING STUNNED PEOPLE. IT WAS CLEA R ONCE THE ALLEGED GUN MAN WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTOD Y, EL PASO WAS CHOSEN FOR THE ATTACK BECA USE OF WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE LI VE. EVERY MASS SHOOTING IS HORRIBLE , B UT THAT ONE IN PARTICULAR HIT SO CLOS E TO HOME. I COVERED S O MUCH VIO LENCE IN JUAREZ, DRUG VIOLEN CE, WHICH IS SP IKING AGAIN, AND THAT HAS BEEN HEARTBREAKING. BUT WHAT WA S ST UNNIN G TO SOME PEOPLE WAS THAT IT HAPPENED IN THIS EVERY DAY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORD ER WERE DOING NORMAL SHOPPING. S O THAT, CO MBI NED WITH OTHER HEARTBREAKING STORIES, IT HAS BEEN TOPPED, BUT I HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE RESI LIENCE OF BORDER RESI DENTS ON BOTH SID ES, ESPECIALLY EL PASO, SE TTING A REAL EXAMPL E. AND ALSO TH IS IDEA OF TOLERANC E OF PEOPLE, THA T IS A PLACE OF TOLERANCE, SO THERE ARE THINGS WE C AN LEAR N FROM THE EL PASO EXPERI ENCE. SIMON: SEE CELIA - - CE CILIA, TH E BORDER OCCU PIES A BIG PLACE I N PUBLIC IMAGINATION AND ESPECIALLY IN POLICYMAKING RIGHT NOW. THERE IS AN TI-IMM IGRATION RHETORIC, T HE BORDER IS PORTRAYED A S THIS INC REDIBLY DANGEROUS P LACE, AND THERE H AVE BEEN C ALLS TO BUILD MORE OF A WALL ON T HE BORDER. WHAT DOES T HAT F EEL LIKE I N SOUTH TEXAS THESE DAYS? WHAT IS THE REAC TION TO THE WALL AN D POSSIBLY A PORTION OF PRIVATE WALL? CECIL IA: WE HAVE A G OOD BIT OF BORDER FENCING BUI LT IN 20 08 AND 20 10 AN D BACK THEN C OMMUNITIES IN SOUTH TEXAS WERE HIGHLY OPPOSED TO THE WALL . WE ARE OPEN LY ADMI TTING T HAT THE FUNCTION OF IT IS HO RRIBLE . THERE IS A RESEARCHER IN TEXAS WH O D ID DAT A CRUNCHING THAT SHOWS THERE IS A PERFEC T RELATIONSHI P BETWEEN HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE BORDER RACK , BOR DER AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT THE WALL. WE KNOW THE WA LL IS SYM BOLIC . THE FURTHER THEY ARE FROM THE BORDER, THE MORE THEY WANT IT. THAT IS NOT TO SAY BORD ER RESIDENTS D ON'T WANT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENFORCEM ENT , BUT THE WALL ITSELF IS THE CLIMAX OF THE POLI TICAL THEATER. AND I THINK PEO PLE IN S OUTH TEXAS ARE TIRED OF THAT. TH EY KNOW I T IS A PLA CE WHERE POLIT ICIANS COME FOR PH OTO OPS AND THEN THEY LEAVE AND F OLKS ARE NOT INVESTING I N THE REGION, AND THE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO STE P IN AND PROV IDI NG D IFFICULT MOMENTS FOR MIGRANT FAM ILIES. I WOULD SAY THERE HAS BEEN A BUILDUP OF THIS IN THE PAST 30 YEARS, AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY. THIS IS AN EXPLOSION O F TRENDS WE HAVE BEEN L IVING THROUGH ON THE BORDER, AND THE BUI LDUP OF BORDER ENFORCEMENT BEGAN A LONG TIME AGO, B UT IN THE 1990 'S WE STARTED HAV ING THIS DETERR ENCE STRATEGY THAT FOCUSE D ON BORDER AGENTS AND PARTICULAR CITIES, AND UNDER P RESIDENT GEORGE W. B USH THE WALL WAS APPROVE D, BUT THEN BU ILT UNDER PRESIDENT O BAMA. I DON'T LIV E THERE ANYMORE BUT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THERE, AND WE SEEM TO BE SUBJE CTED TO MORE STO PS FOR S EARCHES ON THE U.S. SIDE. I THI NK AFT ER 9/11, THE S TAKES WERE RAISED , AND PEOPLE STARTED TAL KING ABO UT THE B ORDER DIFFERENTLY AND USING T HE TERM BORDER SECURITY, W HICH CORRELATED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY SO THE IMPL ICATION WAS THAT TH E THREAT TO THE COUN TRY WAS AT THE BORDER. SO I SAW A LOT O F CHANGE, EVEN DURING THAT TIME. WE HAVE TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE TO THE LANGUAGE WE USE, BEC AUS E IT WAS CHANGIN G INTO THAT L ANGUAGE OF BORDER SECU RITY AND NOW WE HAVE BOTH P OLITICAL PARTIES TAKE FOR GR ANTED THAT THERE IS SO ME TYP E OF PERSISTENT THREAT ON T HE BORDER. SIM ON: A QU ESTION, ALFREDO, ABOUT EL PA SO AND WAREZ - - AN D FAR AS , AND JAA , EL PASO AND JUAREZ . AND WHEN I WAS THERE THERE WAS A BAND PLAYING CREEDENCE C LEARWATER REVIVAL SON GS, AND ENGLISH . , IN ENGLISH. TELL US ABO UT THE CULTURA L LIFE BETWEE N THESE TWO CITIES. WHERE IS TH E CENT ER OF V IBRANCY, JUAREZ OR E L PASO, AND I S THERE CR OSS-POLLI NATION GOING ON BETWEEN ART ISTS AND SINGERS AND PEOPLE ON B OTH SIDES? ALFREDO: TH ERE IS A HISTORY THERE. JUAN GABRIE L PLAYS A HUGE ROLE. JUAN GABRIE L, HIS LAST HI T WAS A CREEDENCE CLEARWATER SONG IN SPANISH. >> THE RAIN SO NG. ALFREDO: IT WILL COME BACK TO ME. BUT THE SON G EXPLAINS THE BICULTU RAL PART OF IT. AND IT IS A N AREA IN SOUTH TEXAS WHERE ACCOR DION MUSIC, MARI ACHIS, IT IS BEING TAUGH T IN HIGH SCHOOL S AND COLLEGE S. AND IT MAKE S PEOPLE FEEL A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE. YOU ARE CON FIDENT ABOUT BELON GING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORD ER. THAT HELPS THAT SIDE O F YOU. WHEN WE LIV ED IN CALIFORN IA, MY MOTHER WOULD SAY WE WANT TO GO TO EL PASO. WE GR EW UP IN THE S AN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THERE W ERE USUALL Y PEOPLE WORKING IN FIELDS, BUT YEARS LATER I UND ERSTOOD THAT TO BE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE THEMSELV ES AND CAN CLAIM BOTH SIDES OF TH E BORDER. AND AS ANGE LA SAID, YOU D ON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO CHO OSE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. AND THAT GOES W ITH MUSIC AND FOOD AND DR INKS. SIMON: ANGE LA, YOU MENTION ED THAT WHEN YOU WERE GR OWING UP YOU HAD TO DECIPHER THIS NEW LANGUAGE CALLED SPAN GLISH, WHICH HAS EXPERIE NCED GROWTH AND EVOLUTI ON. YOU WALK AR OUND LOS ANGELES AND IT IS F ANTASTIC, THE SPANGLI SH YOU WE ARE ALL THE TIME. WHAT DOES T HAT M EAN TO YOU ON A DA Y-TO-DAY BASIS? DO Y OU DO INTE RVIEWS IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, SP ANGLISH? DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO MIX AND WHEN NOT TO? ANGELA: REA LLY, BOTH. AND IT IS F ROWNED ON IN MEXICO CITY, PEOPL E REALLY DON' T WANT TO HEAR SPA NGLISH. BUT ON THE BORDER WE ARE SEEING THIS REAL B LENDING OF CULTURES AND LANGUAG ES, AND I LOOK AT THE BORDER IS A PEEK INTO THE FUTURE. IT IS YOUNG, M AJO RITY LA TINO, MEXICAN-AMERICAN OR AMERICAN MEXICAN, SO THESE AR E COMMUNITIES THAT REFLEC T THE FUTURE. I KNOW THAT CAN BE CONFUSING A ND EVEN CREATE FEAR FOR PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE BORDER, BUT WE HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING IN THIS BLE NDING OF CULTURES . THE ECONOMY , WE DEPEND O N EACH OTHER, ON T HE U.S. SIDE WE DEP END HEAV ILY ON MEXICO. WE ARE FAMILY TIES , WE HAVE ALL SO RTS OF TIES THAT BIND. AND WE DON' T ALWAYS GET ALONG OR EV EN LIKE EACH OTHER, BUT WE LEAR NED A L ONG TIME AGO TH AT WE NEED EACH OTHER. SO T HAT IS SOMETHING T HAT ON THE BORDER WE N EED TO LEARN BEYOND THE BORDER AND EXCEPT THAT FACT A ND TH INK ABOUT IT AND FIGU RE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS NEW RE ALITY WORK. BECAU SE IT IS HERE, YOU CAN'T TURN BACK T IME. >> IT IS LIKE WHAT S AN DIEGO AND T IJUANA WENT THROUGH AT THE HEIGHT OF THE VIOLENC E. SAN DIEGO W AS GOING T O TURN ITS BACK ON TIJUANA, AN D LATER W E REALIZED THAT ECONOMICALLY, THE DEPENDE NCY ALL ALONG T HE U.S.-ME XICO BORDER. MEXICO CITY 'S ARE LARGER, ECO NOMICALLY MORE VIBRANT, SO YOU NOW HAVE TI JUAN A AND SAN DIEGO AND IT IS A SYM BOL TH AT WE NEED EACH OTHER, WE N EED TO WORK THIS OUT TOGETHE R. B UT WHAT HA PPENED IN TIJUANA WAS INTERES TING , BECAUSE TIJUANA SAID, WE HA VE TO INV ENT OURSELVES - - REINVENT OURSELVES. WE CAN'T JU ST DEPEND ON GRINGOS COM ING DOWN. SO THEY GOT INTO CU LTURE, GO T INTO THE WINE INDUST RY THE FOOD INDUSTRY, A ND IT HAS BECO ME A MUCH MORE VIBRAN T REG ION. I THINK A LOT OF BORDER COMMUNITIES HAVE A LOT TO LE ARN FROM THAT, AND SEE THE PRI DE OF EL PASO. IF YOU THIN K OF A BORDER AS ONE BIG COMMUNITY W HERE A BORDERLINE WAS IMPOSED , BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU TALK ABOUT WALLS AND FENCES, WE ARE REALLY THE SAME PEOPLE, WHEN COMMUN ITY - - ONE COMMUNI TY A ND PEOPLE GO BACK AND FO RTH ALL THE TIME. YOU DON'T T ALK ABOUT, WE WANT TO GO TO MEXICO, WE WANT TO GO TO THE UNIT ED STAT ES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] SI MON: ONE FACT OF LIFE FOR PE OPLE IN THE BORDER, OR AS MUCH AS 100 MILES FROM THE BORDER, OUR CHECKPO INTS . IT ALMOST B ECOMES NAT URAL, YO U HAVE TO STOP AND DE CLARE YOU R CITIZENSHIP AND YOU ARE GAZED AT BY A BOR DER PATR OL OFFICER AND THEY DETERM INE WHETHER YOU ARE A RISK. DO YO U THIN K THE REST OF THE COUNTRY , CE CILIA, HA S A GRASP ON WHAT THAT MEANS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS, TO B E VIEWED BY YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT ENTIRELY TR USTWORTHY PERHAPS? CECILIA: NO , I DON'T THINK THE R EST OF THE COUN TRY CAN IMAGINE WHAT THAT IS LIKE, AN D I DON'T THINK THE REST OF THE COUN TRY WOULD BE OK WITH THAT HAPPENING IN NEW YORK OR ANY OTHE R PART OF THE COUN TRY. WE DO HAVE INTERIOR CH ECKPOINTS THAT HAVE B EEN THERE SINCE THE 1970'S, MAYBE. IF YOU GREW UP CRO SSING THE BORDER, LIK E I DID TO VISIT MY GRANDMOTHER , EVERY TIME YOU CO ME BACK IN, YO U ARE QUESTIONS BY , YOU A RE QUESTIO NED BY THE CUSTOMS OFFICER. WE WERE KID S A ND THEY WOULD CHECK TO SEE IF WE WERE LYING, AND WE DIDN'T HAVE PASSPORTS BACK THEN B UT TH EY WO ULD SAY, ARE YOU A CITIZEN, WHERE YOU L IVE, WHAT SCHOOL DO YOU GO T O? I HAVE BEEN DOING A RESEARCH ST UDY ON LA TINO V OTERS AND VOTERS THROUGHOUT TEXAS, AND WHEN YOU ARE SUBJECT ED TO THAT CONSTANT QU ESTIONING OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHETHER YOU BELONG IT L EADS TO PEOPLE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITIC AL SYSTEM, HAVING ALL KINDS OF FE ARS. AND THIS DO UBT OR FEAR ANY TIME YO U ARE AROUND ANY KIND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT . THE OTHER T HING WE HAD AT T HE SAME TIME WAS A REAL DEEP SENSE OF WHO WE W ERE BECAUSE OF THE DEEP CULTUR AL IMMERSION A ND TRADITIONS WE HAD. THA T P ROBLE M CONTINUES AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER WE WOULD AL LOW THIS TO HAPPEN T O ALL AMER ICANS, TO BE CONST ANTLY QUESTIONED. SIMON: IT I S NOT I NNOCENT UN TIL PROVEN GUILTY, ALMOST. CEC ILIA: YE AH, AND I T IS HARD TO KNOW AT THOSE CHECK POINTS, YOU DON'T HAVE AS MANY RIGHTS AS YOU DO IN T HE INTERIO R, A ND YOU NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT RIGHTS YOU HAVE. S O THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, AN D I T IS A LIFE OF QUESTIONING. ALFREDO: ES PECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TECHN OLOGY NOWADAYS, THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHO IS GOIN G IN AND GOIN G OUT, BUT THEY STILL SYSTE M , THEY STILL SUBJECT YOU . SIMON: AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS CAN GET YOUR PHONE AND LOOK AT YOU R CONTACTS AND WEBSITES YOU HAVE BE EN VISITING. WHO YOU HAV E BEEN TEXTING. WH AT SOURCE S YOU HAVE BE EN COMMUNICATI NG WITH. SIMON : , A LFREDO: TH AT IS MORE PRE VALENT IN THE LAST TWO AND A H ALF YEARS WITH THIS ADMINI STRAT ION. IT IS ALMOS T LIKE THE FEDERAL AGE NTS FEEL MUCH MORE EMPOWE RED T O SORT OF INVADE YOUR PRIVACY. SIMON: RELA TED TO THAT POI NT, THIS IS FOR ANYONE ON THE PANEL, ONE THING THAT STRIKES ME ABOUT SE CUR ITY FORCES AND BORDER PATROL IS T HAT IT IS LARGELY A LATINO ORGA NIZATIO N MADE UP OF, I THINK IT IS EASILY HALF OF THE WORKFORCE N OW. THAT CREATE S DIF FICULT AND PERHAPS CONFLICTED LOYALTIES. THESE ARE P EOPLE WHO MAYBE ARRESTING R ELATIVES O F THEIR NEIGHBORS, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND A LOT OF SMALL TOWNS. ANGELA, WHA T IT IS , WH AT IS IT LIKE DEALIN G WIT H BORDER PATROL AND TRYING TO GET INFORMATION OUT OF THEM ? ANGELA: THE RE ARE T WO THINGS, THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS IN T HE FIELD, AND THEY DO A VERY GOOD, FEDERAL JOB OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD L IKE TO STAY IN THEIR OW N COMMUNITY. IT IS WELL- PAY ING AT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TO STAY AT HOME AND IN A LOT OF THES E COMMUNITIES THERE AREN'T A LO T OF GREAT JOBS AND TH ERE IS A BRAIN DRAIN. SO IT IS A GREAT OPP OR TUNITY AND DOES CREATE SOME ISSUES, BUT IT IS VERY COM MON FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE CUSTOM S AND BORDER PROTECTION MEMBERS AND THEIR F AMILIES ARE IN THE COMMUNI TY. GETTING INF ORMATION HAS BECOME INCREASINGL Y DIFFICULT FROM ACTUAL OFFICIAL AG ENCIES. JUST LITTLE BITS AND PIECES, AND WE CAN'T FI ND OUT CERTAIN THINGS LIKE HOW MUCH DE TENTION S PACE, WHY ARE PEOPLE FORCED TO WAIT IN MEXICO IF NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN, THEY HAVE CAMPED OUT IN BORD ER CITI ES WHEN WE ARE TOLD THERE AREN' T AS MANY MIGRANTS CO MING, SO THIS SHOULD BE S OME SPACE IF YOU WANT TO GO THROU GH THE ASYLUM PROCESS. I WILL HARK EN BACK TO A S TORY I DID EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE B ORDER PATR OL AGENTS WERE FIRST TO SO UND THE ALARM A BOUT HORRIBLE CO NDITIONS INSIDE THES E HOLDING CELLS. THEY POINT OUT, WE ARE OF THE COMMUNITY, THIS IS NOT WHAT WE SIGNED U P FOR AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE FAMILIES IN THESE CONDITIONS. SO IT HAS B EEN A TOUGH YEAR FOR THEM AND HA S HAD AN IMPACT. BUT YES, IT IS VERY COM MON FOR BORDER PATROL AGENTS TO B E LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY A ND GOING TO SCHOOL, PARENTS, FAMILY, FRIENDS. ALFREDO: LI KE ANYTHING ON THE BORDER, NOT HING IS REALLY BLACK-AND-WHITE. I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING WITH AN EDITOR I N MEXICO CITY, WE WE RE DOING A PIECE FOR T HE NEW YORKER, A S ERIES OF S TORIES ON CONFLICTED LOYALTIES O F AGENTS. I REMEMBER THE ORDERS FROM MEXICO CITY WAS, T HEY MUST BE CONFLICTED, THEY ARE MEXICAN-AME RICANS, THEY MUST FEEL F OR THEIR COMPA TRIOTS, ETC. MAYBE NOT. THAT WAS TH E POINT OF THE STORY. THERE WAS M ORE OF A SENSE LIKE YOU HAVE TO PROVE TH AT YOU AR E AN AMERICAN , THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING T HE COUNTRY. THEY ARE PA TRIOTS. MEXICAN-AME RICANS ARE VERY PA TRIOTIC T OO. THEY ARE VE RY PATRIOTIC. THAT KIND O F SHOOK TH E BELIEF IN MEXICO CITY AS WEL L. WE WERE SO WRONG ABOUT THAT. SIMON: I LO VE TEXA S. I AM FASCIN AT ED BY TEXAS. IT IS SO DI FFE REN T FROM NEW MEXICO, WHE RE I AM FROM. THE W AY THE BORDER HAS BEEN DETECTED IN , DEPICTED IN SCHOOLBOOKS AND HISTORY BOOKS , THAT WASHAS EVOL VED OVE R TIME. WHAT HAS TH AT BEEN LIKE - - WIT H A BACKGROUND IN JOURNALISM AND A PHD FROM AC ADEM IA , HOW IS IT TO WA TCH THE WAY THE BORDER IS PORTRAYED I N TEXAS ITSEL F? >> GROWING UP, WE WERE NOT TO LD THESE STORI ES ABOUT FAMIL IES LIKE MINE. WHAT HAPPEN ED IN TEXAS WAS T HE TEX AS REVOLUTION , THE NARRATIVE A BOUT THE WAR WAS REWRITTEN S O THAT IT WAS MADE INTO A RACIAL WAR WHEN IT WAS NOT A RACIAL WAR. IT WAS ABOU T WHAT SYSTEM OF G OVERNMENT PEOPLE WANTED TO L IVE UNDER. WHEN HE WAS TOLD ABOUT THE , IT W AS TOLD AB OUT THE TEXAS REVOL UTION, IT WAS SOME THI NG DANGEROUS, TO BE CONTAINE D. TEXAS WAS A NGLO. WE GREW UP NOT KNOW ING THIS STORY. I ACTUALLY WA S IN COLLEGE STUDENT , A COLLEGE S TU DENT, TR YING TO STUDY MY FIRST YE AR. IT WAS ROUG H C OMING FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN BROWNSVI LLE . THERE WAS A SECTION O F HISTORY BOOKS ABOUT BROWNSVILLE . THAT IS WHEN I S TAR TED LEARNING MY HISTORY, IN CALIFORN IA. THEN I DEDICATED MY UNDERGRA D STUDIES AND PHD TO UNRAVELING AND REWRITI NG T HE STORY MY FAMILIES WERE PART O F, AND TRY ING TO U NDERSTAND HOW LATINOS AND MEXICAN-AME RICANS GOT WASHED OUT COMPLET ELY OF THE STORY O F TEXAS. I FE EL LIKE I HAVE NOT MOVED O N TO OTHER SUBJE CTS BECAUSE IT IS AN UNFINISH ED PROJECT. SIMON: THE DEBATE , H AS THERE BEEN A CHANGE? C ECILIA: TH ERE IS A FIGHT FOR C URRICU LUM TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE TEXAS STATE BOARD OF EDUCATIO N. THEY ARE ST ARTING TO INCORPOR ATE THIS IN THE CLASSRO OM. I THINK IT IS A WON DER FUL THING. I THINK THE RE IS THIS FEAR IN THIS COU NTRY THAT, IF YO U HAVE A STRONG IDENTITY, I F YOU HANG ONTO YOUR CULTUR E, IT IS A THREAT TO A SSIMILATIO N AND THE BODY POLITI C OF THIS COUNTRY. MY EXPERIEN CE HAS BEEN, T HE MORE YO U KNOW WHO YOU ARE , TH E MO RE EMPOWERED YOU ARE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND THE MORE YOU CAN MOV E BETWEEN DIF FERENT SPACES. THA T IS CHA NGING FI NALLY, BU T IT HAS BEEN A LONG FIGHT TO GET THERE. SIMO N: IN O NE OF YOUR REC ENT ARTICLES, Y OU RETURNED TO THE SITE OF THE SHOO TING IN EL PASO, TO THAT WALMAR T. TELL US ABO UT THAT. WHAT DOES I T LOOK LIK E NOW, AND WH AT IS THE FEELING AT THE STOR E AND SURROUN DING AREA? ALFRE DO: WA LMART JUS T REOPENED AB OUT A WEEK AGO. R IGHT AFTER THE SHOOTIN G, T HEY MADE S ORT O F A MAKESH IFT MEMORIAL TO THE VICT IMS. THERE WERE TONS O F ROSARIES, F LOWERS, PICTURES OF THEIR LO VED ONE S. WITHI N 48 H OURS, I T WAS ALL GONE. M UCH OF IT WENT BACK T O THE RELATIVES O F THE VICTIMS. SO ME OF IT MOVED TO A NEARBY PARK , NEAR THE WA LMART . ONE OF THE THINGS EL PASO DID, L IKE MANY OTHER CITIE S , Y OU GO THROUGH A MASS SHOOTI NG , EL PASO STRONG , ETC . BUT, IN TAL KING TO PEOPLE A T THE WALMART, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE BEEN A BLE TO REALLY PROCESS THINGS. I D ON'T THI NK WE WILL EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. AS A BORDER AND EL PASOAN. IT HIT US S O HARD THA T WE ARE STILL TRYING TO - - ESPEC IALLY AS JOURNALIST, WE JUST GO ON TO THE NEXT STORY. I DON'T THI NK WE HAVE DONE THIS S TORY JUSTI CE. THERE IS A LOT MORE WE HAVE TO DO TO EDUCATE BOTH SIDES. MEXICO YEST ERDAY, THE GOVERNMENT, ON BEHALF OF 10 MEXIC AN VIC TIMS , 49 PEOPLE W ERE INJURE D. ALMOST HALF OF THEM WER E M EXICANS. IT TELLS YO U ABOUT B OTH SIDES. THE SHOOTIN G HAPPENED ON MY FATHE R'S 85 TH BIRTHD AY. WHEN I THIN K ABOUT THAT SHOOTI NG, T HERE ARE ALL THESE R AW EMOTION S. IF SOMEONE REALLY BELI EVES IN THE AMERICAN DREAM, IT I S MY FA THER. HE BROUGHT US TO MEXICO. HE GAVE US A NEW LIFE. Y OU HAVE SO MEONE FROM NORTH TEXAS COME TO EL PASO TO TAR GET MEXICANS , THAT IS A S LAP I N THE FACE TO THE CITY , BUT J UST AB OUT ANY MEXICAN-AME RICAN WHO BELIEVES IN KEEPING THAT DREAM ALIVE, ESPE CIALLY IN THESE VE RY DIVISIVE, P OLARIZED TIMES IN TH IS COUNTRY. ANGELA: I W AS IN EL PASO LAST MONTH, TRYI NG TO GET A SE NSE OF WHAT THE MASSACR E MEANT TO PE OPLE. IT WAS HARD TO GET ONE PREDOMINANT SENSE. YOU ARE EXACTLY RIG HT, PEOP LE ARE MAKING MEANING OF IT. IT IS A VER Y WOUN DED CITY. THERE IS A LOT OF SADNESS. FO R ME, WE HAVE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY AS A COUNTR Y AND IN TEXA S TO HA VE A D EEPER REFLECTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE WORST C RIME AGAIN ST LAT INOS IN MODERN TIMES, OR T O HAVE A RACIST HA TE CRIME THAT IS TARGETIN G A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY. IN 2015, WE HA D DYLANNN ROO F WHO KILLED AFRI CAN-AMERICANS IN SOUTH CA ROLINA. HE WAS A WH ITE SUP REMACIST. WE TOOK MOR E TIME TO REFLECT WHERE WE WERE AS A COUNTRY. WE DIDN'T D O THE SAME WI TH T HE EL PASO SHOOTING, I FEEL, OR NO T ENOUGH. ONE OF THE ISSUES IS T HAT WE HAV E, HISTO RICALL Y, IN TEXAS AND T HROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY , THOUGHT OF MEXICANS AS OUTSIDER S. WE WERE COM PLETELY ERASED FROM OUR OWN HISTORY . THAT HAPPEN ED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE SOUT HWEST AS WELL. WE ARE A CO MMUNITY SEEN PERPETUALLY AS OUTSIDER S, AND WE DON' T HAVE A WAY OF UN DERSTANDING AS A COUNTRY OUR RACE PROBLEMS AR OUND MEXICAN-AME RICANS AND LATINOS . WE UNDERSTA ND IT AT XENOP HOB IA AND ANTI-IM MIGR ANT SENTIMENT, BUT I FEEL THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO GO BEYOND THAT. ALFRE DO: NE EDS TO GO DEEPE R. SIMON: HOW IS IT PLAYING OUT ON THE BORDER THES E DAYS? ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE IS BET O O'ROURKE. H E SPOKE AB OUT THESE ISSUE S. YOU HAVE JU LIAN CAST RO TALKING A LOT ABOUT THESE ISSUES. IS THERE A SENSE THA T THE BO RDER IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONA L DEBATE, OR IS THERE A SENSE IT IS NEGLE CTE D? ANGELA: IT IS INCLUDED AS THIS FLA SHPOINT OF CRISIS, WHETHER HUMANITARIA N CRISIS OR S ECURITY CRISIS. IT IS PORTR AYED I N SOME CAMPAIGNS A S A DANGER OUS NO MAN'S LA ND OVERRUN BY CRIMINAL S, WHICH COULD N'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. SOMESOME U. S. BORDER CITIES ARE AMONG THE S AFEST IN THE COUNTRY. THEY CARE A BOUT BORDERS BEING A SAF E PLAC E, EVER YBODY D OES, BUT T HEY ALSO CARE ABOUT HEALTH CARE , JOB CREATIO N. PEOPLE ARE TIRED O F ONLY BEING , I TALKED ABOU T THE W ALL. WE HA VE A WALL ALON G BIG STRETCH ES OF BORDER. PEO PLE HAVE VARIOU S VIEWS ABOUT IT. MOST PE OPLE ON THE BORDER POLL ED ARE AGAINST THE WALL BECAUS E IT IS AN INEFF ECT IVE TOOL. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE SOPHISTICAT ED LOOK, BOTH AT BOR DER S ECURITY ISSUES, BUT MORE TH AN THAT, ISSUE S THAT MATTER TO B ORDER RESI DENTS. THERE ARE I SSUES WITH POVERTY THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSE D. WILL WE SEE VOTER TURNO UT IN THESE LARGE LY LATINO REGIONS OF THE BORDER? WILL PEOPLE TURN OUT? W HAT WILL I T TAKE FOR PEOPLE TO TURN OUT?

WE WILL SEE HOW PEO PLE WILL BE MOTIVATED I F THEY THINK THESE CANDIDATES ARE SPEAKING TO THEM. SI MON: I KN OW THE TOPIC TONIGHT IS WHAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CAN LEARN FROM THE BORDER, BUT I THINK THE B ORDER CAN LEARN A LOT FROM CALIFO RNIA AND 187. HAVING LIVE D IN CALIFORN IA , I HAVE A BIG FAMIL Y HERE , THA T IS WHAT PLA YED IN MY MIND AFT ER THE SHOOTIN G. WILL THIS F INALLY MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO P ARTICIPATE, TO COME OUT AN D VOTE, W HETHER DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLIC AN, BUT REALLY MAKE THEMSELVES COUNTED? TH E ULTIMAT E TE ST IS SHOW UP AT THE POLLS. YES, BETO D ID MOTIVAT E A LOT OF PEOPLE TO VOTE, BU T I HOPE THIS TREND CONTI NUES, THAT EL PASOANS AND ALL PEO PLE ALONG THE BORDER CAN TURN OU T. W E REALLY M ATT ER. WE DON'T WA NT WASHINGTON OR SOME OTHER CITY TO WRITE OUTR NARRAT IVE. WE WANT TO DEFINE WHO WE ARE. >> IT DOES WOR K. THAT IS WHY THEY KEEP DOING IT. S IMON: ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN MOST IMPRESSED B Y MY REPORTIN G TRIPS TO THE BORD ER IS A PLACE LIK E ANNUNCIATIO N HOUSE, WHIC H IS AN INCREDIB LE ORGANIZATIO N IN EL PASO WHI CH ASSISTS REF UGEES AN D ASYLUM-SEEK ERS IN MANY WAY S. THERE HAS BEEN AN ORG ANIC GRO WTH OF REAL ACT IVI SM AM ONG BORDE R RESIDENTS T O SOLVE TH ESE ISSUE S ON THEIR OW N, BECAUS E THEY KNOW T HE FEDERAL OR STATE OR CI TY GOVERN MENTS WILL NOT SO LVE THESE THINGS FOR THEM. THEY STEPPE D INTO THAT R OLE. IS THAT SOM ETH ING THAT THE RE ST OF THE COUNTRY CAN LOOK AT , THAT THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF SOLIDARI TY AND COHESIO N ON THE BORD ER THAT IS OVE RLOOKED? HOW DO YOU SEE THA T HAPPENING? YOU ARE COM ING FROM HOUSTON, WHICH HAS A DIFFE RENT DYNAMIC. CE CILIA: WH AT YOU SA Y ABOUT SOCIAL COHESION , I REALLY LIKE THAT. WHAT THE BO RDER HAS GOING FOR IT IS A STRONG SE NSE OF FAMILY, COM MUNITY. I APOLOGIZE , ANGELA: A L OT OF GROUPS WERE INTERVENING . SIMON: GROU PS WORK ING TOG ETHER, WHICH IS DIFFEREN T. CECILIA: I HAVE BEEN DOING ONE ON ONE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH VOTERS AND NONVOTE RS. PEOPLE ARE NOT PARTICI PATING IN THE POLITIC AL P ROCESS, BUT THEY ARE DEEPLY ENGA GED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES . IT IS NOT A LACK OF AGENCY. THE Y ARE DO ING IT IN THESE WAYS. HISTORICALL Y, THE BORDER HAS HAD TO DO THAT FOR ITSELF. I THINK THA T IS SOMETHIN G WE CAN LEARN FROM. ALFREDO: ON E OF THE STORIES WE MISSED A S JOURNALI STS IS THE IMPACT IT HAD ON T HE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WH EN YOU HA VE VO LUNTEERS COMING IN FROM WYO MING, FR OM MONTAN A, FROM DIFFER ENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SAYING I WANT TO SPEND A WEEK AT ANN UNCIATIO N HOUSE AND HELP OUT , THAT IS A P RETTY HELPFUL STO RY FOR THE COUNTRY. IT IS NOT J UST GL OOM AND DOOM. T HERE ARE POCKETS OF PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CA RE. THEY REALLY GIVE A DAMN. WE ARE NOT ALONE. ANGELA: THI S ATTENT ION HAS BROUGHT PEO PLE TO GO TO THE BORDER AND EXPERIE NCE IT. ANNUNCIATIO N HOUSE , AS AMERICAN S, CROSSING BORDERS IS IN OUR DNA. ON THE BORDER, WE SEE IT EVERY DAY. WE DON'T HA VE TO BE REMIN DED THAT THIS IS A NATION OF I MMIGRANTS. WHEN PEOPLE SEE SOME OF THE POOREST COM MUNITIES REACHING OU T AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN , ON BOTH SID ES OF THE BORDER. I W AS AT THESE TE NT CITIES WHER E MEXICAN ASY LUM-SEEK ERS WERE STUCK, AND THEY WE RE GETTING HELP FROM P EOPLE WHO DO REME MBER, B ECAUSE THE Y WERE AT THE BORDER LOOKING FOR NEW OPP ORTUNITY . CECILIA: AN ORGANIZATION IN HOUSTON DID A STUDY OF SCHOOLS IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY. THEY FOUND SCHOOLS WITH HIGH L EVELS OF POVERTY WER E OUTPERFORMI NG OTHER PUBLI C SCHOOLS IN THE STAT E. THEY DID NOT KNOW HO W TO EXPLAIN THAT. THEY DID QUALITA TIVE RESEARCH AN D FOUND THESE INTAN GIBLES THAT LED TO HIGHER P ERFORMANCE THAN YOU WO ULD EXPECT. LIKE THE IN VESTM ENT OF THE WHOL E COMMUNITY IN THE SCHOOL, THE PARENTS KNO W EACH OTHER. THERE ARE OTHER G AINS THAT ARE HA RD TO QUA NTIFY WHEN WE ARE JUST FOCUSI NG ON THE POLI TICS. SIMON: I WE ALREADY FOR QUESTIO NS. , WE ARE READY FOR Q UESTIONS. >> CAN WE PLEA SE HAVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR GUE STS? [AP PLAUSE] WE HAVE TIM E NOW FO R A F EW QUESTIONS, SO PLEASE R AISE YOUR HAND AND ONE OF OUR TWO PEO PLE ON T HE SIDE WITH MICROP HONES WILL CALL ON YOU .

IS THERE A CULTURAL PR ACTICE THAT YOU HA VE SEEN PRESEN T ON THE MEXICAN SID E OF THE BORDER THAT YOU WI SH WERE P RESEN T IN THE UNITED STAT ES AND VICE VERSA? >> I THINK MOR E HUMILI TY ON THE WEST SIDE O F THE BORDER WOULD GO A LONG WAY.

I HAVE THIS PALEST INIAN BRACELET ON, BECAUSE WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT BEING IN SO LIDARI TY WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND NO IGNO RE T HEI R STRUGGLE. THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THA T CONNEC T THAT. >> I DON'T KNO W OF ANY. I THIN K WE SH OULD BE HAVING THAT EXCHANGE AN D SHOULD TAKE WHAT A RE JOURNALISTS THERE , BO RDER JOUR NALISTS THERE. I HAD A GRADU ATE ST UDENT AT THE UNIV ERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN W HO WAS LOOKING AT THOSE CORRELATION S. ONE THING A BOUT THE BORDER HERE THAT IS COM PLEX IS THAT WE HAV E TRI ED TO OP EN AND CLOSE IT AT THE SAME TIME. THE PREVIOU S PRESIDENTS WERE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MINI MIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME WAI TING ON THE BORDER, HOW TO GET MORE TRACTO R-TRAILERS TO COME THROUGH, AN D AT THE SAME TIME, TO ST OP THE GOODS T HAT ARE IL LICIT. IT IS A SPE CIFIC BORDER HERE . AS ENFORCEM ENT INCREASED, WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE SAME CO MPANIES A RE BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY BEING USED. IT IS A GOO D C ONVER SATION THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THAT WE SHO ULD H AVE. >> I GREW UP H ERE IN LOS ANGELES, BU T FOR THE PAST TW O DECADES, I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN A RIZONA, AP PROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES FROM THE BORDER. YOU ARE COR RECT IN SAYING A LOT OF TH E RESIDENTS T HERE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN INTERFAITH GROUPS TO TRY TO STEM THE DEATHS, THE HUMANITARIA N CRISIS OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER ON PREPARED . - - UNPREPARED. A LOT OF PE OPLE CROSSING TH E BORDER TRYING TO MAKE LIV ES IN THE UNITED STAT ES ARE LIKE PEOPLE FROM LOS ANGELES , THEY ARE CITY FO LKS. THEY ARE GO ING INTO THE DESERT WITH OPEN T OED SHOES AND BEING L IED TO, TH OSE LIGHT S OVER THERE, THAT IS PHO ENIX. EVERY YEAR, THERE ARE P EOPLE DYING IN THE DESERT OUT OF IGNO RANCE. A LOT OF WH AT WE DO, WITH NO MORE DEA THS, IS TO PLACE FOOD, CACHES OF W ATER. W E ALSO GO TO THE OTHER S IDE. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF THE CONT INUING DEATHS, BEC AUSE IT IS NO LONGER BEING COVER ED. SC OTT, TWO DAYS AG O, WAS VI NDICATED FOR DOING T HIS KIND OF WORK WHILE OUR A DMINIS TRAT ION IS TRYING TO PROSECUT E. >> THAT IS A GREAT QUEST ION. I DON'T THI NK MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE CIVI L SOCIETY, TH E NGO'S THAT DO THA T KIN D OF WOR K ALONG THE BORDER. SCO TT WARREN'S AC QUITTAL W AS PRETTY AMAZING THI S WEEK. ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING STORIES I HAVE DONE IS IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT A GRO UP BAS ED LARGE LY OUT OF SAN DIEGO. THEY ARE COMPRIS ED E NTIRELY OF IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES. THEY GO OUT INTO TH E DESERT EACH WEEKEND. TH EY MAKE I T THE IR MISSION TO FIND THE RE MAINS OF PEOPLE WHO PERISHED DU RING THE CROSSING, T O GIVE FAMILY MEMB ERS SOME KIND OF CLOSURE, JU ST TO KNOW THAT IS THE IR RELAT IVE, T O IDENTIFY THOSE BONES . IT IS DIFFI CUL T WORK TO DO. THEY GO OUT ON T HEIR FREE TIME A ND DO THIS. IT IS AN IN CRE DIB LE ORGANIZATION. AN EXAMPLE OF IMMIGRAN TS , NO ONE IS D OIN G IT , A ND THEY AR E DO ING IT. >> THEY ARE SI MILAR GRO UPS UP A ND DOWN TH E BORDER. CHILDREN DY ING IN NE W MEXICO AFTER THEY CROSSED THE BORDER.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERE NCE, FROM YOUR P ERSPECTIVE? >> THE DIFFERE NCE IS , IT HASN'T I NSP IRED EN OUGH PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND ACT UALLY VOTE. IT WA S SEEN AS AN ANTI- IMMIGRANT MEASURE. WH AT HAPPEN ED IN EL PASO WAS AN ACT OF HATR ED D IRECTED AT IMMIGRANTS. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THEY W ILL REALLY GIVE PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER, BUT IN THE GENERAL LATINO POPU LATION, TO REGISTER , TO VOTE, TO PARTICIP ATE.

ALTHOUGH I THINK IT IS IN THE CARDS THAT ARIZON A IS GOING TO SHIFT AS WELL. IT IS LOOKI NG VERY PURPLE , THE WAY ITS CON GRES SIONAL DELEGATION IS MADE UP. YO U SEE CHANGES TAKING PLAC E DIFFERENTLY THAN CALIFORNIA. >> WHEN I WAS TEACHING THERE FOR A COUPLE YE ARS, IT WAS THE CHILDREN OF MIGRANTS PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN REGISTERING AND ORGANIZING. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] WE CREATED THE LARGEST MAS S DEMONSTRATI ON IN LOS ANGELES .

JOINING US TODAY IS TH E EDITOR OF N ATIONAL REVIEW MAGA ZINE, AUTHOR OF T HE BOOK ""THE CASE FOR NATIONA LISM."" HOW IT MADE US POWERFUL, U NITED, AND FREE. , AUTHOR OF T HE BOOK ""THE C ASE FOR NATIONALISM."" YOU WRITE T HAT ALMOST EVERYONE HA S AN OPINION OF NATIONALISM WITHOUT KNO WING WHAT IT IS. GUEST: A LO T OF PE OPLE THINK PATRIOTISM IS THE APPR OPRIATE WORD FOR EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT NATIONAL FEELING OR NATIONAL LOYALTY AND NATIONA LISM IS THE WORD FO R EVERYTH ING BAD ABOUT IT. THAT IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY TO LOOK AT IT OR TH E CORRECT DEFINITION IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL. PATRIOTISM COMES FROM A LATIN WORD, SAME AS PATRIARC HY. LOYALTY TO YOUR OWN. NATION ALLY IS A MORE SPECIFIC DOCTRINE TH AT THE SAME PE OPLE UNITED BY COMMON HISTORY AND A COMMON LANGUAGE SH OULD GOVE RN A DI STINCT TERRITORY. IN A NUTSHE LL, THAT IS NATIONALISM. THAT WE SHO ULD BE INDEPENDENT AND SELF-GO VERNING. THIS IS THA T THE RO OT OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, THE INSIGHT THAT WE HAVE OUR OW N RIG HTS AND CLAIMS AND SHOULD BE A PART OF OUR OWN BRITISH EMPIRE. IT RUNS THR OUGHOUT EXAM , AL IS IN A HAMILTON, FDR, AND RE AGAN AS W ELL. A COUPLE KEY PROJECT S. ONE IS THAT WE SHO ULD HAVE A STRONG CAPABLE NAT IONAL GOVERNMENT. HAMILTON IN WASHINGT ON BELIEVE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WILL COLLAPSE AND DISCRED IT THE WHOLE AMERICAN PROJECT AT THE OUTSET UNLE SS IT I S STRONGER AND MORE CAPABLE. LI MITED IS A WELL , A S WELL. WE SHOULD H AVE A STRONG MILITARY, E SPECIALLY A NAVY, DUR ING IMPORTANT H AMILTONIAN PROJECTS. WE SHOULD E XTEND TERRITORIAL EXTENTS, WE SHOULD ASSI MILATE IMMIGRANTS INTO OUR CU LTURE AND IN THE 20TH CE NTUR Y, A MAJOR NATIONALIST PROJECT THAT WAS A THREAT TO POOR AND POLICY, REP UBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, THAT WE SHOULD S UPPORT THE CREATION OF THE INTE RNATIONAL SYSTEM THAT RESPECTS THE SOVEREI GNTY OF OTHER HOPEF ULLY DEMOCRATIC NATIONS ABROAD. HOS T: WHO G ETS TO DECIDE W HAT IS IN THAT DEFINI TION? YOU NAMED S EVERAL SPECIFIC PROJECTS. GUEST: THIS IS THE HAMI LTONIAN TRADITION. YOU CAN HAV E AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE IN AND O UT. OUR BORDERS ARE VERY IM PORTANT AND WE SHOULD PROTECT THE M. OUR FIRST T EST FOR AN Y POLICY IS THAT, DO ES IT SER VE THE INTERESTS OF OUR NATI ON AND OUR PEOPLE THAT THEY M EAN MORE TO US THAN NATION S ARO UND THE WORLD. HOST: YOU M AKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN AMERICAN AN D CIVIC NATIO NALISM, ETHNIC NATIONALISM . WHAT DO THO SE TERMS MEAN? GUEST: CIVI C NATIO NALISM IS USED FOR ANOTHER WORD FOR PA TRIOT ISM, QUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. ETHNIC NATU RAL , NATIONALISM IS THE BELIEF THAT A CERTAIN R ACE OR TRIBE SHOUL D GOVE RN OVER AND ABOVE ANY OTHER ETHNI CITIES . AMERICAN NATIONALISM MINISTRY FO RM IS DEE PER T HAN JUST C IVIC NATIONALISM. THOUGH THAT IS A KEY PART OF THE AMERICA N PROJECT. IT IS HIGHE R A ND ABOVE ETHNI C NATIONALISM. WHITE NATIO NALISM IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS. T HE BEAUTY OF THE NATION IS IT REPRESENTS A LOYALTY UP AND ABOVE A RACE OR S EC T OR RELIGION OR PARTISANSHI P. HOST: RICH LOWRY, AUTH OR OF THE BOOK ""THE C ASE FOR NATIONALISM ."" IT IS OUR T OPIC OF CONVERSATION IN OUR FINA L INSTA LLMENT OF ""WASHINGTON JOURNAL."" R EPUBLICANS (202) 748-8001. D EMOCRATS ( 202) 748-8000. I NDEPENDENT S (202) 748-8002. I WANT TO T ALK ABOUT WHAT THE CR ITERIA FOR CITIZEN SHIP IN THIS COUNTRY HAS TO SAY ABOUT H OW WE SEE OURSELVES. THE CRITERI ON FOR CITIZEN SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES IS N OT AN ATTACHMENT TO A SET OF IDEAS, T HIS STANDARD ENLIGHTENED BY SOME STANDA RDS BUT ALSO SPEAKS TO A DEEP BELIEF , SUC H THAT IT CONFERS EXT RAORDINA RY PRIVILEGES TO THOSE BORN HERE. IT ALSO IMP LIE S THE NATION DOES NOT CH OOSE US AND WE DO NOT CHOOSE IT. GUEST: THIS IS A KEY INSIGHT OF NATIONALISM , THAT WE ALL HAVE A SENSE OF BE LONGING THAT MOST OF US DO NOT CHOOSE. A LOT OF PE OPLE CHOOSE TO COME HERE BUT MO ST OF US DO NOT AND WE ARE BORN HERE. WE ARE LOYA L TO THE COUNTRY AS HEART OF A DEEP A ND ABIDING CONNECTION THAT GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND CHOI CE. IT GOES TO ME HOW IMPORTANT C ULTURE IS IN THIS COUNTR Y BUT GOES BACK T O THE BIBLE, WHERE WE GE T THE IDEA WE ARE A CHOSEN PEOPLE OR ALMOST CHOS EN PEOPLE, AS LINCOLN PUT IT MORE MODESTLY. AND THAT TH E FIRST COVENANT IN AMERICAN HI STORY, EV ERY TOWN AND CHURCH FOUN DED ON THIS CON TINENT THEREAFTER IS THE PRODUCT OF A COVENANT. THE MOST IMPORT ANT I S THE U.S. CO NSTITUTION. HOST: WHAT ARE OTHER COVEN ANTS WE SHOULD LOOK BACK TO? GU EST: THE BASIC IDEA COMES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT. IT IS INTER ESTING BECAUSE IT IMPLIES A K IND OF LIM IT ON GOD, THA T IF YOU FULFILL YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO HIM, HE HAS OBLIGAT IONS TO YOU. YOU SEE THI S REFLEC TED IN THE CONS TITUTION WHICH DOES NOT JUST CR EATE NATIONAL PO WER, BUT ALSO LIMITS NATIONAL POWER. HOST : JOE I S UP FIRST OUT OF CONNECTICUT , A REPUBLICA N. THE BOOK IS ""THE CAS E FOR NATIONALISM ."" RICH LOWRY IS HE RE. CALLE R: I J UST WANT TO SAY I TOTALLY SUP PORT RIC H LOWRY' S IDE A IN HIS BOOK AN D OF COURSE THE BIBLICAL FO UNDATIONS AND SO ON. I SEE SO MUCH IN THIS COUNTR Y, ES PECIALLY UNDER THE OBAMA ADMIN ISTRAT ION, AND WANTED TO GO CONTR ARY TO THAT. WANTI NG TO BRING IN A NOT , OTHE R COUNT RIES A ND THEIR L AWS AND SO ON. WE HAVE THE WHOLE C ONCEPT OF PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE , IS LAMIC PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN LET'S SA Y SHARIA LAW INTO THE COUNTRY . WE HAVE A HISTORY A ND IT IS SAD ABOU T T HE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND ESPECIALLY STUDENTS. I TAUGHT AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND FOUND S O MANY STUDENTS WERE CONSTITUTIO NALLY IGNORANT AN D BIBLICALLY IGNORANT. I WILL GIVE YOU ONE CASE AND THEN I WILL LET IT GO. TRUMP HAS B EEN ON TRI AL IN THIS IMPEACHMENT THING. WITH THE CO NCEPT THA T HE TOO K A CANDIDATE A ND EXPOSED THE M, TALKING ABOUT JOE B IDEN. THE TRUTH I S WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONSTITUTION AND YOU LOOK AT THE SECO ND ARTICLE WHICH GOVER NS THE PRESIDE NT, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THIRD SECTION OF ARTICLE TWO, YOU FI ND OUT THERE IS A TAKE CARE C LAUSE AND THE PRE SIDENT IS RESPONSI BLE FOR MAKING SURE THE LAWS OF THE LAND ARE UPHELD. THI S IS NATIONALISM. HOST: YOU B ROUGHT UP A LOT OF TOPICS. GUEST: THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE CALLERS CON , COMMENTS IS THAT OUR LAWS SHOULD GOVERN US AND NO O NE ELSE'S LAWS SHOULD . THIS GETS T O THE REASON WHY EMPIRES HAVE NEVER BEEN DEMOCRATIC. A NATION IS T HE MOST NATION AL , NATURAL FOR M OF ORGANIZATION TO CREATE A SENSE OF UNITY TH AT WE ALL CAN LIVE TOGETHER UNDER THE S AME SET OF RULES AND LAWS. YOU HAVE VA RIOUS PEOPLES AND NATIONS AND PART OF A LARGER CORRECT , COLLECTION. THE CULTURE WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE LANGUAG E WILL BE DOMINANT. NO ONE ELSE IN THE EMPI RE WILL LIKE THIS. THEY WILL BRISTL E AGAINST IT. AS LONG AS THERE IS ENOUGH COURSE OF P OWER, IT WILL HOLD OF THE , TOGE THER. SOVIET EMPI RE IN THE 20 CENT URY FEL L APART, COLONIAL EM PIRES FELL APART ALL F OR THIS REASON PEOP LE WANT TO GOVERN T HEMSELVES AND THEY SHOULD GOVE RN THEMSELVES. LOWER IN TH E HIERARC HY OF ORGANIZATIO N, YOU GO TO TRIBE OR SECT, BU T O NE WITH POSTCOLONIA L STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AF RICA IS THAT THE RE WAS NOT A SENSE OF NATIONAL FEELING, A SENSE OF SO CIAL TRUS T, A SENSE OF LEE , W E. THAT IS WHE N DEMOCR ACY IS ABLE TO WORK. TH E BEST FO RM OF ORG ANIZA TIO N IS A NATION . CALLER: THI S IS A G REAT SEG UE FOR T HIS QUESTION. YOU SAID AM ERICAN NA TIONALISM RISES OR SO MEHOW RISES ABOVE ETHNI C NATI ONALISM . HE KNOWLEDG E T ELL THE UN DERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE COUN TRY WAS CHANGING. IS BECOMING A LOT MORE BROWN AND P ART OF WHAT OUR JOB WAS WAS TO IMBUE PE OPL E WHO CAME INTO THE COUNTRY IS THIS CON SIS TENT WITH YOUR V IEW O F NAT IONAL ISM AND HOW YOU MAINTAI N A NATIONAL DEMOCRACY A S OPPOSED TO CHANGING AN EMPIRE. GUE ST: IT H AS BEEN IMPORTANT THROUGHOUT HISTORY THA T WE ASSIMILATE IMMIGRANTS. I THINK PEO PLE LOOK AT THE CLICHE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF I MMIGRANTS AND BELIEVE WE ALWAYS H AD A HIGH LEVEL OF IMMIGRAT ION. THAT IS NOT TRUE. IMMIGRATION LEVELS HAVE GONE UP AND DOWN. T HE BARGAIN IS YOU COME HERE A ND EM BRACE OUR IDEALS AND ASSIMILATE INTO THE BROADER CULTURE. TH AT HAS BEEN TRUE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY . THIS COUNTR Y CAN ASSIMIL ATE A LOT OF IMMI GRANTS. I WOULD LIK E TO SUE THE U.S. ADOPTED SYS TEM THAT IS MORE DRE SSE D TO DO MORE OF IT OF HI S US ON SKILLS R ATH ER THAN LEGAL IMMIGRANTS WE ARE TAKI NG. I ALSO WANT TO SEE A ROBUST CU LT URE OF THE SIMULATION. ONE THING I S WE HAD AN ENORMOUS WAVE OF IMMIGRAT ION . YOU HAD EVERY ELITE INSTI TUTION CONCERNED ABOUT A SIM ULATING IMMIGRANTS. WHETHER IT WAS PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIO NS OR SCHOOLS. HISTORICALL Y HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION WITHOUT THA T MACHIN ERY OR CULTURE OF THE SIMULATION, WHICH WORRI ES ME. HOST: DO YO U THIN K AMERICAN NATIONALISM IS WHAT PRESIDENT T RUMP MEANS WHEN HE SAYS AMERIC A FIRST. ? GUEST: I DO . I THINK IT IS AN INSTINCTUAL EXPRESSION OF THE BELIEF THAT WE PUT OUR INTERESTS FIRST. I TH INK TRU MP, WHEN HE IS ON THE TELE PROMPTE R, IT IS UNASSAILABLE. SOME OF THE NATIONA LISTIC STATEMENTS HE MADE THE U. N. AND THE SPEECH HE GAVE, TH E BEST SPEECH OF HIS PRESIDENCY, VERY NATIONALISTIC SPEECH. ALL THAT IS TERRIFIC . WHAT SHOULD BE THE UNIF YING POTENTIAL AN APPEAL O F N ATIONALISM . THERE IS A SENSE WE ARE ALL IN , I N THIS TOG ETHER. HOST: A REV IEW OF Y OUR BOOK IN THE WASHINGTON POST. HE WR OTE IT SE EMS PA RT OF A LARGER EFFO RT ON T HE RIGHT TO CREATE AN AFTER-TH E-FACT FRAMEWORK FOR TRUMPISM TO CONTORT THE PRESIDENT'S IMPULSES IN TO A COHERENT WORLDVIEW T HAT CAN OUTLAST HIM. A SORT OF RESCUE MISSION FOR THE CON SERVATIVE MOVEMENT. RICH LOWRY HAS I DEALS. DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVE A DAMN? GUE ST: ON T HE RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BA CK FILLING SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT E LECTED . US UALLY WHE N YOU HAVE A MAJOR DISRU PTION IN A POLITICAL P ARTY, YOU SEE A MOVEMENT BUILDING OV ER TIME. WHEN THE NE W LEFT TOOK OVER T HE DEMOCRATS IN THE 70'S , T HIS WAS A MOVEMENT YOU COULD SEE ON THE STREETS AND VARIOUS DISSIDENT L EADERS. TRUMP COMES OUT OF NOWH ERE. THERE HAS B EEN AN EFFORT TO THINK THROU GH WHAT HE MEANS AN D W HAT I ATTEMPTED TO DO IN THE BOOK, IT IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT TRUMP. IT IS A BOO K OCCASIONED BY TRUMP, WHERE HE HAS HIT ON AN I MPORTANT F ACTOR IN OUR POLITICS AND HISTORY THAT HAVE B EEN RELATIVELY NEGLECTED A ND OFTEN MISUN DERSTOOD. WHAT I WOUL D LIKE PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY BOOK IS THERE'S SOM ETHING TO THIS NATION ALISM THAT IS DEE PER THAN TRUMP AND ONE TRU MP IS GONE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AS T HE REPU BLICAN PARTY SHOULD NOT TURN IT S BACK ON NATIONAL ISM AND IT SHOULD BE THOUGHTF ULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE PROGRAM GOI NG FORWA RD. HOST: CHRIS , A RE PUBLICAN, GOOD MORNING. CALLER: THA NK YOU, YOU ARE ONE OF OUR BEST DE FENDERS O F THE CONSTITUTION. THE BIRTHRA TE THING BEING BORN MEANS YOU A RE TAU GHT OUR HISTORY. WE ARE STIL L IN TH E FIGHT. WE CAME IN HERE FIGHTING AN D ARE STILL FIGHT ING FO R OUR FREEDOM. IT IS BEING TAKEN FROM US NOW FROM TH E IN SIDE. I AM AMAZED AT IT. THE BIRTHRA TE IS, I AM A CITIZEN AND I HAVE THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY AND MY SOUL AND HEART A ND I WENT TO VIETNAM AND FOUGHT IN VIETNAM. IN 1971. I AM A PROU D VETER AN AND A PATRIOT AND IT IS KILLING ME TO SEE THIS TH ING GOING AWAY FROM ME BY OUR O WN PEOPLE. I WOULD NEV ER TURN ON THEM BUT THEY ARE TURNING ON US. I WA NT MY COUNTRY BACK. THAT IS WIT H THIS IS ALL ABOUT. GUEST: THAN K YOU FOR YOUR SE RVICE. COSMOPOLITA N, BEGINNING I N THE 1960 'S AND 1970'S, THIS HAS SE EPED INTO THE AMERICAN ELITE. WE H AVE A D NA TIONA LIZI NG ELITE, WHICH THE LATE GREAT SOCIA L SCIE NTIST SAMUEL HUNT ON SAID IS PROBABLY UNPRECEDENT ED IN WORLD HISTORY BEC AUSE USUALLY CONSERVATIVES ARE BUILDIN G OF THE NATION AND WE HAVE AN ELITE TH AT IN SOME RESPECTS. W HEN IT IS TAUGH T, THE IDEA THAT I T IS A TALE OF UNR ELIEV ED REPRESSION AND WELL , WOE. WE HAV E GRA VE NATIONAL SI NCE , HO ST: WHAT IS AN EXAMPLE? GUEST: IT I S IMPORTAN T TO FOCUS ON THE HIST ORY OF SLAVERY AND JIM CROW IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK CONSE RVATIV ES HAVE FALLEN DOWN OVER T HE DE CADES AND WANTED TO LOOK PAST A ND SUGARCOAT IT. THE LEAD ES SAY IN THAT SERIES SAID THE AMERICAN RE VOLUTION WAS ABOUT PROTE CTING SLAVERY AND THAT IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE. IT SUGGESTS THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTED P ROPERTY IN MAN WHEN AC TUALLY, BETWEEN THE OFFICES OF JAMES MADIS ON, THE PHRASE WAS EXPLICITLY LEFT OUT OF THE CONSTITUTIO N WHICH REPRESENTED A COMPROMIS E BUT THE IDEA WAS THE CON STITUTION SHOULD NOT AFFIRMATIVE LY DEFEND SLAVERY TOWARD LONG -TERM GOALS. OF BEING TR UER TO ID EALS A ND ELIMINATING SLAVERY. YO U HAD A T URNING AWAY OF SLA VERY IN THE NORTH A T TH E TIME OF THE REVO LUTION. EVERY STATE IN THE NORTH A DOPTING A LOOSENING O F THE SLAVE SYSTE M IN THE SOUTH. WE WOULD NO T HAVE HA D ANTISLAVERY TO THEM THE CIVIL W AR IF THE REVOLUT ION , IT IS UP SE CURING TH AT AND YO U ARE PURPORT ING TO TEACH US TR UTHFUL HISTORY. THAT IT IS NOT JUST TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. HOST: , DE FINE AMERICAN CULTURE? GUEST: AMER ICAN CULTURE IS ORGANIC AND HAS CHANGED OVER TIME AND IT SHOULD. AT THE CORE OF IT IS THE E NGLISH LANGUAGE. L ANGUAGE IS VERY PRI MORDIAL. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. WITH SOME E XCEPTIONS LIKE SWITZERLAND , WHEN YOU HAVE WITHIN A NATION LA RG E PARTS OF THE POPULAT ION THAT SPEAKS SOME OF THE LINE WHICH, YOU WILL HAVE A PROBLEM. TWO YEARS A GO NEARLY TORN APART BY A DRIVE FOR QUEBEC INDEPENDENC E BECAUSE THEY SPEAK FRENCH AND HAVE THEIR OWN CULTURE ON THAT BASIS. YOU CAN SEE SPA IN NOW. IT IS AT TH E CORE OF AME RICAN CULTURE. TH EN IT IS ALL THESE I NFORMAL MORES, OUR CUISINE AND THE WAY WE DRESS, P RED ILECTIONS AND ATTITUD ES A ND IMMIGRA NTS CAN ADOPT THIS CULTURE AND HAVE OVER OUR HI STORY ADO PTING TH IS CULTURE. WHEN I WAS A KID, THER E WAS ONE MEXICAN RES TAURANT WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE. I T WAS A TR EAT TO GO THERE. I REMEMBER LOBBYING MY MOM TO G O . AND NO W THERE IS A CHIPOTLE I EVERY 10 BLOCKS. THE AMERICA N COUP ZINE H AS CHANGED. BU T THERE IS A CORE OF I T THAT HAS TO STAY THE SAME IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE NATION. HOS T: WHAT DOES ONE HAVE TO DO TO SI MULATE? GUEST: THE MOST SUPPORT AND THINGS LEAR N THE LANGUAGE, LEARN THE H ISTORY, WHEN THE IDEALS AND FEEL A PART OF US. THIS IS ANOTHER IMP ORTANT ASPECT OF NATIONAL ISM. I SPENT A L OT OF TIME IN THE BOOK DISCUS SING TEDDY ROOSEVELT O N THIS THEME. SOMETHING H E WROTE AND SPOKE A BOUT POWERFULLY. HOST: ""THE CASE FOR NATIONALISM ."" NORMAN OUT OF NEW JERS EY.

I'M NOT SUR E WHAT NATIONALISM IS WAS SUCH A DIFFERENT COUNTRY IN EVERY STATE. GUEST: THAT IS A GREAT POINT. WE HAVE A F EDERAL SYSTEM THAT APPROP RIATELY HAS A LOT OF LEEWAY F OR DECENTR ALIZ ATION. WE'RE NOT L IKE FRANCE . BUT THE HYP OTHETICAL I USED TO I LLUSTRATE THE POINT ABOUT AMERICA AND ITS CULTURE IS, IF ON T HE STEP S OF THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE TONIG HT, AN D AFRICAN -AMERICAN MEETS A WHI TE AMERI CAN AND THEY INSTANTLY HAVE MORE I N COMMON THAN ANYONE ELSE AROUND THEM BECAUSE THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND CAN COM MUNICATE , THEY PROBABLY DRESS LARGELY THE SAME AND LIKE THE SAME CU ISINE AND HAVE AN ENORMOUS STOCK OF COMMON C ULTURAL KN OWLEDGE, AND THAT IS TRUE WHETHER THEY ARE FR OM NEW JERSEY OR W HETHER THEY ARE FROM CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY I N THAT SEN SE WE ARE A UN ITED NATION ALTHOUGH WE APPROPRIATELY UNDER THE CONSTIT UTIO N GIVE STATES AND LOCALIT IES A LOT OF LEEWAY F OR SELF-RULE. HOST: YOU M ENTIONED FRANCE A MO MENT AGO. I WANT TO TAKE VIE WERS TO THE MOME NT YOU OPENED YOUR BOOK. THIS IS FRE NCH PRES IDENT EMMANUEL MACRON FROM NOVEMB ER 12 OF 2018. >> THIS VISION OF F RANCE, A GENEROUS NATION WITH A VISI ON TO CARRY UNIVERSAL V ALUES HAVE IN A D ARK TIMES EXACTLY THE OPPOSIT E OF THE SELF ISHNESS OF A PEOPLE, WHICH ONLY LOOKS AT ITS OWN INTERESTS B ECAUSE PAT RIOTISM IS THE EXACT OFFSE T OF N ATIONALISTS. , NATIONALISM . NATIONALISM IS A BETRAY AL. BY PURSUING OU R OWN INTERESTS F IRST WITH NO REGARD TO OTHERS, WE ERASE THE VERY THING THE N ATION HOLDS MOST PRECIO US, T HAT WHICH GIVES IT LIFE AND MAKES IT GREAT, IT'S MORAL VALUES. GUEST: I TH INK IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG. HE B OTCHES THE DEFINIT ION OF PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM, AS WE TALKE D ABOUT AT THE TOP. THE IDEA TH AT FRANCE DOES NOT PURSUED ITS , PURS UE ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS I S COMPLETELY ABSURD. THE RE IS NO T INHERENTLY AN OPPOSITI ON BETWEEN IDEALS AND NATIONALISM. THE BEST NA TIONALISMS ARE INFUSED WITH IDEALS. THEY BOTH H AVE AN ATTACHMENT TO THE PARTICU LAR AND A BELIEF IN THE UNIVERSAL. YOU JUST LO OK AT FRE NCH NATIONALISM , WHICH A COU PLE OF CENTURIES AGO WAS BASED O N THE IDEA THAT FRANCE HAD THE MOS T CHRISTIAN KING, AND S UBSEQUENT TO THE FREN CH REVOLUTION WAS ACQUIRE D BY A ZEALOU S IDEALISM AN D UNIVERS ALIS M. I SPEND A S ECTION OF MY BOOK DIS CUSSING JOAN OF ARC, WHO I THINK IS A FIGURE THAT REPRESENTS THE POWER. IT I S NOT E XACTLY NATIONALISM. YOU COULD A RGUE IF TH E TERM APPLIES IT CERTAINL Y NATIONAL LOYALTY AND FEELING , SHE HAS A V ISION THAT SHE SHOULD FREE THE FRENCH LAND FROM THE EN GLISH AND THAT THE FR ENCH SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE FREN CH. AND SHE WIL L AS A TEENAGE G IRL UNDERT AKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY ENTERPRISE TO CHASE TH E ENGLISH FROM FRANCE. THE ENGLISH , TO ERASE AL L MEMORY OF H ER, TO SCATTER HER ASHES IN THE RIVER, THEY CANNOT ELIMINATE THE MEMORY OF HER BECA USE SHE HAS BEC OME A SYMBOL OF THE NATION AND HAS AN INCREDIBLE POWER THROU GHOUT FRENCH HIST ORY IN PARTICULAR AND THROUGH OUT ROSE HISTORY. I THINK MAC RO N WOULD DO WELL TO RECONSIDER THIS. HOST: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WH O SAY NATIONALISM WAS THE CAU SE OF TWO WORLD WARS? THIS IS CON GRESS WOMAN VAL DENNINGS ON NOVEMBER 10 . SHE SAI D, S HOWING A PICTURE OF A JEWISHNES S SYNAGOGUE , JEWISH SYNA GOGUE B URNING, TH IS IS WHERE NATIONALISM AND ANTI-SE MITISM LEADS. ALWAYS. GUE ST: NATI ONALISM IS AN OLD AND POW ERFUL FO RCE AND C AN BE OF USE, WHI CH IS TRUE OF BAS ICALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS LIFE. DEMOCRACY I S ABUSE. W E D O NOT SAY THEREFO RE W E SHOULD BE DEMOCRATS. I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN T HE TIME OF THE NAZIS, BUT THEY CLEARLY HAD NATIONA LIST IC APPEAL AND USED NATIONALISTIC SYMBOLS, BU T HILLER WAS NOT JUS T A NATIONALIST . WHAT MADE HIM ON E OF THE MOST EVIL FIGURE S IN ALL OF WORLD HISTORY WAS THE UNIQUE ASPE CTS OF MOXIE AL I , IDEOLOGY, A BLOODSOAK ED VISION OF S O-CALLE D BIOLOGICAL RACISM WHER E THEIR HANDS SHOULD RULE GERMAN Y AND ALL OF EUROPE B Y C ONQUEST . THIS WAS NO T TRULY A NAT IONALIST PROJECT. BY THE END, HE WAS HAPPY T O SEE THE GERMAN NATION DESTROYED A S WELL. IT FAILED T O LIVE UP TO HIS L UNATIC VISION. CALLER: GOO D MORNIN G. I'M ALSO A VETE RAN. THIS GENERA TOR - - GENTLEMAN TALKS ABOUT MIGRA TION A ND WE TALKED ABOU T BIRTHRIGHT AND CHAIN MIGRATION A ND THAT. DON'T WE NE ED TO FIRST LOOK AT THE FIRST FAMILY? AND THE CHA IN MIGRATION HAPPENING T HERE WITH MELANIA AND HER PARENTS ? THEN WE TAL K ABOUT LANGU AGE AN D EVERY O THER COUNT RY SPE AKS A LANGUAGE. IT IS A FACT. THERE WERE MANY L ANGUA GES BEFORE WHIT E MAN SHOWED UP. MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDRED S. MY QUESTION OF THIS MAN IS WHAT ABOUT CHAIN MIGRATION? GUEST: I'M NOT SURE THAT THE FI RST FAMILY TELLS US MUCH ABO UT WHAT THE BROAD , ROTTER CONV ERSATION SHOULD BE. A BASIC QUE ST ION AS WITH EVERY OTHER POLIC Y IS, DOES IT SERVE OUR INTERES TS, IS IT IN OUR NATIONAL IN TERESTS? THE ATTACHMENT TO THE CLIC HE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS OF SKEWERS ALL RATIONA L THINKING AB OUT IMMIGRATION. ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THE COUN TRY'S M ANY PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD WANT TO COME HERE. MY PO INT IS WE SHOULD BE C HOOSIER AN D GET IMMIGRA NTS WHO ARE PRE PARED TO THRIVE IN THIS COUNTRY AS SOON AS THE Y ARRIVE. I PUT MORE EMPHAS IS ON ENGLISH SPEAKING. IT DOES NOT MEAN TH ERE WOULD NOT BE A HUMANITAR IAN ELEMENT. I THINK THEY'RE ALWAYS SHOULD BE I N THERE SH OULD BE A ROBUST REFUGEE PRO GRAM. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH MORE O F AN EMPHASIS ON SKILLS JUST BECAUSE IT IS A DIF FERENT COUNTRY AND A DIFFE RENT ECONOMY THAN IT WAS IN T HE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, WHERE YOU C AN HAVE IMMIGRANTS COMING IN B Y THE BOATLOAD AN D YOU COULD BASICALLY PLUG THEM I NTO THE FACTORY LIN E AND TR UST THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE OK. THE BASIC E CONO MY WERE EDUCATION A ND SKILLS ARE MORE IMPORTANT T HAN EVER, I THI NK THAT SHOULD BE R EFLECTED IN OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY. HOS T: ALABA MA, BRENDA, GOO D MORNING. CALLER: I A GREE ABO UT TRUMP. THE WORLD IS ON FIRE AND HE IS A TERRIBLE PERSON. STEPHEN MIL LER IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST . EVERYONE IN THE RAPE THAT - - EVE RYONE KNOWS KAVAN AUGH R APED GUES T: THE CHARGES AGAINST BRETT KAVAN AUGH DO NOT STAND UP, A ND I BELIEVE VERY STRONG LY THEY WERE MANUFACTURED. AND NOT EVE RYONE IS FOR TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY. WE HAVE A V ERY STARKLY DIV IDED COUNTRY ON TRUMP, A ND I THINK IT HAS JUST BEEN REMARKABLE HOW IN THE LAST THREE YEARS , IT FEELS LIKE SO MUCH HAS HAPPENE D. BASICALLY, EVERYONE IS EXACTLY WHERE THEY STARTED OUT WITH ON TRUMP, M ORE OR LESS. THERE WAS O NE NBC POLL ON IMP EACHMENT , AND IT HAD 42% FAVORING TR UMP'S, AND 46% OPP OSING IT, WHICH THE N UMBERS SHO ULD SOUN D FAMILIAR COME BECAUSE THEY ARE TH E POPULAR VOTE FROM 2016. I THINK THI S WILL B E, AB SENT SOME UNFORESEEN EVENTS, ANO THER VERY CLOSE ELECTION. H OST: A COM MENT FROM TONY O N TWITTER, SAYING WORDS GANDH I AND NELSON MAND ELA NAT IONALISTS? THE PROBLEM SEE MS TO BE IN THE APPLICATION OF NATIONAL IST PRINCIPLES, NOT THE DOCTRIN E ITSELF. GUEST: BOTH GANDHI AND NELSON MANDELA WER E NATIONALISTS. NELSON MAND ELA SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFE CT OF B EING GOVER NED BY OTHER PEOPLE IS A LIVING SOCIAL HELL FOR OT HER PEOPLE, AND THAT IS A NATIONALIST IC SENTIMENT. ALSO, ANOTHER COR E BELIEF DOCT RINE OF NATIONALISM, THE NATION BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. IT DOES NOT BELONG TO A NY ONE SECT, ANY P ARTICULAR ELITE, AND THE GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO S ERVE THE NATION, NOT THE OTH ER WAY AROUND. POST: 20 MI NUTES LEFT WITH RICH L OWRY THIS MORNING. THE BOOK IS THE CASE FOR NATIONALISM , THE LAST INSTALLMENT IN OUR WEEK LY AUTHOR SERIES ON W ASHINGTON JOURNAL. WE ALWAYS D O IT AROUND THIS TIME O F YEAR. THIS IS PAT RICK IN COFFEE SPRINGS, AL ABAMA, A REPUBLICA N. GOOD MORNING. >> YES, GOOD M ORNING TO YOU SIR. MY QUESTION TO YOU, MR. LO WERY, WITH NATIONALISM AND ACTUARY CITIES , S ANCTUARY C ITIES. AS A NATION , HASN'T THIS SANCTU ARY CITY BUSINESS GONE TOO FA R? ELECTED OFF ICIALS OF THE SANC TUARY HOLDINGS ARE TELLING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, LEAVE MY PE OPLE ALONE, AND YET THEY ARE SQ UAWKING N OW ABOUT G IVING ALL OF THES E ILLEGALS DRIVERS LIC ENSES, A ND THAT IS A FREE TICKET ALMOST AT ANY VOTING REGISTRATIO N BOOTH IN AM ERICA, IS A PHOTO ID, BASICAL LY BASED ON YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE. I WOULD LIK E YOUR T AKE ON THAT. GUEST: WELL , I STR ONGLY OPPOSE SANCTUARY C ITIES. THEY ARE A DISGRACE AND THE IDE A THAT THEY W OULD NOT C OOPERATE WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY HAVE IMMIGRANTS IN JAIL WHO HA VE CO MMITTED CRIMES, NOT COOPERA TING WITH FEDERAL GOV ERNMENT AND FINDING OUT WHAT EL SE THEY ARE GUILTY OF AND HAND ING THEM OVER I F DEP ORTAT ION IS CALLED FOR IS TERR IBLE . WE HAVE SEEN THE DO WNSIDES IN SOME OF THESE HORRI FIC CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY PEOPLE W HO ARE SPRUNG WHEN THEY S HOULD HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. I THINK YOU A RE ABS OLUTELY RIGHT AND THIS IS WRO NG, AND A PRACTICE THAT SHOULD STOP, BUT SOME LOCALI TIES HAVE DOUBLED DOWN ON THIS AS A W AY TO THUMB THEIR NOSE AT PRESIDENT T RUMP. HOST: YOUR THOUGHTS ON GUN SANCTUARY C ITIES? VIRGINIA LE ADERS URG ED RESISTANCE TO GUN LAWS, COMPA RE IT TO THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. GUEST: I DO NOT THINK WE ARE IN A RE VOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN T HIS COUNTRY, AN D THAT IS A G ROSS RHE TORICAL OVERREACH. I DON'T SUP PORT AS A GENERAL MATTER GUN CONTROL. I THINK THE B IZARRE PART OF THE DEBA TE IN THIS COUNTR Y OVER MASS SHOOTING IS REALLY M OST OR ALL OF THE GUN CONTROL THAT ARE OFFERED AS A MEANS TO CO MBAT OR DISCOURAGE OR EVEN ELIMINATE MASS KILLIN G'S H AS ZERO INTERACTION WITH MASS KILLIN GS, IF YOU LOOK AT BACKGROUND CHECKS, THE MOST BA SIC OF THESE IDEAS, UNIVERSAL B ACKGROUND CHECKS, SO- CALLED, THE PROBLEM IS MOST OF THE SE SHOOTERS HAVE NOT BE EN ADJUDICATED, THEY ARE NOT GUI LTY OF A CRIME PRIOR TO THESE HE INOUS ACTS, AND T HEY PASSED BACK GROUND CHECKS. SO I DO NOT THIN K THIS AGENDA MAKE S ANY SENSE. HOST: TO BR IDGETON, MISSOURI. THIS IS ANT HONY, AND INDEPENDENTS. GOOD MORNIN G. CALLER: GOO D MORNING. I SEE IT IN MORE OF A B IBLICAL PERSPECTIVE . I AM NOT SURE IF YOU ARE FAMILIA R WI TH THE PROPHECY OF THE ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT UNDER THE O NE WORLD RULER IN TH E END OF TIME S HERE? GUEST: I CA NNOT SAY I'M AM HIGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT, NO. C ALLER: WEL L ACCORD ING TO THE PROPHECY, T HERE WILL BE ONE WORLD RULER AND ONE WORLD RELIGION, AND ONE WOR LD GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN SEE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF THAT WITH ALL OF THE DIVERSION A ND ALL THE CORRUPT ION AND ALL OF THE HATRED IN THE WORL D. MR. BIDEN: MR. LOWERY? , POST: , HO ST: MR. L OWRY? GUES T: WHEN PEOPLE STARTED READING THE BIBLE I N THE VERNACULAR, THEY ALL IM AGINED THEMSELVES, INCLUDING E NGLAND AND SUBSEQUENTL Y US, AS THE SUCCESSOR TO ANCIENT ISR AEL, WHI CH WAS A NATION, N OT A MODERN NATION, BUT ON THE BORDER OF ANCIENT ISR AEL, HAS ITS OWN LAWS, S ENSE OF TOGETHERNESS AND MISSION , AN D THIS NO TION REALLY PUT AN IMPRINT ON THE MODE RN WESTERN WORLD AND T HE NATIONS THAT MAKE IT UP. HOST : WE SP ENT TIME TALKIN G TO EVANGELICAL VOTERS ONLY ABOUT THEIR SUPPO RT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT ISN'T THE EVANGEL ICAL RIGHT ACTING LIKE A CONTROLLING ELITE IN CO NTEMPORAR Y AMERICA? GUEST: I DO N'T , I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL. I THINK PAR T OF THE SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS , YOU READ THE TWEET, I HE ARD EARLI ER THAT HE IS GOING TO PROTECT THEM FROM CONTROLLING ELITES. THE EVANGELICAL SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IS MORE A P OPULIST IN THAT SENSE. MOST EVANGE LICALS THAT I ENCO UNTER AND TALK TO, TH EY SU PPORT TRUMP, BUT THEY ARE FULLY A WARE OF HIS FLAWS AND THE DOWNSID ES OF HOW HE C ONDUCTS HIMSELF AND WHAT HE SAYS, IT IS JUST THEY D O NOT SEE ANY ALTERNA TIVE AND WHAT TH EY ARE BEING OFFERED FROM THE OT HER SIDE IS A PARTY THAT SUPPOR TS ABORTION ON DEMAND I N EVERY CI RCUMSTANC E THAT HAS VE RY LITTLE REGA RD FOR CONSCIE NCE RIGHTS, THI NKS THE CONSTITUTIO N IS A LIVING DOCUMENT TH AT SHOULD BE CHANGED IN KEEPING WITH POLITICAL A GENDAS, SO THEY ARE REALLY THROWN IN THE ARMS OF TRUMP. SOME EVANGE LICALS ARE VERY STRONG TRUMP THIS. I THINK THE E VANGELICAL LEADERS WHO GO OUT ON T V AND D EFE ND EVERYTHING HE SAYS, EVERY WORD HE SAYS ARE DI SGRACING THEMSELVES AND THEY SHOULDN'T DO IT, THAT TH ERE SHOULD BE AN AWARENESS A ND A FORTHRIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DOWN S BY, B UT MAK ING THE CASE THAT IN THIS WORLD OF GR AY, HE IS BETTER T HAN THE ALTERNATIVE. HOST: THIS IS THAT TWEET THAT YOU JUST RE FERE NCED, BRET HUME I N RESPONSE TO THE CHRISTIANITY TODAY EDITO RIAL COLUMN, CALLING ON PRESIDEN T TRUMP'S REMOVAL FROM OFFICE . SA YING A DA Y AFTER THE T WEET CAME OUT, PEOPLE MYSTIFIED B Y EVANGELICAL SUPPORT TRUMP DO NO T SEEM TO GET THE REASON WHY. EVANGELICAL S DO NOT SUPPORT HIS CONDUCT, BU T THEY BELIEVE HE IS THEIR ENEMY'S ENEMY AND IS WILL ING TO FIGHT. THAT HOUR O F WASHINGTON JOURNAL SHOULD ALRE ADY BE AVAILABLE O N THE WEBSITE . THIS IS DON ALD IN SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, A DEMOCRAT. GOOD MORNIN G. CALLER: GOO D MORNING. I WILL BE R EAL QUICK. A CO UPLE THINGS I WANT TO SAY , N ATIONALISM , PHRASES LIK E NATIONALISM AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE S HOULD JUST BURY, BECAU SE THEY TAKE O N A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. ANOTHE R THI NG I WAN T TO SAY, I THINK THE REASON WHY YOU WROTE THIS BOOK IS BEC AUSE YOU R PARTY, OR Y OUR TRUMP SUPPO RTERS, THAT TRUMP HAS R EALLY GONE AGAINS T CLIMATE CHANGE AND EVERYTH ING, AND YOU GUY S KNOW T HERE IS GOING TO BE AN IN FLU X OF ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES PO SSIBLY COMING INTO THIS COUNTR Y BEC AUSE OF THE POLICY OF T HIS ADMINISTRATION TO TOTALLY PUT THEIR BLINDERS ON TO CLIMA TE CHANGE. YOUR COMMEN TS ON THAT? GUEST: THAN K YOU. THAT IS NOT WHY I WROTE THE BOOK , BUT I WILL TAKE UP THE ISSU E OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FACT OF THE MATTER IS, ANY U.S. PO LICY BASI CALLY MAKES NO DIFFEREN CE IN THE GLOBAL TEMP ERATURE OF 80 TO 10 0 YEARS F ROM NOW. E VEN THE GREEN N EW DEAL WOULD MAKE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE UN ITED STAT ES THAT IS FEE DING GLOBAL EMIS SIONS. >> JOE BIDEN.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY GOO DNESS. SUNDAY IN P ETERBOR OUGH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE THIS STATE, FOR REAL. YOU HAVE HE ARD ME SAY THAT. I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WH O REPRESENTED THIS STATE, AND SOME OF YOU HEAR D ME SAY IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HO ME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT , EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERY BODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATTER OF F ACT, FIRST TIME I RAN FOR T HE UNITED DATE S SENATE, I WAS 29 YE ARS OLD D OES UN ITED STATES SENA TE, I WAS 29 YEARS OL D, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I BETTE R BE CAREFUL. BEEN A GREA T FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN IR AN, MY STATE WA S A LITTLE LIKE YOURS , , I RAN, MY S TA TE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS. I REMEMBER, I STARTED O FF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUTHERN PA RT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. T HEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. W E WE RE A BORDER ST ATE, NOT SURE WHAT SIDE W E WANT TO FIG HT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE S OUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOUTHERN. THEY TALK A T YOU LIKE YO U ARE A GOOD OLD FELLA. THE WAY YOU GO IN DELAW ARE, YOU WORK YO UR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHA T YOU SA Y, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOW N HERE. EDGAR C BEN NETT - - YOU COULD N OT CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU A RE NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YO U KNOW YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOM E. EDGAR C. SE EMED A LO T MORE CONSERVATIV E THAN I WAS, BUT WE RE HAPPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO W E WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS C HURCH IN D OWNTOWN SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BE AUT IFUL CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, AND HAD THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FRON T LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELONG TO I N UPSTA TE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH'S. Y OU WALK THROUGH THE HEADSTO NES AND THE ENTRANCE TO GO UP. THE MINISTE R WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. H E SAID, WE HA VE WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED EIGHTH SENA TE , U NITED STATES SENATE. HOPEFULLY H E WILL GRE ET THE PARISHIONER S AS THEY WALK OUT. I DID NOT E XP ECT THAT, BUT I WAS VERY FL ATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTER SH AKING HANDS WITH EVERYB ODY. EDGAR SEAT WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG O AK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA . AFTER THE W ORDS - - AF TERWARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID , I T WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HO RSE'S TAIL OVER T HERE. HE SAID OF, THAT IS MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: TRUE STORY. I WANT TO G ET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMBER ONE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMIN G AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAV E TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTI AL ISSUE YOU O N THOUGH, MR. MAYOR, IF W E GET FOUR MORE Y EARS OF DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHAR ACT ER OF OUR COUN TRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBO LE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. IT MATTERS A LOT WHAT WE ARE GOIN G TO DO AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO PI CK. WHEN I ANNO UNCED FOR THE SEN ATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE MERELY WHY I WAS RUNNING WHE N I RAN FOR PRESIDE NT. THERE'S THR EE REASONS. ON E, TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE I T HINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, E SPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPEN ED IN CHARLOTT ESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPL E COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCRE ECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT W HAT THEY THOUGHT, AN D HE SAID THE RE WERE VERY FINE P EOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT H AS NEVER SAID ANYTHI NG LIKE THAT, FOR R EAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAID SOMETH ING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL W AR, BUT NO PRESIDENT H AS EVER SA ID ANYTHING LI KE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REAS ONS I AM RUNNING, TO RESTORE A S ENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THO SE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDEN T. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDE NT HAS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVE RY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED THE ARK OF CONCLUSI ON , OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER A ND WIDER, AND IT IS BEING SHUTD OWN. I THINK IT IS BEING CORRO SIVE F OR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WA S RUNNING, TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS TAKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHI EST MIDDLE CLASS IN TH E WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORL D. ALL THE DAT A SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMERICA N PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HA D. WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY BE FORE IN THE LAST CE NTURY. WE HAVE NEV ER LOST THAT S ENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED . THIS TIME W HEN WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE HAVE TO BRING EV ERYBODY ALONG. EVER YBODY A LONG. FROM THE DI SABLED TO PEOPLE OF C ALLER, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKING PEOPLE , MY DAD WOUL D SAY I AM NO T LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNM ENT. JUST GIVE M E A SHOT. THE THIRD REASON I WA S RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY . I WAS PRETT Y ROUNDLY CRI TICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLE AGUES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM THE PR IMARY , NO, THERE A RE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE . THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE GO OD PE OPLE. THEY WOULD SAY Y EAH, J OE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE, REM EMBER? HEATED THE ARMS CO NTROL TREATIES, HE DID , A ND THEY WO ULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HA VE DONE, BUT T HAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THIS REPUBL ICAN PARTY IS DI FFERENT. IT IS DIFFE REN T, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO T HAT WE DID A LOT OF THESE THINGS. I T HINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTE LY CRITICAL. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE , I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLI C AND PARTY WELL. I HAVE BEEN O N THE RECEIVI NG END OF DONALD TRUMP'S BIL LION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ONLY SUR VIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FAMILY, GOING AFTER ME , I UND ERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT I T IS N OT ABOUT ME, I T IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AR OUND THE COUNTRY . PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGES. THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED TO RUN AND REP RESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. ALL THE PEO PLE. IMMIGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPEN DENT S, BECAUSE , DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPEN DENT S, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO ANYT HING. THIS COUNTR Y IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN GE T DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE O F POWER BY A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS, I CAN'T GET IT DONE THO UGH I AM JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DO NO T TH INK IT IS NAIVE AT AL L TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. AND THE NEE D TO DO IT. I BELIEVE W E CAN, BECAUS E I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSI TION , SOME OF THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING WIT H IN THIS NOMINA TION SAY TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER . IT CANNOT B E SUSTAINED I N AMERICA. IT CANNOT B E SUSTAINE D. IT IS NOT W HO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: SO W E HAVE TO. WE CANNOT S URRENDER T HE NOTION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF HA RD THINGS DONE BEFORE. DOE S NOT ME AN IT IS NOT G OING TO BE HARD THIS TIME. HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REP UBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE A ND SENATE TO V OTE WITH Y OU, AND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEA T THEM. AND I DO NOT ME AN BY GOI NG AF TER THEIR PERSONALITIES OR THE DIRT Y POLITICS OF GOING AFTER THEIR MOTIVES. LO OK AT WHA T HAS HAPPENED IN AMERICAN PO LITICS. EVEN SMALL STATE S THAT ARE CLOSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPEN S? I COME TO YOU AND I S AY, LOOK . I THINK YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSINESS. I THINK YOU ARE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU ARE THIS , BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORKOUT CLI MATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I LEARNED A LONG TIME A GO FROM MI KE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORITY LEADER FROM MONTAN A, MORE INTEGRITY I N HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST PEOPLE HADN'T HIT THEIR W HOLE BODY , HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR R EAL. HE SAID IT IS NOT A LWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOT IVES, BU T IT IS ALWAYS APPR OPRIATE TO QUESTION THEIR JUDGM ENT. YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR MOTIV ES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. THEN YOU CA N GET SOMETHI NG PASSED. WHEN IN FAC T A LOT HAS CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CA RDI SHOW , CAR NIE SHOW COMES THROU GH TOWN AND YO U FIND OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UND ER THE T HREE SHELLS, YOU USUALLY KNOW BETTER THE SECOND TIME. , BETTER THE SECOND TIME. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN IN FAC T SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRON MENT IS SO RIGHT FOR U S TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT A S DEMO CRATS OR REPUBLICANS , BUT AS A NA TION. WE CAN ONLY 21ST C ENTURY. WE , OWN THE 21S T CENTURY. I HAVE NEVE R BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS O F THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK . IF YOU THIN K ABOUT IT, W E ARE IN A SITUATION W HERE YOU'V E GOT TO GIVE , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF THEY DISAGREE WITH US, HE RE IS THE DEAL. TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS. CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE , I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FO R 67, 60 9 , I AM NOT SURE THE NU MBER OF CANDIDATES , LAST TIME OUT IN 2018 . THE ONLY GU Y INVITED IN ALL THE STA TES, FROM ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLV ANI A, STATE THAT WE LOS T AND/OR WERE CLOSE. GUES S WHAT WE DID ? WE DID NOT GO AFTE R THE PERSONALITIES OF THE PEOP LE WE R AN AGAINST, WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN 41 F EET AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE W ON 41 SEATS. BY T HE WAY, FO UR ACADEM Y GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PIL OT, DROPPING BOMBS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SAID, AL L OF A SUDDEN WH EN PEOPLE REALIZED REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED O BAMACARE. PEOPLE SAID , YOU LOST BE CAUSE IT IS NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT H APPEN ED?THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STA TE AND OTHERS AND SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TA KE AWAY OBAMAC ARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CO VER PRE-EXISTIN G CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTI L AGE 26 ANYMORE, ETC. EVERY ONE SA ID WELL, WHAT? BECAU SE PEO PLE DID NOT EVE N KNOW IT WAS OBAMACA RE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT - - I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BU T J OHN KNOWS , MR . PRESIDE NT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VICTORY L AP HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. I GOT IN TROUBLE ARE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRE SIDE CHAT , REM EMBER THAT? BUT T HE PRE SIDENT S AID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FAC E TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. IT WAS N'T U NTI L PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. IF YO U ARE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, GOVERNOR, Y OUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRE SSMAN WANTS TO TA KE AWA Y THIS THING YOU HAPPY. , YOU HAVE. P EOPLE SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN YOU CA NNOT CONVINCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. PEOPLE KNOW , I AM CONCLUDING WITH THIS A ND I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION T O CLIMATE CHA NGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT . C LIMATE CHANGE THRO UGH A WHOLE RANGE OF IS SUES, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOM EN ACT, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL, A WHO LE RANGE OF THINGS. EVERYBODY W HO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , I AM NOT BEING FACET IOUS. THIS IS REA LITY. EVEN THE SU PPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KNOW W HO HE IS, PEOPLE LIKE CAM, THEY K NOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THE M ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT T HEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DE CIDED THE Y LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE D ID OR THINGS DEMOCRATS D ID NOT DO OR W HATEVER . WE HAVE TO LET THEM KN OW THAT WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER F EAR. BECAUSE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEARS PEOPL , FE EDING FEA R TO PEO PLE. IF YOU SAY THE LIE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IT BRE AKS THROUGH. IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT , WE HA VE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CHOOSE T RUTH OVERLIES. WE CHOOSE S CIENCE OVER FICTION. OVER FICTIO N. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: FOR REAL. . WE GOT A LO T OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. I WANT TO S TA RT OFF BY THANKING EVERYONE UN DER THE AGE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KIDDO. I DON'T KNO W HOW YO U GOT HERE, BUT AFTER T HIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBODY U NDER 15, YOU GET SOM ETHING S PECIAL TOD AY, BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE BORING, BORING, BOR ING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. MY MOTHER W OULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, H USH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. SO FIRE AWA Y. WE HAVE PEO PLE IN THE AUDIENCE, G IVE THE MICROPHONE TO THEM , >> HELLO, THAN K YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOU R WORK ON THE ACA. MY CHILD WA S BORN SUPER SICK AND BEFORE THE ACA LIF TED LIFETIME INSURANCE C APS, I JUS T REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WITH ALL THESE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ACA, WH AT ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE T HAT ALL CHILDREN RE CEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY N EED AND CA N ACCESS THE MEDICAL SERVICES THEY REQUIRE? MR . BIDEN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST NAME? >> SARAH. MR. BIDEN: SARA H. YOU COULD H EAR A CRACK IN SARAH'S VOI CE THERE, BECAUSE MAN Y OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TH ING. WHEN I FIRS T GOT ELECTED , BEFORE I GOT SWORN IN, I WAS I N WASHINGTON AND A TRACT OR-T RA ILER BLINDSIDED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTE R CHRISTMAS S HOPPING, A ND KILLED MY W IFE AND DAUGHTER. M Y SONS SURVIVED. BUT WHAT HA PPENED, I HAVE INSURANCE. I HAD THE P EACE O F MIND THA T I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM GOOD D OCTORS. YO U KNOW, I GOT HOSPITALIZED YEARS AGO W ITH A CRAN IAL ANEURYSM. I WAS HOSPI TALIZED THE COUPLE OF TIMES. T HEY TOOK T HE TOP OF MY H EAD OFF THE SECOND TIME, SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND THE BRAIN THE F IRST TIME. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: BUT THOSE NURSES GAVE YOU HOPE. A ND MY SON, BEAU, ATTOR NEY GENERAL, A DECORATED WAR HERO , FOR REAL. A YEAR IN IRAQ, SI X MONTHS IN COZUMEL FOR , BEFO RE THAT. HE CAME HOM E AND WA S DIA GNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOM A, GIVEN MONTHS. IT WAS NOT COU LD HE , WOUL D HE LI VE, IT WAS WHEN . R UN OUT OF COVE RAGE. SUFFER PEACE. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. ONE OF THE THINGS MY DAD USED TO SAY IS THAT EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNIT Y. HOW CAN A P ARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHE N THEY HAVE A DYIN G DIALED CHIL D AND THERE IS NO T A DAMN THIN G YOU C AN DO ABOUT IT?HO W CAN A PAREN T MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNI TY WHE RE THEY HAVE A CHILD IN SCHOOL I CANNOT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY TO GET THEM TH ERE. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. HERE IS WHAT I SUPP OSE. I WILL NOT GO INTO EXCRUC IATING DETAIL, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO DO MORE, LET ME KNOW . NUMBER ONE, I TAKE OBAMAC ARE A ND FURTHER SUBSIDIZE I T SO IT CO STS LESS TO GET INTO OBAMACARE FOR EVERYONE, N O MATTER WHAT YOUR I NCOME IS, SO YOU CAN GET WHA T YOU CALL A GOLD PLAN, AND I F YOU CAN AFFORD, IF YOU HAVE GOOD INCOME, YOU CAN BUY INTO IT AND IN F ACT, YO U WILL NOT HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE MORE THAN $1000. THAT IS THE GOLD PLAN. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THAT PLAN. YOU CAN BUY A C HEAPER PLAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE. FOR T HOSE W HO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE PLAN, I PROVIDE WHAT A ROCK AND I WANTED , - - WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED , A RE USUALLY WOULD CALL HIM PR ESIDENT, BUT I DO NO T WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH TH E OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: I ME AN IT. I DO NOT WA NT TO GET THEM MIXED UP. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, A P UBLIC OPTI ON THAT PROVIDED ME DICARE, A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO IN FACT WAN TED TO B UY INTO A MEDICARE OPTION, IF THEY WANTED TO D O IT, AND IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT, IF THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAI D, T HEY WOULD AUTOMATICAL LY BE ENROLLED IN THIS MEDICA RE OPTION. IT IS MEDIC ARE FOR THOSE W HO WANT IT, BE CAUSE WE HAVE 160 MILLION PEOPLE NATI ONWIDE WHO IN FACT LIK E THE HEALTH CARE PLANS THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED, MANY OF TH EM WITH T HE UNIONS AND COMPANIES, THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE PLANS THAT THEY LIKE. THEY GAVE U P SIGNIFICANT SALARY CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO GE T THAT COVERAGE. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GIVE IT UP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT. LIKE MEDICA RE FOR ALL, AS A MATTER OF LAW, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY PRIVATE INSURANCE. YOU HAVE TO GET , GIV E IT UP. BARACK PROM ISED YO U COULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND IT TURN ED OUT NOT TO BE RIGHT. YOU CAN KEE P YO UR PLAN AS LONG AS YOU R COMPANY HAS THE PLA N. THEY COULD TURN AROUND AND SAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT AN YMORE. BEEN YOU CA N BUY INTO OBAMACARE, THEY OBAMA-BIDEN PLAN, THAT RELATE S TO HAVING THIS PUBLIC OPTION. I D O NOT WA NT TO KILL YOU, WHAT DOES IT COS T? A LOT OF MO NEY, $ 750 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. BUT IT DOES N'T COS T $30 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS, A ND IT LEAV ES YOU WITH THE OPTION OF K EEPING WHAT YOU HAD IF YOU WANTED IT OR BUYING IN A FEW , BU YI NG IN I F YOU DON'T W ANT IT. EVERYBODY I N MY STATE, LIKE YOURS, IF I AM NOT MISTAKE N, U NLESS , [ INAUDIBLE] UNLESS YOU ALL , I KNOW HE IS A REP UBLICAN , HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT? I LAY O UT IN DETAIL HOW I WOULD PAY FOR THE PLAN AND EVERYTH ING ELSE I CALL FOR, AND WE OUGH T TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU THESE C HARTS. THESE ARE THE TAX INCREAS ES FOR THE VERY, VERY WEALTH Y, BE CAUSE WE NOW HAVE $1 TRI LLION, $ 800 BILLION, $9 00 BILLION DEF ICITS NOW. THEY TAKE C ARE OF 1% OF TH E A MERICAN PEOPLE. I T AKE CAPITAL GAI NS AND TREAT T HEM AS ORDINARY IN COME. NOTHING WRO NG WITH THAT. IF YO U ARE IN , A ND I WOULD RAISE THE TAX BRA CKET UP TO 39.6% FOR T HE WEALTHI EST. IF YOU ARE IN THAT TAX BRACKET, YO U PAY 39.6% O N TH E CAPITAL GAINS INSTE AD OF 20%. THAT ALONE WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION. TH AT ONE TH ING. I WOULD RAI SE THE CORPORATE TAX RATES - - I COME FROM THE CORPORATE S TATE OF AM ERICA. MORE CORPOR ATIONS ARE INCORPORATED IN MY STATE THAN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT IS NOT A JOKE. IT IS GIGANTIC. GUESS WHAT? BARACK AND I THOUGHT THESE CORPORATE TAX RATES S HOUL D BE L OWERED FRO M 38% TO 28%, BUT NOT 20%. IF YOU TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28%, WHI CH IS A RATIONAL POSITION, THAT RAISES ABOUT $720 BILLION. I AM NOT GO ING TO GO THROU GH IT ALL. AND ENDING THE FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION TAX BREAK, THAT RAISES ABOUT $25 BILLION RIG HT OFF T HE BAT. I PAY FOR E VERYTH ING I CALL FOR. EVERYTHING I CALL FOR. I STILL WIL L REDUCE THE DEFICIT IN THE PROCESS. BE CAUSE YOU DO NOT NEED ALL THIS MONEY TO PA Y FOR THE THINGS I CALL FOR IN HEAL TH CARE, EDUCA TION, ETC. THERE IS A LOT MO RE TO SAY, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY. IF YOU HAVE , F OR EXAMPLE , WH EN GALE INTRODUCED ME , LET M E SAY IT ANOTHER WAY. HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM, IF YOU DON' T WANT TO ANSWER YOUR HAVE TO, OBVIOUSLY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHT ER, H USBAND, WIFE, MOTHER, WERE FATHER TO CANCER REACT GO , MOTHE R OR FATHER T O CANCER? THAT IS WHA T HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE COVERAGE. AND IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE TO GE T THE COVERAGE, HOW MANY HA VE , I WON'T GO THROUGH IT. ANYWAY, THE RE IS A LOT WE CAN AFFORD TO DO, AND HERE IS THE BIGGEST DEAL. I ADMIRE TH E INTENTION OF MY FRIENDS WHO FOUGHT FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL, BU T THE MINIMUM NUM BER IS $ 30 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS, M OST PEOPLE THINK IT IS $40 T RILLION, B UT THAT IS $3.5 TRILLION A YEAR. THAT IS MOR E MONEY THAN WE SPEND ON EVERY SI NGLE THING THE GOVERNMENT DOES. YOU C OULD W IPE OUT THE PEN TAGON, SATELLITES IN THE SKY, EVERYTHING. YOU CAN WIPE OUT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIO N, THE ENTIRETY OF THE CIVI L SERVICE, WIPE IT ALL OUT. IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO $3.5 TRI LLION A YEAR. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN RU NNING AGAINST DONALD TRUM P, WE HAVE TO HAVE TRU TH IN LENDING HERE. THE WORST T HING YOU CAN DO RUNN ING AGAINST HIM IS ASSERT SOMETHING T HAT IS NOT ACCURAT E OR SO PREPOSTE ROUS TO GET DONE TH AT HE IS ABLE TO HAVE A FIELD DAY . DON'T UNDERESTIMA TE. DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE THIS GUY. D ON'T UNDER ESTIMA TE HIM. HE BRA GS AB OUT AN ECONOMY THAT IS GRO WING, AND IT IS GROWING. EXCEPT IF Y OU ARE IN THE BOTTOM 96% OF THE COUNTRY. [A PPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: BUT LOOK, THE S TOCK MARKET IS AS HIGH AS IT HAS E VER BEEN. UNEMPLOYMENT IS INCREDIB LY LOW. IT IS REAL. IT HAS GROW N. BUT THERE I S NO RATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROWTH IN T ERMS OF IN CREASES IN INCOME AND OTHER THING S. I WILL ANSW ER QUES TIONS S HORTER NOW IF YOU ASK ME LESS COCKADED QUESTIONS - - LESS COMPLI CATED QUESTIONS. [LAUGHTER] >> WHAT ARE YO U LOO KING FOR IN QUAL ITIES FOR A RUNNING MATE? MR. B IDEN: ARE YOU AVA ILABLE, SIR? [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: THE ONLY TH ING I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IS THE VICE PRESIDENCY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BE EN WRITTEN ABO UT BY A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PR ESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS OF LATE, TH EY ARGUE THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A VICE PRES IDENT OR PRESIDENT CLOSER THAN BRARARACK A ND I. I GOT TO KN OW HIM. WHEN HE MOV ED HIS FAMILY TO WASHINGTON AFTER SOME TIME, I SET HIM UP WITH MY SON HUNTER AND HIS FAMILY, AND THEY TA LKED AND BECAME FRIENDS. THE SHELL B ECAME FRIENDS WITH MY DAU GHTER-IN-LAW. OUR GRANDDA UGHTERS, MY GRANDD A UGH TERS AN D HIS DAUGHTE RS ARE BEST FRIEND S. MAYBE, WHO IS AT PENN, AND HIS DAUGHTER WH O PICKED MICHIGAN OVARY ALE - - , OVER YALE, THEY HAVE B EEN BEST FRIENDS SINCE GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WENT TO GRA DE SCHOOL TOGETHER IN A SMALL SCHOO L OF WASHINGT ON. THEY BECAME VERY CLOSE. BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN ACCIDENTALL Y. IT HAPPENED BE CAUSE WE AGREED AT THE FRONT-E ND THAT WE WOULD BE CO MPLETELY HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WHEN THE PRESIDE NT IS ASKED BY HIS FRIEND FROM CHICAGO, WH AT IS IT LIKE HAVING JOE AROUND, HE SAYS IT IS LIKE HAVING AN O LDER BROTHER. WHAT WE AGR EED ON, WHEN HE FIRST ASKED ME TO BE VICE PRESID ENT, I SAY THIS BECAUS E IT IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE N OW, IS THA T I SAID I DID NOT W ANT TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD HELP HIM MO RE BEING A SENIOR SE NA TOR THAT HAD SOME IN FLUENCE IN CONGRESS. I KNOW VICE PRESIDENTS ARE USUALLY STANDBY EQUIPMENT. THAT IS USU ALLY ALL YOU ARE . I ASKED HIM , HE CAME BACK AND SA ID TO MEE T WITH MY FAMILY A BOUT IT, A ND HE CAME BACK. TO MY SURPR ISE , M Y DECEASED SON AND MY SON HUNTER STRONGLY ARGUED I SH OULD DO IT, AND THE COUP DE GRACE WA S D ELIVERED BY MY MOTHE R, WHO WAS THEN 92 YEARS OLD. SHE WO ULD N OT MOVE IN TO THE HOUSE W ITH US, BECAUSE WE WERE IN A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDPA. THERE IS A LITTLE GARAGE THAT WE TUR NED INTO A NICE APARTMENT AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVEWAY, AND SHE SAI D THAT WAS OK. BUT AFTER W E HAD THIS ME ETING ON THE BACK PORCH, HE S AID GET BACK TO ME IN 48 HOURS, OK, ABOUT W HETHER I COULD BE VETTED A ND CHECK M E OUT, WITH 10 LAWYERS LOOKING AT ME, AS SOME ONE VERY TACTFULLY SAID, LIKE A PUBLIC CO LO NOSCOPY. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: SO W HAT HAP PENED WAS, WE WENT THROUGH THIS MEETIN G FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR, AND M Y MOM, YOU KN OW , I W ON THE GEN E POOL. I HAD A MOM THAT EVERYONE WI SHED COULD BE THEIR MOM. MY MOM HEAR D E VERYONE'S CONFESSIONAL ALL THE TIM E, LET US OUT, YOU HA D TO BE IN BY 12, AND IF MY M OM WAS IN CONFESSI ON WITH ONE OF MY F RIENDS, SHE WOULD GO LIKE THIS - - DON'T STOP, KEEP MOVING . SHE SAID JO DIE COMER REMEMBER WHEN I CALL ED YOU A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ASK ED YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOUS E, AND ASKED A BOUT BARAC K, AND HE SAID HE WAS A MAN OF GR EAT INTEGRITY AND BRILLIA NT? I SAID YEAH . SHE SAID, R EMEM BER WH EN YOU WERE A KID AND T HEY DESEGREGATED THE ADJACENT NE IGHBORHOOD AND SOLD A HOLM , A REAL ESTATE GUY SOLD A HOME TO AN AFRICAN- AMERICAN COUPLE, AND PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING AT NIGHT, I T WAS IN THE SUMMER, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE, YOU WENT DO WN AND GO T ARR ESTED BY POLICE W ERE STANDING ON THE PORCH WITH THE BLACK COUPL E? I SAID YEAH , I REM EMBER THAT. REMEM BER WH EN YOU HAD A C OUNT RY C LUB JOB, BUT WA NTED TO WORK AT THE CITY POOL AND BE THE ONLY WHITE EMPLO YEE IN THE PROJECT S? YEAH, MOM. MEMBER WHEN YOU HAD THA T GOOD JOB AT A LA W FIRM AND YOU BECAME A PUBLIC DE FENDER BE CAUSE THE CITY WAS OCCUPIE D? THE FIRST A FRICAN-AME RICAN MAN IN HISTORY WHO HAS THE CHA NCE TO BE PRESI DENT OFFERED YOU TO WORK FOR HIM AND YOU TOLD HIM NO? [LA UGHTER] MR. BIDEN: DAMM IT ALL, MOM. T RUE STORY. BEST DECISI ON MY MOTHER EVER MADE F OR ME. WE SIT DOWN AND DI SCUSS WHO TO PICK , THERE ARE SO MANY QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO B E PRESIDENT. NO MATTER I F YOU ARE 36 YEARS OLD, YOU SHOULD PICK SOMEONE WHO , IF GOD FOR BID SOMETHING HAPPENS, THEY CAN ST EP IN AND BECOME PRES IDENT. THERE ARE A NUMBE R OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VER Y QUALIFIED, BUT HERE IS THE COUP DE GRACE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. WITH BARACK AND I, WE K NEW WE WERE INTELLECTUA LLY SIMPATICO O N THE ISSU ES. WE DID NOT DISAGRE E FUNDAMENTALLY ON ANY ISSUE, FOR REAL. WE DISAGREED O N TACTIC, NOT SUBSTANCE, AND WE WOUL D ARGUE LIKE HELL W ITH O NE ANOTHER PRIVATELY. I HAVE MADE I T CLE AR, E VERYBODY KNEW, HE IS PRESIDENT, HE DECIDES. BUT HE WANT ED S OMEBODY WHO HAD A DIFFERING VIEW, WHO WOULD COMMAND, IN HIS PHRASE, ""NO T BE INTIMIDA TED WHEN THEY WALKED IN T HE OVER OFFICE ."" IT HAS TO B E S OMEONE WHO SHARES, IF I AM ELECTE D, MY VALUE SET AND MY PRIORITI ES. OTHERWISE I T MAKES IT VERY HAR D, BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL. T HE DAYS OF PIC KING SOMEONE TO BALANCE THE TICKET ARE THE DAY S THAT A RE BA SICALLY GONE BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBIL ITY OF A PRESIDENT IS SO IMMEN SE, NO ONE WOMAN OR MA N CAN HANDLE THE JOB. THEY H AVE TO DELEGATE SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBIL ITY. NOT A JOKE. THE P RESIDE NT D ID THAT WITH ME, WHETHER IT WAS DEALING WIT H IRAQ O R WOR KING ON THE RECOVERY ACT, WHICH WAS $900 BILLION. WH EN HE GAV E ME AN ASSIGNMENT, HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORITY. I COULD HIR E AND FI RE, P ICK PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CABINET , DO EXACTLY AS IF I WER E THE PRESIDENT. FOR REAL. I T TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE FOR A PRESI DENT, HE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT O R SHE HAS TO BE CONFIDENT E NOUGH THAT THEY CAN GIVE SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY AND NOT HAVE TH E PRESS SAY, SO AND SO I S DOING IT FOR HIM. BUT TH EY NEVER QUEST ION WHETHER HE WAS BRIL LIA NT, THEY NEVER QUESTION WH ETHER OR NOT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DELEGATE AU THORITY. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY, IF I GET TO BE THE NOMINEE, WHO IS SOME BODY SIMPATICO, COMFORTABLE WITH ME, WILL ARGUE AT ME AND HOLLER AT ME WHEN I D ISAGREE, AND WE AGRE ED WE WOULD MEET FOR LUNCH ONCE A WEEK, AND E VERY SINGLE DAY, WHEN WE WER E IN SESSION AND BOTH IN THE COUNTRY, WE MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE MORN ING, EVERY SINGL E DAY. IT IS THAT OLD EXPRESS ION, YOU DON'T M ISS ANYTHING BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LID. THERE ARE A LOT OF PE OPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, NOT A JOKE, OF SEVEN WOMEN , OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. NOT A JOKE. WHO ARE CAP ABLE OF BEING PRESIDENT TOMORROW IF THEY STARTED OFF AS VICE PRESID ENT. I HAVE A COUPLE IN YOUR STATE THAT ARE NOT BAD, NU MBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, MALE AND FE MALE. AS YOU KNOW , I HAV E OVERWHELMING SUPPORT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF AFRICAN- AMERICANS WHO, IN FACT, WITH THE PE OPLE BEING CONSIDERED BY ME AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BECOMES THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A G REA T CADRE OF PEOPLE TO PICK FROM, AND W E HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD YOUNG PEOPL E WHO ARE OUT THERE. AND IT IS N OT A BAD T RAINING GROUND, BEING VICE PRESID ENT. SO THAT IS AS HONEST AS I CAN BE WITH YOU. I 'M GOING TO GO TO YES NO. [LA UGHT ER] >> THANK YOU, MR. NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNIT ED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE A C OMMON AND VERY GOOD FRIEND IN GREG. HE IS A VER Y DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. HE SA YS TO SAY HELLO. THANK YOU F OR COMING. THOSE CHILD REN UNDER 15, THEY ARE OUR GRANDCH ILDREN AND CHILDREN. MR. BIDEN: THEY ARE YOURS? OH. >> AND WE ARE CELEBRATING OUR 46TH WE DDIN G ANNIVERSARY TODAY, MY WIFE AND MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] AND HER NAM E IS JILL. TH ANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BRI NGING HOPE BACK T O THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE QUESTIO N I HAVE , LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PRESID ENT , [APPLAUSE] THE LEAST O F US WHO Y OU HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR IS W HAT BRINGS PEOP LE GREAT HOPE IN OUR HEARTS. SPE AK A MIN UTE ABOUT THE N ATIVE AMERICANS AND HOW DEEPLY THEY NEED OUR HELP. MR. BIDEN: BY T HE WAY, FIRST OF ALL, MY SYMPATHIES. [LAUGHTER] MR. BIDEN: THAT IS WHAT EVE RYBODY SAYS TO JILL. THAT IS WHA T I A M KNOWN AS IN WASHINGTON, JILL HUSBAND, AND I AM PR OUD OF IT. YOU HAV E TO BE REALLY PATI ENT WITH GRANDPOPS. WE ARE DIFF ICULT TO RAISE. F IRST OF AL L, THEY A RE INDIAN NATIONS. OTHER THAN AFRICA N-AMERICANS, WHO WERE BROUGH T OVER HERE IN CHAINS ON T HE BOTT OM OF SLAVES SHIPS, MANY OF WHO M DIED B EFORE THEY GOT HE RE , THAT IS THE ORIG INAL SIN OF THIS COUNTRY, THE STAIN ON OUR SOUL , WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER T HE YEARS T O NATIVE AMERICANS HAS BEEN EQ UALLY AS CONSEQUENTIAL. I LEARNED E AR LY ON FROM A F ELLOW WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF M INE AND A WONDERFUL SENATOR WHO SUPPORT ED ME WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND HELPED RAISE ME A LITTLE BI T WAS SENATOR DAN IN NO WAY , A ND THEN SP ARKY MATSANAGA. THEY WERE G IANT SUPPORTERS OF INDIAN N ATI ONS, AND ANY TIME SOMEONE WOU LD SAY, INDIANS, NATIVE AMER ICANS - - NO, JOE, INDIAN NATI ONS. WHAT HAS HA PPENED TO THEM HAS BEEN DE VASTATING OVER THE YEARS. WHAT IS HAP PENIN G IN SOME STATES WHERE WE AR E, AND THAT IS MAY BE UP IN YOUR STATE A LIT TLE BIT AND IN MY STATE, I N DELAWARE, COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE B EEN MADE HAVE B EEN W ALKED AWAY FROM, A LOT OF THEM. WHEN I WROT E THE VIOLENCE AG AINST WOMEN ACT, WHAT I DID WAS CHANGE THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SAME PROCED URES THAT ARE AV AILABLE TO WOMEN IN INDIAN NATI ONS WHO ARE VICTIMIZED A LOT, BY T HE WAY, WH ERE IF A MAN WALKE D ON AND ENGAGED IN A FORCED SEX WITH AN OTHER MAN , WHICH HAPPENS ABO UT 4% OF THE TIME , T HEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRIED IN INDIAN COURT. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORI TY TO TRY AND THEIR COURTS, ON THEIR LAND, IF IT IS ON THE LAND OF AN INDIAN NATION. WE HAVE TO FINALLY BEGIN TO MA KE GOOD ON WHAT WE SAID WE BELIEVED , THAT IN FAC T IT WAS A COMMITMEN T MADE, IF WE MOVE DO AWAY AND DID ALL THESE T HINGS LIKE JACKSON DID YEARS AGO, THAT WE WOULD BE GIN TO TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT. I 'M NOT TAL KING ABOUT REPAR ATIONS, I AM TALKING ABOUT DEALI NG WITH WHAT CONTINUES TO BE BASIC ALLY SYSTEMIC RA CISM THAT EXISTS FOR NOT ONL Y THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT ALSO FO R INDIAN AMERICANS. THANK YOU. YES MA 'AM? >> D O WE HAVE TIM E FOR ON E MORE QUESTION? >>MR. BIDEN: ASK ME ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, MAN . IT IS THE N UMBER ONE ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] >> [INAUDIBLE] MR. BIDEN: WE A RE ALL DEAD. >> WE ARE ALL DEAD. [INAUDIBLE] WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? MR. BIDEN: BY T HE WAY, YOU CAN TELL HE REALLY CARES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, BEC AUSE I MENTION IT WHEN I S TART OFF, AND HE DOES NOT ASK A Q UESTION, HE HOLDS UP A SIGN. WHA T IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT THAT EXISTS . THERE ARE T HREE THINGS RIGHT OFF T HE BAT THAT I WOULD DO. THE FIR ST THING I WOU LD DO WAS IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACC ORD. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: AND BY THE WAY, I HELPED WITH THAT TOGETH ER. I AM THE GU Y WHO CONVINCED OUR TEAM TH AT CHINA WOULD JOIN BECAUSE I SPENT MORE TIME WITH X I JINPING THA N ANYONE HAD AND HE WAS EMBA RRASSED AT HAVING TO BE PART OF IT. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD TAK E THE MOST EG REGI OUS , THE DEAL W HEN WE DI D THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, EVERY NATIO N THAT SIGNED UP WOULD IN FA CT MOV ED TO DE AL WITH CLIMATE CHA NGE AS S CIENCE DICTATED IT. THEY AL L SE T STA NDARDS, WE SET STANDARDS A CROSS THE BOARD, AND IN THE MEANTIME, W E LEARNED THINGS WERE EVEN M ORE DANGEROUS. I WOULD CALL IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS A MEETING W IT H ALL TH E MAJOR POLLUTERS IN THE WORL D, IMAGERS, TO UP THE COMMITM ENTS. THOSE WHO D ID NOT, THEY WOULD FIND THEMSE LVES IN A POSITION WHERE THE R EST OF THE WORLD WOULD EXACT ECONOMIC PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO DO THAT. LOOK AT WHA T THE CHINESE ARE DOING NOW. THEIR BELT AND ROAD PROPOSAL. THEY ARE EX PORTING MORE DIRTY COAL AROUND THE WORLD IN THE NAME OF THE IR OWN INTERES TS, BUT NOT DOING IT IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. THEY WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT UN DER THE E CONOMIC , RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE , ONE OF THE REASONS IT WORRIES ME SO MUCH ABO UT THE PRESIDENT WALKING AWA Y FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REST ON CIV ILITI ES , RESPONSIBIL ITIES, THE LARGEST CAR BON SINK IN THE WORLD IS THE AMAZ ON, IN THE WORLD. I AM ONE OF THE GUYS WH O CAME ALONG WITH THE PR OPOSAL YEARS FOREST PRES ERVATION. IN CASE YOU AR E MY BONA FIDES, YOU CAN CHECK POLITICAL A CT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CLIMA TE CHANGE BILL AND IT WAS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER AND I PUSHE D ON IT. WHEN WE DID THE REPUBLIC , THE RECOVER Y ACT OF $990 BILLION, WE PUT $100 BILLION IN BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF PRO DUCING SOLAR AND WIND, W ITH NO RATIONALE. THE POINT I S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, MORE CA RBON FROM THE AI R, THE THING BREAKING TH ROUGH AND CAUSING GLOBAL WARM ING, IS ABSORBED IN THE AMAZ ON THAN IS EMI TTED BY EVERY SINGL E VEHI CLE DRI VEN OF ANY TYPE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS BURNI NG. I HAVE BEEN PUSHIN G, NOT ALONE, BUT I HAVE BEEN PUSHING ALO NG WITH JOHN K ERRY, A BIG SUPPORTER AND FRIEND OF MINE, PUSHI NG THAT WE MIS SING TO BRAZIL - - WE HAVE BEE N SAYING TO BRAZIL, WE HAVE GOT TO FIX IT AND WE WILL HEL P YOU, PAY YO U TO STOP IT. NO T TO BILLION DOLLARS. MORE LIKE $ 40 MI LLION , BILLION . THERE HAS T O BE CONSEQUENCES. MAYBE YOU A ND I CAN TALK ALONE, BUT TELL ME WHEN I'M GOING T O MUCH. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO IS RIGHT OF F THE BAT IMMEDIATELY , IN 2021, JANUA RY, WH EN I SAY JOIN AND REJOIN THE PARIS ACCOR D, I INTRODUCED THE PROPOSAL, W E GET TO ZERO MISSIONS BY 2050. SOME PEOPLE HAVE 2049 AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 2030. VIRTUALLY I MPOSSIBLE TO GET THERE. YOUR FOREST IS STILL GOING TO FIND INS ECT S AND EVERGREENS THE SUMMER. YOUR WINTER S WILL GET WARMER. 85% OF THE PROBLEM IS OVER THERE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT REQUIRES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW T O BRING TOGETHER THE WORLD. TO B E ABLE TO HAVE A FOREIGN-POL ICY VISION THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN ARE TRUSTED SO ON DAY ONE, THE NE XT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE T O BE ABLE TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE WORL D STAGE. THE WORLD W ILL KNOW WHO THAT PE RSON IS A ND NO THAT PERSON THOSE WHO T HEY ARE, W HAT T HEIR WEAKNESSES ARE. WHAT THEY ARE LIKE. W E CAN DO I T BUT WE H AVE TO GET BACK IN THE BUSINESS. WHEN WE SAY THER E IS NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHA NGE, AND WE ALRE ADY DEFORESTATION OUR LAND OVER T HE LAST 300 YEARS AND HAVE DONE W ELL BY IT, AND THE RES T OF THE WORLD SAYS YOU KEEP IT UP, COME ON. IT WILL NOT HA PPEN. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BRI NG THE WORLD TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE HARD. REALLY HARD. THE THIRD T HING WE HAVE TO DO IS SE T D OWN GUIDE RAILS NOW. BETWEE N THE YEARS 2 021 AND 2030, I T IS IRREVERSIBLE THE PATH WE HAV E SET US ON. HOLDING THE M RELIAB LE FO R WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, PARTICULARL Y IN UNDERSER VED NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WHEN TH EY DO NOT, PUT THEM IN JAIL. I AM NOT JO KING ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] MR.VIOCE PR ES. BIDEN : , V ICE PRES. BIDEN : THE CITY WOULD BE AB LE TO BORROW MONEY AND GET DIRECTE D TO REPLACE ALL THE WINDOWS . AND DOORS A ND INSTANTLY , INSULATION SO YOU ARE NOT EMI TTIN G FROM THE BUILDIN G HE AT OR AIR CONDITI ONING, COSTING MUCH MORE M ONEY. IF WE TOOK EVERY PUBLIC AND FEDERAL BUI LDING IN THE COUNTRY , WHICH THEY STARTED OFF DOING BEFORE THEY TENTED, WE COULD , TH IS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL TO B E C ONSUMED EVERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER ENERG Y CONSUMING IT.

[APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN I SAID THE SOUL OF THE NATION, THI NK ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT OUR S OUL WHEN YOU SEND YO UR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD OFF IN FIRST OR SE COND OR THIRD OR FO URTH GRADE, AND THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. BUILDING NE W SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND THEM THE GE NERATION THAT IS MOS T UNEASY AND HAS THE GREATES T ANXIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA IS THE Z GE NERATION, AGES 7-17. DO NO TE THE GREATEST FEAR IS? GE TTING SHO T IN SCH OOL. TALK ABOUT A SICK SOUL. I AM THE ON LY GUY WHO HAS EVER BEATEN THE NRA NATIONA LLY. I HAVE BEATEN THEM TWICE. I GO T THE B RADY BILL PASSED . I AM THE GU Y WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN PASSED. BECAUSE OF SOME HAN GING CHADS IN FLORIDA, AB LE , A GUY NAMED BUSH LET IT EXPIRE. YOUR STATE AND MINE, A LOT OF HUNTERS, THAT IS FINE. AN YBODY WHO NEEDS A MAGAZINE WITH 100 ROUNDS IN I T, YOU SHO ULD NOT BE HUNT ING. YOU ARE A DANGER TO YOURSELF . NOT A JOKE. NOT I DEAL W EARING A KEVLAR VEST. MY DECEASED SO N AND MY SON WERE BI RD HUNTERS. YOU LOCK TH EM UP. WE 'RE T HE ONLY COUNTR Y, THE ONLY INDUSTRY IN THE NATI ON NOT ABLE TO BE SUED, TH E O NLY ON E. HOW WOULD T HAT HAVE BEEN THE CASE WH EN I WAS PUSHING TO GO AFTER THE P HARMACEUTICAL COUNTRIES F OR , COMP ANIES FOR OPIOIDS? BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO SUE THEM FOR THE DAMAGE THEY WERE DOING, WE WERE ABL E TO CHANGE THE WHOLE THING AND I T IS STILL CHANGING. YOU CAN DO THAT WITH GUN MANUFACTURE RS. ONE OF MY OBJECTIV ES, I WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. DEMOCRATS V OTED TO GIVE EXEMPT IONS TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. BUT I WILL WORK LIKE HELL T O ELI MINATE THAT EXEMPT ION. LASTLY, WE TALK ABOUT TECHN OLOGY. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW. THAT T HE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN PULL IT SUGAR ON AN Y WEAPON WOULD BE ON E WHOSE BIOMETRIC MARKER MATC HED WHA T DONE , WITH THE GU N WAS SOLD TO. IT IS J AMES BOND STUFF BUT IT IS R EAL AND IT EXISTS. OUT IN SILI CON VALLEY, AND MET WITH THIS GROUP OF EXPERTS ON HOW THEY COULD DO THAT. IT CA ME ALONG AND THEY CAME UP WITH SEV ERA L PISTOLS THA T DO THAT. THEY STARTE D TO SOLOMON ADVERTISED THAT WAY. YOU'RE NOT VIOLATI NG A NYONE'S SE COND AMENDMENT RIGHT. IF I'M ABLE TO BUY THE GUN ON A BACKGROUN D CHECK, I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO FIRE THE GUN. BE CAUSE LOO K WHAT H APPENED UP IN CONNECTICUT. THE MOM HAD BEG UN IN THE KICK , THE KID PIC KED IT UP. HE WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK. THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT T O SAY PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE A GUN. CERTAIN GUN S, NOT EVERY GUN. SO THEY PUT THEM IN STORES AND THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURE RS SAID IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THE M, WE WILL BOYCOTT YOUR STORES AND PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS. SO THEY'RE NOT ON THE SHELVES AT ALL NOW. WHAT IS GOI NG ON? THIS IS WRONG. THER E ARE S O MANY AVENUES WE CAN GO W ITHOUT VIOLATING ANYONE'S BASIC RIGHT . TO OWN A GU N. FOR THOSE O F YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A GROUP WHO SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS THE BLOO D OF PATRIOTS, YOU NEED , IS WATERED BY THE BLOOD OF PA TRIOTS, YOU NEED A FIGHTER J ET IF YOU WILL PROTECT YOU RSELF AGAINST THE GOVERNM ENT. YOU NEED SO METH ING A LOT MORE IF THAT IS THE RATIONALE. EXTREME PEO PLE ARGUE THAT THE REASON WHY THE SECOND AMENDMENT E XISTS IS S O WE CAN DEFEND OURS ELVES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. YOU NEED A COUPLE OF FLAMETHR OWERS. ALL KIDDING ASIDE. THESE PEOPL E TELL ME YOU CANNOT LIMIT THE T YPE OF WEAPONS. CAN ANYONE HERE , LIKE THEY D ID WI TH A FORM ER DUPONT GUY, WELL, YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THE GOVERNMENT, YOU BETTER GET A PERSO NNEL C ARRIER OR SOMETHIN G. YOU WILL NOT DO IT WITH AR-15. WE HAVE BEE N A BLE T O SAY YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE G UN AND THAT IS THE LAW. YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE GUN OR BAZOOKA. I KNOW IT S OUNDS SILLY BUT T HE IDE A THAT YOU CANNOT SAY THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF WE APONS YOU CANNOT OWN IS NOT AT ALL INCO NSI STENT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. FROM THE BE GINNI NG, FROM THE BEGINNING, EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT O F THE CONS TIT UTIO N HAS AN EXCEPTION. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IF ANYONE N EW TO YELL FIRE, WE CO ULD PUT YOU IN JAIL WITH PEOPLE RUNNING OUT OF FEAR OF PEOPLE GETTING HURT AND TH ERE IS NO FIRE. YOU DON'T H AVE THE FR EEDOM OF SPEECH TO YELL FIRE. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM IF YOU ARE A CONVICTED FELON OR TERRORIS T TO GO BUY A WEAPON. ONE REASON WHY, AND TH IS IS THE BEST WAY TO CONC LUDE IT , I TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENC E AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I WROTE THA T, I DID IT MYSELF. IT TOOK QUI TE YEARS TO GET IT PASSED. IT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IM PACT ON C HANGING THE CULTURE OF AMERICA. EVERY SEVER AL YEARS IT HAS TO B E REAUTHORIZED. THE HOUSE P ASSED OVERWHELMIN GLY, SITTING IN THE SENATE. IT CUTS OUT WHAT THEY CALL T HE BOYFRIEND EXCEPTION. THE BIGGEST FIGHT I HAD TO GE T IT AUTHORIZED THE SECOND TIME WAS TH AT IF YOU WERE THE SU BJECT OF ABUSE BY A HUSBAND OR SOMEONE YOU LIVE WITH, AND THAT PERSON WAS CONVICT ED, THEY COULD NOT OWN A GUN, A WEAPON. WHAT HAPPEN ED WAS THEY WO RKED OUT AN EXEMPTIO N, THE BOYFRIE ND EXEMPTION. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHILD WITH A PERSON BE ATING YOU UP, OR YOU DO NOT LIVE WITH HIM, T HAT P ERSON CAN OWN A W EAPON. THE VAST MA JORITY OF WOMEN KI LLED BY T HEIR AB USE RS ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. THE UN IT KN OW W HAT THE GREATEST LOSS OF LIFE IS WITH A G UN? SUICIDE. OV ER 20% OF ALL PEOPLE WHO DIE BECAUSE OF A BULLET OU R PEOPLE COMMITTING SUICIDE. AND WE SAY WE W ILL NOT ALLOW THE POLICE TO KNOW WHE THE R OR NOT SOMEONE HAS A SERIO US MENTAL ILLNESS THA T MAY BE SHOU LD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A WEAPON? IT IS NOT A N EASY PROBLE M BEC AUSE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLE D TO THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY BUT THAT IS WHY WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ALONG THE VIOLENC E AGAINST WOMEN ACT TO BE PASSE D A ND REAUTHORIZED AND WE WILL LOSE ENORMOUS PROTECTIONS IF CUT DOWN BY WEL L OVER 60% OV ER TH E AGE OF 30. THE REPORTS ARE WAY UP. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME FOR WARD. THE NRA AND GUN MANUFAC TURE RS ARE MUCH TOO PO WERFU L AN D THEY DO NOT REPR ESENT A RATIONAL READING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I HAVE TAUG HT CONS TITUTIONAL LAW FOR 22 YEARS. I PROMISE Y OU. THEY DON'T. THANK YOU F OR BEING HERE. I APPRECIAT E IT.

CSPANJB41202038	Joe Biden	2020-01-04	Joe Biden Campaigns in Vinton, Iowa	"GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT, OR THIS AFTERNOON I SHOULD SAY, TO HEAR FROM ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IT IS SO GREAT TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF IOWA, WHERE OTHER STATES WHO ARE , WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ACTIVE, TO SEE OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SEE OUR CANDIDATES, DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY FORTUNATE THAT WE GET TO SEE OUR CANDIDATES UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THEY ARE SO VERY CRITICAL FOR THE NOMINATING PROCESS. BEFORE I GET STARTED, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A COUPLE , ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. IVY SCHUSTER. SHE IS RUNNING FOR STATE SENATE IN OUR DISTRICT , [APPLAUSE] RUBY BALL DACA WHO IS RUNNING FOR OUR HOUSE EAT IS NOT HERE THIS AFTERNOON. SHE HAD A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION HER. PLEASE WELCOME THEM AND GET TO KNOW THEM SO THAT YOU CAN DO A GOOD AND EDUCATED VOTE NEXT NOVEMBER FOR OUR STATEHOUSE. ONE OF THE THINGS , I WOULD NOT BE COUNTY CHAIR IF I DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET OUT AND DO CAUCUS ON FEBRUARY 3. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU SUPPORT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT YOU GET OUT ON FEBRUARY 3 AND HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD. THIS IS GRASSROOTS POLITICS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW OUR COUNTRY IS LEADING. SO PLEASE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR CAUCUSES ARE, SUPPORT WHO YOU , WHOEVER YOU WANT TO SUPPORT. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ISSUES ARE KNOWN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE PLATFORM PROCESS. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART FOR THE PROCESS THAT YOU CAN BE A PART OF. ALSO, IT DOESN'T JUST END ON FEBRUARY 3. THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE, IN THE LOCAL PARTY, TO STAY INVOLVED. AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT WE NEED. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE INVOLVED. THIS IS A PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE, WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CITIZEN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LEGISLATORS, OUR PRESIDENT, OUR CONGRESSPEOPLE DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO, AND DO WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS UP TO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FEBRUARY 3, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT UNTIL NOVEMBER AND GO OUT TO NOVEMBER AND VOTE AND FORGET ABOUT IT AGAIN. THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO EVERY DAY. ON THAT TONE ALSO, TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE HEARING. THERE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS FAKE NEWS. WE NO LONGER CAN JUST SIT BACK AND TAKE THE FIRST THING WE SEE OR HEAR AS GOSPEL. IT TAKES US TO DO THE WORK, TO FIND OUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT IS THE TRUTH. IN THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE. IT IS JUST UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PRESENT SYSTEM IS WE HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR IT. I IMPLORE ALL OF YOU TO PAY ATTENTION, TO FIND CREDIBLE SOURCES, LISTEN TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE, AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WRITERS BEFORE YOU START THINKING THAT YOU HAVE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. AND ON THAT NOTE, I HAVE THE VERY PLEASANT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO INTRODUCE OUR CONGRESSWOMAN IN THE FIRST DISTRICT, CONGRESSMAN , CONGRESSWOMAN ABBY FINKEL HOW ARE, WHO IN 2018 WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TWO WOMEN TO SERVE AND CONGRESS FOR IOWA. THIS IS WHERE THE FAKE NEWS THING COMES IN. IF YOU HAVE LIST , HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO RADIO OR TV, THEY ARE COMING AFTER ABBY. DON'T KID YOURSELF. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN SAYING IS SHE IS PART OF THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE. BUT IT IS OUT THERE. MORE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED THIS LAST YEAR. BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION. AND IT IS SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK IN THE SENATE. BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE ANY DEMOCRAT ANY WIN. HE IS WILLING TO HIJACK OUR COUNTRY FOR POLITICS. ABBY IS OUT THERE DOING HER WORK. SHE IS WORKING VERY HARD IN REPRESENTING US. AND WE HAVE TO GET HER REELECTED. I ASKED YOU TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN AND DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP HER GET REELECTED. I ALSO HAVE THE HONOR TODAY OF INTRODUCING FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. GO AHEAD. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE KNOWN JOE BIDEN AND HIS WIFE, JILL, FOR MANY YEARS NOW. WE HAVE CRISSCROSSED OVER A LOT OF POLITICAL EVENTS OVER THE YEARS. HE HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF GETTING GOOD, POSITIVE LEGISLATION PASSED IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT, WHICH IS SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK BECAUSE THE HOUSE PASSED IT BY THE SENATE WILL NOT TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND OUR OWN SENATOR TONY ERNST IS LEADING THE PATH INTO BLOCKING THAT LEGISLATION. JOE BIDEN , YEAH. JOE BIDEN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THAT PAST ALONG WITH MANY OTHER THINGS. HE WAS ALSO A GREAT PARTNER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND WILL AGAIN BE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL HAVE THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP QUALITIES THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE AND TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS THAT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT. ABBY FINKENAUER SO PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN ADVISED , SO PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN ABBY FINKENAUER AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) OH MY GOODNESS. WOW. OH MY GOSH. WELL, HELLO, VINTON. YES, YOU CAN HEAR ME. AWESOME. WHAT A CROWD. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. IT IS SO DANG COLD OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BRAVING THIS BEAUTIFUL IOWA WHETHER. , WEATHER. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO SAY HELLO TO HER NEXT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH ROSEMARY, FOR ALL THAT YOU DO, AND EVERYBODY HERE IN VINTON WHO HAS WORKED THEIR TAILS OFF THESE LAST TWO YEARS AND BEYOND, MAKING SURE THAT WE FLIPPED THIS CONGRESSIONAL SEAT AND WE TOOK BACK THAT U.S. HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU AND I AM SO, SO GRATEFUL EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GET TO REPRESENT WAS CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN CONGRESS. I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING AND SOMEBODY I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT A LOT THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN ON THE BUS NOW FOR TWO DAYS, ANOTHER DAY TO GO TOMORROW. BUT WE STARTED IN DUBUQUE. MY HOMETOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN DUBUQUE COUNTY. MY PARENTS WERE THERE AND THERE WAS NOTABLY SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT THAT I WISH COULD HAVE BEEN. UNFORTUNATELY, HE PASSED AWAY MANY YEARS AGO BUT HE IS SOMEBODY I THINK ABOUT OFTEN AND THAT IS MY LATE GRANDFATHER WHO WAS A FIREFIGHTER IN DUBUQUE. YOU SEE, HE IS THE GUY THAT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I WOULD SIT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH HIM WHEN I WAS 10 AFTER CHURCH ON SATURDAY NIGHTS AND IT WOULD BE MY GRANDFATHER WHO WAS THE FIREFIGHTER AND THE DEMOCRAT, MY UNCLE WHO WAS A DEMOCRAT AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, ANOTHER UNCLE WHO WAS A REPUBLICAN AND A LAWYER, AND ME. AND WE WOULD BE HAVING I MEAN SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THAT KITCHEN TABLE AFTER DINNER. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, THOSE NIGHTS LEFT A VERY IMPORTANT IMPRESSION ON MY LIFE. AND I LEARNED TWO VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS. ONE WAS EVEN THOUGH I WAS A YOUNG GIRL, I HAD EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITH GROWN MEN. [APPLAUSE] SECOND, AND VERY IMPORTANT, WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD DISAGREE, AND AGAIN, WE SURE WOULD, WE COULD HUG EACH OTHER AT THE END OF THE NIGHT SAY, I LOVE YOU AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. I JUST REMEMBER THINKING THAT THAT IS HOW POLICY SHOULD BE. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS STUCK WITH ME AGAIN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AGAIN, MY GRANDFATHER, HE IS THE GUY TOO THAT I TOOK A LOT OF ADVICE FROM. WHEN ONE DAY IN 2007 I WAS SERVING AS SPEAKERS PAGE IN THE IOWA HOUSE, I WAS 18, YOU GUYS ARE MEMBER 2007. WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES WE THOUGHT THEN, BUT NOW LOOK AT NOW. THERE WERE A LOT OF FOLKS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY WERE COMING THROUGH THE CAPITAL. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, YOU GUYS KNOW THIS, BACK INTO THOUSAND SEVEN, IF YOUR LAST NAME WAS NOT OBAMA OR CLINTON, IT WAS LIKE, YOU DIDN'T KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT WAS RUNNING ALL THE TIME. ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY GRANDFATHER CALLS ME ONE DAY AND HE GOES ABBY, THERE IS THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE THAT IS COMING TO THE CAPITAL, AND YOU HAVE GOT TO MEET HIM YOU HAVE GOT TO TALK TO HIM. HE GETS IT, HE UNDERSTANDS OUR FAMILY, HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE WE COME FROM, HE GETS IT. I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE BUT IF POPPA TELLS ME, I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SENATOR. FROM DELAWARE. . I WILL NEVER FORGET SITTING IN THAT IOWA HOUSE CAUCUS ROOM THAT DAY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO JOE BIDEN WAS WALKING IN. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I SURE AS HECK WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WALKED OUT. HE WAS THE GUY THAT DOES UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE COME FROM. HE'S THE GUY WHO STICKS TO HIS VALUES, WHO CARES ABOUT PEOPLE, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY HAS NEVER CHANGED. AND SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO SINCE THAT DAY. AND IT IS WHY I BELIEVE SO MANY OF YOU RIGHT NOW IN VINTON SHOWED UP TODAY TO HEAR HIM. BECAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THE SAME THING THAT I KNOW ABOUT HIM, IS HE ALSO BELIEVES AND HOPE. THAT WAS THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT WE USED TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT ACT IN 2008. IT IS ALSO WHAT WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT AND 2018. AND HE GETS IT. HE UNDERSTANDS IT IS ABOUT HOPE AND THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULDN'T JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE. AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS ABOUT HOPE IN THE IDEA THAT GOD, YOU GET SICK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. AND HOPE AND THE IDEA, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW, WHERE YOU CAN WORK HARD ON YOUR FAMILY FARM, PASS IT ONTO THE NEXT GENERATION WITHOUT WAKING UP EVERY SINGLE MORNING WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FUTURE BECAUSE OF A TRADE WAR THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT DECIDES TO START ON THEIR. , START ON TWITTER. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE STUFF THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN UNDERSTANDS. ANOTHER THING HE UNDERSTANDS AND IS ESPECIALLY WHY I DECIDED TO COME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO AND ENDORSE HIM FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE I JUST SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND WASHINGTON WHERE I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, WE WORK ACROSS THE AISLE A LOT, ESPECIALLY ON MY COMMITTEES. I SIT ON SMALL BUSINESS, WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON A MULTITUDE OF THE BILLS. MY DAY IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN SOMETIMES YOU SEE ON TV AT NIGHT. THERE ARE ALSO TIMES WHERE I SWEAR, IT IS LIKE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE SPEAKING DIFFERENT LINKAGES. AND THERE IS NOBODY AT THE TOP WITH LEADERSHIP WHO IS WILLING TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FLAWS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO BELIEVES THERE IS MORE VALUE IN SOWING FEAR AND DIVISION AND OUR COUNTRY THEN BRINGING US TOGETHER. AND WE HAVE HEARD IT SAID BEFORE. THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL SAY, I'M SURE YOU WILL HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT THIS, THAT PEOPLE THINK HE IS NAIVE FOR BELIEVING WE CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY. THAT WE CAN UNITE DEMOCRATS AND WE CAN UNITE CONGRESS. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AFTER THE LAST YEAR THERE, IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY, HOW TO UNITE CONGRESS, HOW TO UNITE AS A PARTY, I AM VERY, VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY, AND HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BELIEVED IN IT FROM DAY ONE, ALWAYS HAS AND IT IS WHY WE DESPERATELY NEED HIM IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] ONE OTHER THING, I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO MY GRANDPA ONE MORE TIME. HE'S THAT GUY WHO TAUGHT ME ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE IS ALL ABOUT. BEING A FIREFIGHTER, I THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE MEANS. IT'S TRUE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WOULD GET A PHONE CALL TO RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING, HE DIDN'T CALL BACK AND ASK, WHAT COLOR IS YOUR SKIN? HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? WHO DO YOU LOVE? WHAT RELIGION ARE YOU? HE JUST SHOWED UP AND HE HELPED PEOPLE AND HE DID HIS JOB. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO EVERY SINGLE DAY AS YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN. THAT IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR U.S. SENATE. AND IT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TODAY TO COMMIT TO CAUCUS FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE WE NEED THAT EXACT EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, IT GIVES ME A GREAT HONOR AS THE WORKING-CLASS KID FROM CHERYL, IOWA WHO GREW UP IN DUBUQUE COUNTY WHO IS NOW YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN TO GET TO ENDORSE AND INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE WORKING-CLASS KID FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELL, FOLKS, THE FOLKS IN MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MONTANA AND LOUISIANA, THEY OWE YOU. YOU SENT US A FIRST CONGRESSWOMAN. YOU REALLY DID. [APPLAUSE] YOU REALLY HAVE. I HAVE A GREAT HONOR AND , IN THE 2018 ELECTION CYCLE TO GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN IN THE FOUR STATES FOR OVER ALMOST, I KEEP FORGETTING THE NUMBER, 65 TO 69, CANDIDATES. WE WON BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE WON 41 SEATS WITH LEADERS LIKE ABBY FINKENAUER. WE ELECTED A GROUP OF REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. FOLKS, IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS. BECAUSE IT HAS GIVEN EVERYBODY SOME HOPE AND IT HAS ALSO STEMMED THE TIDE OF SOME OF THE REALLY DANGEROUS THINGS WERE HAPPENING. BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS GETTING ABBY REELECTED THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE OWE YOU, AS I SAID, WE OWE YOU AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR ELECTING ABBY. HAVING ABBY AND CINDY AS THE FIRST TWO CONGRESSWOMEN IN THE STATE, PRETTY COOL THING. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WE ARE AT A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY WHERE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS, TRUMP SUPPORTERS, INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS, THAT WE ARE REALLY AT ONE OF THOSE INFLECTION POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AN AWFUL LOT IS AT STAKE. AN AWFUL LOT IS AT STAKE. EMOTIONS RUN PRETTY HIGH. THEY RUN PRETTY HIGH ON BOTH SIDES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN'T LET HAPPEN IS WE CAN'T GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE JUST HOLLERING OUT ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. THE FACT IS, WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE OUR POLITICS HAS BECOME PRETTY UGLY OVER THE LAST 6, 8 YEARS. WHERE WE JUDGE PEOPLE BY WHAT WE THINK THEIR MOTIVE IS RATHER THAN THE JUDGMENT. I LEARNED EARLY ON FROM A GUY NAMED MIKE MANSFIELD WHO WAS A LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR MONTANA, WHEN I WAS CRITICIZING SOMEBODY WHO HAD SOME , HAD SAID SOMETHING AWFUL ON THE SENATE FLOOR, HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID JOE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION ANOTHER MAN OR WOMAN'S JUDGMENT, BUT NOT THEIR MOTIVE. ONCE YOU QUESTION THEIR MOTIVE, YOU CAN'T GET TO AN AGREEMENT. IF I SAY YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF OR YOU ARE A CHEAT OR THIS OR THAT AND SAY BY THE WAY, LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE FARMING PROBLEM, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE SPIRIT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE OR DON'T AGREE ON A SUBSTANCE, BUT WALK AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF JUST ATTACKING THE OTHER PERSON AND ATTACKING THEIR MOTIVE, SAYING THEY ARE BAD FOLKS. WE HAVE A COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WHERE I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT, AS ABBY POINTED OUT, THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT BOND WE ALL HAVE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY BACK EAST AND I PARTICULARLY PICKED PHILADELPHIA WHICH WAS ACROSS THE LINE FROM WHERE I LIVE IN DELAWARE, I TALKED ABOUT HOW WE USED TO, WE STARTED OFF AS A UNIQUE IDEA. WE ARE THE UNIQUE IDEA IN HISTORY. WE, THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. NO COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON A PRINCIPAL LIKE THAT. OR A DECLARATION, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. THAT'S THE PRESIDENT, HE ALWAYS FORGETS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] ALL KIDDING ASIDE, WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE PRINCIPLES. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT BEFORE. THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN COMPLETELY INCLUSIVE, WE LEFT A LOT OF BROWN AND BLACK FOLKS OUT OF THAT EQUATION. BUT THE FOLKS, THE POINT IS, WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY BEFORE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED OF LATE IS WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE WITH THEIR VEINS, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW IN TELEVISION, THEIR VEINS BULGING, SINGING THE SAME CHANT THAT WAS SUNG IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE CLAN SAYING THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM, AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. WHAT HAPPENED? THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON WHAT HAPPENED. AND HE SAID ""THERE WERE VERY, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES."" NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A , HAS SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT, INCLUDING ANDREW JACKSON WHO WAS BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR. PRETTY TOUGH STUFF. THE DIVISION IN THE NATION BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, ETHNICITY, WHETHER YOU ARE FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY, HAS NEVER BEEN WHERE IT HAS BEEN BEFORE. WE HAVE TO BRING IT BACK. WE ARE A NATION THAT IS BASED ON A PRINCIPAL. PRINCIPLES. IDEAS. ONE OF THE THINGS ABBY AND I , I CAMPAIGNED FOR ABBY WHEN SHE RAN AND WON LAST TIME. . SHE IS WINNING BY 20% AND SHE WON IN SPITE OF MY SHOWING UP. [LAUGHTER] ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT , LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, OUR BACKGROUNDS ARE SIMILAR. SHE USED TO EAT AT HER GRANDDAD'S TABLE ON SATURDAY. NO EXCEPTION, I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ABOUT THIS, TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD HAVE AFTER 10:30 MASS, EVERYBODY WOULD GO BACK TO MY GRANDPA'S KITCHEN TABLE, AND HE HAD FOUR SONS AND A DAUGHTER, AND A MAIDEN AUNT WHO LIVED WITH HIM, MY GRANDMA'S SISTER. THE WOMEN WOULD COME BACK AND BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, WOMEN HAD TEA AT THE LACE TABLECLOTH ON THE GUYS WOULD ARGUE POLITICS AND SPORTS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. AND IF YOU ARE A BOY OR GIRL, ONLY WHEN YOU GOT AROUND 15 YEARS OLD, YOU COULD WANDER AROUND THE TABLE, YOU DIDN'T GET TO SIT DOWN. I REMEMBER MY GRANDPA TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR GUY WHO HAD , WHO WAS A LOCAL POLITICAL BOSS, IN EFFECT, WHO WAS , WHO HAD GOTTEN IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE GAVE HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW OR SOMEBODY A JOB. I CAN'T REMEMBER. I REMEMBER MY GRANDPA SAYING TO ME, THE ONE THING , I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD DEFEND THIS PARTICULAR GUY. HE SAID I DEFEND HIM, I DON'T AGREE WITH THEM AT ALL, BUT I THINK WHENEVER HE SAYS HE DOES, HE SAID HE IS FOR YOU, YOU CAN BE SURE HE IS FOR YOU. YOU KNEW WHERE HE STOOD. YOU TALK ABOUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE STAND ON WHAT THEIR VALUES ARE AND WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO. TODAY WE CALL IT AUTHENTICITY. THE THING I LIKE ABOUT, WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT AT MY TABLE AS WELL AS WHAT ABBY WAS TAUGHT IS AUTHENTICITY MATTERS. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME AUTHENTICITY. IF YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN AND YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY AND YOU DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO TRY, AND DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO GET IT DONE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW. WE DO HAVE TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. THE FACT IS THE VALUES THAT I'VE OBSERVED AND I'VE BEEN TO IOWA GOING BACK TO CAMPAIGNING FOR JOHN CULVER BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S AS A YOUNG KID IN THE SENATE. I WAS A YOUNG KID IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME. [LAUGHTER] IOWA VALUES ARE BASICALLY AMERICAN VALUES. ESPECIALLY, IN THE REASON I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN THE RURAL COUNTIES, I HAVE BEEN NOW 240 SOME , TO FORTY SOME. IT IS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER. IT IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR WORD. ABOUT WHAT YOU TEACH YOUR KIDS. THAT THEY CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE IF THEY WORK AND PLAY BY THE RULES AND DO IT WELL. TELLING YOUR KIDS THAT NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND, NO MATTER WHETHER THEY COME FROM A POSITION OF INFLUENCE OR JUST ORDINARY FOLKS LIKE US, THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IF YOU WORK HARD AT IT. THAT NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU. BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. THAT IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH DECENCY. I WILL BET YOU NOT A ONE OF YOU TONIGHT, RIDING HOME ON ONE OF THE ROADS IN THIS COUNTY, AND SOMEONE WITH A FLAT TIRE, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STOP TO HELP. WE ARE LOSING THAT. WE ARE LOSING THAT SENSE AROUND THE COUNTRY THESE DAYS. WHERE WE ARE ISOLATED MORE AND MORE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME AND TRYING TO REVIVE WHAT I THINK TO BE THE THING THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND MY CAREER OVERSEAS IN THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND VICE PRESIDENT DOING NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. OVERSEAS, THEY THINK , THEY ARE KIND OF NAIVE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE DEALS WITH, FOREIGN COUNTRIES ABOUT FAIRNESS, DECENCY. THE WORD I HEARD MORE OFTEN AT MY DADS TABLE WAS THE WORD DIGNITY. EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY, NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND OR WHERE THEY ARE FROM. THINK HOW THAT IS SLIPPING AWAY IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC ISSUE, IT GOES TO WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO REESTABLISH, IN MY VIEW. TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD. THE FACT IS, THE STORIES OF ABBY'S FAMILY AND MY FAMILY ARE NOT VERY DIFFERENT. AND YOUR FAMILIES. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA. ORDINARY AMERICANS BUILT AMERICA. AND I MIGHT ADD , [APPLAUSE] SO WHERE ARE WE NOW? WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET BACK , I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE FRIENDS, THE CHAIRWOMAN AND I WERE SPEAKING ABOUT A FRIEND OF HERS WHO IS WORKING IN ANOTHER COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. IN LIGHT OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED WITH THE BOMBING. THIS PERSON TOLD HER HE IS COMING HOME, HE CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY WHERE HE IS NOW BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED. JUST A CAUCUS, I KNOW HE WAS COMING HOME FOR SAFETY REASONS. HE'S COMING HOME TO CAUCUS, HE MUST REALLY BE SERIOUS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SOLA MONEYS BEING KILLED. THERE SHOULD BE NO BEING FOR THIS GUY. I KNEW OF HIM, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MY CAREER DEALING WITH THE CODES FORCE AND HE HEADED THAT FORCE, THE ASSASSINS ANOTHER'S IN IRAN. THE HOPE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT AT LEAST HAS A PLAN, HAS A PLAN THAT HE HAS THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ITERATION OF THIS ARE GOING TO BE. THAT HE HAD GOTTEN SERIOUS ADVICE FROM HIS MILITARY, WHICH I DON'T KNOW YET, WHETHER OR NOT HE IS PREPARED FOR WHAT IS LIKELY TO COME, AND IT IS GOING TO, IN TERMS OF PROTECTING AMERICAN FORCES, AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS, AMERICAN PEOPLE AND EMBASSIES, ETC., AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE THUS FAR, HE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED HE PAYS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO HIS ADVISORS. MOST OF THE REALLY GOOD ADVISORS, AND I'M NOT JOKING, HAVE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE NEED TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO, ON DAY ONE, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO , INHERIT TWO THINGS. A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY, AS WELL AS A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING ON DAY ONE. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND ON JANUARY 21 AFTER BEING SWORN IN IN 2021 AND BE ABLE TO COMMAND THE RESPECT OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHERE THEY LOOK OUT ON EVERYONE FROM THE IRANIANS TO XI JINPING IN CHINA, TO THAT FELLA WHO CALLS HIMSELF A PRESIDENT BUT IS BECOMING SOMEWHAT OF A DICTATOR IN RUSSIA. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON TALKING TO THEM, MAN OR WOMAN, KNOWS WHO THEY ARE AND THEY KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS. AND THEY KNOW, THEY KNOW THAT THE WORD OF THE PRESIDENT WILL BE KEPT, OUR FRIENDS WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW, THAT WE ARE WITH THEM AND OUR ENEMIES WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THEIR MOTIVES AND WE ARE PREPARED. BUT FOLKS, I'M NOT AT ALL SURE WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT MORE AS WE GO ON, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED RELATIVE TO IRAN. BUT THERE IS A LOT WE HAVE TO LEARN BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO WEEKS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY RATIONALE FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED, OTHER THAN JUST DECIDING TO TAKE HIM OUT LIKE I SAID, NOT A GOOD GUY. BUT WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL AND WE BETTER BE PREPARED, I HOPE WE ARE PREPARED, TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND AROUND THE WORLD AND HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH RATHER THAN PUT US IN REAL JEOPARDY. THE LAST THING WE NEED NOW IS ANOTHER WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NOT 6 MILLION PEOPLE OR 8 MILLION BUT 40 MILLION PEOPLE. A SOPHISTICATED COUNTRY. IT BETTER BE WORTH WHAT IN FACT HE DID, NOT AT ALL SURE THAT IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW. LOOK, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO HERE IN IOWA, THAT THEY DON'T DO , BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE ALL FIGURED OUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ENVIES YOU AND IS CRAZY ABOUT YOU ALL. BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FIRST CAUCUS AND THEY ARE NOT ANY HAPPY ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH HAS THE FIRST PRIMARY. BECAUSE THEY SAY WE DO NOT REPRESENT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT AS DIVERSE AS THE REST OF MANY OTHER STATES. SO ON AND SO FORTH. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I TELL THEM. I TELL THEM AS I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT THE ONE THING ABOUT YOU ALL IS YOU TAKE YOUR JOB REALLY SERIOUSLY. YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT THINKS ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT I WANT FOR MY STATE, WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DETERMINING WHO GETS TO GO THROUGH THE NEXT GATE. WHO GETS TO POSSIBLY BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE YOU ELIMINATE PEOPLE IN THIS PROCESS. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED BY THE WHOLE COUNTRY. YOU THINK BEYOND YOURSELVES. YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME FOR YEARS , FOUR YEARS OF DAMAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUSED DOMESTICALLY AND IN FOREIGN POLICY. YOU FACT IS, AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THIS EFFORT, YOU WILL DETERMINE WHO GETS TO BE THE PERSON WHO MAY BE THE ONE FACING THIS PRESIDENT. YOU LOOK AT NOT ONLY WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THEM ON AN ISSUE, BUT YOU LOOK AT THAT PERSON AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF BEATING DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THIS ELECTION MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUCUS YOU EVER PARTICIPATED IN. NOT BECAUSE I AM RUNNING OR ANY OTHER PARTICULAR DEMOCRAT, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE. WE CAN HANDLE WITH THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE GOODWILL OF NEIGHBORS, WE CAN HANDLE FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP AND TURN IT AROUND. BUT EIGHT YEARS? EIGHT YEARS CAN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. I THINK OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYONE IN THE COUNTRY. THE QUESTION IS, WHO IS BEST QUALIFIED AND MORE LIKELY TO BE TO THIS PRESIDENT. SECONDLY, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE THE PRESIDENT. WHO IS GOING TO BE MOST HELPFUL IN HELPING US WIN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE? [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF, IN A GENERAL ELECTION, WHO IS BEST TO HAVE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET TO BE ABLE TO WIN IN IOWA? IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT SEEMS TO BE THE NEXT THING PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT, NOT ONLY WHO IS LIKELY TO HELP US WIN THE SENATE AND WIN THE PRESIDENCY, BUT BEYOND THAT, WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO DO THE THINGS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO DO? MAKE HEALTH CARE A RIGHT AT A NAIL IT DOWN SO IT IS ABLE TO BE DONE AND YOU ARE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE YOUR TAXES GET A THROUGH THE CEILING AND MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE PAY MORE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PAID FOR ADDITIONAL INSURANCE IF THEY HAD TO PAY FOR IT. WHO IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, INVESTING IN OUR CHILDREN IS GOING TO GET THAT DONE? WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO PRESERVE THIS PLANET? WHO WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT? IT TAKES LEGISLATION. THE QUESTION IS, IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT EACH OF OUR BACKGROUNDS AND RECORDS. WHO HAVE DONE BIG THINGS? HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE IN THE CONGRESS? HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO GET MAJOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION PASSED? WHO WILL, IF ELECTED, BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC AND THE CONGRESS TO PASS THE LEGISLATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT? THE THIRD THING IS IMPORTANT, YOU TALK ABOUT IT AND IOWA A LOT. WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY? [APPLAUSE] THE FACT IS, WE CANNOT GOVERN THIS COUNTRY, CANNOT SUSTAIN DEMOCRACY, WITHOUT ARRIVING AT A CONSENSUS. WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT IS SEPARATED POWERS, THE SENATE, HOUSE, COURT, AT A PRESIDENT. WHEN YOU CANNOT ARRIVE AT A CONSENSUS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ABUSE THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION. YOU ACT IN A WAY THAT IS BEYOND YOUR SCOPE, BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE LEGALITY OF A PRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO PULL IT TOGETHER. THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE SEEKING THE NOMINATION POINT OUT, THAT IS TRUE, JOE BIDEN PASSED BIG THINGS, HE PUT TOGETHER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, THE RECOVERY ACT, 900 BILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT WASTE OR FRAUD, JOE BIDEN DID ALL THESE THINGS, BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND THIS DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PARTY. I DO NOT THINK ANYBODY HAS MORE REASON TO BE UPSET WITH THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN I DO. THEY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LYING ABOUT ME. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING AFTER MY SURVIVING SON. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE I AM NOT THE NOMINEE. HAVE YOU SEEN A SITTING PRESIDENT MORE INTERESTED IN CHOOSING WHO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL BE THAT THIS PRESIDENT? I LEARNED THREE THINGS. ONE, VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. SERIOUS. THAT IS WHY FACEBOOK TOOK DOWN THOSE SPOTS AND PHONY AT THE RUSSIANS PUT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IS WHY THEY TOOK THEM DOWN. SECOND, KIM JONG-UN, WHO EXCHANGES LOVE LETTERS WITH DONALD TRUMP, HIS NEWS AGENCY SAID , THIS IS THREE WEEKS OLD , JOE BIDEN IS A RABID DOG AND HE SHOULD BE BEATEN TO DEATH WITH A STICK. [LAUGHTER] THE OTHER THING, I LEARNED DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. HIS FOLKS ARE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY , THEY TELL ME $50 MILLION IN A NEGATIVE AD, ADS THAT ARE SO NEGATIVE, EVEN A MAINSTREAM PRESS WILL NOT PRINT THEM. SOME REAL, MOST BOLD. THEY ARE , SOME WILL, MOST WON'T. THEY ARE FLAT FLIES. I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY FIGHT, BUT BE ABLE TO SEAL. THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT, TO SEAL, NOT JUST FIGHT. BRING US TOGETHER. WE CAN DO THAT. WHEN THEY TELL ME I CANNOT DO THE THINGS I WAS ABLE TO DO BEFORE AS A SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT AND SAY THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, IT WAS TO BE YEARS AGO. , IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, THERE WAS A TEARS ACT, $9 BILLION TO DEAL WITH RESEARCH AND CANCER RESEARCH. AFTER THE PRESIDENT , THIS PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED AND BEFORE HE WAS SWORN IN, I PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND THEY SAID WE WILL NOT PASS ANYTHING ELSE WAS THE ELECTION IS OVER. THERE WERE ONLY 110 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO WERE SUPPORTING THIS ACT AND 30 OR 40 FOLKS IN THE SENATE. GUESS WHAT? TWO WEEKS BEFORE , 10 DAYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT GOT SWORN IN, I GOT A VOTE ON THE ACT, IT GOT OVER 390 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE TO VOTE FOR IT AND ALMOST EVERY SENATOR. IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN HEALTH CARE. BUT MY POINT IS THIS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO WORK ON. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. WITH DONALD TRUMP GONE, YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO WILL BE LIBERATED. I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. RIGHT NOW, THEY KNOW THAT IF HE IS THE PRESIDENT, HE HAS ENOUGH POWER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH IS 30 SOMETHING PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC, THEY CAN BEAT YOU IN A PRIMARY. THAT DOES NOT SAY THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A PROFILE IN COURAGE, BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS NOT HAPPENING. THINGS CAN CHANGE. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO PERSUADE AS WELL. NOT JUST SAY WHAT WE ARE FOR, BUT PERSUADE PEOPLE. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD ARE READY FOR SOMETHING TO CHANGE. THEY KNOW WE CANNOT SUSTAIN OURSELVES THIS WAY. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE THREE THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. ONE, WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE SINGLE MOST FOCUSED ISSUE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IS CLIMATE THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TURNED GREAT PROBLEMS INTO OPPORTUNITIES. I PUT TOGETHER A PLAN, WHICH I WILL NOT DETAIL, YOU CAN TALK MORE ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT PRIVATELY, HERE IS THE DEAL. WE SHOULD BECOME THE LEADER OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO ABSORB THAT CARBON MARKET THAT CARBON OUT OF THE AIR, DEAL WITH TECHNOLOGY , IT IS GOING TO START IN RURAL AMERICA. RAILAMERICA HAS THE CAPACITY TO , RURAL AMERICA HAS THE CAPACITY. PAY FARMERS TO ABSORB CARBON FROM THE AIR. MAKE SURE WE MOVE AND NOT GO WITH OLD COMPANIES AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR COMMITMENT ON THE ISSUE OF IGO FUELS , BIOFUELS. TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. THE FIRST AND I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, I WILL REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH I HELPED PUT TOGETHER. I WILL CALL ALMOST 200 NATIONS, I WILL CALL THEM TO THE UNITED STATES TO SIT DOWN AND UP THE ANTE. THE DEAL WE MADE WAS NOT ONLY MEET THE STANDARDS SET BY SCIENCE WHEN IT WAS FORMED, BUT THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED BECAUSE THE DANGER IS WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. GET EVERYBODY TO SIGN UP TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP THEIR COMMITMENT. IF THEY DON'T, THEY WILL PAY AN ECONOMIC PRICE. SO YOU CANNOT , CHINA CANNOT CONTINUE TO SAY WE WILL NOT INAMED, BUT HERE IS WHETHER THEY ARE DOING, THEIR BELT AND WROTE PROPOSAL, THEY ARE EXPORTING. GOAL AROUND THE WORLD THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE MAKE UP 50% OF THE PROBLEM AND THE UNITED STATES. , 15%. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 85%. IF WE DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE BIT OF AMBITIONS, WHICH IS NOT RATIONAL, BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT, THE RIVERS WILL STILL FLOOD, FARMS. FLOOD, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF WITH WARMER WINTERS AND WARMER SUMMERS. YOU WILL SEE DROUGHTS, A LOT OF THINGS, BECAUSE THE 85% OF THE ANIMATORS ARE AROUND THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT REQUIRES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION, BUT HAS HAPPENED. WHEN I WAS A KID, I NUMBER THE IOWA TEST. [LAUGHTER] YOU WHERE THE STANDARD FOR THE COUNTRY. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. YOU NO LONGER ARE. YOU ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE STANDARD. LOOK WHAT WE HAVE DONE. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. WHEN SOMEONE WOULD SAY, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I VALUE, HE WOULD SAY, DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU VALUE, SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET, I WILL TELL YOU YOUR VALUE. ALL THESE FOLKS SAY THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. THEY CUT BUDGETS. WE HAVE TO PUT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA NO MATTER THEIR ZIP CODE OR BACKGROUND IN A POSITION TO MAKE A LIVING IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE CAN DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] ALL THE DATA SHOWS THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES, IF A CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL, NOT DATE HERE , NOT DAYCARE, IT INCREASES BY 48% OF THE PROSPECT THEY WILL GO THROUGH 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL AND GRADUATE AND GET A DEGREE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. THAT IS THE DATA. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES. INDOOR STATE, HOW MANY , ANYBODY TEACH IN HERE? TEACHERS? OK. HOW MANY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS YOU HAVE AROUND TO HELP KIDS THROUGH PROBLEMS? WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST , THERE ARE TWO STUDIES. ONE SAYS ONE FOR EVERY 1400 KIDS AND ONE SAYS FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500 OR ONE TO 700. THE STUDIES SHOW , WE TALK ABOUT OPIOID ABUSE. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DRUG ABUSE CAUSING MENTAL PROBLEMS. MENTAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE DRUG ABUSE. WHEN YOU IDENTIFY EARLY KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING, YOU CAN INTERVENE AND DO A LOT OF THINGS, NOT PUNISHED, BUT HELP. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING IN RURAL AMERICA IN REGARD TO HOSPITALS. 60% OF TRAUMA DEATHS OCCUR IN 20% OF THE POPULATION. WHY? IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU NEED HELP. GUESS WHAT? RURAL HOSPITALS, BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATIZATION OF MEDICARE , WHAT IS HAPPENING? HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING. HOW CAN THAT BE? HOW CAN WE ALLOW THAT? THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR POWER TO DO AND STILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT BY GETTING RID OF RIDICULOUS TAX CUTS. AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY. [APPLAUSE] LASTLY, HEALTH CARE. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW I WILL DO IT. OBAMA AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME GETTING OBAMACARE PASSED. IT WAS NOT ALL WE WANTED, BUT IT CHANGED THE LIVES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. EVERY EVENT I GO THROUGH , GO TO, I THINK YOUR CONGRESSMAN WILL TELL YOU, PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. NOT ME , OBAMACARE SAVED MY LIFE. IT DID NOT GET IT ALL DONE, BUT THERE IS AN EASY WAY TO FIX THIS. WE WANT TO ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, A MEDICARE-LIKE PROPOSAL. WHAT I AM GOING TO DO, AND I WILL GET IT PASSED, PEOPLE ARE GOOD FOLKS, BUT MEDICARE FOR ALL COSTS $40 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS TO DO MEDICARE FOR ALL. OUR ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET IS $3 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT IS MORE THAN WE SPEND ON EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES IN ANY FORM, FROM THE MILITARY TO EDUCATION DOWN THE LINE. FOR EIGHT TO ACRE, IT WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. BERNIE ACKNOWLEDGES , THAT IS THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO REINSTATE IT BECAUSE IN OBAMACARE, YOU CAN BUY A GOLD PLANET SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN $1000 DEDUCTIBLE AND PROVIDE A MEDICARE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BUY INTO THAT OPTION IF THEY WISH TO . IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED. IT CAN BE DONE NOW. IT COSTS $750 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. WE CAN PAY FOR IT. THERE ARE EASY WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL MAKE SURE , NOW REPUBLICANS WILL VOTE FOR WHAT I ABOUT TO SAY. RAISE THE TAX RATE BACK UP TO THE HIGHEST RATE OF 39.5 PERCENT. THAT RAISES HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MAKING SURE , I HAVE A THINK I WILL NOT BORE YOU WITH. I HAVE A CHART YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND GET. THE THINGS I WILL DO. CAPITAL GAINS SHOULD BE TAXED AT WHAT YOUR REGULAR INCOME IS. WE SHOULD REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. IF WE DID THAT, YOU WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT ONE THING. IF YOU MADE SURE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE WENT UP TO 28%, YOU WOULD RAISE ANOTHER $730 BILLION. WHO AMONG REPUBLICANS IS OPPOSED TO THAT? WHEN YOU SAY, AMAZON PAYS ZERO TAX. THEY MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE NOT ASKING PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I GO DOWN THE LIST. WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED, REFORMING THE TAX CODE SO MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE AT WORKING PEOPLE HAVE A WAY UP. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN MAKE SURE EVERYBODY , EAR THE BIG DEAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY LIKE THE HEALTH CARE PLAN THEY NEGOTIATED WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP JUST TO GET THEM, PARTICULARLY THOSE NEGOTIATED BY UNION MEMBERS. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU GO THE OTHER BOOT, YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT UP, THERE CAN BE NO PRIVATE INSURANCE. I THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN WASHINGTON WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU. IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR COMPANY SAYS THEY WILL NOT DO INSURANCE, YOU HAVE THE MEDICARE OPTION AND THE JOE BIDEN CLAN. YOU CAN BUY INSURANCE THAT IS CHEAPER OR IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT, GET IT FOR FREE. EVERYBODY IS FOR THE OTHER PLAN, THEY SAY IT WILL TAKE BETWEEN FOUR YEARS TO GET A PATH AND MAYBE 10 YEARS TO GET IT DONE, A NEW STRUCTURE , COME ON. I HAVE BEEN A GREAT CONSUMER OF HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY. MY SON LAY DYING FOR 19 MONTHS WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM IRAQ. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF MY OWN DIGNITY IF I SAID TO ME BEFORE OBAMACARE, THEY COULD HAVE SAID, YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF COVERAGE, SUFFER IN PEACE FOR FIVE MONTHS. OR IF YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, OR A HUSBAND OR WIFE, YOU CANNOT GET COVERED. TALK ABOUT BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR DIGNITY. HOW DID YOU DO THAT? HOW CAN WE DO THAT? THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS , IT IS ABOUT NOW, NOT TOMORROW. IT IS ABOUT NOW. PEOPLE NEED HOPE. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE IN 1972, I WAS NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN YET, I HAD TO WAIT 17 DAYS TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR REAL. I WAS A WASHINGTON, D.C., HIRING STAFF, A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE WOMAN THEY PUT ON THE PHONE, SHE WAS SO NERVOUS, SHE SAID TO HAVE TO COME HOME, THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCIDENT. YOUR FAMILY WAS SHOPPING AT A TRACTOR-TRAILER BROADSIDED THEM. POOR KID, SHE SAID, YOUR WIFE IS DEAD, YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD, YOUR TWO KIDS, I'M NOT SURE THEY WILL MAKE IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WHEN I WENT HOME. LOOKING AT MY BOYS, WHO WERE ALMOST FOUR AND ALMOST FIVE. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF THEY SAID YOU CANNOT AFFORD THIS. WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DOES A PARENT DO? LOOK, THIS IS NOT ABOUT TOMORROW. IT IS ABOUT TODAY, ABOUT HOPE. GIVING PEOPLE AN OPTION. I PROMISE YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU, IF I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE THAT IS OF PORTABLE AND GOOD AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FAMILY. I GET IT. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, BY THE WAY, LET ME MAKE CLEAR, THERE HAS BEEN A BOUT YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND MORE. AND SOMETIMES YOU DID NOT HAVE THE HELP I HAD. I WAS LUCKY. MY SISTER, BROTHER, MOM, DAD HELP ME RAISE MY KIDS. THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE , I HAVE ENORMOUS REGARD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GOT UP TODAY, PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER WITH NO HELP, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS I OUTLINED AT OTHERS YOU UNDERSTAND. HOW MANY OF YOU LOST A FAMILY MEMBER TO CANCER? RAISE YOUR HAND. YOU GET IT. YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY DOES. THINK OF THE PEOPLE , THINK OF THE SINGLE MOMS. I WAS A SINGLE DATA FOR FIVE YEARS. WHEN I WAS A SENATOR, I WAS MAKING A DECENT SALARY. I COULD NOT AFFORD DAYCARE. IF I DID NOT HAVE MY MOM, MY SISTER, MY BROTHER , THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE, INCREDIBLE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO GET UP EVERY DAY AND DO IT EVERY DAY. THAT IS TO OUR. THESE PEOPLE DESERVE A SHOT. SAME KIND OF SHOT THAT YOU ALL WANT. FOLKS, IT IS ABOUT HOPE. THAT ME AND BY SAYING THIS. WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I WAS ELECTED, I WAS LABELED THIS IDEALISTIC, OPTIMISTIC, YOUNG MAN. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TO PROTECT US. BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD RESPONSE TO US. IT IS THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER ASKED NOT TO THAT, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THE RAYS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD RESPONSE TO US, WE FORM A GREAT ALLIANCES BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS WHO WE ARE. OUR EXAMPLE. TO QUOTE A REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN, WE ARE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. BUT THE LUSTER IS COMING OFF RIGHT NOW. IT IS WHO WE ARE. WE HAD MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WHEN I DID THE CANCER INITIATIVE , WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING ABLE TO CURE CANCERS. FUNDAMENTALLY, DIABETES. IF WE INVEST TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S. IF WE DO NOT, GUESS WHAT? EVERY BED IN AMERICA TODAY WILL BE FILLED WITH AN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT IN 20 YEARS AND IT WILL COST US $258 BILLION A YEAR. WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN MAKING SURE WHAT WE CAN DO AND WE CAN DO SO MUCH. EVERY MAJOR IDEA HAS COME OUT OF ONE OF THOSE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. THEY ARE NOT OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE OWNED BY YOU. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT IS A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT , IT IS OWNED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. EVERY MAJOR CHANGE HAS COME OUT OF THOSE PLACES. WE ARE BETTER STOCKED THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. WITH THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE. THIRD, WE ARE IN A SITUATION , WE ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. IT IS JUST A FACT. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THAT WILL NOT LAST. IF WE DO, , WE ONLY WORLD. THE WORLD NEEDS SOMEONE LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THEY NEED A LEADER. I DO NOT MEAN PUTTING THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO DO MORE. BUT LEADING THE WORLD IN TERMS OF BEING THE ONE WHO MOVES THE WORLD FORWARD ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. IF WE DO NOT, SOMEONE WILL FILL THAT VACUUM. LAST THING I WILL SAY IS , LOOK. MY COLLEGE IN THE SENATE , BRILLIANT GUY. JOHN AND OTHERS USED TO KID ME. THEY WOULD QUOTE A SENTENCE IN THE SENATE FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S GOING TO BE MOVING SPEECH. THERE IS ONE SENTENCE I WOULD QUOTE ALL THE TIME. MY COLLEAGUES GOT TIRED OF HEARING ME DO IT. IT IS ONE THAT HARDLY GETS QUOTED AND MET THE MOST TO ME. HE ANSWERED A QUESTION WHICH WAS NOT ASKED. IT WAS IMPLICIT. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? HE SAID, WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE AS AMERICANS REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. I REFUSED TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY, IT IS TIME WE REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE SET OUR MIND TO DO WE HAVE BEEN ON ABLE TO DO. IT IS TIME TO GET UP, TAKE IT BACK, LEADING THE WORLD AGAIN AND GIVE OUR CHILDREN A DIFFERENT LOOK. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) I AM HAPPY THAT YOU ARE RUNNING. THIS IS MY FIRST ELECTION I CAN VOTE IN. I HAVE YOUR MEMOIR YOU SIGNED FOR MY GRANDMA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. THERE IS A PHOTO OF HER AND MY BROTHER WHEN THEY ARE BABIES IN 2008. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU HAVE A GOOD SISTER. WE HAVE MET. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I , MR. BIDEN: I REALLY MEAN IT. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I AM THE ONLY GUY WHO HAS BEATEN HIM TWICE. THE IDEA THAT KIDS HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER, TALK ABOUT MORAL BANKRUPTCY. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE , I WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOTHER. STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW. I APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU HAVE DONE FOR YOUR FAMILY.

WATCH OUR LIVE COVERAGE. ON MONTH FEBRUARY 3, C-SPAN'S 2020. YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. IN NEW YORK CITY STOOD, 2020, JOE BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DISCUSSED THE AIR STRIKE THAT KILLED GENERAL SOLEIMANI AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REJOINING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PLEASE WELCOME VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SIX MONTHS AGO HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, I MADE THE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT AND INCAPABLE OF WORLD LEADERSHIP AND IN THE PAST FEW DAYS IN THE WAKE OF THE KILLING OF THE IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI, DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVEN THAT BEYOND. AND THE FAILURE TO CONSULT WITH OUR ALLIES OR CONGRESS AND THE RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD SURELY FOLLOW WAS IN MY VIEW DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT. FOLKS, IN THE WAKE OF SUCH AN ENORMOUS ESCALATION THAT HAS EXPLODED TO POLITICS IN THE REGION HAS PUT THE UNITED STATES ON A COLLISION COURSE THAT WHAT WE EXPECT FROM AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHAT HAVE WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP? WE HAVE NOT HEARD AN EXPLANATION TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THIS DECISION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES WERE THOUGHT THROUGH. NO LEVEL-HEADED WORDS MEANT TO DIAL DOWN THE TENSIONS AND TAKE US OFF THE PATH OF CONFLICT. NO PRESS CONFERENCE OR CONSULTATION WITH OUR CONGRESS. NO. WHAT WE HAVE HEARD SO FAR ARE TWEETS, THREATS AND TANTRUMS. ALL WE HEARD FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION ARE SHIFTY EXPLANATIONS, EVASIVE EXPLANATIONS, AND IMMINENT THREAT WITHOUT THE NECESSARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT CONCLUSION. AND SINCE THIS IS A PRESIDENT WITH A HISTORY OF LYING ABOUT VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING, WHO HAS DESTROYED HIS OWN CREDIBILITY AND THAT OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE GLOBAL STAGE, WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOR OUR ALLIES AND INDEED, NO ONE AROUND THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE TAKING HIS WORD FOR IT. IF THERE WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT THAT REQUIRED THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTION THAT WE ARE ARE OWED AN EXPLANATION AND FACTS TO BACK IT UP. BUT THE , THESE MATTERS ARE IMPORTANT. AND TO ME, THEY ARE UNMISTAKENBLY CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO TO WAR WITH IRAN WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION. WITHOUT WORKING WITH CONGRESS. IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. IT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PART OF HIS JOB. PRESIDENTIAL NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS CANNOT BE SATISFIED IN 280 CHARACTERS OR LESS. AND NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER TAKE UNITED STATES TO WAR WITHOUT SECURING THE INFORMED CONSENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS WHICH HE HAS PLACED AMERICAN TROOPS AND OUR DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND CIVILIANS AND PERSONNEL AS WELL, AND OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES OR SHOWED A MODICUM OF GRAVITAS, I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THAT. MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT THIS OUTCOME WAS A STRATEGIC SET BACK, CHANTS OF DEATH TO AMERICA, ONCE MORE ECHOING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN AND ITS ALLIES ARE VOWING REVENGE THAT WAS AVOIDABLE. THE SEEDS OF DANGER WERE PLANTED BY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF ON MAY 8, 2018. THE DAY THE PRESIDENT TORE UP THE NUCLEAR DEAL AGAINST HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS AND TURNED HIS CLOSEST EUROPEAN ALLIES AND HE DESTROYED ANY PROGRESS MADE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND BUILD ON IT AND CREATE A SAFER WORLD. WHAT WE HAD IN THE IRAN DEAL, WE HAD VERBAL VIABILITY, CUT OFF EVERY ONE OF IRAN'S PATHWAYS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON. INSPECTORS REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED IRAN'S COMPLIANCE AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. AND ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO GLOBAL SECURITY WAS OFF THE TABLE. IRANIAN NUCLEAR POWER. AND WHEN THE IRANIAN DEAL WAS ENFORCED, WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS DANGEROUS CYCLE OF AT THIS TIME FOR AT THAT TIME RESPONSE. THERE WERE ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THEIR ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE ACTION. THE IRAN DEAL WAS NOT ONLY ACCOMPLISHING A CRITICAL MISSION THAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR, BUT CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE DIPLOMACY WAS POSSIBLE. AND TRUMP, HE WALKED AWAY, NOT IRAN, TRUMP WALKED AWAY. TRUMP MADE THE INTERNATIONAL OUTLIAR. TRUMP REIMPO POSSESSED SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS TO QUOTE EXERT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE REGIME WITH CLAIMS THAT IT WOULD DETER AGGRESSION AND SECURE A MUCH PROMISED, QUOTE, BETTER DEAL. . ON BOTH FRONTS, AS MANY ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME, HIS THREATS WERE EMPTY, BASELESS, AND NAIVE. SINCE THEN ALL THAT'S MATERIALIZED IS AN UTTERLY PREDICTABLE CYCLE OF ESCALATING CONFLICT WITH IRAN. IT WAS STATED AT THE TIME THAT OF COURSE IRAN WOULD SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRESSURE WE WERE EXERTING WAS NOT COST-FREE. THEY COULD TAKE ACTIONS TO MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US AS WELL. IRAN BEGAN AGAIN TO UNEARTH AND ENRICH URANIUM BEYOND THE LIMITS ALLOWED UNDER THE IRAN DEAL, THE NUCLEAR DEAL. IRAN ATTACKED OIL TANKERS, SHOT DOWN AN UNMANNED U.S. SURVEILLANCE DRONE. YET THE ADMINISTRATION HAD NO PLAN TO PREVENT, MITIGATE, OR APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE PROVOCATIONS. INSTEAD, TRUMP ACTED ERRATICALLY AND IMPULSIVELY, WHICH IS NOT UNEXPECT. HE ORDERED A RETALIATORY STRIKE THEN CALLED IT OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE, THEN THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED MORE SANCTIONS. SHOT DOWN AN IRANIAN DRONE, ISSUED A WARRANT TO SEIZE EWE RAIN , SEIZE AN IRANIAN OIL TANKER AND BEFORE LONG, IRAN ATTACKED SAUDI ARABIA'S FACILITY, AND IRAQ RESTARTED ROCKET ATTACKS AGAINST OUR BASES. UNTIL ONE OF THOSE ATTACKS AGAINST OUR BASES, KIRKUK, KILLED A U.S. CITIZEN AND WOUNDED OTHERS. TAFF TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE, AN ACT CONDEMNED BY ALL AMERICANS. BUT IN RESPONSE, TRUMP BOMBED FIVE SITES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, TIED TO THE MILITIA GROUP, KILLING AT LEAST 25. IRAQ PROTESTERS ORGANIZED BY IRAN-BACKED MILITIAS ASSAULTED OUR EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD AND BREACHED THE OUTER WALL OF THAT COMPOUND. NO INJURIES WERE REPORT BUD TRUMP WAS EMBARRASSED. BY THE IMAGES OF A BURNT OUT RECEPTION AREA. HE ORDERED THE DRONE STRIKES TO KILL SOLEIMANI, PERHAPS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT OFFICIAL IN IRAN NEAR THE BAGHDAD AIRPORT AS A CONSEQUENCE AND RUSHED THOUSANDS MORE TROOPS TO THE REGION TO DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT. ACTION-REACTION, PROVOCATION-RESPONSE. ALL PREDICTABLE, ALL PREDICTED. A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS HE WANTS TO CUT, END, AND DEFAULTLESS WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS BRINGING US DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO STARTING A BRAND NEW ONE. A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS HE WANTS OUT OF THE REGION SENDS AN ADDITIONAL 18,000 PLUS TRPS TO DEAL WITH A CRISIS OF OYS HIS OWN MAKING. AN ADMINISTRATION THAT CLAIMS ITS ACTIONS MADE AMERICA SAFER IN THE SAME BREATH URGES OUR CITIZENS TO LEAVE IRAQ, PUTS AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE REGION ON NOTICE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED DANGER THAT NOW EXISTS. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT IRAN, I NEVER HAVE. THE REGIME HAS LONG SPONSORED TERRORISTS WHO THREATENED OUR INTERESTS. IT CON TIN , IT CONTINUES TO DETAIN AMERICAN CITIZENS. RUTHLESSLY KILLED HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS. THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. BUT THERE'S A SMART WAY TO COUNTER THEM. 20 COUNTER IRAN. AND A SELF-DEFEATING WAY. TRUMP'S APPROACH IN MY VIEW IS DEMONSTRABLY THE LATTER. SOLEIMANI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS AN THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT LIVES THROUGHOUT THE REGION. HE WAS THE MASTERMIND BUT HE WAS NOT THE WHOLE OF THE REGIME OR ITS CAPACITY TO STRIKE BACK. SO THE QUESTION IS, WAS THE REWARD OF REMOVING A BAD ACTOR WORTH THE RISK OF WHAT COMES NEXT? WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT TRUMP OR ANYONE AROUND HIM THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT THAT CALCULUS. THE PENTAGON LONG WARNED AGAINST TAKING A SHOT LIKE THIS WAS SHOCKED THAT TRUMP WOULD TAKE SUCH A TERRIFIC, THAT'S THE REPORTS, I CAN'T VERIFY. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER IRAN WILL RETALIATE, IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL. BUT , BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR TROOPS, OUR PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT THE REGION, WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS WHO HAVE TROOPS IN HARM'S WAY, THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION, WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR THE LONG-TERM MISSION OF COUNTERING IRAN AND PREVENTING ISIS FROM BOUNCING BACK AND OUR MILITARY TO PURSUE A BROADER STRATEGIC AIM IN THE REGION, ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THE FALLOUT. IRAN HAS DECLARED IT WILL NO LONGER ABIDE BY THE CONSTRAINTS SET UP BY THE NUCLEAR DEAL, PUTTING IT BACK ON TRACK TO OBTAIN MATERIAL FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND PUSHING THE REGION CLOSER TO A NUCLEAR CRISIS. YOU KNOW, OUR FORCES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA ARE NOW FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THEMSELVES, PREPARING TO LEAD, PUTTING THE COUNTERISIS MISSION ON HOLD, ALLOWING A DEADLY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THE ROOM TO REGROUP AND REACTIVATE. THE IRAN PARLIAMENT VOTED TO EJECT ALL AMERICANS AND COALITION FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY. AND HOWEVER YOU MAY FEEL ABOUT AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THERE'S A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY TO DRAW DOWN OUR TROOPS, OUR TROOP PRESENCE. GETTING UNSER MOANS YOULY KICKED OUT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY THE WRONG WAY. AND IF WE DO END UP HAVING TO LEAVE, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER BOON FOR IRAN TIPPING THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE REGION IN THEIR FAVOR. JUST WEEKS AGO, THERE WAS SPONTANEOUS PROTEST ACROSS IRAN AGAINST THE REGIME. IT'S TAKEN THAT PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS OFF THE REGIME NOW. TRUMP'S IMPULSIVE DECISION MAY DO MORE TO STRENGTHEN IRAN'S POSITION IN THE RETHAN ANY OF SOLEIMANI'S PLOTS WOULD HAVE EVER ACCOMPLISHED. YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT WE SEE MORE OR LESS LIFE, MORE OR LESS THREATS, MORE INTEREST IN THE AREA, IT'S ALWAYS, IT'S ALWAYS AND NOW A DEBACLE. WHAT WE HAVE , AND WHAT IS POSSIBLY THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY AND PRECISELY THE MOMENT WHEN WE SHOULD BE RALLYING OUR ALLIES TO STAND BESIDE US AND HOLD THE LINE AGAINST THREATS, DONALD TRUMP'S SHORTSIGHTED, AMERICA-FIRST DOGMATISM HAS COME HOME TO ROOST. OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, OUR CLOSEST ALLIES ARE CALLING FOR RESTRAINT AND MAKING A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THAT HAPPEN COMING OUT OF NATO AND CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE QUIETLY REVELING IN THE PROSPECT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL NOW ONCE AGAIN BE BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER MAJOR CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, GIVING THEM ROOM, THEY'D LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS, THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND CARVE OUT THEIR OWN SPHERES OF INFLUENCE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES CHALLENGING THEM ON HUMAN RIGHTS. ON ABUSIVE TRADE PRACTICES. ON MEDDLING IN OTHER NATIONS' DEMOCRACIES. BECAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY IN IRAN. WE ARE ALONE NOW. WE'RE ALONE AND WE'LL HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF DONALD TRUMP'S FOLLY. AND THIS , AT THIS MOMENT, IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN WE MOST FEEL THE LACK OF FUNCTION IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY PROCESS OR DIPLOMACY, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AFTER THREE YEARS OF HOLLOWING OUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, DISRESPECTING AND DISMISSING OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, DESTROYING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CAPITOL HILL, THROWING OUT THE DELIBERATE POLICYMAKING PROCESS THAT HAS SERVED REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS FOR DECADES, CO-ROADING THE VALUES OF THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES, ABUSING OUR ALLIES, EMBRACING DICTATORS, CREATE, NOT SOLVING FOREIGN POLICY ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, WE'RE IN A MUCH WORSE POSITION TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS CRISIS THAN WE WERE WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I LEFT OFFICE. YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NO STRATEGY, IT SEEMS TO ME. HE HAS NO END GAME. HERE'S THE HARDEST TRUTH OF ALL. HIS CONSTANT MISTAKES AND POOR DECISION MAKE HAVING LEFT US, THE UNITED STATES WORK A SEVERELY LIMITED SLATE OF OPTIONS FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. AND MOST OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE NOW BAD. BUT THERE ARE SOME KEY STEPS IN ANY RESPONSIBLE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WOULD TAKE. WHILE I DON'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO LISTEN TO ME, I HOPE HE'LL LISTEN TO THOSE AROUND HIM WHO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE THREATS WE NOW FACE. HE SHOULD TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT OUR FORCES AND ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR DIPLOMATS, CIVILIANS AND OVERSEAS FACILITIES, NOT JUST IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT ANYWHERE IRAN MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRIKE. HE SHOULD ENSURE THAT AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS TO GUARD AGAINST HEIGHTENED RISK FOR SIGNER , CYBER ATTACKS. HE SHOULD STOP TWEETING SO HE DOESN'T BOX US IN WITH THESE THREATS THAT THE ONLY OPTIONS LEFT FOR IRAN ARE UNCREASINGLY DAMAGING STRIKES AND COUNTERSTRIKES. AND HE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY, I HOPE HE'S DOING THIS NOW BUT I'VE HEARD NONE OF IT, HE SHOULD BE REACHING OUT TO OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS AND OTHERS AND SEND PRIVATE SIGNALS OF DETERRENCE AND DE-ESCALATION TO IREASON AND FIND A WAY TO AVOID THE ONRUSH OF WAR AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO REJOIN THE IRAN DEAL AND BUILD ON IT. IF IRAN MOVES BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS AND RE-ESTABLISHES INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW TO CONFRONT THESE THREATS, WE WOULD BE MUCH, MUCH BETTER OFF. THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS IS THROUGH DIEMPLOYEE MAY. IS CLEAR-EYED, HARD-NOSED DIPLOMACY GROUNDED IN STRATEGY THAT'S NOT ABOUT ONE-OFF DECISIONS AND ONE UPMANS , ONE UPSMANSHIP. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR REGIONAL INTERESTS INCLUDING OUR COUNTERISIS CAMPAIGN. NO ONE WANTS WAR. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE HARD WORK TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T END UP THERE BY ACCIDENT. FINALLY, THIS ONE IS NOT OPTIONAL, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOUR DECISION AND YOUR STRATEGY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S YOUR JOB AS PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT. NOT DEAR LEADER. NOT SUPREME LEADER. DEMOCRACY RUNS ON ACCOUNTABILITY. AND NOWHERE IS IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE POWER TO MAKE WAR AND BRING PEACE. YOU'RE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH CONGRESS, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU'RE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION, MR. PRESIDENT. AND YOU CANNOT PURSUE WAR WITH IRAN WITHOUT CONSENT AND AUTHORITY FROM CONGRESS. THE EXISTING AUMF'S, THE CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE DO, NOT APPLY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT AND OUR CONSTITUTION WILL NOT ABIDE A PRESIDENT WHO RULES BY FIAT AND DEMANDS OBEDIENCE. I SERVED IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FOR EIGHT YEARS. EIGHT YEARS. AND YOU KNOW, WHAT I FIND IS I SERVED IN THAT BRANCH, ALSO, THE OTHER ONE, THE STHATH, THE CONGRESS, FOR 36. AND I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT HOLD UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADVANCE OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. TO WORK TOGETHER. NOT IN A POLITICAL INTEREST OF ANY ONE PARTY OR ANY ONE PERSON. WE NEED TO RESTORE THE BALANCE OF POWERS BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO , WE NEED CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT SERVE TO CHECK AND BALANCE THE WORST INSTINCTS OF OUR LEADERS IN EITHER OF THE BRANCHES. WE NEED TO USE OUR SYSTEM TO BRING US TOGETHER AS A NATION, NOT ABUSE IT AND RIP US APART. THIS IS NOT A NAIVE, OUTDATED WAY OF THINKING. THIS IS THE GENIUS AND TIMELESSNESS OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WHICH HAS FOR MORE THAN 240 YEARS ALLOWED US TO REMAKE OUR , OURSELVES, RECKON WITH OUR SHORTCOMINGS AND MOVE OUR NATION EVER FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT WE OWE THESE BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN WHO STEPPED FORWARD TO WEAR THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES. WHO DECIDE, WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. WHO CHOSE THAT JOIN THE PEACE CORPS OR WORK IN DEVELOPMENT. WE REPRESENT THE BEST OF OUR COUNTRY THEY REPRESENT THE BEST OF OUR COUNTRY ALL AROUND THE WORLD. TODAY THEY ARE DOING SO AT GREAT RISK BECAUSE OF OUR PRESIDENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. THESE ARE DANGEROUS TIMES, BUT LET ME END BY SAYING, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. WE NEED ACTION, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?467903-1/vice-president-joe-biden-foreign-policy-statement	Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden delivered remarks on foreign policy at Chelsea Piers in New York City.

AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT HEARS THE ORAL ARGUMENT IN A MONTANA CASE. AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING THE ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE RALLY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. NOW, HERE IS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] HELLO, CLAREMONT. I COULD BE , THE HISTORY OF CLAREMONT, I COULD BE IN SCRANTON OR CLAREMONT , CLAYMONT, DELAWARE. WE USED TO HAVE VIABLE INDUSTRIES. IN SCRANTON IT WAS COLD AND STEEL AND IN CLAYMONT, DELAWARE IT WAS STEEL AND EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED AT ENOUGH. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU TO BETHANY AND MR. SPEAKER FOR NOT ONLY YOUR SERVICES AS A SPEAKER BUT YOUR SERVICE IN VIETNAM. YOU KNOW BEAU. HE SAID THE MOST MOVING THING THAT HAPPENED AFTER HE CAME HOME , HELLO? HELLO? I WILL PULL THIS ONE OFF. OH, YES. EXCUSE MY BACK, I APOLOGIZE. HE SAID ONE OF THE MOST MOVING THINGS OCCURRED AFTER HE HAD BEEN A YEAR AND A RACK. THEY LANDED, HIS DIVISION. HIS UNIT. AND HE SAID , I FORGET THE EXACT NUMBER BUT SOMETHING LIKE 30 VIETNAM THAT'S STANDING THERE IN LINE AS THEY GOT OFF AND SALUTING THEM. AND WHEN YOU GUYS CAME HOME, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT OF RESPECT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS. AND BY THE WAY, YOUR NOTION ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID REGARDING TRAUMATIC RAIN INJURIES, I WILL SPEAK TO IN JUST A SECOND BUT THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND I REALLY MEAN THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU FOR BOTH OF YOU FOR SUPPORTING ME. THE MAIN REASON I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT YOU SUPPORTING ME , WHERE DID SHE GO? THERE YOU ARE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO LOON LAKE. TALK ABOUT HEAVEN ON EARTH. FOLKS, LOOK, I WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I WANT A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ALL AS WE GO AROUND THIS ROPE LINE. BUT, FOLKS, YOU ALL DO HAVE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. THERE IS A LOT OF STATES AND BOTH PRIMARIES THAT ANDY YOU BEING THE FIRST PRIMARY BUT TO ALWAYS TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. DECIDING ON NOT ONLY WHO IS BEST FOR YOUR STATE BUT WHETHER THAT PERSON CAN GO ON AND WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING SINCE I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS RACE, THE CARE OR OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. THE CANDIDATES , THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES AND THE CHARACTER OF OUR LEADERS. AND DONALD TRUMP, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EXAGGERATION TO SUGGEST, HE HAS DIMINISHED THE CHARACTER OF THE U.S. ALLIES ONCE LOOKED AT US FOR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS OUR PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT MOVING ON WITHOUT US. OUR ADVERSARIES WHO ONCE FEARED TO CROSS US NOW SEE A PRESIDENT THAT ONE CAN BAMBOOZLE OR IGNORED. ORDINARY PEOPLE IN EVERY NATION AROUND THE WORLD WHO ONCE SAW AMERICA AS A CITADEL OF MORAL LIBERTY AND THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE LOOK AND SAY , WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? WE USED TO STAND FOR UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOM OF ALL PEOPLE AND NOW WE SEE THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO GETTING LOVE LETTERS FROM THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. BACKSLAPPING OTHER AUTOCRATIC LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHILE POKING HIS FINGER AT OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS. WE ONCE WERE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND OPEN AND WELCOME TO ALL. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED TO CLOSE THE GATES. MY WIFE WAS RECENTLY IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS WITH A CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS TO PROVIDE CHRISTMAS MEALS FOR THESE KIDS, MOSTLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVING IN SQUALOR SEEKING ASYLUM. FIRST TIME I AM AWARE OF ANY PRESIDENT REQUIRING AN ASYLUM SEEKER TO NOT SEEK IT FROM U.S. SOIL BUT DOES HE GET FROM ABROAD, IN THIS CASE IN LITERALLY IN RAINSOAKED BANKS ALONG THE RIVER'S IN MEXICO. AND REFUGEES AND ENTIRE RELIGIOUS GROUPS , THE SO-CALLED MUSLIM BAN. ABN IS A BETRAYAL OF ALL FOUNDATIONS OF OUR AMERICAN HISTORY AND AMERICAN FREEDOM. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR AND NOW AFTER A THREE-YEAR ASSAULT ON OUR AMERICAN VALUES, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO EXPAND THE RELIGIOUS BAND TO MORE COUNTRIES. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS IS NOT ONLY MORALLY WRONG, IT IS LIKE PUTTING UP A GREAT BIG RECRUITING BANNER FOR TERRORISTS SAYING , SEE, WE TOLD YOU. THEY WANT TO ABANDON US. THE FACT HE DOES NOT SEE THAT , I'M CONFIDENT THE PEOPLE ADVISING HIM KNOW IT BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO LISTEN TO ANYONE OF CONSEQUENCE. MAKE NO MISTAKE , IT COMES OUT OF , HOW CAN I SAY IT? YOU SAW THE REPORT THAT INDIRECTLY REFERENCED LAST WEEK, IT HAPPENED A WHILE AGO, WHERE THERE WAS A SUPER SECRET PLACE FOR MEETINGS. HE REFERRED TO THESE INCREDIBLE GENERALS AND FLAG OFFICERS MANY HOME HAVE LEFT THEM PUBLICLY CRITICIZED HIM , HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES TO THEIR FACE. IN FRONT OF THEIR FOLKS. AND THEN THIS WEEK, HE BRUSHED OFF THOSE BRAVE TROOPS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOMBARDMENT. HE SAID THAT WHILE THEY ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR TRAUMATIC RAIN INJURY, HE SAID NO, THEY JUST HAVE A HEADACHE. MY WORDS NOT HIS , WHY DON'T YOU JUST GROW WHAT? AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESS THAT FOLLOWS ME. I BRING OUT MY SCHEDULE AND AT THE BOTTOM I HAVE , TROOPS KILLED. I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY FALLEN HEROES HAVE DIED. IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, SO FAR 6904. A WEEK AGO, IT WAS 6901. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ONE LEFT BEHIND A FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY. AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHAT IS NOT ON HERE IS THAT THERE ARE 300,000, 300 THOUSAND ESTIMATED PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM THESE WARS WITH , SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BEING EXPOSED TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES AND OTHER PROBLEMS. THE IDEA THAT IT IS TAKEN SO LIGHTLY, I FIND IT QUITE FRANKLY DISGUSTING. AND LAST YEAR, A GALLUP POLL RELEASED A STUDY THAT SAID THE WORLD NOW RATES CHINA, CHINA'S LEADERSHIP HIGHER THAN THEY DO AMERICA'S MISSION IN THE WORLD. AS MY WIFE AND PROFESSOR WITH SAY , YOU CAN GOOGLE IT AND WE ARE JUST ABOVE, BARELY ABOVE RUSSIA. YOU KNOW, OUR MORAL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN SACKED. OUR CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN SHOT. AND QUITE FRANKLY, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN DIMINISHED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT TWO THINGS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL NO MATTER HOW IT GOES. ONE, THEY WILL INHERIT A DIVIDED COUNTRY AND NUMBER TWO, A WORLD IN DISARRAY. OR WILL BE NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. NOT. WE WILL NEED A PRESIDENT READY ON DAY ONE TO COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE, IT BE THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES AND MAKE THE U.S. THE PHYSICAL AND MORAL LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT FROM THE BEGINNING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS OR CEOS. IT WAS BUILT BY THE MIDDLE CLASS , ORDINARY HARD-WORKING PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY AND YOUR'S. ORDINARY AMERICANS THAT DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. JUST A CHANCE. NO GUARANTEES. I HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS NATION. ON FACTORY FLOORS AND UNDERSTANDING THE DIGNITY OF LABOR. AND A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS IT WAS BUILT , THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS BUILT BY UNIONS. UNIONS. YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN. YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE PAIN THAT IS STILL RESONATE IN MANY COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING GREAT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. HE EITHER DOES NOT KNOW OR DOES NOT CARE THAT WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ARE STILL GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. RECENT STUDY SHOWED 44% OF THE PEOPLE ARE MAKING APPROXIMATELY THE EQUIVALENT OF NINE DOLLARS AND OUR. 44% OF THE PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU GOT BENEFITS FROM THE TAX CUT , LOOK, WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT CAN BRING US TOGETHER, UNITE OUR PARTY AND THE COUNTRY AS WELL. WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. AND A DEMOCRACY IS A STATE BECAUSE IT DEPENDS UPON CONSENSUS. YOU CANNOT GET ANYTHING DONE UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION UNLESS YOU CAN REACH A CONSENSUS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN MAKE THE PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE. IF YOU CANNOT UNITE THE COUNTRY, NOT ON EVERY SINGLE THING BUT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GENERATE THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO FORM A CONSENSUS, WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, AND THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE SEEKING THE NOMINATION AS WELL, THINK I AM NAIVE. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN IN FACT GENERATE SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS BETWEEN DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS. BUT I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT IN FACT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE. AND THIS ENDLESS WAR BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. IT IS DEADLY FOR US. I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER IN THE SENATE AND AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. WORKING TOGETHER TO GET MAJOR THINGS DONE AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THEM DONE. AND WHEN YOU CANNOT AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS, YOU GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN AGAINST THEM AND DEFEAT THEM. YOU TALK ABOUT THE MARRIAGE. IT IS OK TO JUDGE THEIR JUDGMENT BUT NOT TO QUESTION THEIR MOTIVE. BUT US WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE. ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF DOING THAT. BUT THAT IS THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER NATIONALLY NOW AND IT HAS TO STOP BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET AN AWFUL LOT DONE. I'M TOLD BY MY COLLEAGUES SEEKING A NOMINATION THAT BIDEN HAS DONE THIS HIS WHOLE LIFE BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS NEW PARTY. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF AFFECTION OF THIS NEW PARTY FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME NOW AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT REPEATEDLY. DONALD TRUMP HAS SPENT WELL OVER 12 MILLION , $12 MILLION-$14 MILLION TELLING LIES ABOUT ME. THIS DEMOCRAT PARTY UNDERSTANDS BETTER THAN MOST. THEY HAVE SMEARED ME. HE HAS COLLUDED WITH FOREIGN POWERS TO MAKE SURE , HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PRESIDENT SPENT SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO KEEP SOMEONE FOR BEING A NOMINEE? I WONDER WHY? YOU SAW IT TODAY THAT HIS SPOKESPERSON SAID , YOU SHOULD NOMINATE SOMEONE ELSE OTHER THAN BIDEN BECAUSE BIDEN IS A BAD GUY. WELL, KELLYANNE CONWAY, I APPRECIATE HER BEING AGAINST ME. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, THEY HAVE SLANDERED ME AND MY ONLY SURVIVING SON. BUT LOOK, I CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS WITH ME TONIGHT, TODAY AND SHE IS CAMPAIGNING WITH ME AND HER NAME IS FINNEGAN BIDEN. SHE IS A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE IN PHILADELPHIA AND SHE IS ON THE TRAIL WITH ME AND SHE AND , I HAVE TAUGHT ALL MY KIDS AND MY FIVE RAN KIDS THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT THE PRESIDENT CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. A PRESIDENT HAS TO HEAL. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY, THIS IS ABOUT YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT ABOUT ME. AND I REALLY MEAN THAT. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. MY CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED MORE THAN JUST PLANS AND PROPOSALS. WE NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY GET SOME OF IT DONE. SOME OF IT PASSED. I WILL PUT MY RECORD ON THE LINE WITH ALL OF THE NOMINEES RUNNING AS MY RECORD OF DELIVERING BIG THINGS, CONSEQUENTIAL DEMOCRATIC WINS UP AND DOWN THE LINE AND AGAINST ANYONE IN THIS RACE. I WAS A GUY THAT WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL AND GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED AND BACKGROUND CHECKS. I PASSED THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WHICH LASTED FOR 10 YEARS AND A BAND FOR HIGH-CAPACITY , [APPLAUSE] HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES. YOU COULD NOT HAVE 100 OR 50 BULLETS IN A CLIP. WHO IN GODS NAME NEEDS THAT OTHER THAN TO DO DAMAGE? I PASSED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT. [APPLAUSE] I GOT THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN THROUGH THE U.S. SENATE. AND I DELIVERED THREE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH WAS A BILL THAT KEPT US OUT OF A DEPRESSION. WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, WE WERE ABLE TO GET OBAMACARE. PROTECTING 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. BY THE WAY, I FOUND IT FASCINATING , DID YOU HEAR LAST WEEK? PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID , I AM THE REASON WHY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE COVERED. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY , BLESS ME, FATHER, I HAVE SINNED. WHAT IS GOING ON? NOW, YESTERDAY HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT , TWO DAYS AGO, HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND NOW HE IS GOING TO BE SAVED. I JUST MIGHT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT WILL ALL BE SAVED BY HIM. I SHOULD NOT EVEN GET GOING. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO NEED IS WE CAN GET THINGS DONE. I HAVE PUT , MY TEAM WAS PART OF SECURING THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. KEEPING IRAN FROM FINDING A PATH TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT NOTICE. NOT A SINGLE PERSON SAID THAT THEY HAD VIOLATED IT. AND NUMBER TWO, THE PARIS AGREEMENT. THE BEST HOPE FOR THE WORLD TO MEET THE CLIMATE ROLE. , CLIMATE GOAL. PEOPLE SAY WE CAN'T LET THINGS DONE. ON OUR WAY OUT OF OFFICE, AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION, WE WERE TOLD THAT NOT A SINGLE THING WHAT PAST THE TWEEN THE TIME HE WON AND THE TIME HE WAS SWORN IN. I PUT TOGETHER A BIPARTISAN DEAL WORTH ALMOST $9 BILLION FOR CANCER RESEARCH. EVEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE KIND ENOUGH TO NAME IT THE BEAU BIDEN CANCER RECOVERY ACT AS WELL AS $7 BILLION FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND OTHER RESEARCH. AND A BIPARTISAN INVESTMENT CALLED THE CURES ACT. AND WE WERE TOLD WE COULD NOT GET ANYTHING DONE. THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP SAID NOTHING COULD GET THEM. WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, SOMETIMES SMART THINGS HAPPEN. FOLKS, LOOK , I AM NOT IN NOSTALGIA OR GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE. IT TAKES LEADERSHIP AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN LEAD RIGHT NOW. SO, FOLKS, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO NUMBER ONE RESTORE AND FULLY EXPAND THE PROMISE OF AMERICA , TO LITERALLY RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THIS TIME BRING ALONG BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS AS WELL AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS SO THAT EVERYONE THAT COMES ALONG REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, GENDER, DISABILITY. AND UNITE THIS COUNTRY SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AGAIN AND GET THINGS DONE. IMAGINE ALL OF THE PROGRESS WE CAN MAKE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IF WE ALL COME TOGETHER. WE CAN TAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE SURE HEALTH CARE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE BUT AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND EVERYONE IS PROTECTED AND CAN AFFORD IT. PREPARE EVERY STUDENT IN AMERICA FROM PRE-K, THREE , THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD AND EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CHANCES TO SUCCEED ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND TALK ABOUT MORAL DEPRAVITY. 15 YEARS AGO, IF YOU HAD A CHILD GO TO SCHOOL THEY LEARNED HOW TO DROP, ROLE, AND COVER. NOW, THEY LEARN HOW TO DR. AND COVERED. , DUCK AND COVER. THE GREATEST CONCERN OF CHILDREN BETWEEN SEVEN AND 17 IS BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. THAT IS ASTOUNDING. THAT IS THE FACT. THEIR GREATEST FEAR. FOLKS, LOOK, WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, AMERCO WILL ONCE AGAIN STAND UP TO GET TATERS. WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR ALLIES RATHER THAN BERATING THEM AND BELITTLING THEM. WE WILL RALLY THE FREE WORLD AND MEET THE CHALLENGES OF OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT AND SO MUCH MORE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY WHOLE CAREER. I WAS ELECTED WHEN I WAS A 29 EUROS KID AND THEY CALLED ME THE YOUNG IDEALIST. I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TO LEAD IN THE 21ST CENTURY, MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT WE HAVE NEVER , THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO DO IN WAR AND PEACE WHEN WE HAVE SET OUR MIND TO GET IT DONE AS A PEOPLE. FOLKS, THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS BEAT DONALD TRUMP. AND NOT ONLY THAT, AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER, WE HAVE TO WIN IN STATES THAT WILL WIN US BACK THE U.S. SENATE. BECAUSE FOLKS, WE CAN DO THAT. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WIN. WE HAVE TO BE A WILL TO WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA, WIN IN GEORGIA, IN ARIZONA. NOT JUST MY HOME STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND OTHERS. WE WILL WIN THOSE. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHO CAN BEST HELP, WHO DO THEY MOST WANT TO RUN WITH? WHO WILL HELP THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE TICKET? THAT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE. I THINK I AND THAT GUY. IT IS UP TO YOU TO DECIDE. WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE PRESIDENCY AND THE U.S. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE NOW. I WENT INTO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGNED FOR 67 CANDIDATES AND ELECTED 41 PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN GO AFTER THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR CHARACTER , WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR CARE TO HER BUT AFTER HEALTH CARE. THEY ALL WANTED TO DO AWAY WITH OBAMACARE. AND PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE CAMPAIGNED ON THE ISSUE AND WE WON AND PURPLE AND RED STATES. WE WON IN ALABAMA AND ELSEWHERE ACROSS AMERICA. WE CAN DO THIS IF WE REMEMBER WHO THE DEVIL WE ARE. AND WE STAND TOGETHER. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING TITO , I REALLY HOPE , AND WHERE I COME FROM IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOUR STATE. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED HERE IN THE YEARS COMING UP AND CAMPAIGNING FOR PEOPLE AND FOR MYSELF IS YOU ARE LIKE DELAWARE, EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYBODY ELSE WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE NORTH COUNTRY OR DOWN BY THE MASSACHUSETTS BORDER. EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYONE ELSE. THE FIRST TIME I RAN IN DELAWARE WHICH IS THE LARGER STATE. WE HAVE THE LARGEST STATE IN AMERICA WITH ONLY ONE CONGRESSPERSON. WE ARE JUST SHORT OF GETTING TO TWO. AND THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS EVEN MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH ARE HERE IN TERMS OF HOW TO CAMPAIGN. WHAT HAPPENED WAS I STARTED OFF AND THEY SAID , BE CAREFUL, NOW. I WAS A YOUNG KID. EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYBODY. I STARTED OFF CAMPAIGNING ALONG THE BORDER OF MARYLAND AND DELAWARE IN THE SOUTH. I WAS INVITED INTO A METHODIST CHURCH THAT WAS DOWN IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED SHELBYVILLE. THE PREACHER CAME IN AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE COUNCILMEMBER BIDEN TO COME AND MEET SOME OF THE PARISHIONERS. I WAS DOWN THERE WITH A FELLA NAMED EDGAR C BENNETT AND I HAD TO CALL HIM ""EDGAR C."" AND WE SPEAK WITH AN ACCENT DOWN THERE AND THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. I WAS GREETING ALL OF THE PEOPLE AND AS WE ARE WALKING OUTCOME HE WAS UNDER THE OAK TREE WITH HIS WIFE. AND WATCHING. WHEN IT IS FINISHED, I ASKED HOW IT WENT , AND HE SAID IT WENT GREAT EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE JERK. AND HE SAID, IT DID GO WELL BUT THAT ONE GUY WAS MY FIRST COUSIN ALEX. THE WAY I CAMPAIGN IS YOU SHOW UP, KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SHE CAN. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I AM A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY. GIVE ME A LOOK. OK? THANK YOU, ALL VERY VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) ALL ACROSS THE FIELD, WE WILL CONNECT THE MISSIONS AND ELIMINATE MORE THAN 40% IN THE FIRST 10 YEARS. [INDISCERNIBLE] FOSSIL FU ELS. IF WE CAN KEEP THE STANDARDS THAT BARACK AND I PUT IN PLACE , FOR EXAMPLE. SHIFT THE FEDERAL PLAN FOR ETHANOL AND BIOFUEL. WE NEED TO REJOIN THE PARIS ACCORD. WE NEED TO UP THE ANTE. WITHOUT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP , HEY MAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE TWO 20 SOMETHING YEAR OLD. THERE IS HUGE ANXIETY IN THAT GENERATION AND COMING UP BEHIND THEM ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PLANET THEY WILL BE INHERITING TO LIVE ON. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD HAVE FAMILIES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THEIR PREVIEW , IT IS ALREADY HERE. I GUESS WHAT I'M HOPING FOR IS MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT WHERE THE PHASEOUT , WHEN THE PHASEOUT OF FOSSIL FUELS WILL BE. THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US A CHIPPY YESTERDAY. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCIENTIST THAT WILL TELL US THAT WE CANNOT ELIMINATE DOWN TO ZERO BUT WE CAN RADICALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FOSSIL FEELS , FOR EXAMPLE, I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE RAIN FOREST IS THE LARGEST CARBON SYSTEM IN THE WHOLE WORLD. ITWHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT IS THE U.S. DOING? I WOULD PUT THE ENTIRE HEMISPHERE TOGETHER LIKE I DID WITH REGARD TO , THAT IS WHY , I'M THE GUY IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THAT LED THE EFFORT WITH $100 BILLION BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF SOLAR AND WIND. [INDISCERNIBLE] THAT IS OK. I APPRECIATE THEM. ANYWAYS, TAKE A LOOK. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THE U.S. IS COMING BACK. NOTWITHSTANDING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS ANGERING EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. NATO IS GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME RIGHT NOW. WE WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF [INDISCERNIBLE] LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR COUNTRY. 100,000 JOBS OUT THERE THAT PAY WELL. HIGH-TECH JOBS. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A MACHINE ON THE FLOOR , SOLAR PANELS. THAT IS WHY WE PUT UP WHAT WE DID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. HOW WILL WE GET TRADE SCHOOLS AS WELL AS [INDISCERNIBLE] ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGED GUYS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE HANGUPS THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS DID REGARDING RACE. I REALLY MEAN IT. [INDISCERNIBLE] (music) I KNOW. WELL, THANK YOU, MAN. WE HAVE A DEAL. I HAVE A COMMAND COIN. AND THE NEXT TIME HE SEES ME, IF HE DOES NOT HAVE IT, HE HAS TO BUY THE DRINKS. I GOT COCA-COLA."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?468360-1/joe-biden-campaign-event-claremont-hampshire	Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Common Man Inn hotel in Claremont, New Hampshire.

MY NAME IS OWEN TOWNS AND. I AM OWEN TOWNS, AND IT IS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME TO BE A HEALING FOR JOE BIDEN. MY FIRST POLITICAL MEMORY GOING UP WAS GOING TO THE VOTING BASE WITH MY FATHER WHO WATCH HIM BEFORE THE OBAMA BIDEN BALLOT IN 2008 AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE WE ACTUALLY VOTED FOR DEMOCRAT AND FOR MANY MILLIONS OF OTHERS OF AMERICANS, THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS PERSONAL. GROWING UP IN RURAL AMERICA ON A FARM, I'VE ALWAYS LEANED TOWARDS CANDIDATES AND POLITICIANS WE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO MY FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE WHO I GREW UP WITH, MY NEIGHBORS. FOR GENERATIONS, MANY RURAL AMERICANS TENDED TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT, BUT IN 2016 WE SAW THOSE SAME VOTERS VOTE FOR OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THAT IS SIMPLY PUT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP SHOWED UP IN AREAS THAT BOTH SIDES WROTE OFF THE MAP. FORTUNATELY THERE IS A CANDIDATE IN OUR PARTY NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MY OWN. JOE BIDEN IS THE CANDIDATE TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY AGAIN AND BUILD A DIVERSE SUSTAINABLE WORKING CLASS COALITION THAT WILL HELP US WIN BACK THE MIDWEST. HE HAS SHOWED UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN, LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITIES I GREW UP IN, TO LEARN FROM THEM AND TO HELP THEM. FROM LA TO HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS AND BACK HOME IS GRANTED, JOE BIDEN WILL BRING TOGETHER THOSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER WITH THOSE DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS AND NOT JUST TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE BUT TAKE BACK THE SENATE, I PASSED THE BOLD, PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION THAT WILL REVITALIZE THE MIDDLE CLASS AND RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION AND THAT IS WHY I NEED EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN, HALL WITH ONLY FIVE DAYS, OR REALLY, FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE IOWA CAUCUS, I NEED EVERYONE IN THIS CROWD TO LOOK AROUND FOR ONE OF MY COWORKERS WITH A CLIPBOARD AND SIGN UP FOR SOME SHIFTS TO HELP US KNOCK ON DOORS AND MAKE PHONE CALLS AND HELP US OUT ON CAUCUS NIGHT AS A PRECINCT MEMBER. WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THE FINISH LINE. WE ARE LESS THAN 200 DOLLARS AND WE NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP US GET THERE. AND SINCE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO WINNING IN, IOWA THAT IS WHY I NEED YOU. IN ORDER TO DO, THAT WE HAVE TO NOMINATE THE RIGHT CANDIDATE AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN SO, THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT AND THANK YOU GUYS. PLEASE WELCOME FIREFIGHTER AND CANDIDATE FOR STATE SENATE STEVE GORE MAN. WELL, WELCOME. MY NAME IS STEVE GORMAN. I AM A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR IOWA SENATE HERE IN DISTRICT EIGHT, WHICH ENCOMPASSES COUNCIL BLUFFS. I WAS REALLY HONORED WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO INTRODUCE OUR GUEST TONIGHT. I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF. 29 YEARS AGO, I TOOK A JOB TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF THIS COMMUNITY AND IT'S A GREAT HONOR AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS SUCH A WEALTH OF LEGISLATION AND EXPERIENCE AND SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND PUT THIS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU CAME HERE TO TALK TO JOE. BECAUSE 29 YEARS AGO BECAME A FIREFIGHTER, AND I DID NOT REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO ME TO BE ABLE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GO TO WORK AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FAMILY AT HOME. JOE BIDEN , AND THIS IS WHY I AM CAUCUSING FOR JOE BIDEN, AND I WILL STAND WITH JOE BIDEN IN A MATTER WHAT. JOE BIDEN MADE IT POSSIBLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FAMILY IF I BUT THE ULTIMATE PRIZE IN MY JOB. HE SOUGHT TO WHAT THAT FAMILIES OF THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN MY LINE OF WORK, THAT THEIR FAMILIES WERE TAKING CARE OF, AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. FAMILY IS NUMBER ONE IN LIFE. IT NEVER ONE THING MY SECOND FAMILY IS MY FIREFIGHTERS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THESE GUYS HAVE MY BACK AT ALL TIMES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT ON A LOT OF, DAYS WE ARE CALLED INTO SOME, VERY VERY BAD SITUATIONS. YOUR WORST DAYS, AND WE SEE THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ENVIRONMENTS THAT NOT GOOD FOR US HEALTH WISE AND NOT GOOD FOR US AS FAR AS BEING A DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. WE FACE THEM ALMOST DAILY. THESE GUYS HAVE OUR BACKS. I BACK. I HAVE THEIR BACK. WE PRACTICE WHAT WE CALL TO WIN TWO OUT. WHEN WE GO INTO A, FIRE THERE'S TWO OF US THAT GO IN THERE TO RESCUE YOU AND DO THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO, TO PUT YOUR PROFITING GET YOU OUT OF THAT BURNING STRUCTURE. THERE IS TWO GUYS OUTSIDE WATCHING OUR BACK, MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T GET LOST IN THERE AND IF WE GET IN TROUBLE, THEY'RE COMING IN TO GET US AND YOU, AND THEN THERE IS JOE BIDEN. IN THE 29 YEARS THAT I WORKED AS A FIREFIGHTER, WE DID NOT HAVE TO ASK HIM FOR HELP, HE WAS THERE. HE WAS LEGISLATING TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS GETTING MY FAIR PAY AND MY FAMILY WAS TAKEN CARE OF. HE IS MAKING SURE THAT THE INJURIES THAT I SUSTAIN, AND AS A FIREFIGHTER I'VE BEEN INTRODUCING SEVERAL TIMES, THAT I WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND MY FAMILY WAS TAKEN CARE OF. JOE BIDEN HAS , FIREFIGHTERS ARE PEOPLE PEOPLE. WE LOVE PEOPLE. WE DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE. WE TAKE CARE OF YOU. JOE BIDEN IS THIS MAN. HE IS KIND. HE IS THERE. HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND I AM SO PROUD OF THE CAUCUS.

NOW, YOU SEE THE MAN WITH THE SYRACUSE JERSEY? I WANT TO SHOW UP IN SYRACUSE. I WAS ASKED BY EVERYBODY HERE IN IOWA, ARE USED TO THE COLD YET? YOU WON'T SEE NOTHING TILL YOU'VE BEEN SYRACUSE. SYRACUSE GETS MORE SNOW THAN ANY MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HUNDRED 96 INCHES OF SNOW, AND IT'S COLD. THE PREVIOUS DAYS IT'S NOT COLDER WHEN THE SNOW IS COMING DOWN. I TELL YOU WHAT, I WENT TO SYRACUSE TO PREPARE ME FOR BEING ABLE TO CAMPAIGN IN IOWA. SO GREAT TO SEE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND LET ME THANK THE SOON SENATOR TO BE THESE GUYS HAVE HEARD ME SAY. THIS, THIS IS THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION AND A GOOD, GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND A GREAT HELPED ME MY WHOLE CAREER WE'VE BEEN FRIEND, BUT THERE'S AN EXPRESSION, GOD MADE MAN AND THEN HE MADE A FEW FIREFIGHTERS AND THEY'RE ALL CRAZY, UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE WHO IN GOD'S NAME WOULD RUN INTO A FIRE AND NOT RUN AWAY FROM IT, BUT THEY'RE AMAZING. AND THE TOP WHAT HAVE YOU HAD THIS BOX AND THEY HAVE YOU BACK TO, ANOTHER SAY IN THE SENATE,, EXCUSE APPOINT A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE, THEY HAVE ARE BACK IN THE WAY THAT INCLUDES MY POLITICAL SUPPORT. I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE SUPPORT OF FIREFIGHTERS BACK MY HOME STATE. THERE ARE THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND FIREFIGHTERS. I HAVE THE FIREFIGHTERS BUT SERIOUSLY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS WORTH SAYING WE, NEVER APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT WE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF HELP, WEATHERS ALONG ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, A FIREFIGHTER, A DOCTOR, ENTERS BUT THE THING ABOUT THESE GUYS AND WOMEN IS THEY ARE ALWAYS THERE AND IN MY CASE, THEY SAY THE LIVES OF BOTH MY SONS, I GET ELECTED THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 1972 AND I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON ON DECEMBER 18TH, HOW YOU DOING? ON DECEMBER 18TH, AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER, THE POOR WOMAN WAS SCARED TO DEATH. SHE SAID,, SHE BLURTED, OUT YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER ENDED , ARE DEAD AND YOUR TWO SONS MAY NOT MAKE IT. THESE GUYS, MY FIREFIGHTERS AT HOME, SPENT THREE HOURS WITH THE JAWS OF LIFE GETTING MY SONS UP TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. THREE HOURS AND THEN ABOUT 25 YEAR LONGER THAN THAT AGO, I HAD A CRANIAL ANEURYSM AND I HAD TO GET DOWN TO A HOSPITAL, TO A NEUROSURGEON FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 13-HOUR OPERATION THE SNOWSTORM. MY FIREFIGHTERS GOT ME DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SNOW STORM IN TIME TO SAVE MY LIFE THEN I WAS BACK IN 97 I, THINK IT WAS 98 I, WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON TO MEET THE PRESS ON A, SUNDAY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL, DAY LIGHTNING STRUCK MY HOME AND IT BEGAN TO BURN, DOWN IT WAS SO THICK, THE, SMOKE YOU LITERALLY COULD NOT SEE IT INSIDE THE ROOM, EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF FURNITURE FROM BASEMENT THIRD FLOOR WAS GONE, AND THEY SAY MY LEFT LIFE'S LIFE AND MY AS MY WIFE SAYS, BEFORE ME, THEY SAY THE CAT. SO, THEY ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, AND THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW THAT COME AND, GOD FORBID, YOU LOSE YOUR HOUSE, YOU BRING YOUR HOUSE, DOWN THERE OUT THE NEXT DAY WITH A BOOT ON THE CORNER RAISING MONEY TO HELP YOU REBUILD YOUR HOUSE. WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR JOB, THEY'RE OUT AT LITTLE LEAGUE FIELDS IN THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING EVERYTHING, SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT, BUT I APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU ARE THE COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO. THANK YOU. , I APPRECIATE YOUR WIFE BEING HERE AS WELL AND THIS NOVEMBER, WE NEED TO KICK DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE DO SEND STEVE TO THE IOWA STATE SENATE. AND I AM PROUD TO BE JOINED BY A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG, TIME INCREDIBLE FRIEND WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN JUST ABOUT ANYBODY FOR MY CAMPAIGN, RIGHT AROUND ABOUT THE GOLD BUS OF MINE, SHE AND TOM VILSACK, KRISTIE IS DYNAMIC FIRST LADY, SHE WAS HERE IN IOWA. HE CRISSCROSS THE STATE ADVOCATING FOR LITERACY AND IMPROVING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL COMMUNITIES AND THEN WHEN BARACK AND I GOT ELECTED SHE CAME TO WASHINGTON AND SHE TOOK THAT MESSAGE GLOBALLY, ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION, SHE WORKED WITH USA IDEA AROUND THE WORLD, AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE OPPORTUNITY SHINES AND EVERY CORNER THE WAR BECAUSE THE BETTER EDUCATED WE ARE THE BETTER OFF EVERYBODY IS AND SO I WANT TO THANK KRISTIE FOR ALL SHE'S DONE. LOOK, FOLKS, EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA, TO THE GREAT CHAGRIN OF MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY THINK YOU HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE, BUT I TELL YOU FOR REAL, YOU WILL TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY, THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL CAUCUS YOU'VE EVER PARTICIPATED, IN NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED, NOT BECAUSE JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING, OR ANY ONE CANDIDATE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS RUNNING, BECAUSE OF THE MAN WHO'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE CAN HANDLE FOR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. WE CAN HOPEFULLY GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS AN OPERATION IN HISTORY, BUT YEARS WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF THIS COUNTRY IN MY VIEW AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS A BETTER THAN ME SO YOU'RE MAKING A SERIOUS CHOICE AND WHAT I TELL PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ASK ME ABOUT IOWA, I, SAY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU LOOK JUST LOOK AT WHAT IN FACT YOU WANT PARTICULARLY IN YOUR STATE, WE LOOK AT WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF IOWA THEY CAN SURVIVE OUT OF IOWA AND HAVE A CHANCE OF BECOMING THE NOMINEE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO, SO, SO MUCH AT STAKE THIS TIME IN ONE. AND I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT FOR REAL. YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PRESIDENT OF LATE. THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE LEARN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. HE WAS TALKING TO INSTEAD OF RESPECTING OUR TROOPS, THERE WAS A REPORT THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED AND NO ONE HAS DENIED IT, THAT HE WENT OVER TO THE PENTAGON AND WHAT THEY CALL, ANYWAYS, HE WENT TO THE PENTAGON TO MEET WITH THE FLAG OFFICERS AND GENERALS, AND HE REFERRED TO THEM IS LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES. I HONESTLY GOT CAN'T THINK OF ANY TIME IN THE PAST OR ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER LOOKED AT OUR LAWYERS WHO SAID THINGS LIKE THAT TO THEM, ALLEGEDLY TO THEIR FACES. MY MOTHER WOULD, SAY I DON'T KNOW WHO DIED AND LEFT HIM, BOSS NO, BUT THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT IT, I TALK ABOUT CHARACTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND THEN WE LEARNED,, WE LEAVE AT 34 OF OUR WARRIORS WHO WERE STATIONED IN IRAQ WHERE MY SON'S BEEN HERE BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY,, BY SOUND AND ALL OF THOSE WARS WHERE THEY, ARE 34 OF, THEM STATION IN, IRAQ DURING THE MISSILE ATTACK BY THE IRANIANS AND 34 HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY? HE SAID NOBODY REALLY GOT HURT, IT WASN'T VERY SERIOUS, JUST HEADACHES. JUST HEADACHES. WELL, THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 300,000 OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS ACCORDING TO INNATE BUT TO BE SO CAVALIER, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE WARRIORS, JUST HEADACHES AND FOLKS, THE FACT IS THAT THE VFW A , FOREIGN WAR WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY POLITICAL ABOUT YET CAME OUT AND SAID THEY CALLED ON HIM TO APOLOGIZE, TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR WARRIORS FOR SAYING THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAS OR HAS NOT. MY GUESS IS HE PROBABLY HAS NOT. LET'S BE CLEAR, OUR TROOPS DESERVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WE OWE THEM 1% OF OUR POPULATION DEFENDS 99% OF US NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED, AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN DISARRAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING, NOT MUCH TIME AT ALL FOUR ON THE JOB TRAINING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO ON DAY ONE CAN COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE BECAUSE HE OR SHE KNOWS THOSE LEADERS, HERE ARE SHE IS KNOWN BY THEM, SOMEONE WHO CAN LEAD OUR ARMED FORCES, AND REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO BADLY DAMAGED BY HIS EMBRACE OF THUGS AND DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE UNITED STATES THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. FOLKS, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS THAT AS YOUR FUTURE SENATORS SAID EARLIER THAT THIS, COUNTRY WAS NOT GO BY WALL STREET YES BUT BUILT BY ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE. THEY ARE THE ONE IN RURAL AMERICA THE CITY,. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. GIVEN HALF A CHANCE THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, THEY ARE PROBABLY COME FROM FAMILIES LIKE I DID. WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE POOR, BUT I GUESS WE TECHNICALLY WERE. WE WERE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS IN TERMS OF INCOME, AND THEN AFTER MY DAD DID THAT WORK UP AND GRANT, AND PENNSYLVANIA, HE WAS NOT A COAL MINER, MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WHAT WAS, HE WAS NOT A COAL MINER TO SALES PERSON. THERE WERE NO JOB SO HE WENT DOWN TO DELAWARE AND HE WAS RAISED THERE ALMOST ONE THIRD GRADE TWO 11TH GRADE AND WE WENT BACK DOWN AND IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO GET US HOME, AND WE HAD THREE BEDROOM HOME, SPLIT LEVEL, HOME NICE PLACE, FOR KIDS AND A GRAND POP, WELL, WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST FINE, BUT FOLKS, THE POINT IS THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY TIME WE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF, ANYTHING WHERE WE HAD FAMILY, WE HAD VALUES, AND WE ALL CARE ABOUT THE SAME THING YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT OUT HERE IN IOWA, DECENCY, HONOR, COMMITMENT, SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF, KNOWING IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU. SO, FOLKS, LOOK. AND THE PROBLEM NOW, THE ONLY THING STANDING IN OUR WAY OF REBUILDING THIS COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE TO, REBUILD IS OUR BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. OUR POLITICS HAS BECOME SO, MEAN SO, PETTY SO BUSINESS THAT WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, UNITE THE COUNTRY, UNITE OUR COUNTRY FLAT, OUT FOLKS, WE ARE DEMOCRACY, DEMOCRACIES DEPEND ON CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO REACH CONSENSUS. THREE IS NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN, TO PROGRESS IF WE CANNOT REACH CONSENSUS SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RACE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THINK I'M NAIVE IN BELIEVING WE CAN UNIFY THE COUNTRY. NO, IT IS NOT NAIVE, IS WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE POLITICAL CAREER, POINT TO GET THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, ACT THE RECOVERY, ACT A WHOLE RANK OF THINGS LIKE UNLISTED A LONGER THAN WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN SO FAR BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE, IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, I DON'T ATTACK THEIR MOTIVE, YOU DON'T ATTACK THEIR JUDGMENT, YOU SAY, YOU ARE WRONG, ONCE OR ATTACK YOUR MOTIVE AND SAY YOU'RE IN THE POCKET, OF AND YOU ARE THIS IN THAT, AND I SAY, LET'S WORK OUT A BILL TO REBUILD THE HIGHWAYS, YES, FAT CHANCE, BUT IF I NEVER QUESTION YOUR MOTIVE AND I JUST QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT WE CAN ALWAYS END UP IN A COMPROMISE AND GET SOMETHING DONE. AND THERE IS SO MUCH THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET DONE IN MY VIEW. AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT AS I SAID, I AM TOLD THAT I AM NAIVE AND THEY SAY YES, JOE HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT, JOE IS BEEN ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE TOGETHER BEFORE, THEY JOE DID THIS THAT IN THE OTHER, THING EVERY TIME THERE WAS A DRAMA WITH A REPUBLICAN HOUSE OR SENATE, WHEN WE WERE VICE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT, I WAS THE GUY WHO FIXED, IT WELL THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO BUT NOW THEY SAY THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION. I TELL YOU, WHAT MAN, IT'S JUST BEEN AMAZING HOW MUCH THEY LOVE ME. ONE OF THE EVER HAD A PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPEND OVER 12 TO 15 MILLION DOLLARS RUNNING NEGATIVE ADS THAT WERE FLAT OUT LIES ABOUT A PERSON IT WAS NOT EVEN THE NOMINEE YET? I WONDER WHAT HE IS AFRAID OF AND THEN YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF AMAZING BUT LOOK, FOLKS, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT, IT IS NOT DOES THE PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FASCINATING. LET'S BE CLEAR. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WENT OUT THERE AND COLLUDED WITH A FOREIGN POWER TO TRY TO SMEAR ME. NO ONE UNDER OATH OR ANY UNDERWAY HAS EVER SUGGESTED I DID ANYTHING OTHER THAN MY JOB IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DID IT AS HIS LEADING OF ADMINISTRATIONS UNDER OATH WE'VE COMPLETE TARGETING HONESTY CARRYING OUT A POLICY UNITED STATES BUT OF ALL OF ALLIES AND ALL OF EUROPE, AND REDUCE CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. THE FACT IS THAT THEY SLANDERED ME AND SLANDERED MY ONLY SURVIVING SON AND BY THE WAY, YOU SEE JONI THE OTHER DAY? WHOA. SHE SPILLED THE BEANS. YOU KNOW, SHE JUST CAME OUT, THE WHOLE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FOR TRUMP WAS JUST A BIT OF POLITICAL HIT JOB,, IT IS NOT, IT IS HOW SCARED TRUMP IS TO RUNNING IT, AND, LOOK HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID. IOWA CAUCUSES, I WILL CALL THIS IS A NEXT MONDAY. I REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS DISCUSSION, MEANING, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ME ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WITH REPUBLICAN PROSECUTORS,, HOW THIS DISCUSSION TODAY, TWO DAYS AGO, INFORMS AND INFLUENCES IOWA CAUCUS VOTERS. WILL THEY BE SUPPORTING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THIS POINT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT IS JUST FLOODED ACKNOWLEDGING, WE'VE BEEN DOING WHATEVER WE CAN TO KEEP BIDEN FROM BEING THE NOMINEE AND WE TRIED TO DO, IT AND IRAQ IS NOT WORKING AND OUR GOING TO TRY, I MEAN, RAND, EXCUSE, ME THEY TRY TO UKRAINE, GOT US IN A WAR IN IRAN, PEOPLE GOT HURT IN IRAQ, FOLKS, I, MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND. ONE COMMENTATOR CALLED, IN AND I WANT TO QUOTE, THIS, BECAUSE IT IS LIKE SCREAMING THE QUIET PART INTO THE BOULEVARD, AND THAT GIVES US THE WONDERFUL NEWS SENATOR FROM FLORIDA, RICK SCOTT, ONE OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA. HE STARTED RUNNING ADS HERE IN IOWA AGAINST ME WELL, GOD LOVE, HIM AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, HE IS SO INTERESTED, HE IS INTERESTED FROM A SENATOR FROM FLORIDA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD WIN AN IOWA CAUCUS. ISN'T THAT FASCINATING? I GUESS IF I HAD THAT MUCH MONEY EXPENDED ON ANYTHING I COULD BUT, PRETTY AMAZING. THINK ABOUT, IT FROM THE CENTER FROM FLORIDA SITTING IN WASHINGTON, AS HARD TO START RUNNING NEGATIVE, ADS SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUS, NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. IT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE TO ME. THEY ARE TRYING TO SMEAR ME TO STOP ME. THEY KNOW IF I AM NOT THE NOMINEE, , IF I AM THE NOMINEE, I'M GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP. SO, SO, IOWA CAUCUS GOERS ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A TWOFER. ONE, IF I COME OUT OF HERE AS A WINNER, OVERRULE DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHT AND TO, YOU WILL RUIN JR.'S NIGHT AS WELL. AND I'M SURE THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA LOVES THE RECENT POLLS, ANYWAY, IN FLORIDA, LOOK, NO MATTER HOW PERSONAL THESE TEXTS , THESE ATTACKS, ARE ON A SERIOUS, NOTE AGAINST ME IN MY FAMILY, PRESIDENTS CAN'T HOLD GRUDGES. WE REALLY CAN'T BECAUSE THIS FIGHT IS NOT ABOUT ME IN MY FAMILY, IT IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR KIDS, BUT YOUR GRANDKIDS, ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY HAS TO NOTIFY, BUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT GOING TO HAVE TO HEAL AND YET KNOW HOW TO HEAL THE COUNTRY BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS ON THE BALLOT COME NOVEMBER. AND THAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, CHARACTER. CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO DARK, ANGRY NATION BC IN DONALD TRUMP'S TWEETS. AT THREE IN THE MORNING. . TWEETING BIRD. ANYWAY. THINK ABOUT, IT THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. READ THEM SOMETIME, LIKE LISTEN TO, THEM LOOK AT THEM, THEY ARE BIZARRE. I DON'T BELIEVE IN A NATION THAT PUTS KIDS IN CAGES AND THINKS IT'S OKAY. I DON'T BELIEVE, I DON'T THINK WE ARE A NATION THAT WHIPS OF HYSTERIA, SAYS WERE GOING TO BE BUILD A WALL AND IN FACT SAYS IMMIGRANTS ARE ABOUT TO INVADE AND TAKE US OVER AND RAPE US FROM MEXICO, BUT THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACIST LIKE THIS GUY HAS BEEN DOING. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE EITHER. AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT VOWS DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU I WILL NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THAT THE FREE PRESS IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. WE SOUND LIKE SOME KIND , OF I WON'T EVEN SAY. IT SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT, LIKE ABOUT HOW WE TALK. PRESIDENT HAVE YOU EVER HEARD SPEAK LIKE THIS BEFORE? I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT BELIEVES THE U.S. CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT, MOCKED OR IGNORED. I LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE STANDS, FOR HOW HE BEHAVED AND WHAT HE DOES, AND MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME WE: HAVE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICAN, WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I BELIEVE THERE IS WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS CALLS AN AMBITIOUS , AN INVISIBLE FABRIC THAT BOND THIS NATION TOGETHER. HE TALKS ABOUT GOOD CITIZENS, HE TALKS ABOUT THE GREEK PHRASE FOR A GOOD CITIZEN. HE TALKS ABOUT THAT WHAT WE KNOW, WE KNOW WHAT THAT MORAL FABRIC IS. IT IS HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. GIVING EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. DEMONIZING NO ONE, THE POOR, THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. LEADING BY EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. STANDING IS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT US. THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS A CODE. IT IS A CODE. IT IS THE AMERICAN CODE. FOR SOME REASON THIS PRESIDENT JUST AS NOT GET IT. FOR SOME REASON THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN IT. HE IS SNOOZING. HE THINKS HE MAKES AS WEAK. AND I CAN'T READ EXACTLY TO BE YEAR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID ALL THE STUFF ABOUT LEANING IT, REACHING OUT, MAKES YOU A SUCKER. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WE ALL, ALL OF, US NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE FROM, BASICALLY, FUNDAMENTAL, WHAT I CALL AMERICAN VALUES,. DECENTLY , DECENCY, HONESTY, RESPECT, WE DON'T ALWAYS LIVE UP TO, WHAT WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DISMISSED IT. FOLKS, HE THINKS THAT IT MAKES US WEAK BUT HE IS DEAD WRONG. IT MAKES A STRONG. IT IS WHO WE, ARE THAT IS THE GLUE THAT HOLDS THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED AND CAN COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. FOLKS, I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO MAKE PROGRESS ON MATTERS THAT MATTER THE MOST, REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, AND WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, HEALTH CARE, RATIONAL GUN POLICY SOAK HIS DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER IN THEIR FIRST, SECOND, OR THIRD GRADE, AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WELL, CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY, THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ON THIS PLANET, IS THE MOST URGENT NEED WE HAVE. LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS, THEY MAKE NO QUALMS ABOUT. IT EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS, FIND A STRONG TRUMP SUPPORTER AND ASK IF THEY WOULD HAVE A CHILD WHO THEY WOULD WANT TO GROW UP WITH DONALD TRUMP'S VALUES. I'M NOT JOKING, IT IS A DIFFERENT VALUES THAT THIS MAN HAS, DONE I, THINK IS WHO WE, ARE AND IT IS DAMAGING US BADLY AROUND THE WORLD IT IS DAMAGING US AND PUTTING US AT HOME. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN ELECTED HAS BEEN TO DIVIDE US. DO THIS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, HE CAME DOWN THAT ESCALATOR ANNOUNCING HIS PRESIDENCY, STARTED OFF AND SAID, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID, OF WERE GOING TO GET RID OF THOSE MEXICAN RAPISTS, AND WENT ON FROM THERE. AND WHAT YOU SAW WHEN ALL THIS VOTE CAME OUT OF THAT FIELD IN VIRGINIA? IN CHARLOTTESVILLE? CARRY THOSE CHARGES, CLOSE YOUR EYES REMEMBER WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE. CLOSE YOUR EYES, WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION, COMING OUT OF FIELDS WITH TORCHES, CARRYING TORCHES BY THE HUNDREDS, WELCOME TO THE STREETS, THERE VEINS BULGING, SPEWING HATE, CITING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF EUROPE IN GERMANY IN THE THIRTIES, CARRYING SWASTIKAS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN, AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. AND WHAT DID THEY ASK , THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MISTER PRESIDENT. DO YOU MOVE WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, THEY WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. NO PRESIDENT. FOLKS, THIS IS NOT JUST AN ETHICS LESSON. IT IS AS RICH AS THE FABRIC OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. LIKE I SAID, EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE WILL KNOW WHO WE ARE. FOLKS, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE, SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AND WE YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LAW IS. SO, FOLKS, REMEMBER I, REALLY MEAN, THIS REMEMBER, WE ARE WALKING DOWN WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA IS US. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BEEN A SINGLE THING , THIS IS LITERAL. NEVER BEEN A SINGLE THING WE HAVE SET OUR MIND TO THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO, BUT WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN THE NATION WE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. FOLKS, THANK YOU. FOLKS, HE TOLD ME I'M'S WAS TO CATCH A PLANE TO DES MOINES TO TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. I WANT TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS, BY STAFF WILL KILL ME IN THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO CHRISTY VILSACK, BUT ANYBODY ELSE, IF YOU CAN GET ME , IF YOU DON'T ASK AS A QUESTIONS, I CAN DO THEM QUICKLY BUT IF IT IS YES OR NO, I CAN DO IT EVEN MORE QUICKLY. DON'T BELIEVE ME. I'M USED TO. BULLIES NOT A, JOKE I WAS A, KID I WAS A PRETTY GOOD ATHLETE, I WAS THE SECOND HIGHEST SCORE IN FOOTBALL IN MY STATE. I WAS A PRETTY GOOD BASEBALL PLAYER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE THING THAT WAS A PROBLEM FOR ME WAS WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO STUTTER AND EVERYBODY THINKS THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF US DAUGHTER. IT IS HARD TO ASK THE GIRL OUT TO THE EIGHTH GRADE DATE. THEY DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY, BUT THINK ABOUT, IT IF I TOLD YOU I HAD A CLEFT LIP, OR RIGHT HAD WITHERED ARM, YOU WOULD'VE LASTED IT ALL. WE THINK WE CAN LAUGH AT IT SO, I'M USED TO BULLIES. THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED TO FIGHT. NOT A JOKE, BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT BOYS ARE. AT THEIR CORE, BULLIES ARE COWARDS. AT THEIR CORE, THEY ARE COWARDS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANNA TRY NOT TO DO. I'M GOING TO TRY TO RESIST MY IRISH TEMPER AND NOT GET DOWN TO THE MOSH PIT WITH THIS FELLA. I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION. I CAMPAIGNED , DID 84 EVENTS FOR HILLARY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AFTER THE ELECTION WAS ALL OVER, THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY , THERE IS A SCHOOL CALLED THE SHORN SKIN SCHOOL AT HARVARD. THEY DID A STUDY OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN OR SAID ABOUT HILLARY DURING THE CAMPAIGN IN THE PRESS AND THE MEDIA AND THEY WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF , HOW MUCH MORE RELATED ISSUES, SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH RELATED TO ISSUES? 4%. F OH YOU ARE. SO WE ALL THOUGHT, WHEN HE INCLUDE, INITIALLY WHEN YOU TALKED, ABOUT IT ONCE IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN, BUT BEING ABLE TO GRAB WOMEN WHEREVER HE COULD, AND HE COULD SHOOT SOMEONE ON FIFTH AVENUE GET AWAY WITH IT, AND WE TALKED ABOUT, PEOPLE WE ALL SAW , THOUGHT THAT WAS A DEAD SET LOSER FOR HIM. BUT GUESS WHAT, IT IS THE ONLY PLACE HE'S COMFORTABLE ARGUING. IT IS WHAT IS USED. DO I'M SERIOUS. HE DOES NOT KNOW THE ISSUES SO, I'M GOING TO TRY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE AT ALL RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE PRESIDENT. I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO DEBATE HIM BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THE BEST WAY TO POINT OUT WHY HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT. I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. IN TERMS OF FOREIGN POLICY, IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC POLICY, IN TERMS OF THE MAJOR ISSUES, HEALTH CARE, DID YOU REALIZE? I DIDN'T KNOW, THIS I THOUGHT BARACK AND I DID THIS, HE WAS SAYING TWO WEEKS AGO, THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED IS BECAUSE OF, MEAT DONALD J TRUMP. LOW. SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY BEST AND IF I'M, NOT GOING TO CALL MY SISTER, GRABBED JOE BY THE AIR AND PULL HIM, OUT BUT I PROMISE YOU, I'M NOT GOING TO. I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. YES SIR. THAT'S AN ESSAY BUT I'LL DO IT QUICKLY. THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD DO IN THE FIRST 90 DAYS IS I WOULD IMMEDIATELY SEND AN IMMIGRATION BILL TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND HOUSE THAT IN FACT WE PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND SECONDLY I WOULD IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. AND I WOULD INVITE THE CLOSE TO 200 MEMBERS THAT ARE , NATIONS THAT ARE MEMBER OF THAT ACCORD TO THE AUDIENCE LIKE WE DID WITH THE NUCLEAR PROVOCATION ENGINE HAPPENED SIT DOWN AND AGREE THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE TO UP THE ANTE BECAUSE WHEN WE WALKED, OUT EVERYTHING COLLAPSED. NOTHING IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE TO LEAD THE WORLD. AND EVEN IF WE DO WHAT MY PROPOSAL CALLS, FOR AN OF THIS AS WELL, AND ELIMINATED BY THE TIME WE GET A NET ZERO, MISSIONS GUESS, WHAT WE WOULD GET RID OF 50% OF THE PROBLEM UNITED STATES. 85% OF THE PROBLEMS THE REST OF THE WORLD SO, WE COULD BE A NET ZERO EMITTER OF ANY POLLUTANT. NOT ZERO AND WE ARE STILL GOT TO HAVE YOUR RIVERS FLOODING. WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE THIS AWFUL WEATHER CONDITIONS. WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE GLACIERS MELTING. WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN GETTING SICK OR AND SICK OR BECAUSE OF THE AIR AND ASTHMA AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. WERE GOING TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO MY WHOLE CAREER, I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME BRING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES TOGETHER, AND FOR, REAL WHETHER THERE IS ORGANIZING 61 NATIONS TO TAKE DOWN ISIS WITHOUT US HAVING TO COMMIT HUNDREDS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO TAKE THEM ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR WHATEVER IT WAS, THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE AND SO THAT IS THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND IT GOES ON FROM THERE BUT THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO. LAST QUESTION. SIR. I LIKE YOUR LID. I DO TOO. TAX BREAKS, THE TAX, WARS CHINA TAX. IT HAS DESTROYED OUR ECONOMY. I JUST GOT WORD THAT MINNESOTA HAD A RECORD BREAKING NUMBERS OF LOSSES OF FARMERS IN HISTORY. OUR FARMERS IN IOWA HAVE LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING. SMALL BUSINESS HAS LOST EVERYTHING AND THE CONSUMERS HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO CHANGE THAT? IMMEDIATELY, LOOK AT HIS TRADE POLICIES AND HERE'S WHAT WE WILL DO. LOOK, I KNOW THAT I COME FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STATE. WE ALL THINK I WHAT IS THE ONLY STATE THOSE AGRICULTURE ARE, BUT THE POTENTIAL OF THE GOES DOWN THE DELAWARE RIVER, THE CHESAPEAKE BAY DOWN TO THE POTOMAC IS A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY OF AGRICULTURE, MOSTLY CHICKENS AND SOYBEANS AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE ON HIS POLICIES. WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND PHASE ONE OF HIS NEW TRADE POLICY WITH CHINA IS JUST TAKING FARMERS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE DAY WE LEFT OFFICE. THAT'S ALL IT'S DONE. AFTER IT HAVING COST US, THE FARMERS IN THE TAXPAYERS, OVER 24 BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP THE LOSSES TO THE FARMERS, I DON'T BEGRUDGE THAT BECAUSE OF HIS TERRIBLE POLICY. WE SPENT SO MUCH MORE MONEY ON BAILING OUT THE FARMERS BECAUSE OF HIS GOT AWFUL POLICY AND NOT LEAVING THEM HOLE AT THE END OF THE DAY ANYWAY. THEN, WE DID THE BAILOUT GENERAL MOTORS IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, SO THE IDEA THAT LOTS OF TIMES WHEN THINGS AFFECT OUR STATE AND A COMES IN WE THINK, THAT DOESN'T COST ANYTHING, WILL COST TAXPAYERS AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE 24 BILLION DOLLARS HERE BUT ALSO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SO, IT IS LEFT FARMERS IN A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION. AND LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE WITH ETHANOL. WE SPEND 100 MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT GAS PUMPS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO BE ABLE TO CARRY ETHANOL GASOLINE WITH ETHANOL. OKAY? SO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION. 100 MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT DOES HE DO? MADE A DEAL WITH EGGS ON THE BREAK THE DEAL. LOOK HOW MANY OF THE PLANTS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN. THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE MAKING 15 DOLLARS AN HOUR. THIS IS FARMERS BEING ABLE TO SELL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CORN FOR THIS ETHANOL, REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE FACTORIES THAT PRODUCE THIS, THEY'RE MAKING ABOUT 45 TO 50 DOLLARS AN HOUR. THEY ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS, WITH BENEFITS BEYOND IT, IT IS RAISE THE ECONOMY OF IOWA, INITIALLY, PEOPLE BEGINNING TO MAKE AND RURAL AREAS A GOOD, DECENT SALARY SO, INTENT STEADFAST DOING WHAT WE DID, WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THE FARMERS WITH REGARD TO ETHANOL AND SO THEY LOST, THINGS WE SHOULD BE INVESTING MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY IN AMERICAN FARMERS AND LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IOWA, RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. GO ON JOE BIDEN .COM AND LOOK AT MY AGRICULTURE SLASH ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN. WE SHOULD BE PAYING FARMERS, NUMBER ONE, TO PUT MORE LAND IN CONSERVATION. WE SHOULD BE PAYING, THEM PAY THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR DOING THIS, IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCT, THEY ARE TAKING A MARKET TO SELL. WE ALSO SHOULD BE PAYING FARMERS TO TRANSFER A LOT OF THEIR LAND THAT THEY HAVE INTO CARBON ABSORPTION. TAKING THE ROOT OF PLANTS, BEING ABLE TO DRAW CARBON OUT OF THE YEAR THAT DOES NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH BUT IT IS BURIED BENEATH THE SOIL AND DOES NOT CAUSE ANY OF THE GLOBAL WARMING. AND IT SHOULD BE PAID FOR. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PUT FARMERS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY AND DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY IN THE CITIES, EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY ALL OVER THE WORLD AND SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND ON CHINA WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH CHINA AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO OUR ECONOMY, THEY ARE STEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THEY'RE DEMANDING IT BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A 51% CHINESE BUSINESS PARTNER WHICH MEANS, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL YOUR TRADE SECRETS AND IT MEANS THAT OVER TIME, THEY WILL JUST STOP US UP WHAT WE HAVE. WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY. CHINA IS NOW A 5G COUNTRY. THEY ARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HIGH TECH MATERIAL. WE ARE NOT MAKING THE SAME INVESTMENTS HERE, AND WE ARE GETTING A 1.9 TRILLION DOLLAR TAX, CUT MOST OF WHICH IS GOING TO THE TOP 2%. BUT THEY DON'T NEED. IT THEY ARE JUST. WHY THEY HAVE FORUMS, THEY CAN KEEP ALL FOUR OF IT. SO, LOOK, FOLKS. THE LAST POINT I WILL MAKE, I WAS GOING TO GET INTO THIS BUT I WILL JUST FOR A SECOND NOW, YOU TALK ABOUT TAXES. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME TO SAY THIS, WHOEVER OUR NOMINEE IS, IS AUTHENTIC,, STRAIGHTFORWARD TELLS THE TRUTH WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO, DO WHAT IT'S GONNA COST HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. NOW, WHEN I TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH PROVIDING HEALTH CARE WITH EVERYBODY, I TALK ABOUT BUILDING ON THE OBAMACARE WHICH I HELPED PASS FOR THE PRESIDENT, ADDING THE PUBLIC OPTION, ADDING A PUBLIC OPTION, IF THERE IS A MEDICARE LIKE OPTION AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZING AND MAKING IT CHEAPER TO BUY IN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, IF YOU IN FACT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID UNDER GOVERNORS REALLY SCREWED THAT UP IN THIS STATE, WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE LIKE OPTIONS. THAT COST A LOT OF MONEY. MY PLAN COST, TO DO, THAT ABOUT 740 BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. I MAKE ONE CHANGE TO PAY FOR IT ALL AND I'LL GET REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THIS ONE AND THAT IS THAT WE TAKE , WE TALK TO CAPITAL GAINS AT THE INCOME TAX DOUBT SO, RIGHT NOW, CAPITAL GAINS TAXES 20%. NO MATTER HOW MUCH , WHATEVER YOU TALK STRUCTURE IS. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE, IF WE TALK TO REWARD HIM WHERE THEY'RE NOT JUST WELL, WHY SHOULD YOUR SECRETARY, IF YOU ARE MILLIONAIRE, PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING? IF YOU DID JUST THAT, THE TAX RATE IS 30%, CAPITAL, GAINS TO GIVE 30%, I'M GOING TO RAISE IT THE 39.6% WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE HIGHEST RATE, ATOP, RATE YOU PAY 39.6%. YOU SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THAT RAISES? 800 BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S DOING THAT. I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF AMERICA, DELAWARE, MORE CORPORATIONS THERE THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE, REALLY, TRULY, NOW, TAX RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 20%. BARACK AND I THOUGHT IT COULD BE REDUCED TO 24 36%, BUT IF WE RAISE IT TO 20%, AND BY, THE WAY NUMBER TO PAY ANY TAX AT ALL, THAT RAISES 730 BILLION DOLLARS. CORPORATE AMERICA IS HAVING THE BEST RUN OF THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. DON'T PUNISH, THEM TO START TO PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE AND IF YOU PUT A MINIMUM TAX ON CORPORATIONS, YOU HAVE, AMAZON A BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION, THEY PAY ZERO. NOTHING. NOT A SINGLE SENT. NOT A SINGLE CENT BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SO MANY LOOPHOLES. WELL, IF WE JUST MAKE SURE THE CORPORATIONS AREN'T PAYING, ANYTHING PAID A MINIMUM OF 15%, NO MATTER WHAT EXEMPTIONS THEY HAVE, IF YOU 15%, THAT RAISES A TOTAL OF 400 400 BILLION DOLLARS NO. THESE ARE THINGS THAT EVEN REPUBLICAN THE RESERVE AGAINST. I ASK A REPUBLICAN NEIGHBORS WHETHER WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT REDUCING DRUG PRICES. MY GUESS IS , I GUESS IS NO, THEY WON'T, SAY WE'D LIKE THE HIGH, PRICES LET'S KEEP IN THAT, WAY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUADRUPLE OR TRIPLE WHATEVER THE DRUG PRICE FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT CHANGED SO, FOLKS, HERE IS THE DEAL. WE CAN PROVIDE FOR, WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY JUST A RATIONAL TAX POLICY BASED ON THE RIDICULOUS CHANGES THIS PRESIDENT MADE TAX POLICY. WE CAN PAY FOR EVERYTHING FROM EDUCATION STRAIGHT THROUGH TO DEALING WITH WOBBLE WARMING AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. LAST EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE IS A PROFESSOR. SHE'S AN EDUCATOR. SHE IS TAUGHT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL INITIATIVES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND BY THE WAY, I GET SO TIRED OF THE MAIL COMING, DOCTOR AND JOE BIDEN THAT WHEN I LEFT THE VICE PRESIDENCY, I BECAME A FULL PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA BUT GUESS, WHAT IS STILL CAME DOCTOR AND JOE BIDEN, NOTHING CHANGED, BUT AS JILL SAID, NO, JOKE, SHE SAYS ANY COUNTRY WITH EDUCATION IS GOING TO COMPETE US. WELL, LOOK, YOU HAVE, WHY SHOULD A CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN DEPEND ON WHAT IS IT COULD THEY COME FROM, THEY LIVE IN. SO, IF YOU DID ONE THING, AND THIS IS NOT EVEN A BIG TICKET ITEM IN TERMS OF A TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET, IF YOU JUST TOOK WHAT THEY CALLED TITLE I, SCHOOLS SCHOOLS THAT ARE SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT HAVE A HIGH TAX BASE AND CANNOT PROVIDE A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY TEACHERS OR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS, OKAY, IF YOU JUST TOOK THIS THING CALLED TITLE ONE PROGRAM PROVIDES BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THIS A LONG TIME AGO, 15 BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA THAT CAN BE SPREAD AROUND THESE TITLE I SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN RURAL AREAS A LOT AS WELL AS IN URBAN AREAS, NOW, IF YOU CHANGE THAT FROM 15 TO 45 BILLION, YOU TRIPLE IT OVER THE PERIOD, WHAT HAPPENS? YOU'RE ABLE TO BEGIN TO PAY EVERY TEACHER IN THESE SCHOOLS THAT COMPETITIVE WAGE FOR TEACHERS IN THE HIGHER PRICE SCHOOLS. WHY? IF YOU HAVE A SON OR DAUGHTER OR ANY OF YOU ARE IN EDUCATOR, WHEN YOU GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL YOU GOT YOUR DEGREE AND, IF YOU GRADUATED MAGNET COME LOUDLY YOU STARTED OFF WITH 23.5% LESS SALARY THAN EVERYONE ELSE GRADUATING EXCEPT IN THE ONE AREA MY DAUGHTER WENT AND GOT HER MASTERS DEGREE IN AND THAT IS DEALING WITH SOCIAL WHERE WELFARE ISSUES YOU KNOW, ANYWAY, I WISH I HAD ONE REPUBLICAN KID. I'M ONLY KIDDING. BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, WHY SHOULD THAT BE? NOW, RIGHT NOW WE ARE 115,000 TEACHERS SHORT IN AMERICA IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT IS PREDICTED TO GO TO AT LEAST 230, TO MATCH 270 BY 2005. OKAY. 2025. WHY IS THAT? THE BABY BOOMERS ARE LEAVING TEACHING. NO ONE IS WILLING TO GO INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM BECAUSE THE SALARY IS SO LOW SO, IF YOU DID BUT I SUGGESTED YOU COULD RAISE SALARIES TO MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE AND AFTER TEN YEARS YOU'D BE MAKING 60,000 DOLLARS A YEAR AS A TEACHER, NUMBER ONE, AND NUMBER TWO IT WOULD DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. YOU KNOW HOW MANY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WE HAVE? NOW WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS. 1570 KIDS. ALL OF THE EXPERTS SAY IT SHOULD BE DOWN CLOSE TO ONE TO 500, OR THE HIGHEST, ONE TO 700. WE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL NURSES IN OUR SCHOOLS. NUMBER THREE, WE WOULD DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN OUR SCHOOLS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT COME FROM HOME BUT HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, EVERY SINGLE CHILD AGED THREE, FOUR AND FIVE WOULD GO TO SCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, SCHOOL. NORMAL SCHOOL. NO, EVERYONE IN UNIVERSITIES IN NEIGHBORING STATES, NEBRASKA POINT OUT AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THIS IS ALL DOWN IN THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF STUDY, IF IN FACT YOU HAD SOMEONE GOING TO SCHOOL NO MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND, NO MATTER HOW POOR THE FAMILY WAS,, STARTING AT AGE THREE, YOU INCREASE BY OVER 55% CHANCE THAT THEY WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF HIGH SCHOOL, THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND MAYBE BEYOND WITHOUT GETTING ANY TROUBLE. WHY IS IT NOT EVERYBODY'S INTEREST? EVERYBODY'S INTEREST? SUPER WEALTHY PEOPLE'S INTEREST, POOR FOLKS INTEREST, THAT WE HAVE KIDS BEING ABLE TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH AND LEARN AS MUCH, AND LAST THING IN THESE TITLE I SCHOOLS, AS REQUIRED WHEN WE GET THIS PASSED IS WE PROVIDE ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES, WELL, WE STARTED WITH THE PREJUDICE THAT A KID COMING OUT OF A VERY POOR FAMILY AND THAT SMART CAN'T DO THAT WELL. GUESS, WHAT IF THEY ARE EXPOSED STARTING AT AGE THREE TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER VOCABULARY, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING ANY OTHER KID CAN DO AND SO WE SHOULD PROVIDE FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES FOR THOSE WHO WANT THOSE COURSES. THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO AND THAT COST ANOTHER 30 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE SPENDING ON THINGS THAT DON'T MATTER. IF WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE A TAX BREAK FOR RESOURCES, WHY CAN'T WE GIVE A TAX BREAK FOR , ANYWAY. SO, I'M BREAKING MY RULE. MY STAFF I, COULD SEE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES. THE PLANE IS LEAVING, JOE, YOU KNOW, BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. THE ONLY POINT I WANT TO MAKE, FOLKS, THERE IS NO REASON, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TODAY THAN I EVER WAS. I'LL DO IT WHEN WE FINISH, OKAY? THAT WILL STICK AROUND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND SHAKE HANDS BUT THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE BETTER POSITION THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. OUR WORKERS ARE LIBERAL THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN AMERICA THEN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED AND EVERY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN SOCIETY HAS COME OUT OF THIS RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES A YOU OWN THEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THEM. THEY GET MONETIZED BY CORPORATIONS, WHICH IS, OKAY BUT YOU OWN THEM. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE , IF WE INVEST IN OURSELVES AGAIN, WE WILL REMAIN. THAT WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD, AND IT IS BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT IS A LOT HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN ADDITION TO, THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS LOOKING HOPING AND PRAYING TO GOD WE WILL COME BACK BECAUSE I, SAID THE WORLD IS NOT SO GALVANIZING AND IF WE DON'T ORGANIZE, IT IF I GUYS WILL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH. I LOVE THE IDEA AS AN EDUCATOR 50 YEARS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO TEACHERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE COME THE END OF THIS ELECTION. I WANT TO TALK TO THE ISLANDS IN THE ROOM FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES. WE HAVE A PRETTY IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE SIGNED A COMMITTEE CAUCUS CARD FOR JOE BIDEN AND WHY MY HUSBAND, FORMER GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY, HAS SIGNED A CARD AS WELL. HE WOULD LOVE TO BE HERE TONIGHT BUT HE WILL BE WITH US TOMORROW, BUT I AM SPEAKING FOR BOTH OF US. WE HAVE KNOWN JOE AND JOE BIDEN FOR 33 YEARS. WE TRUST THEM AS MUCH TODAY AS WE DID 33 YEARS AGO. WE WERE ROCK-SOLID, THEN THEY ARE ROCK-SOLID NOW, AND THAT IS WHY WE BOTH , WILL STAND NEXT TO , IN THE IOWA CAUCUS. I ASKED MYSELF WHAT I WANT FROM THE SELECTION AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP ANY , EVERY MORNING AS AN EDUCATOR COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER AND GO ABOUT MY WORK KNOWING THAT THE PERSON WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND HIS STAFF HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE DOMESTIC FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES THAT WILL FACE US IN THE YEARS TO COME. THAT EXPERIENCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I ALSO WANT TO GET EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH CONGRESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, WITH FOREIGN LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO SOLVE THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES THAT WILL FACE US AND I WANT TO GET UP EVERY MORNING KNOWING THAT I CAN AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES INTO MY CLASSROOM OR DO MY GRANDCHILDREN CLASSROOM AND THEY WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE THEM THERE AND HE WOULD REPRESENT THE VALUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT AS AMERICANS. DORIS CURRENTS GOODWIN WHO WAS A SCHOLAR PRESIDENT SAYS THE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS AND GOOD PRESIDENTS ARE RESILIENCE AND COMPASSION. JOE BIDEN HAS BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TOM AND I LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE, ALL OF, YOU MANY OF YOU REACHED OUT TO US BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR OUR FAMILY. JOE AND JOE BIDEN REACHED OUT TO US, TO OUR SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW, TO OUR EXTENDED FAMILY, AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT HE AND EVERY SHOE AS WELL, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO INTO A ROOM LIKE THIS AND I'VE BEEN A LOT OF THEM WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLITICIANS, YOU CAN'T GO INTO A ROOM WITH JOE BIDEN WHERE HE ISN'T STANDING SOMEPLACE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERING AND SHOWING THE COMPASSION THAT HE IS SO WELL-KNOWN FOR. I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO HAVE SUFFERED, AND HE CERTAINLY KNOWS WHAT IS LIKE TO SEND A CHILD OFF TO WAR, THE, MILITARY HE KNOWS WHAT IT LIKE TO HAVE LOST A VERY BELOVED FAMILY MEMBER, AND YOU CAN GO TO A SITUATION ANY PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY INCOME FOR PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED LAW SO AS I WENT ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THIS DECISION THAT I HAVE TO MAKE, I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH, PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE FROM HERE, TO GET THERE. I THOUGHT OF IT ALL THE CHILDREN, THE EIGHT CRITICIZE HOT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE STUDENTS AT THE SMALL COLLEGE IN MOUNT PLEASANT. I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GONNA SHOW UP THE CAUCUS, MAY VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING A CANDIDATE THAT THEY CAN VOTE FOR IN NOVEMBER. SO, WHERE I COME, FROM IF I DID NOT HAVE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY FRIENDS IT ALSO I TRY TO THINK OF WHO IS MY FAVORITE REPUBLICAN, WE ARE MY FAVORITE INDEPENDENTS, WHO ARE THE PEOPLE LIVE COPY FOR THAT I CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T AGREE POLITICALLY AND WHAT CANDIDATE IS GOING TO BE BEST NOT ONLY TO BE DONALD TRUMP BUT WILL PROVIDE A PERSON THAT THEY COULD ACCEPT AND THEY COULD WALK INTO THE VOTING BOOTHS NO VOTE FOR SO, WHEN WE WERE TALKING A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO TALKING TO FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND I NOTICE THE MY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP WAS IN THE BACK ROW, AND SHE IS A LIFELONG REPUBLICAN, AS IS HER HUSBAND AND SHE CAME UP AFTERWARDS SHE SAID, I'M THAT PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I CAN'T VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP, BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOMEBODY THAT I CAN VOTE FOR, SOMEBODY WHO IS A MODERATE, WHO WILL APPEAL ACROSS PARTY LINES AND IN, FACT EVERY ROOM I'VE BEEN IN SAYS THAT WHEN IT IS OVER AND WALKING THE LINE AND TALKING TO, PEOPLE SOMEBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE IS ONE OF THOSE AS WELL. I JUST MET A FORMER LEGISLATOR WHO SPOKE WITH TOM, WHO SERVED WITH TOM ON THE LEGISLATURE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHO SAYS HE WILL CAUCUS FOR JOE BIDEN ON MONDAY SO I HOPE THAT YOU AS WELL PUT ON YOUR PRACTICAL IOWA HATS AND THINK ABOUT WHO IS THAT PERSON WHO IS GOING TO APPEAL THE MOST PEOPLE, BECAUSE TOM AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT PERSON IS JOE BIDEN AND WE HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US AND TALKING FOR HIM ON MONDAY AND VOTING FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SANTA CAUCUS CARD. PLEASE SIGN A CAUCUS CARD. COME ON MONDAY.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?468675-1/joe-biden-campaign-event-council-bluffs-iowa	Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, campaigned in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

CSPANJB12202042	Joe Biden	2020-02-01	Joe Biden Caucus Rally in Waterloo, Iowa	"AT THIS POINT, I'M STILL UNDECIDED, BUT I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT LEANING TOWARDS TRUMP. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE OUT THERE THAT IS BEING TRUTHFUL AND HONEST. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT GIVING EVERYBODY FREE THIS AND FREE THAT. IN IOWA, THERE IS NOTHING FREE. YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING YOU GET. IT IS TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALIZED THAT. AND THE SCHAMA POLITICS THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING ON MY THINK IT HURTS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT IS GREAT TO BE JOINED BY THEM AND TO KNOW THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE BACK OF OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT, BEFORE I INTRODUCE HIM, I JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL SAY THANK YOU. IT IS AN HONOR TO GET TO BE YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN AND BE ONE OF THE FIRST CONGRESSWOMEN EVER ELECTED FROM THE STATE OF IOWA, ALONG WITH CINDY IN IOWA THREE. IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR EVERY SINGLE DAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH. IT IS ALSO IN HONOR OF MIND TO GET TO ENDORSE AND SUPPORT AND CAUCUS ON MONDAY NIGHT FOR JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, TO KNOW WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR ME, YOU GUYS HAVE TO KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM. SOME OF YOU DO. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE WAY I GREW UP HERE IN IOWA, THAT THIS MAN HAS MY SUPPORT. YOU SEE, I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF DUBUQUE. IT HAS MORE COWS THAN PEOPLE. MY DAD WAS A UNION PIPEFITTER WELDER. MY MOM WAS A SCHOOL SECRETARY. THERE WERE FOUR KIDS AND MY FAMILY, AND WE WERE ALL FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GRADUATES. [APPLAUSE] GROWING UP HERE IN IOWA AND IN THIS COUNTRY, WE WERE NEVER PROMISED IT WAS GOING TO BE EASY , BUT WE WERE PROMISED THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN MAKE IT. THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD, AND THAT IS WHAT WE WERE PROMISED, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR AND WHAT WE KNOW JOE BIDEN, AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, WILL THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE FIRST TIME I MET THE VICE PRESIDENT, IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY GRANDFATHER, WHO WAS A FIREFIGHTER. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A GUY WHO I LOOKED UP TO MY WHOLE LIFE. ONE DAY, IN 2007, I HAD BEEN HAPPY TO WORK DOWN AT THE STATEHOUSE AS A PAGE AT THE TIME. I WAS AN 18-YEAR-OLD. YOU GUYS REMEMBER 2007, WHEN WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES RUNNING, BUT I DID NOT KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE RACE AND ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I DID NOT KNOW WHY MY GRANDFATHER WAS CALLING ME AND TELLING ME I HAD TO GO LISTEN TO THIS SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. HE TOLD ME, I'M TELLING YOU, THIS JOE BIDEN, HE GETS IT. HE UNDERSTANDS OUR FAMILY, AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO LISTEN TO HIM. I SAID ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO, PAPA. THERE I GO, INTO THIS ROOM, THE IOWA CAUCUS ROOM. BOB, I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE THAT DAY. I GO INTO THIS IOWA CAUCUS ROOM, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DID NOT KNOW WHO JOE BIDEN WAS WHEN HE WALKED IN, BUT I SURE AS HECK NEW WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WALKED OUT. [APPLAUSE] HE'S THE GUY THAT UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE AND WHAT IT MEANT FOR ME TO HAVE GROWN UP IN IOWA AS A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD TO HAVE HER DAD'S BUSINESS AGENTS NAME MEMORIZED, BECAUSE WHEN THAT NAME SHOWED UP ON CALLER ID, IT MEANT MY DAD HAD A JOB. HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT FOR FAMILIES WHEN THAT NAME WAS NOT SHOWING UP VERY OFTEN, AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR KITCHEN TABLES AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. HE ALSO KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD THE DIGNITY OF WORK, LIKE MY DAD, WHO HAD WORKED 16 HOUR SHIFTS AND WOULD GET HOME AND LITERALLY WRING THE SWEAT OUT OF HIS BELT. HE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT FOR MY FAMILY. HE UNDERSTOOD IT AND FOUGHT FOR FOLKS WHO GREW UP JUST LIKE ME, JUST LIKE US HIS ENTIRE CAREER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE OTHER THING THAT HE KNEW WAS PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE DIGNITY AND DECENCY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. YOU SEE, JOE BIDEN REMINDS ME A LOT OF MY GRANDFATHER IN WAYS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE. TO ME, MY GRANDFATHER WAS THE GUY WHO TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT IT. HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER, AND FOR ME, OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE ACTUALLY MEANS MAMA BECAUSE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WOULD GET A CALL TO RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING, HE DID NOT CALL BACK AND ASKED, WHAT COLOR IS YOUR SKIN, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE, WHERE YOU FROM, WHO DO YOU LOVE, WHAT'S YOUR RELIGION? HE JUST SHOWED UP AND HELPED PEOPLE AND DID HIS JOB. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE KIND OF JOB WE HAVE SEEN FROM VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THAT IS THE KIND OF JOB WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SEE RIGHT NOW IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE REASONS ARE WHY I DECIDED TO SUPPORT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT IT BECAME EVEN MORE CLEAR WHY HE HAS MY SUPPORT THREE WEEKS AGO, AFTER I ENDORSED. WE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER ON A BUS. WHEN YOU ARE GETTING AROUND IOWA, YOU GUYS KNOW YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, SO WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO CATCH UP. ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY , WE REALLY CONNECTED ON, THE FACT THAT WE WERE ELECTED TO FEDERAL OFFICE AT THE AGE OF 29. I KNOW IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I WAS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST WOMEN EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT FOR JOE BIDEN ALSO TO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE AT 29. WE TALKED ABOUT YES, WHEN YOU GET ELECTED AT A YOUNG AGE, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO LEARN ON THE JOB. MAKE SURE YOU HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE, GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, THEY WILL QUESTION. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT, BUT ALSO, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT, IT HIT, MY GOSH, NOT ONLY WAS HE ELECTED TO FEDERAL OFFICE AT 29, YOUNGER THAN I AM STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW, BUT HE ALSO AT THAT TIME SUFFERED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES MOST OF US CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. AT THE AGE OF 29, AFTER GETTING ELECTED, HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS BABY DAUGHTER AND HIS SON, CRITICALLY INJURED. I THINK WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT OATH, THE SAME OATH I TOOK, RAISING YOUR HAND, PLEDGING TO FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION, WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT, STANDING IN THAT HOSPITAL ROOM WITH HIS TWO BOYS, KNOWING THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET ON A TRAIN EVERY NIGHT TO GO BACK AND FORTH, THAT HE DID NOT DO THIS AND DID NOT GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS FANCY OR HE WAS GOING TO BECOME SOME CELEBRITY. HE DID IT AFTER EVERYTHING HE HAD BEEN THROUGH, KNOWING THAT HIS COUNTRY DID NOT OWN HIM ANYTHING, BUT HE STILL OWED SOMETHING TO HIS COUNTRY, TO HIS COMMUNITY, AND TO HIS FAMILY. HE TOOK THAT OATH WITH EYES WIDE OPEN. THAT'S THE CHARACTER, THOSE ARE THE VALUES, THAT THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT CAN'T CONTEND WITH AND IS TERRIFIED TO FACE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN AND THAT CHARACTER AND THOSE VALUES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE DEPENDS ON IT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THAT LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP SO THAT WE CAN WIN BACK THAT STATEHOUSE, SO THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK THE U.S. SENATE SEAT, AND THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS SEAT BLUE AND TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU WORK WITH ME HERE, YOU GET OUT THERE ON MONDAY NIGHT LIKE I'M GOING TO GET OUT THERE, YOU MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR FRIENDS, YOU BRING YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU BRING YOUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU BRING, BUT GET OUT THERE AND CAUCUS, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING. WE NEED YOU TO DO THAT JOB ON MONDAY NIGHT. I PROMISE I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER I CAN, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, IOWA IS MY HOME, AND THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. AND WE NEED JOE BIDEN, HIS CHARACTER, AND HIS VALUES TO TAKE IT BACK. THANK YOU. [VIDEO CLIP] IT'S SAID AND HEAR YOUR CHARACTER IS REVEALED. , IN HERE YOUR CHARACTER IS REVEALED. WE SIDE WITH OBAMA, WE SEE IT WITH TROUT, BUT IT IS IN LIFE WHAT YOUR CHARACTER IS FOR, WHERE YOU ARE FROM, WHO YOU GREW UP WITH, AND WHO YOU LOVE. HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TESTED. WHAT YOU'VE OVERCOME. HOW YOU STEP UP, AND WHAT YOU DO WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF. WHERE YOU'VE LED. WHAT YOU'VE DONE. AND WHAT YOU WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TO DO. WHO YOU STAND WITH, AND WHO YOU FIGHT FOR. CHARACTER MATTERS. MAYBE MORE HERE THAN ANYWHERE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN! (music) (music) VICE PRES. BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE MAKING ME A HERO IN FRONT OF MY FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS. THESE ARE THE LOVES OF MY LIFE. THIS IS MY NUMBER THREE GRANDDAUGHTER, MAISIE, A FRESHMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. SHE WAS TO TEAM ALL STATE AND HIGH SCHOOL, WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS BECAUSE SHE SAID, I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY UNTIL I KNOW I CAN DO THE WORK. SHE REALLY DISAPPOINTED , SHE ONLY GOT A 3.9. GOD LOVE HER. THIS IS MY NUMBER TWO GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN BIDEN. I COLOR MY SECRET WEAPON. , CALL HER MY SECRET WEAPON. SHE HAS BEEN COMPETING WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME. SHE'S A JUNIOR, AN HONORS STUDENT. SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT ME. THIS IS BEAU BIDEN'S DAUGHTER. SHE'S ONLY IN NINTH GRADE. THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE I WANT SECRET SERVICE AGAIN, SO THEY TRAVEL WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES. [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. BIDEN: AND THIS IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY LOVE. THIS IS MY OLDEST GRANDDAUGHTER, NAMED AFTER MY DECEASED DAUGHTER NAOMI. SHE IS A SENIOR AT COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL, AND SHE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HER POP AT HIS OLD AGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THAT'S VERY NICE. YOU ARE CHARLOTTE? HOW OLD ARE YOU? SEVEN YEARS OLD. CHARLOTTE THREW ME A BEAUTIFUL SIGN THAT SAYS ""GO JOE BIDEN."" THANK YOU, BABY. I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: FUTURE PRESIDENT. I'LL VOTE FOR YOU. I'LL REMEMBER YOU WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT AND THEY SAY THERE IS AN OLD GUY OUTSIDE NAMED JOE BIDEN WHO USED TO BE PRESIDENT, PROMISE YOU WON'T SAY JOE WHO, OK? WILL YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME? THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, HONEY. IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO BE BACK IN WATERLOO. I WANT TO START BY THANKING BOB, YOUR REPRESENTATIVE, FOR ENDORSING ME. THERE'S BOB RIGHT HERE. BOB ENDORSED ME, WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, FRANKLY. HE SAID, WHEN I ENDORSE YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO, RIGHT? I SAID YEAH, WIN. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A LOT OF ROADS AND BRIDGES WHEN WE GET THIS DONE. AND KRISTI BILL SACK HAS BECOME A GREAT FRIEND, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. SHE HAS TRAVELED ALL OVER THE STATE FOR ME. WE PROBABLY PUT IN WELL OVER A THOUSAND MILES AROUND THE STATE AND HAVE BEEN TO ABOUT 23 COUNTIES WITH ME, HELPING ME OUT. TOM AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. WE HAVE WIVES THAT ARE BETTER LOOKING AND SMARTER THAN WE ARE. TOM, THANK YOU, PAL. TOM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE IN HIS SUPPORT ME. , HIS SUPPORT FOR ME. I WILL JUST SAY THIS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT WOULD GIVE ME SOME SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES, FROM TAKING CARE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, WHICH WAS OVER $900 BILLION, AND HE GAVE ME PRESIDENTIAL POWERS WHEN I DID IT. HE HAD MANY OTHER THINGS HE HAD TO DO, WHETHER I WAS DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN AT OUR BORDER AND GOING DOWN TO CENTRAL AMERICA TO TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT, ETC. BUT I WAS ABLE TO TASK ANYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP ME. ALTHOUGH TOM WAS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE , THAT'S A GOOD KID, I LIKE THAT , [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. BIDEN: ALTHOUGH HE WAS SEC. OF AGRICULTURE, ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE THING I NEEDED HELP ON, I WENT TO TOM. TOM, THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD FRIEND, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. TOM IS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST GUYS I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. HE DOES SO MUCH. IT WAS THE SINGLE BEST DECISION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE IN TERMS OF A CABINET. THANK YOU, TOM. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PRESIDENT FINKENAUER REMEMBERS ME WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT. TALK ABOUT TALENT. YOU HAVE ELECTED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WOMEN TO CONGRESS FROM THIS STATE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, INCLUDING NOT JUST ABBY, BUT ASHLEY MIGHT YOU HAVE JUST DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB , NOT JUST ABBY, BUT , YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. ABBY HAS BEEN WITH ME ALL OVER THE STATE AND IS A GREAT FRIEND AND A GREAT ASSET. SHE WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE TOOK BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ALONG WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AXNE. WE HAVE A TALENTED GROUP OF MEMBERS IN THE NEWLY ELECTED 201819 THAT WE HAVE HAD. I HAVE CAMPAIGN FOR A LOT OF CANDIDATES IN MY CAREER, BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT CONTRADICTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE TALENTED CLASS OF CANDIDATES I HAVE WORKED FOR THAN THE CLASS THAT GOT ELECTED IN 2018. 37 OF THE PEOPLE I WENT OUT WITH WHERE WOMEN, AND THEY ARE REALLY GOOD. FULKS, I WANT TO , FOLKS, I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL FOR BEING A PART OF THE TEAM AND HELPING CARRY ME ALONG HERE. FOLKS, EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS HERE IN IOWA. YOU SET IN MOTION A NATION. IT IS ALWAYS A BIG RESPONSE ABILITY, BUT IT IS ALWAYS A BIGGER RESPONSIBILITY THAN ANY TIME ANY OF YOU PARTICIPATED. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING MORE BECAUSE ANYBODY ELSE IS RUNNING. IT'S BECAUSE OF WHO IS PRESIDENT. AND WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE IS KNOWN ON JANUARY 20, 2021 AS FORMER PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I REALLY DO BELIEVE THIS YEAR THAT THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES IS ON THE BALLOT. I WROTE AN ARTICLE, WHAT GOT ME INTO THE RACE, IN 2017 WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION. CARRYING TORCHES, COMING OUT OF THE FIELD, THEIR VEINS BULGING. SCREAMING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS SCREAMED AND HOLLERED IN GERMANY IN THE 30'S, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS. A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS RESISTING THIS HATE WAS KILLED. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, DONALD TRUMP, WAS ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE CONFLICT. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT. I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR ATLANTIC MAGAZINE THAT THE TIME SAYING THAT THE SOUL OF THE NATION IS AT RISK, AND I MEANT IT. WASN'T HYPERBOLE. IT'S THE REASON I FINALLY DECIDED TO RUN. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS LATER CAME TO ME, NOT A JOKE, AND SUGGESTED THAT I HAD TO RUN. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE AN UGLY CAMPAIGN. DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BE CAUGHT UP IN IT. THEY CAME TO SEE ME. WE HAVE A TRADITION. YOU CAN ASK FOR A FAMILY MEETING, AND IT IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IF ANY KID ASKS FOR A FAMILY MEETING. I GOT A CALL FROM NAOMI. THE ONLY ONE MISSING IS MY GRANDSON, HE IS IN EIGHTH GRADE. THEY CAME AND SAID I HAD TO RUN. IT'S GOING TO BE BAD, BUT WE HAVE TO RUN. THEIR WHOLE LIFE, THE FATHER HAS BEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL, GRANDFATHER U.S. SENATOR, VICE PRESIDENT. THEY KNOW THE UPS AND DOWNS THAT GO WITH THAT. I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. I THINK HARD ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND NOT DONE. JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. A LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT. WE LEARNED THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE U.S. MILITARY, DONALD TRUMP, MET WITH OUR FLAG OFFICERS AND GENERALS IN THE PENTAGON, AND TO THEIR FACE, CALLED THEM ""LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S EVER BEEN A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO HAS TALKED TO OUR WARRIORS THAT WAY EVER. THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, I AND MANY OTHERS PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THERE WOULD BE CONFLICT. INSTEAD OF AMERICA FIRST, IT BECAME AMERICA ALONE. OUR ALLIES WALKED AWAY, ENDED UP IN A CONFLICT THAT THINK GOD HAS NOT GONE BEYOND WHAT IT DID. REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED? YOU HAD THE IRANIANS SENDING MISSILES INTO THE AIR FORCE WHERE MY SON HAD BEEN IN IRAQ. IT TURNS OUT 64 OF THOSE WARRIORS ARE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHEN HE FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT? THAT IT'S NOT SERIOUS, JUST HEADACHES. THIS MAN DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THESE WARRIORS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF MY SON WAS STILL THERE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST WHETHER OR NOT I AGREE OR DON'T AGREE WITH HIS POLICIES. ALL KIDDING ASIDE. CAN ANYBODY THINK OF ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO THIS? OUR TROOPS DESERVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, NOT SOMEONE WHO BELITTLES THEM, BERATES THEM, AND DOESN'T SUPPORT THEM. TO STATE THE OBVIOUS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT A COUNTRY DIVIDED AND A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THERE IS NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE WHO CAN TAKE COMMAND OF OUR FORCES, WHO CAN REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE U.S. THE ENVY AND LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY MEAN THIS. I KNOW WHAT YOU ALL THOUGHT. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GET THIS BAD. I REALLY DIDN'T. I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS. I'M NOT BEING A WISE GUY. I'M BEING DEADLY EARNEST. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID RIGHT AFTER HE WAS ELECTED? THIS IS HARDER THAN WRITING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. BLESS ME, FATHER. SERIOUSLY. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. I SAID THIS MUST BE A JOKE. TURNS OUT IT IS A DIFFERENT JOKE. WE HAVE SO MUCH WE HAVE TO DO. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GETTING CRUSHED. I COME FROM FAMILIES JUST LIKE YOU DID. THREE BEDROOM SPLIT LIVER HOME , SPLIT LEVEL HOME, FOR KIDS. DAD TOOK THREE YEARS AFTER HE MOVED FROM SCRANTON TO FIND A JOB SO HE CAN BUY A HOUSE. WE WEREN'T POOR, BUT WE LIVED PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK. MY DAD STILL BELIEVED ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE. HE GOT ALL FOUR OF HIS KIDS TO COLLEGE. HE ALWAYS BELIEVED EVERYONE HAD A RIGHT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MIDDLE CLASS TODAY IS GETTING CRUSHED. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE WORLD. AND THE MIDDLE CLASS, OVER HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, THINK OF THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER LIVE TO HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAVE. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A LIFETIME OF ANYONE IN THIS ROOM, EVEN IF YOU ARE 100 YEARS OLD. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE. AS , WE HAVE TO REBUILD IT. THE MIDDLE CLASS WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOS, IT WAS BUILT I ORDINARY MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. GUESS WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S HOW IT GOT THERE. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE, THIS IS A FACT. THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED BEFORE. THIS TIME, YOU HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, BLACK, BROWN, THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, GAY, STRAIGHT, EVERYBODY HAS TO GET A CHANCE TO COME ALONG. BECAUSE IT IS WHO WE ARE, IT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A LEADER WHO NOT ONLY CAN UNITE OUR PARTY, WHICH HAS TO BE DONE, BUT UNITE THE COUNTRY. WE'RE A DEMOCRACY. NO DEMOCRACY CAN BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, NOT JUST INDEPENDENTS, BUT REPUBLICANS, AS WELL. A DEMOCRACY CAN'T FUNCTION WITHOUT A CONSENSUS. OTHERWISE, THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENS IS THE ABUSE OF POWER. ONE BRANCH CLAIMING POWER THAT IS BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY, BEYOND WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ELIGIBLE. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE U.S. SENATE, I WAS PROUD TO SERVE IN THAT ORGANIZATION. IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST HONORS OF MY LIFE READ BUT FOLKS, IT IS NOT THE CONGRESS I KNOW AND NOT THE SENATE I KNOW. YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS SAYING WHAT HE COMMITTED IS IMPEACHABLE, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DIVIDE THE COUNTRY MORE, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. OR YES, WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG, BUT IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING THROWN OUT OF OFFICE. I FIND THAT KIND OF FASCINATING. THE FACT IS THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON HAS ROLLED OVER IN HIS GRAVE. THE PHRASE I WANT TO READ TO YOU, GEORGE WASHINGTON IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS SAID ""AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS WILES OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE, THE JEALOUSY OF A FREE PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE CONSTANTLY AWAKE, SINCE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE PROVE THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL FOES A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT."" GEORGE WASHINGTON WARNED US AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WHAT DOES THIS SAY? IT SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS A LOT LESS GEORGE WASHINGTON THAN HE IS GEORGE WALLACE, THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. AND FOLKS, I FOUND IT FASCINATING. WHEN I TALK ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, , AND IF THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE THAT I'M RUNNING THE NOMINATION WITH, SEEKING THE NOMINATION, THEY SAY JOE USED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE PEOPLE TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, GIVE CONSENSUS, AND PAST OF THE VAC , VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, MADE SURE WE HAD THE RECOVERY ACT BY CONVINCING REPUBLICANS TO JOIN, $900 BILLION SPENT, LESS THAN .2% ACCORDING TO THE STUDIES. THEY WERE THE OLD DAYS. THREE YEARS AGO. AND THEY SAY , I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I KNOW THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY BETTER THAN ANYBODY. ME AND MY FAMILY HAVE IN THE OBJECT OF THEIR ATTENTION FOR THREE YEARS. AN OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PEOPLE HAVE SPENT OVER $12 MILLION TO $15 MILLION RUNNING NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST ME. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T EVEN CARRY THE ADS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FLAT OUT LIES. I WAS TOLD THERE WERE OVER 60, MAYBE IT WAS 80, I SAW IT IN A NEWS CLIP, REPUBLICANS COMING OUT TO THE CAUCUSES TO DETERMINE WHO WAS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE. SOMEONE WAS PROBABLY GOING TO STAND UP. THE LAST THREE EVENTS WE DID, SOMEONE FROM THAT GROUP STOOD UP AND STARTED TO SHOUT SOMETHING. IT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE IT'S OVER. AND IT IS KIND OF AMAZING. DID YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SENATOR SAID, JONI ERNST? ""IOWA CAUCUSES ARE THIS NEXT MONDAY, I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS DISCUSSION TODAY , WHERE THERE WERE GOING AFTER ME IN THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WITH LIES, ""THIS DECISION INFORMS AND INFLUENCES IOWA CAUCUS VOTERS. WILL THEY STILL SUPPORT JOE BIDEN AT THIS POINT."" [APPLAUSE] GOT TO GIVE HER CREDIT, SHE IS REALLY SUBTLE, ISN'T SHE? JUST READ THE WASHINGTON POST HEADLINE. IT SAID ""TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES TO ATTACK BIDEN AHEAD OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES."" PRETTY SIMPLE. I WONDER WHY THEY DON'T WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. I WONDER WHY HE'S SO CONCERNED. SHE KNOWS IF I'M THE NOMINEE, I WILL BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WITH THIS SAYS ABOUT THE THREAT TO THE NATION THAT EXISTS. CAN YOU EVER THINK OF A TIME, NOT ONLY IN THE CAUCUS HISTORY, BUT RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY, THE LAST 57-80 YEARS, WHERE A SITTING PRESIDENT HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER PARTY TRYING TO BECOME A NOMINEE. THERE MAY BE A TIME, I CAN'T THINK OF ANY TIME. A PRESIDENT DECIDING HE WANTS TO PICK WHO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WILL BE, OR AT LEAST WHO IT WON'T BE. NO MATTER HOW PERSONAL THE ATTACKS ARE ON ME AND MY SURVIVING SON, MY FAMILY AS A WHOLE, I CAN'T AFFORD TO HOLD GRUDGES. A PRESIDENT HAS TO NOT ONLY FIGHT, THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO HEAL. THIS NATION NEEDS HEALING. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY, THEY ARE ABOUT YOU. ABOUT YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WHAT'S NOT BEING DONE, AND HOW WHEN HE SAYS IN THESE AWFUL THINGS , NOT ABOUT ME ALONE, BUT ACROSS THE BOARD. THE LANGUAGE HE USES. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. MY DAD USED TO SAY, THERE IS SILENCE WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED, THAT'S COMPLICITY. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION BIGGER THAN WHETHER OR NOT A DEMOCRAT WINS. IT'S ABOUT WHERE WHETHER OR NOT WE RESTORE THE ESSENCE AND SOUL OF THE COUNTRY, WE ARE, WHAT WE STAND FOR. IT IS DOING US GREAT DAMAGE ACROSS THE WORLD AND AT HOME. AND AT HOME, IT IS WORSE. AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET, CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. I DO NOT BELIEVE AMERICA IS THAT DARK, ANGRY NATION WE SEE DONALD TRUMP TWEETING ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT THINKS IT'S OK TO PUT KIDS IN CAGES ON THE BORDER. I DON'T BELIEVE WERE A NATION THAT FEELS ABOUT THE INVASION OF PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH, THE MEXICAN RAPISTS COMING OUR WAY. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE WERE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACY AND HATE GROUPS, WHICH IS HAPPENING NOW. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT LACKS THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA SO OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL IN FIRST GRADE AND LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. IT IS IMMORAL. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR, WHAT HE BELIEVES, AND THE TERRIBLE THINGS HE SAYS, WHAT HE HAS DONE, WHAT I SEE AND I THINK IS WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS AS A NATION. DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LISTENING TO US. WHEN HE SAID THOSE THINGS ABOUT GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS, HE SHOT THE NATION AND ABSOLUTELY PERPLEXED THE WORLD. FOREIGN LEADERS WERE ASKING PUBLICLY, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT DAVID BROOKS WRITES, HE SAYS THERE IS AN INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS SOCIETIES UP. THAT FABRIC IS BEING RIPPED AND CUT BY THIS PRESIDENT, AND HAS TO BE AMENDED, RENDERED, FIXED, AND IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. IT IS MADE UP OF THE AMERICAN CODE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE, THE PEOPLE , WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT, WE NEVER FULLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT. IT IS PRETTY BASIC. IT IS ABOUT HONESTY. DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY. NOT BELITTLING PEOPLE WITH HANDICAPS, OR PROBLEMS THAT THEY CAN SOLVE BECAUSE OF THOSE PHYSICAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S ABOUT LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. IT'S ABOUT GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR, DEMONIZING NO ONE, LEADING BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE TO OUR POWER. AS RONALD REAGAN SAID, BEING THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL TO WHICH THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS TO FOR HOPE AND GIVES FROM, BECAUSE THEY THINK MAY, JUST MAYBE, IT IS A CODE, A UNIQUELY AMERICAN CODE. A COLD DONALD TRUMP DEMONSTRATED HE HAS NOT SUBSCRIBED TO. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN. THINK OF THE THINGS HE THINKS AS WEAKNESS, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DECENCY AND FAIRNESS, GIVING THE OTHER GUY A CHANCE, HE THINKS THAT SHOWS WEAKNESS. NOT A JOKE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO REACH OUT, GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT, HE THINKS IT IS WEAKNESS. YOU SHOULD BE STRONG, IT IS ABOUT YOURSELF. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE. IN MY VIEW, IT REALLY MATTERS. AMERICA IS UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD WHO HAS BEEN ORGANIZED ON AN IDEA. THINK ABOUT THIS GOING HOME, WITH YOUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, HUSBAND OR WIFE, WHOEVER YOU HAPPEN TO GO HOME WITH, HOW WILL YOU DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES BEING AN AMERICAN? DEFINE WHAT A FRENCHMAN IS, WHAT A KOREAN IS, WHAT A CHINESE PERSON IS, WHAT , YOU CAN DEFINE IT. IT IS EASILY BASED UPON THE NOTION OF ETHNICITY, RELIGION, OR TRIBE. HOW ARE WE DEFINED , HOW HAVE WE DEFINED WHAT AN AMERICAN IS? YOU CAN'T. BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIVERSE. BUT EVERY AMERICAN SIGNS ONTO IT, WHETHER THEY SAY IT THIS WAY OR NOT. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE THINK THE CONSTITUTION IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS, WE DON'T LIVE UP TO IT, BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, WE THE PEOPLE. MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY ARMY, ANY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD, IT IS BIGGER AND WIDER THAN THE OCEAN. IT IS MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN ANY GOVERNMENT. WE ARE UNIQUE IN THE WORLD. IF WE LET THIS CORROSIVE PROCESS CONTINUE, IT IS LIKE BATTERY ACID. I REALLY MEAN IT. I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. THINK OF WHAT IT DOES TO AMERICA. THE IDEA IS NOT AN IDEA, NOT AN IDEA DONALD TRUMP SHARES. THIS NATION NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST TO US ALL. STARTING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FIT , CONSEQUENTIAL THREAT THAT PLAGUES AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, HEALTH CARE, GUN POLICY, AND AN ECONOMY THAT BEGINS TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WHY SHOULD IT BE THAT A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WHO MAY BE A DECENT PERSON, WHY SHOULD THEY PAY AT A LOWER TAX RATE THAN THEIR SECRETARY SHOULD? WE CAN CHANGE THIS. THIS GOD-AWFUL TAX CUT HE PUT FORWARD, IT HELPS ONLY .2% , 2% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF WE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY PAYS THE SAME TAX ON THEIR CAPITAL GAINS AS WHETHER TAX RATE IS AND RAISE THE TAX RATE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS AT 49.6%, JUST DOING THAT ONE THING, PUNISHING NOBODY, IT RAISES $800 BILLION. IF WE JUST MADE SURE , I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF AMERICA, DELAWARE. IF WE JUST MADE CORPORATIONS PAY , MULTITRILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS PAY NO TAX AT ALL. IF YOU JUST SAID YOU HAD TO PAY A MINIMUM OF 50%, NO MATTER HOW MANY LOOPHOLES YOU HAVE, THAT WOULD RAISE ANOTHER $40 BILLION. IF YOU JUST SAID WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU PAY NOT 20%, BUT 28%, THAT RAISES ABOUT $750 BILLION. THERE PUNISHING NOBODY. JUST BEGIN TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. [APPLAUSE] MY CONCLUDING POINT IS THIS, TO DO ALL THIS, PROMISES AREN'T ENOUGH. THE OLD SAYING IS TALK IS CHEAP, WELL IN POLITICS, TALK IS SOMETIMES VERY EXPENSIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU TELL THEM YOU ARE GOING TO DO. DON'T YOU KIND OF FIND IT FASCINATING? GOOD PEOPLE ON OUR TEAM HAVE THESE INCREDIBLY GOOD IDEAS I WONDER WHY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO COST. TAKE MEDICARE FOR ALL. HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO COST IF WE GIVE ALL STUDENT DEBT. HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST GOING DOWN THE LIST. THE NUMBER ADDS UP ACCORDING TO THE SENIOR ECONOMISTS AS SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA OF $60 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THE ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS END UP NOT BEING STRAIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE WILL EAT YOU ALIVE. HE WILL LEAD US ALIVE. TELL IT STRAIGHT. TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST, WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. WE CAN HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE, FOR $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. WE CAN DEAL WITH EDUCATION. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS. HERE IS THE DEAL, WE HAVE THE LEVEL. EVERYONE IN THIS RACE TALKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE, BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY LAID INTO LAW OBAMACARE. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT. [APPLAUSE] NOW THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO, GET RID OF HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING YOUR GOVERNORS, NOW WE NEED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WANTED TO TAKE THE FIRST TIME, PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION. A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION THAT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR INSURANCE, YOU CAN'T, IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN GET THE MEDICARE OPTION. IF YOU QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, YOU AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL IN THE MEDICARE OPTION IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT. WE BRING DOWN DRUG PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY. NOT RAISING THE PRICE OF DRUGS BE ON THE COST OF MEDICAL INFLATION. IF YOU WANT PROGRESSIVE CHANGE ON HEALTH CARE, I WILL SAY IT TO YOU PLAINLY, I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH MORE THAN A PLAN, I HAVE A RECORD OF HAVING GOTTEN IT DONE. [APPLAUSE] EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT GUNS, I'M THE ONLY ONE NATIONALLY WHO HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN BIG RATIONAL GUN LEGISLATION PASSED. I'M THE GUY THAT PASSED THE BRADY BILL WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT GOT EVISCERATED LATER. ALONG WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN IN THE U.S. SENATE, WE GOT ASSAULT WEAPONS BANNED AND LIMITED THE NUMBERS OF ALL ITS YOU CAN HAVE IN A CLIP. WHO IN GOD'S NAME NEEDS 100 ROUNDS IN A CLIP? NOBODY. I HAVE A 20 GAUGE AND A 12 GAUGE, I'M NOT A HUNTER, BUT I SKEET SHOOT. MY SONS WERE DUCK HUNTERS. GEESE FLYING INTERNATIONALLY FROM CANADA DOWN, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE THREE SHELLS. WE PREDICT EAST BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE. WHY CAN WE HAVE THREE SHELLS VERSUS A SHOTGUN, WHEN YOU CAN HAVE 40, 50, 60, 200 ROUNDS. YOU SAW WITH THAT DATE IN LAS VEGAS. YOU SO WHAT IT'S DONE ACROSS THE NATION. I PROMISE YOU IF I AM YOUR CANDIDATE AND PRESIDENT, I WILL BEAT THE NRA AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] WE TALK ABOUT , EVERYONE HAS PLANS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. I PASSED THE BIDEN BILL, THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL IN THE SENATE IN 1987. REAL POLITICS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER. LONG BEFORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT IT. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. WE MADE AN INVESTMENT, THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE U.S. IN CLEAN ENERGY. SUN AND SOLAR, BECAUSE THE RESEARCH BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE IS AS LOW AS THE PRICE OF COAL. THAT'S WHY NO ONE IS GOING TO BUILD ANOTHER COAL PLANT. IT IS NOT EVEN ECONOMICAL ANYMORE. I WORKED WITH JOHN KERRY, WE PASSED THE CLIMATE ACCORD IN PARIS. IF YOU WANT PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN A CLIMATE, I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NOBODY. NOBODY AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] I'M THE ONLY ONE RUNNING WHO HAS DONE IT SO FAR. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE GOING TO CAUCUS FOR, HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE PROMISES, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM. I'VE GOT A RECORD TO PROVE IT. I HAVE PASSED MORE MAJOR LEGISLATION THROUGH CONGRESS AS A SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT THAN ALL OTHER FOLKS COMBINED WHO ARE RUNNING. THEY ARE NOT BAD FOLKS, THEY ARE GOOD FOLKS. BUT I HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN KNOWING HOW TO GET IT DONE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE DEMOCRATS CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, AND WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A THING WE CAN'T DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA, A PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS WON'T BE SECRET, THEY WILL BE PUBLIC. POLITICAL SELF INTERESTS WILL NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE NATIONAL INTERESTS. AND NO ONE, NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WILL BE ABOVE THE LAW, I PROMISE YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MANY OF YOU ARE HERE TONIGHT AS BIDEN SUPPORTERS AND PLAN ON CAUCUSING FOR JOE ON MONDAY NIGHT. SOME OF YOU MAY BE HERE UNDECIDED. LET ME SPEAK TO BOTH GROUPS. TO THOSE WHO ARE BIDEN SUPPORTERS, I WANT TO EQUIP YOU WITH THE ABILITY TO TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS BETWEEN NOW, MONDAY NIGHT, AND ON MONDAY NIGHT IN THE CAUCUS, TO PERSUADE THEM TO BECOME BIDEN SUPPORTERS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNDECIDED, I WANT TO MAKE THE CASE. I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN JOE BIDEN IN ACTION. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES IS A VERY SERIOUS JOB, AND JOE BIDEN IS A VERY SERIOUS MAN. HE SAID EARLIER IN HIS COMMENTS THAT THE CHILDREN ARE LISTENING, AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS GREAT GRANDKIDS WHO ARE HERE. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY GRANDSON. HE HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES AS THE SMALLEST AND CUTEST SURROGATE FOR A GRANDFATHER. BUT I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY HIS FATHER, BECAUSE WE LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER SEVERAL YEARS AGO, OUR FAMILY KIND OF STRUGGLED THROUGH ALL OF THAT. WE KIND OF GOT OFF OF SCHEDULE. WE DIDN'T GET TO GO TO FIRST COMMUNION CLASS WHEN HE NEEDED TO. HE ASKED THE FIRST COMMUNITY CLASS FOR JAKE. I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I SAID IT IS SIMPLE, THE FIRST THREE COMMITMENTS ABOUT HOW WE LOVE AND RESPECT GOD, HOW WE LOVE AND RESPECT EACH OTHER. I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO PUT A FINER POINT ON THIS. I SAID THERE ARE SOME PASTORS AND MINISTERS, PRIESTS WHO ARE NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PRESIDENT. JAKE SAID WHY IS THAT? I SAID BECAUSE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TAKES THE LORDS'S NAME IN VAIN IN PUBLIC FAR TOO FREQUENTLY FOR THOSE FOLKS. THEY DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT, THEY DON'T THINK IT'S RESPECTFUL. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH. I THOUGHT WE COULD MOVE ONTO ANOTHER SUBJECT. JAKE DIDN'T MISS A BEAT. HE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS THAT'S WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] HE'S 10 YEARS OLD AND HE GETS IT. THREE VERY SIMPLE MESSAGES ABOUT JOE BIDEN. HE IN FACT CAN GET THINGS DONE. I HAVE WATCHED IT. WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IN THE BALANCE, PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT JOE BIDEN TO CONGRESS. WHEN THE RECOVERY ACT WAS IN THE BALANCE, THOUGH BIDEN WAS SENT TO CONGRESS TO GET THE JOB DONE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WANTED SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE RECOVERY ACT, HE PUT JOE BIDEN IN CHARGE. I WAS IN COUNTLESS MEETINGS WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT WHERE HE URGED US TO GET THE RESOURCES OUT. BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR ECONOMY WAS SAVED. I HAVE SEEN JOE BIDEN IN ACTION. HE NOT ONLY HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO GET THE THINGS HE WANTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S WHY HE WAS SENT UP TO CONGRESS. THOSE FOLKS TRUSTED JOE. THEY WILL TRUST HIM AGAIN WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR EXPANDED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THEY WILL TRUST HIM AGAIN AS HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE CAN REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. NO ONE IN THIS RACE HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT JOE BIDEN HAS. NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE WORLD BEING IN A MESS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE WORLD, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD, AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WORLD LEADERS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK. JOE BIDEN DOESN'T NEED PRIMER OR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, HE DOESN'T NEED A SIX MONTHS OR TWO YEARS TO GET TO KNOW THESE FOLKS AND UNDERSTAND WHO THEY ARE. FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, JOE BIDEN CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REPAIRING THE CREDIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP RESTORING OUR REPUTATION, REBUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY TO BE THE GLOBAL LEADER WE WANT IT TO BE. HE COULD DO THIS FROM DAY ONE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THESE WORLD LEADERS AND THEY KNOW HIM. THOSE WORLD LEADERS TRUST JOE BIDEN. HE KNOWS THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE WORLD. HERE'S A LITTLE SECRET. YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIPS UNLESS YOU WIN. YOU HAVE TO WIN TO GOVERN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE VOTES THAN THE OTHER GUY. YOU NEED MORE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THAN THE OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FOLKS DO LATE AT NIGHT, BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I DO AT NIGHT, I LOOK AT STATE POLLS. I'M VERY INTERESTED NOT JUST IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IOWA, WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA THINKING? WHAT ABOUT GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN? MAYBE EVEN TEXAS? WHAT ARE THEY THINK ABOUT A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE? ARIZONA, NEVADA, COLORADO? HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON THE POLES I HAVE SEEN, THE RECENT POLLS, THE POLES RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, NONE, EXCEPT ONE, WHO IS BEATING AND IS COMPETITIVE WITH DONALD TRUMP IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE STATES, INCLUDING TEXAS, THAN JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WIN FLORIDA, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, TEXAS, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, IOWA, NEVADA, ARIZONA, COLORADO? THEY SWEAR YOU IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] SO THOSE ARE THE THREE SOLID REASONS HE IS THE MOST ELECTABLE DEMOCRAT, HE CAN GET'S DONE AND REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIP. I WANT TO SHARE ONE MORE REASON THAT IS PERSONAL TO ME. IT HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO HERE TONIGHT, THE BIDEN FAMILY HAS SUFFERED. MY FAMILY,, I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE SENSE, THE PURPOSE, WHY EVEN GO ON? OUR SON WAS DEVASTATED BY THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER. HE GOES TO A BIDEN EVENT EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN, WALKS UP AS HE MAY WALK UP TO SOME OF YOU TONIGHT, ASKS HOW HE'S DOING. MY SON THINKING OF THIS AS A POLITICIAN, ASKING HOW YOU ARE DOING, THEN HE WILL PASS ON TO THE NEXT GUY, HE SAYS HE'S DOING FINE. BUT JOE BIDEN IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POLITICIAN, A DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON, BECAUSE HE SUFFERED. HE STOPPED JUST AND ASKED HOW HE WAS FEELING. ""WE ARE IN A FRATERNITY WE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BELONG TO, AND I KNOW YOU ARE SUFFERING, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING, BECAUSE I FELT IT."" THAT'S CALLED EMPATHY. THAT'S CALLED THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED. TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUFFERING AND CONVEY A SENSE THAT DESPITE THE PAIN THAT YOU CAN PUT ONE STEP FORWARD, THAT YOU COULD MOVE TO A BETTER DAY. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? BECAUSE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TO HAVE THAT QUALITY. HE HAS TO HAVE THAT QUALITY WHEN HE WALKS INTO A GYMNASIUM WITH PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GUNNED DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY. HE HAS TO HAVE THAT WHEN HE GOES TO A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY A TORNADO. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WIPED OUT BY A FIRE. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY A FLOOD. PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU GET IT, YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE HERE TO HELP, WE CAN DO THIS AND GET TO A BETTER PLACE. HE CERTAINLY HAS TO HAVE IT WHEN HE TALKS TO THE FAMILY OF SOMEONE WHO BRAVELY SERVED US IN THE MILITARY, WHOSE LIFE WAS LOST IN WAR. DO YOU REMEMBER DONALD TRUMP IN PUERTO RICO? DO YOU REMEMBER THE PAPER TOWELS? WERE YOU PROUD OF YOUR NATION'S REACTION TO THAT TRAGEDY THEN? OF COURSE NOT, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC FOR A PRESIDENT THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SUPPORT JOE BIDEN, YOU ARE NOT ONLY SUPPORTING THE GUY WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT, NOT JUST THE GUY THAT CAN GET THINGS DONE THAT WE WANT DONE, AND NOT THE GUY WHO WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OUR BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD YOU ARE GOING TO GET A PRESIDENT THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU CAN BE PROUD OF, AND WHO WILL SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT, EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY HE HAS TO HEAL THIS GREAT NATION. HE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HIMSELF, HE BELIEVES IN US. HE BELIEVES WE CAN BE BETTER, WE CAN BE UNITED, HE WANTS TO HEAL US. HE NEEDS OUR HELP TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TO UNITE US AGAIN. MONDAY NIGHT, JOE BIDEN, OUR GUY. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) I MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT.

WE BELIEVE THAT AND IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED EVERY HOUR HE REMAINS PRESIDENT. EVERYONE OF US KNOWS DEEP IN OUR BONES EVERYTHING THIS NATION STANDS FOR IS AT STAKE, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION, AND CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT.

THE OTHER REASON WE ARE RUNNING, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE WORKING CLASS, THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING HURT BADLY. WE HAVE UNIFY THIS COUNTRY.

WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF THERE REALLY DOING WELL, BUT YOU KNOW, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE YET. I KNOW THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TRYING TO WORK THROUGH ALL THE ISSUES WITH THAT APPLICATION THEY HAD. THEY HAD THAT APP AND OTHER PROBLEMS. I SAID LAST NIGHT, LET'S GIVE THEM TIME. I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL. LET'S GIVE THEM TIME TO WORK OUT THOSE ISSUES CAREFULLY BECAUSE A LOT DEPENDS ON IT. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHOA SEESLY HOW MANY DELEGATES , HOW MANY DELEGATES WE HAVE. I HAVE A GOOD FEELING OF GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE. [APPLAUSE] NOW IT'S TIME FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE TO SPEAK AND SPEAK LOUDLY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING MY CASE ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I THINK ABOUT ALL THE FAMILIES , WHAT ALL THE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN TODAY. WHETHER IT'S STARING AT THE CEILING BECAUSE YOU HAVE JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, AND MY INTRODUCER CAN TELL YOU, OR YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR FAMILY'S GOING TO MAKE IT OR YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD AND YOU JUST LOST YOUR JOB. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NEXT. OR YOU JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE WITH SO MUCH DEBT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IN LORD'S NAME DO I GET STARTED. IT JUST MAKES ME WORK HARDER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS. IT WAS BUILT NOT , NOT BUILT BY C.E.O.'S. IT WAS BUILT BY YOU, HARDWORKING PEOPLE JUST LIKE MY FAMILY. JUST ASKED FOR NOTHING ELSE BUT A CHANCE. GIVE ME A CHANCE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, NONE OF US WERE GIVING MUCH OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE LOVE OF OUR FAMILIES. WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING WE EVER GOT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, JOE, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. BUT I AT LEAST EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. THAT'S OUR JOB. OUR JOB IS NOT TO NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND BUT OUR JOB , THE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT IT, IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT. MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY , I REALLY MEAN THIS. HE SAID, EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. EVERYONE. AND GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER IN WAR OR IN PEACE LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. NOT ONE SINGLE, SOLITARY TIME. AND I SAID IT FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED, WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR AND BELIEVES IN, OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD IS AT STAKE. WHEN I SAID THAT SIX OR EIGHT MONTHS AGO, PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXAGGERATION NOW SERVE ACKNOWLEDGING IT. WE SAW IT LAST WEEK, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS ABOVE THE LAW, WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS THAT'S DECIDED TO PUT THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PARTY AND THE PRESIDENT AHEAD OF THEIR LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION. YOU KNOW, I REALLY , I REALLY THINK WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT THIS TIME IS CHARACTER. CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT THIS TIME. I DON'T BELIEVE , [APPLAUSE] THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES, THE VERY CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY AS THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS AT US. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A DARK, ANGRY NATION THAT DONALD TRUMP , [CROWD CHANTING ""WE WANT JOE""] JOE THAMPLETE FOLLOW ME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THEY LOVE ME. FOLKS, FOLKS, LOOK. FOLKS, FOLKS. [CROWD YELLING] JOE: FOLKS, THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH POLITICS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S OK. COME HERE, COME HERE. NO. I HOPE YOU'RE OK, KIDDO. I HOPE YOU'RE OK. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING UP. THANK YOU. THERE'S SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN WHO BENEFITED FROM THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT I WROTE, YOU REALIZE HOW MANY OTHERS YOU HELP BY SPEAKING OUT. THANK YOU, KIDDO. THANK YOU. LOOK, I DON'T BELIEVE IN SAYING WHAT WE JUST SAW THAT WE'RE THE ANGRY NATION DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES WE ARE. I DON'T BELIEVE, I REALLY, HONEST TO GOD, DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT PUTS KIDS IN CAGES AN THINKS IT'S OK. I DON'T THINK , OH, PAL. COME ON, PAL, GIVE ME A BREAK, WILL YOU? NOW YOU KNOW HOW STRONGLY TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ME TO RUN AGAINST HIM. FOLKS, I APOLOGIZE. BY THE WAY. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE LISTEN WHY I'M RUNNING. WE HAVE TO STOP. THIS WE HAVE TO STOP. THIS [APPLAUSE] , TO STOP THIS. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHO WE ARE. IT'S NOT. IT'S AN OVERWHELMING MINORITY. BUT FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT BUILDS WALLS AND WHIPS US INTO HYSTERIA OVER THE INVASION OF IMMIGRANTS. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND HATE GROUPS. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT'S GOING TO BOW DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. I KNOW I WILL NOT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR, HOW HE BEHAVES, WHAT HE'S DONE, MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME. WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT, WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. LOOK, I BELIEVE THERE'S WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL AN INVISIBLE WALL OF , INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP SOCIETY. IT'S MADE , BLESS ME, FATHER. [LAUGHTER] IT'S GOOD TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. GOOD TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. FOLKS, LOOK. LOOK. YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT THIS INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP EVERY SOCIETY. CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST DAVID BUFF TALKS ABOUT IT, HE SAID IT'S MADE UP OF THE BASIC, FUNDAMENTAL CORE VALUES OF AMERICA. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. MAKING SURE WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND. HELP ORG PEOPLE. REALIZING THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. GIVING EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. JUST A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. NOT DEMONIZING AND RIDICULING THE POOR, THE HANDICAPPED, THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. AND LEADING BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. RONALD REAGAN SAID IT, THAT SHINE STIG ON A HILL. BEING PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH BIGGER THAN WE ARE INDIVIDUALLY. IT'S A CODE. IT'S A CODE YOU EMBRACE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT'S A CODE THEY EMBRACE AT HOME. IT'S UNIQUELY AN AMERICAN CODE. AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED AND A WORLD THAT'S IN DISARRAY. THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE. SOMEONE WHO CAN COMMAND. [APPLAUSE] SOMEONE WHO CAN COMMAND WORLD STAGE, MEET OUR ARMED FORCES AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, REPAIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE UNITED STATES NOT ONLY THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD BUT THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH CARE ISSUES IS DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS JEAN UNDERSTANDS, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW INCREDIBLY THANKFUL I AM TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN, JEAN, I MEAN IT, ANYWAY. YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW A CANCER DIAGNOSIS DOES TO A FAMILY. RAISE YOUR HAND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHTER, HUSBAND, WIFE, BROTHER, CYSTERS TO CANCER, OR YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM CANCER. YOU GET IT. YOU UNDERSTAND. WHAT JEAN IS GOING THROUGH SOONED MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP GOING WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE OR YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION IS TO FIND SOME PURPOSE. JEAN, YOU'RE A FIGHTER. AND SO AM I. YOU'RE A FIGHTER, PAL. SO I KNOW , I KNOW AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FAMILY. FOLKS, FOLKS WE RELY ON OBAMACARE FOR HEALTH CARE AND THE VERY QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHY I'M RUNNING. OBAMACARE IS THE REASON MORE THAN 50,000 GRANITE STATERS HAD MEDICAID COVERAGE AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. I FOUND IT ASTOUNDING, I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE'S THE REASON WHY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE COVERED. ISN'T THAT FASCINATING? I'M SERIOUS. HE'S IN COURT TRYING TO DO , SAY THE WHOLE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT HE SAID HE'S THE REASON WE'VE GOT COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CHILD ON A POLICY UNTIL AGE 26. THAT'S HOW SOME 20 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA TIMELY GOT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND WE CAN'T LET ANYTHING THREATEN THAT. SO IT'S TIME TO GET REAL ABOUT HEALTH CARE. I BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD IS TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE WITH A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION. MEDICARE IF YOU WANT IT. IT'S A PLAN THAT WILL LOWER CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO D OR BUY IN IF YOU DONE CHOOSE TO. IF YOU DON'T ARE THE MONEY YOU'RE ABLE TO GET IN FREE. IT'S A PLAN THAT WILL GET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES UNDER CONTROL. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY, IT COSTS $750 MILLION OVER THE , $750 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. IF WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S NOT $30 TRILLION THE OTHERS ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL. $30 TRILLION. $30 TRILLION TO $40 TRILLION. I CAN GET MY PLAN PASSED THROUGH THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, I CAN GET IT DONE RIGHT AWAY. SENATOR SANDERS, GOD LOVE HIM, AND THE OTHER, ATTACKED MY HEALTH CARE PLAN AND SAID IT'S TOO SMALL. FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE DEAD WRONG ABOUT WHAT IT COVERS. IT WAS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT THAT THIS PARTY SHOULD BE PROUD TO DEFEND. BUT LOOK, BERNIE HAS TALKED ABOUT A SINGER , SINGLE PAYER MEDICARE SYSTEM FOR , HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTRY FOR 30 YEARS NOW. HASN'T MOVED IT AN INCH. SMART BOTH THE VERMONT , VERMONT PAST GOVERNORS ENDORSED ME. IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE NOW. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ISN'T FOR IT. HOW SIT GOING TO PASS? HOW IS IT GOING TO MOVE? HOW DOES IT GET DONE? YOU CAN'T GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT IT. IT ACTUALLY HAS TO GET DONE. THE FACT IS, NOW BERNIE, HE WAS BEING STRAIGHT BEFORE, TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO RAISE MIDDLE CLASS TAXES. NOW HE AND THE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF MEDICARE FOR ALL WANT TO TELL , WON'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT COSTS. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. USED TO SAY $30 TRILLION WITH A MIDDLE CLASS INCREASE. BUT NOT MORE. NOW HE SAYS NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'LL COST. WON'T SAY WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. TRY PASSING A $30 TRILLION PLAN THROUGH THE CONGRESS AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. HOW MUCH IS , IT'S GOING TO COST AND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. I'M NOT QUESTIONING HIS INTENTIONS. BUT HOW IS IT GOING TO GO, CONVINCE ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY? BUT LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPECULATE WHO HAS THE BETTER APPROACH. IN 2018, I CAMPAIGNED IN 24 STATES FOR OVER 65 CANDIDATES. AND THEY'RE IN STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS WON IN THE TOUGHEST DISTRICTS IN AMERICA. AND THAT OPPOSED MEDICARE FOR ALL. NOT A ONE OF THEM THAT I'M AWARE OF RAN ON THE IDEA THAT , WELL THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY, THAT RAN ON THE IDEA THAT MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD PASS. YOU KNOW. 30 OUT OF THE 39 DEMOCRATS WHO WON THE TOUGHEST DISTRICTS IN AMERICA, THEY ALL OPPOSED MEDICARE FOR ALL. NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE OPPOSED TO HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE THEY WANT A RATIONAL WAY IN WHICH TO HAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EMBRACE WHAT THEY'RE BEGINNING TO EMBRACE ACROSS THE BOARD YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WE LOST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THE NEXT YEAR. AND EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STARTED TO GET RID OF IT, CUT IT, DO AWAY WIT, GO TO COURT TO SAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE ANYMORE, WHAT HAPPENED? ALL OF A SUDDEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MANY OF YOU, I SUSPECT, SAID WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY KID WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME OR ASTHMA OR ANY OTHER PRE-EXISTING CONDITION OR CANCER, I DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO BE COVERED IS BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WHEN IT PASSED, I URGED THE PRESIDENT TO TALK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SPEND MORE TIME EXPLAINING WHAT IT DID. HE SAID JOE, IT'S CLASSIC BARACK, HE SAID WE DENT HAVE TIME TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP, WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. IT WASN'T UNTIL IT GOT CUT YOU ALL REALIZED WHAT IT WAS. AND WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S COME ROARING BACK IN A BIG WAY PAUSE PEOPLE NOW KNOW WHAT WE DID AND WHAT WAS BEING LOST. SO FOLKS, I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE. I CAN TELL YOU, ALL YOU WHO RAISED YOUR HAND, WHO HAVE CANCER YOURSELF OR LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER, YOU NEED HOPE YOU NEED HOPE. NOT NEXT WEEK. NOT , MOST OF THE CANDIDATES ARE FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL ARE SAYING IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOUR YEARS TO PASS, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRUCTURE, COULD BE 10 YEARS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE NEED HOPE NOW. SO WE WANT REAL PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN HEALTH CARE, REAL CHANGE, NOT JUST TALK. AND I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS EVER GOT AN BIG HEALTH CARE REFORM BILL THROUGH THE CONGRESS. IT'S CALLED OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GET IT DONE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS THAT THREATEN OURS CHILDREN, OUR GRANDKIDS AS WELL. IT'S CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S A KILLER. [APPLAUSE] I PASSED THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, THE UNITED STATES SENATE, IN 1987. POLITIFACT, WHO GOES AND CHECKS WHETHER THINGS ARE TRUE OR FALSE, CALLED IT A GAME-CHANGER. THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, INSIDE THE $900 RECOVERY ACT THE PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF TO KEEP IT FROM GOING INTO DEPRESSION, WE MADE A RECORD INVESTMENT FOR CLEAN NRNL, WIND, AND SOLAR. I WORKED WITH JOHN KERY RY WHO HELPED PASS , I WORKED WITH JOHN TO HELP PASS THE , NOT LEGISLATION BUT GET THE CLIMATE, THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT PASSED BY GETTING ALMOST 200 NATIONS TO SIGN UP. IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ALL HAVE SERIOUS PLANS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THERE'S ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IN MINE. MY PLAN UNDERSTANDS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST A DOMESTIC ISSUE. IT'S AN INTERCOMMARBLE ISSUE. I DID EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO DO AT HOME AND IF WE DO IT AND WE WILL, TO GET CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER CONTROL AND GET TO NET ZERO, THAT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH. WE WON'T DO THAT. WE'RE JUST 15% OF THE PROBLEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKES UP 5% OF THE PROBLEM. SO THIS IS ALSO FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE AS WELL. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE TO BRING THE LEADERS TOGETHER HERE, I'VE DONE THAT. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS EVER DONE THAT. I DID IT BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH , ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AS WELL. I DID IT BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. WE PUT TOGETHER THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO FIGHT ISIS. EVERYONE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BUT ASK YOURSELF, WHO ELSE IN THIS RACE HAS BROUGHT WORLD LEADERS TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A MAJOR PROBLEM? I'M DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE THINK IT'S OK, OK TO SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL, WHERE THE FIRST DAY THEY GO TO SCHOOL THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. IT'S SHAMELESS. SHAMELESS. GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS IS SHAMELESS. LOOK, I OWN A 20 GAUGE AND A 12 GAUGE, I KNOW HOW , I SKEET SHOOT MY BOYS, WE'RE DUCK HUNTERS. WE PROTECT INTERNATIONAL DUCK HUNTING MORE THAN PEOPLE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHELLS WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE SHOOTING GEESE. I'M THE GUY THAT GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED WITH THE BACKGROUND CHECKS. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE LEADING CONTENDERS RUNS AGAINST ME FOR THE NOMINATION VOTED AGAINST IT FIVE TIMES. I'M WORKING WITH SENATOR , I WORKED WITH SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN OF CALIFORNIA TO GET THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN FOR 10 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY UNTIL WE HAD HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA AN LOST THE PRESIDENCY. BUT I'LL GET THEM BANNED AGAIN. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS TAKE ON THE N.R.A. STRAIGHT UP AND FLAT BEATEN THEM, TWICE. [APPLAUSE] I'LL BEAT THEM AGAIN. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IF I'M PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE ONLY , GUN MANUFACTURERS CAN'T BE SUE LOODIC YOU SEE THE TOBACCO COMPANIES, IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. A COUPLE OF CANDIDATES VOTED FOR THAT AS WELL. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A LEADER, A LEADER WHO CAN UNITE THE PARTY, STARTING OFF, AND THEN UNITE THE COUNTRY. WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. EVERY DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON CONSENSUS. CONSENSUS. THERE'S NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN TOSH PROGRESS IF WE CAN'T REACH A CONSENSUS YOU SHOULD OUR SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RACE SAY THAT I'M NAIVE. NICE TO KNOW I'M NAIVE, I'VE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. I'M NAIVE BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN UNIFY THE COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FOREVER AT WAR. THE REPUBLICANS AREN'T OUR ENEMIES, THEY'RE OPPOSITION. AND WE GET RID OF STUFF LIKE YOU HEARD HERE TODAY, WE CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT. I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE AND WILL DO IT AS YOUR PRESIDENT. THEY SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. JUST GOT A TASTE OF THAT NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN ANYBODY, I'VE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] MORE THAN ANYONE. AND I WONDER WHY THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO KEEP MY FROM BEING THE NOMINEE? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANOTHER PARTY SPEND AS MUCH TIME DECIDING WHO THE OTHER PARTY'S NOMINEE SHOULDN'T BE? I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT? I AM THE OBJECT OF THEIR , THEY SPENT $12 MILLION TO $15 MILLION IN NEGATIVE ADS THAT MOST MAINSTREAM STATIONS WON'T RUN, FOR REAL. I LEARNED A COUPLE OF THINGS. VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. LITERALLY. THEY'VE DONE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SO-CALLED BOTS ON, YOU KNOW, AND FINALLY FACEBOOK CAME ALONG AND SAID WE CAN'T PUT THEM ON, THEY'RE NOT HONEST. THEY'VE DECIDED THAT , THEY SAID 80 PEOPLE TO IOWA TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME GETTING THE NOMINATION. AND I'M , I DON'T KNOW. I WONDER IF THEY SCREWED UP THE COUNT. THAT'S A JOKE. THAT'S A JOKE. THAT'S A JOKE. BUT LOOK, FOLKS. THERE'S A LOT OF LOUSY STUFF GOING ON. BUT YOU KNOW, CAN'T HOLD GRUDGES. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO HEAL. I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST TO US. CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, PROTECTING OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR SACRED RIGHT TO VOTE. DEFENDING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND THE SCOURGE , ENDING THE SCOURGE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND SEXUAL ABUSE. EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. TAKING ON THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. AND REWARD WORK NOT JUST WEALTH WHICH IS WHAT WE CO-NOW. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS WE NEED TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. EVEN THE PEOPLE IN HERE, I DOUBT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP LIKE DONALD TRUMP. I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. NOT BEING FACETIOUS. WE KNOW WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS WE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION AND COMPASSION OVER CRUELTY. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, YES. YES. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. TRUTH OVER LIES. LOOK, FOLKS, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOT A SINGLE THING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. NEVER HAVE WE EVER, EVER FAILED WHEN WE SET AN OBJECTIVE.

WHAT'S ON MY MIND IS THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO GET BEHIND PETE BUTTIGIEG. I THINK THAT HIM BEING A VETERAN CAN TEAR RIGHT INTO TRUMP. TRUMP NOT GOING TO THE WAR. I REALLY BELIEVE THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS GOT A START GETTING ON BOARD BECAUSE I WAS ALL BEHIND OBAMA. OBAMA WAS GREAT, BUT THERE IS NO BLACK OBAMA IN THIS YEAR'S FIELD. SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. PETE IS GOING TO BE WITH THE BLACKS, HE WILL HELP THE BLACKS OUT WITH HEALTH CARE, WORK, ECONOMY. HE WILL HELP THE BLACKS WITH THE POLICE ISSUES. HE UNDERSTANDS IT. IT IS NOT A NICHE , EASY ISSUE, BUT AT LEAST HE UNDERSTANDS THERE IS AN ISSUE AND HE CAN ATTACK IT THAT WAY. SOME FOLKS GOT TOGETHER TO RAISE A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO START WHAT IS THE MODERN-DAY NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. DRIVING HAD THIS EVENING I CANNOT HELP BUT THINK OF ALL THOSE FOLKS THAT NEVER GOT TO SEE AN EVENT LIKE THIS. THE PARTY WAS NEARLY NONEXISTENT.

THAT WORK AND THE WORK OF SO MANY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY HELPED FLIP THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, AND IS DELIVERING REAL RESULTS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE PASSED MAJOR LEGISLATION TO TAKE ON BIG PHARMA AND LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

[APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE TAKING BIG STEPS FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE, TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARD IN THIS COUNTRY CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THIS WORK IS URGENT. IT CAN'T WAIT, AND PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON US TO GET THIS RIGHT. THAT IS WHY WE ARE IN THIS FIGHT TOGETHER.

AND IF WE DON'T STICK TOGETHER, OUR WORK WILL BE FOR NOTHING. JUST LIKE IN 2020 , JUST LIKE IN 2018, THIS ELECTION IS BIGGER THAN ANY OF US. IT IS BIGGER THAN THE PERSONALITIES OR MOMENTARY FRUSTRATIONS OF THIS PRIMARY PROCESS. IT IS BIGGER THAN A DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON HOW WE OBTAIN THE GOALS WE ALL SHARE, IT IS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS FOR PEOPLE. IT IS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, AND IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THE INSTITUTIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WILL HOLD. IT IS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND DO WHAT HISTORY IS COUNTING ON US AND REQUIRING US TO DO AT THIS MOMENT, UNITE AND WIN.

[APPLAUSE] IT ALL STARTS. THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE UPON US. IT ALL STARTS RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, WITH THE BERLIN THIS ROOM , WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AND BY NOVEMBER WE WILL ALL BE ON THE SAME TEAM WORKING TOGETHER TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT. AND NEXT JANUARY, I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT OF THE END STATES MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS HUSBAND. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) WELL, GOOD EVENING, DEMOCRATS. WOW. LOOK AT THIS WONDERFUL, FULL ARENA, IN SHAHEEN COUNTRY, IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TONIGHT. A SHOUT OUT AND THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN RAY BUCKLEY AND THE ENTIRE NEW HAMSTER DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS FANTASTIC EVENT. MY HUSBAND TOM IS HERE. I WANT TO THANK HIM, AND MY MOM PEGGY, FOR THEIR SUPPORT, AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OUR HONORED GUESTS FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT IS BALMY BY OUR STANDARDS, BY THE WAY, BUT MOSTLY I WANT TO THANK NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO PUTTING OUR COUNTRY ON A PATH TO A STRONGER FUTURE. IT IS ALMOST TIME, AFTER MONTHS OF TOWN HALLS AND TOUGH QUESTIONS AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING, OUR FIRST-AND-THE-NATION PRIMARY ARRIVES ON TUESDAY , FIRST-IN-THE-NATION PRIMARY ARRIVES ON TUESDAY, AND WITH ALL THE EYES OF THE NATION UPON US, GRANITE STATERS ARE GOING TO PROVE ONCE AGAIN THAT NOBODY DOES DEMOCRACY BETTER THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] IN A FEW MINUTES YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR WONDERFUL CANDIDATES. THEY ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEIR POLICIES AND PRIORITIES, AND OF COURSE, ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, I COULD NOT AGREE MORE STRONGLY. TONIGHT THOUGH, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER VITAL 2020 PRIORITY, CALLED GETTING MITCH MCCONNELL OUT OF THE SENATE. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHEERING] THAT IS RIGHT, FOLKS. LOOK, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE A DEMOCRAT. [APPLAUSE] AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS WITHOUT A CONGRESS THAT HAS THEIR BACK, AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IF MITCH MCCONNELL REMAINS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. DAY AFTER DAY, MITCH MCCONNELL BLOCKS LEGISLATION CRITICAL TO HARD-WORKING GRANITE STATERS, AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HE TAKES PRIDE IN REFERRING TO HIMSELF AS THE LEGISLATIVE GRIM REAPER. [CROWD BOOING] SO HERE IS A FEW THINGS TO THINK ABOUT. MITCH MCCONNELL WON'T TAKE UP BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION FROM THE HOUSE THAT WOULD PROTECT AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [CROWD BOOING] HE IS BLOCKING THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. THAT ACT PASSED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE HOUSE, ALONG WITH THE BIPARTISAN EQUALITY ACT, WHICH WOULD PROTECT LGBTQ AMERICANS FROM DISCRIMINATION. MITCH MCCONNELL WON'T TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND HE IS REFUSING TO TAKE UP EFFORTS, KNOWN ONLY BY DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO BY REPUBLICANS, TO SAFEGUARD OUR , NOT ONLY BY DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO BY REPUBLICANS, TO SAFEGUARD OUR ELECTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN INTERFERENCE. [CROWD CHANTING] AND ALL THE WHILE, HE IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN'T TO STACK OUR COURTS WITH BLATANTLY PARTISAN AND UNQUALIFIED JUDGES FOR LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. [CROWD BOOING] AND AS YOU HAVE ALL SEEN OVER THE PAST WEEK, MITCH MCCONNELL BLOCKED THE SENATE AND ALL AMERICANS FROM SEEING DOCUMENTS AND HEARING FROM WITNESSES WITH FIRST-HAND INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT IS INDEFENSIBLE. THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SHOULD NOT BE A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL DEFENSE TEAM. [APPLAUSE] SO FOLKS, I AM AS FRUSTRATED BY AND TIRED OF MITCH MCCONNELL'S PARTISAN GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON AS YOU ARE. IT IS UP TO ALL OF US TO DO SOMETHING. IT IS ON US TO TURN THIS AROUND, AND THAT STARTS WITH REELECTING MY FRIEND, AND OUR FABULOUS SENIOR SENATOR, JEANNE SHAHEEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN FIGHTS TO GET RESULTS EVERY DAY, GETTING RESULT AFTER RESULT FOR HARD-WORKING GRANITE STATERS, AND WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT TAKE THE MAJORITY BACK WITHOUT REELECTING JEANNE SHAHEEN. SO WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. AND I AM ALSO GOING TO URGE EVERYBODY TO DO WHAT YOU CAN, EVERYTHING YOU CAN, TO SUPPORT OUR STRONG DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR SENATE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS REALLY, REALLY VITAL. [APPLAUSE] NOW, WE ALSO HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BLUE, [APPLAUSE] WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ELECT ANNIE KUSTER AND CHRIS PAPPAS. NEW HAMPSHIRE, WE ARE JUST DAYS AWAY AND WE HAVE LOTS OF WORK TO DO BEFORE THE PRIMARIES, BUT THEN AFTER THE PRIMARIES TOGETHER, TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL ELECTION DAY TO,, ELECT A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE HOUSE BLEW AND FLIP THE SENATE INTO DEMOCRATIC CONTROL. IT IS A LOT OF WORK, TO BE SURE, BUT NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS, YOU HAVE PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT YOUR GRASSROOTS ENERGY IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. SO KEEP WORKING. KEEP ORGANIZING.

[APPLAUSE] THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IF YOU HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. [APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE, AND THAT WOMEN SHOULD GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, AND THAT WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS IT NOW. [CROWD CHANTING] AND WE BELIEVE WOMEN SHOULD MAKE OUR OWN HEALTH CARE CHOICES AND OUR OWN CHOICES ABOUT OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHEERING] AND WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ETHNIC BACKGROUND IS, NO MATTER HOW YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR GENDER, NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE ARE WHERE YOU CAME FROM, THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE, AND TO HAVE THE SAME CHOICES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THAT WE ALL HAD.

[APPLAUSE] AND FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES THAT HAVE GIVEN SO MANY AMERICANS HOPE AT A TIME WHEN WE REALLY NEED IT AND IN , NEED IT IN THIS COUNTRY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, FOR SHARING WITH US A VISION OF WHAT AMERICA CAN BE. ANY OF YOU WHO GETS ELECTED WILL BE BETTER THAN THE PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOW. [APPLAUSE] SO AFTER TUESDAY, WE WANT TO SEND YOU ALL OUT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH THE WIND AT YOUR BACKS THROUGHOUT THIS NOMINATING CONTEST, AND WHEN IT IS OVER, WHEN WE HAVE A NOMINEE, WE HAVE ALL GOT TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK OUR HEARTS OUT FOR THAT NOMINEE, SO WE CAN TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I HAVE ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY TONIGHT BEFORE I LEAVE THE STAGE, BECAUSE THIS DINNER ALWAYS HONORS A DEMOCRAT WITH THE MCINTYRE SHAHEEN LEGACY AWARD, A DEMOCRAT THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN AN EXEMPLARY WAY. THIS YEAR, IT IS A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS GETTING THE MCINTYRE-SHAHEEN AWARD. IT IS A WOMAN WHO I GOT TO SERVE WITHIN THE STATE SENATE, AND HERETO HELP ME GIVE THE AWARD IS MY HUSBAND BILLY. [APPLAUSE] MY DAUGHTER STEPHANIE AND HER HUSBAND, CRAIG, STACY AND HER HUSBAND RYAN, MOLLY AND HER HUSBAND HEAL. , HUSBAND HUGH. THIS AWARD GOES TO A WOMAN WHO TAUGHT ME WHAT IT IS LIKE TO PROVIDE REAL CONSTITUENT SERVICE, WHO NEVER QUIT DURING HER TIME AS STATE SENATOR AND EXECUTIVE COUNSELOR AND SENATE PRESIDENT. SHE BROKE THE GLASS CEILING AND HELPED US HAVE WOMEN LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE WHEN WE HAD THE GOVERNOR, SENATE PRESIDENT AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WHO WERE ALL WOMEN. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE JOIN ME IN HONORING BEV HOLLINGWORTH FROM HAMPTON, WHO HAS DONE SUCH GREAT THINGS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR SO MANY YEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BEV. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ALL, SO MUCH. THANK YOU. I AM SO PROUD TO BE RECOGNIZED BY MY DEAR FRIEND JEANNE, AND ALL OF YOU. I AM JUST OVERWHELMED. I HAD NO IDEA. YOU ARE IN TROUBLE. SHE CONVINCED ME I WAS JUST GOING TO BE HERE FOR HER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH I AM SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF. THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, EXCEPT THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] I WOULDN'T STANDING HERE TONIGHT, HAVING SERVED IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S COUNSEL, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MY FAMILY, WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO GO INTO POLITICS AFTER MANY ISSUES. I LOST MY HUSBAND TO LEUKEMIA AT VERY YOUNG AGE, AND LEGISLATION WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AT THE TIME. AND THEN HE DIED, UNFORTUNATELY, AT A VERY YOUNG AGE. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO FIND MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND, FAIL GILLIGAN , PHIL GILLIGAN. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING] (music) THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR SHAHEEN. IT IS NOT OFTEN YOU GET TO SPEAK AFTER SOMEONE SO RESPECTED THEY NAMED THE EVENT AFTER HER. THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK YOU AND THE DELEGATION ARE DOING, SENATOR HASSAN CONGRESSMAN PAPPAS , SENATOR HASSAN, CONGRESSMAN PASO , CONGRESSMAN PAPPAS, THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE, FOR WELCOMING US TO THIS STATE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. I AM HERE ONE MORE TIME TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME, NOT ONLY TO END THE ERA OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT TO LAUNCH THE AIR ARE THAT MUST, NEXT , THAT MUST COME NEXT. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW SOME ARE ASKING, WHAT BUSINESS DOES THE SOUTH BEND MAYOR HAVE SEEKING THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND? YOU DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, YOU DON'T HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE CITY YOU ARE THE MAYOR OF ISN'T EVEN THE BIGGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS MORE LIKE MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] TO WHICH I SAY, THAT IS VERY MUCH THE POINT, BECAUSE AMERICANS IN SMALL, RURAL TOWNS AND INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES AND YES, IN OUR BIGGEST CITIES, ARE TIRED OF BEING REDUCED TO A PUNCHLINE BY WASHINGTON POLITICIANS, AND READY FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE THE VOICE TO THE AMERICAN CAPITAL. [CROWD CHANTING] AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A PRESIDENT TO CUTS TAXES FOR GIANT CORPORATIONS HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY LIVES IN A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY AMERICAN MIDWEST, AND IS READY TO CALL HIM OUT? [APPLAUSE] HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A PRESIDENT WHO LIKES TO QUOTE HIMSELF IN RELIGION? THIS PRESIDENT HAS TO STAND NEXT TO SOMEONE NOT AFRAID TO REMIND FELLOW BELIEVERS THAT GOD DOES NOT BELONG TO A POLITICAL PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A PRESIDENT WHO AVOIDED SURVEYING WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN , AVOIDED SERVING WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN HAVE TO SQUARE OFF AGAINST A WAR VETERAN PREPARED TO ILLUSTRATE WHY THERE IS NOTHING PATRIOTIC ABOUT PARDONING WAR CRIMINALS OR PUNISHING WAR HEROES. WE WILL BEAT THIS PRESIDENT. WITH THE PRESIDENT THIS DISRUPTED, WE CAN'T RELY ON A FAMILIAR PLAYBOOK FROM BEFORE. WITH A PRESIDENT THIS DIVISIVE, WE CANNOT RISK DIVIDING AMERICANS' FUTURE FURTHER, SAYING YOU MUST EITHER BE FOR A REVOLUTION OR YOU MUST BE FOR THE STATUS QUOTE. LET'S MAKE ROOM FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS MOVEMENT. THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT, OUR ONE CHANCE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND THERE IS AN AMERICAN MAJORITY THAT IS UNIFIED NOT JUST IN WHO WE ARE AGAINST, BUT IN WHAT WE ARE FOR. BECAUSE WE ARE FOR HIGHER WAGES AND THE EMPOWERMENT OF WORKERS. WE ARE FOR HONORING OUR TROOPS BY PUTTING AN END TO ENDLESS WARS. WE ARE FOR OUR TEACHERS AND PREPARED TO BACK THEM UP WITH A SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WHO BELIEVES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE WILL CREATE AN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE WHERE YOUR RACE HAS NO BEARING ON YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR WEALTH OR YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCE , OR YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT IS IN AMERICA WE MUST BUILD TOGETHER, AND WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER. A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO ASKED ME WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO SO HIS FAMILY CAN AFFORD INSULIN, CANNOT WAIT FOR US TO ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNINSURED AMERICAN AND NO SUCH THING AS AN UNAFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION. [APPLAUSE] THE 13-YEAR-OLD WHO TOLD ME THAT SHE ASKED FOR A KEVLAR BACKPACK FOR CHRISTMAS CANNOT WAIT FOR US TO ACT TO PROTECT HER SCHOOL FROM GUN VIOLENCE. WE MUST ACT NOW. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT THE GLORIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT, IT IS THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TACKLE THESE BIG CHALLENGES. AND MY BELIEF [CROWD CHANTING] BUTTIGIEG. BUTTIGIEG. BUTTIGIEG. BUTTIGIEG. BUTTIGIEG. , MY BELIEF IN THIS AMERICA IS NOT THE PRODUCT OF MY AGE, IT IS THE PRODUCT OF MY EXPERIENCE. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU BELIEVE IN AN AMERICAN FUTURE DEFINED BY BELONGING, THIS IS OUR CHANCE. IF YOU BELIEVE IN AN AMERICAN POLITICS DEFINED BY BOLDNESS, THIS IS OUR CHANCE. IF YOU BELIEVE IN AN AMERICAN FUTURE DEFINED BY UNITY, THIS IS OUR CHANCE, NEW HAMPSHIRE. NEW HAMPSHIRE, ON TUESDAY LET'S MAKE HISTORY AND LET'S GO ON TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) [""UP AROUND THE BEND"" BY CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL PLAYING] (music) THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU, AND IN THE STATE THAT HAD THE AUDACITY TO SEND NOT ONE, BUT TWO WOMEN TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, MAGGIE HASSAN AND JEANNE SHAHEEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE, I STARTED MY CAMPAIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF A MINNESOTA BLIZZARD. THERE WERE FOUR INCHES OF SNOW ON MY HEAD, BECAUSE I WANTED TO IMPRESS NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE PREDICTED I WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE IT THROUGH THAT SPEECH, BUT I MADE IT THROUGH THAT SPEECH AND I MADE IT THROUGH THE SUMMER AND I MADE IT TO THAT DEBATE STAGE LAST NIGHT, AND WE HAVE MOMENTUM LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE BEATEN THE ODDS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, BECAUSE WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS, AND I AM SPEAKING TO ALL OF THE SUPPORTERS THEREFORE ALL OF THE CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT WHAT UNITES US IS BIGGER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. WE KNOW THAT AS A PARTY, WE KNOW THAT, AND WE KNOW THAT YES, THIS ELECTION IS AN ECONOMIC CHECK ON THIS PRESIDENT, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SHARING IN THE PROSPERITY ACROSS THIS NATION. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS ELECTION IS A PATRIOTISM CHECK. IT IS A DECENCY CHECK ON THIS PRESIDENT. AND WHAT UNITES US MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY HEART OF AMERICA IS BIGGER THAN THE HEART OF THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE KNOW THAT. EVERYONE OF US KNOWS THAT , EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS THAT, AND DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHTMARE IS THAT OUR FIRED UP DEMOCRATS WILL MARCH TO VICTORY WITH THE INDEPENDENTS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THE STATE, AND THAT WE WILL WIN BIG IN NOVEMBER. THAT IS HIS NIGHTMARE. [APPLAUSE] SO WHAT WILL I DO? I WILL PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. WE WILL GET THAT DONE, TO GET BIG MONEY OUT OF OUR POLITICS. WHAT UNITES US IS TO STOP HIS SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND KICK PEOPLE OFF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT IS WRONG, AND WE WILL STOP HIM. WE WILL TAKE ON BIG PHARMA TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TAKE ON THE NRA, TO PASS GUN-SAFETY LEGISLATION. THAT IS OUR OPTIMISTIC AGENDA FOR THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE KNOW AS A PARTY THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DIVIDE THE DIVIDER IN CHIEF, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OUT DIVIDE HIM. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE OUT-DIVIDING SOMEONE THAT WAKES UP EVERY MORNING TO SEE WHO HE CAN TAKE ON NEXT, SEE WHO HE CAN BLAME NEXT EARED LET'S SEE WHAT THE LIST IS. HE BLAMES BARACK OBAMA, RIGHT? HE DOES THAT ALL THE TIME. HE BLAMES IMMIGRANTS. HE BLAMES THE HEAD OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT HE APPOINTED. HE BLAMES THE GENERALS THAT HE COMMANDED. HE BLAMES THE ENTIRE KINGDOM OF DENMARK. WHO DOES THAT? [LAUGHTER] HE EVEN BLAMED THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA FOR CUTTING HIM OUT OF THE CANADIAN VERSION OF ""HOME ALONE 2."" HE DOES THAT. HE BLAMES PEOPLE. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE TO OFFER INSTEAD? WE ARE A PARTY THAT BRINGS PEOPLE WITH US INSTEAD OF SHUTTING THEM OUT, AND YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING I HAVE DONE. I HAVE WON IN RURAL AREAS BIG TIME, I HAVE ONE IN SUBURBAN AREAS, I HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE ELECTION I HAVE EVER RUN BACK TO FOURTH GRADE. [APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING] NOW, DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE BRING PEOPLE WITH US, THAT WE PUT SOMEONE ON THE TICKET THAT GETS IT, THAT CAN BRING THOSE PEOPLE BACK, AND YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND. I AM , HI, BERNIE PEOPLE , I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF AN IRON-OR MINOR , IRON ORE MINER. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF A TEACHER AND A NEWSPAPERMAN. I AM THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND I AM A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM OR WHO YOU KNOW ARE WHERE YOU WORSHIP OR WHO YOU LOVE, THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WILL END WITH THIS. I TOLD THIS STORY LAST NIGHT, THAT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DURING THAT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL THINKING, WE ALL SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING, AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT A PRESIDENT THAT THINKS HE CAN BULLDOZE OVER OUR DEMOCRACY AND RISE ABOVE THE RULE OF LAW AND IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM, THAT HE CAN DECIDE WHO GETS THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THE STORY OF KENNEDY WHO DIED IN THEIR WAS A TRAIN AND PEOPLE STOOD ALONG THE TRAIN TRACKS TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND A MAN WAS STANDING THERE CRYING, AND A REPORTER SAID, DID YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT? IN THE PRESIDENT SAID NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT, BUT THE PRESIDENT KNEW ME. WHAT IS MISSING IS THIS , MISSING WITH THIS GUY IS EMPATHY, WHAT IS MISSING IS A SACRED TRUST WITH THE PEOPLE, AND IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE DECIDING WHETHER TO FILL YOUR REFRIGERATOR OR YOUR PRESCRIPTION, I KNOW YOU AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN LONG-TERM CARE FOR YOUR PARENTS OR CHILD CARE FOR YOUR KIDS, I KNOW YOU AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STRETCH YOUR PAYCHECK TO THE RENT, I KNOW YOU AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. THAT IS HOW WE WIN THIS ELECTION, DEMOCRATS, THAT IS HOW WE WIN, SO I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN OUR FIGHT. I DON'T HAVE THE BIGGEST BANK ACCOUNT. I AM NOT THE TALLEST PERSON IN THE ROOM, BUT WHAT I HAVE GOT IS GRIT, THE GRIT YOU GET FROM A MINNESOTA BLIZZARD, THE GRIT YOU GET FROM SPENDING YOUR LIFE, NOT AN EASY LIFE, FIGHTING AND OVERCOMING ADVERSITY, THE GRIT YOU GET WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PERFECT BIRTH WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER IS BORN AND YOU GET KICKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL WHILE SHE IS IN INTENSIVE CARE, AND THE FIRST POLITICAL MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE IS TO PASS ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS IN THE COUNTRY GUARANTEEING NEW MOMS AND THEIR BABIES A 48 HOUR HOSPITAL STAY. THAT IS GRIT. THAT IS GRIT, AND THAT IS WHAT I BRING TO THIS TICKET. I PICKED THE COLOR GREEN BECAUSE IT IS THE COLOR OF MY POLITICAL MENTOR, PAUL WELLSTONE. HE BROUGHT PEOPLE WITH HIM. I AM ASKING YOU TO COME WITH US. LET'S GO. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT. ONE REASON IS, YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN PRIMARIES. YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DELEGATION IN JEANNE SHAHEEN AND MAGGIE HASSAN THAN CHRIS PAPPAS AND ANNIE KUSTER. GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE CAN'T STAND FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE KNOW BETTER. NOBODY TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY MORE SERIOUSLY THAN YOU DO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU THINK FOR YOURSELVES, YOU KNOW OUR PARTY AND YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, AMERICA'S CHARACTER IS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. WE HAVE TO ACT. THE MAN I MET IN CLAREMONT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DAYS AGO PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I'M LOSING MY JOB, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL MY FAMILY, WHAT DO I SAY, HOW DO I DO IT? IT WAS INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL AND I SAID, I UNDERSTAND. I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY DAD WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE WHAT I CALL THE LONGEST WALK UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KID'S BEDROOM AND SAY JOE, I DON'T HAVE A JOB, WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, WE HAVE TO MOVE. BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, AND HE MEANT IT. IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET US A HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN, BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT IT WOULD BE OK. BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY ARE ABLE TO LOOK THEIR CHILDREN AND THE EYE FACED WITH THAT KIND OF CRISIS AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK? THEY DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT SO MUCH HARDER IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IT WON'T MAKE IT OK. JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, 12 HOURS AGO, JILL AND I AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN STOOD IN LINE IN MANCHESTER FOR FOOD FOR CHILDREN, BITTERLY COLD, 22 DEGREES, THE WIND BLOWING, AND YOU SEE ALL THESE LITTLE CHILDREN STANDING IN LINE, HUDDLED, NO GLOVES, PHRASING, , FREEZING, WAITING TO PICK UP A CARDBOARD BOX SO THEY CAN PUT BREAD IN IT, DOUGHNUTS IN IT, THINGS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET FOR FOOD, AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A WOMAN WITH BARELY A SWEATER ON HOLDING HER CHILD TIGHTLY IN TEARS COMING DOWN HER EYES AS SHE PICKED UP BREAD. THE MEN WHO CAME ALONG, UNABLE TOJUST THINKING, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HOW CAN THAT BE HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE BITTER COLD WITH NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. JUST GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SUSTENANCE. ONE OF THE GUYS WALKED UP AND GAVE ME A SCHOOL CAP. WHY DO I HAVE IT? I GAVE IT TO ONE OF THE KIDS. THINK ABOUT IT. NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A LINE THAT LASTED AND LASTED AND LASTED. NO HOPE IN SIGHT FOR THESE PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US GREW UP IN, THAT WE BELIEVE IN. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE OTHER DAY, THREE DAYS AGO, WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS BEING INTRODUCED IN CLAREMONT, I BELIEVE IT WAS. A GUY, A WOMAN IS GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU. HER NAME WAS CHRISTIE. SHE LOOKED AT ME. SHE SAID, I WILL TELL MY STORY. SHE WAS A VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN VICTIM, BEATEN BY HER HUSBAND. SHE SAID SHE WAS ON THE STREET WITH A LITTLE BABY. NOWHERE TO GO. SHE PICKED UP A PAPER AND SHE LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY. HE'S WRITING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE WILL FIND ME A HOUSE AND HOME. GUESS WHAT? IT SAVED HER LIFE. SHE HAD MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE. THAT IMPACT ON HER CHILD, IT GOT HER OFF THE STREET. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ON THE STREET ARE THERE BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS ARE BEING ABUSED AND BATTERED. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE SUFFERING FROM POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS WITH US DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT? THE ACT I WROTE IS SITTING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE NOT BEING PASSED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GIVE THE BOYFRIENDS GUNS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE ALL RUNNING, EVERYONE OF US. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE OTHER WAY. FOLKS, WE ARE BEING LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO EMPATHY, NO SYMPATHY, WHO MOCKS PEOPLE, WHO MAKES FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WHO DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BE MEAN. HE DOESN'T HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY AND HIM. HE SPEAKS TO WOMEN IN SUCH DEGRADING TERMS. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU WERE RAISED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT'S NOT HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT'S NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US KNOW. IT DOESN'T REPRESENT NEW HAMPSHIRE VALUES EITHER. [CHEERS] I LOST A LOT IN MY LIFETIME LIKE YOU HAVE. I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I LOST MY SON TO A LONG BATTLE WITH BRAIN CANCER. I WON'T STAND BY AND LOSE THIS ELECTION TO THIS MAN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. [CHEERS] THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. WE MUST DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS NO CHOICE. THE MAN DOES NOT HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY. WE HAVE TO STAND UP AGAINST BIGOTRY, HATRED, THE ABUSE OF POWER. THIS MAN DERIVES PEOPLE. IT'S UP TO YOU, AMERICA. ONLY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN DO IT. WE MUST DO IT NOW. STAND UP, TAKE IT BACK. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. LET'S GO DO IT NOW. NOW. NOW. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. [CHEERS] IT IS PHENOMENAL TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU, YANG GANG. I LOVE CAMPAIGNING HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR SO MANY REASONS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU KNEW THIS. I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE. I GRADUATED FROM MIDDLE SECTOR ACADEMY IN 1992. I AM THRILLED TO BE CAMPAIGNING HERE TONIGHT. YOU ARE AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY. I KNOW IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT. I DID THE MATH, NEW HAMPSHIRE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS EACH OF YOU IS WORTH? [CHEERS] THERE ARE LEGITIMATELY 7000 PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. THAT IS LIKE 7 MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND VOTING POWER. THAT IS THE POWER YOU ALL HAVE TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD AND ADDRESS A CHALLENGE, A PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THAT PROBLEM, THAT CHALLENGES THIS. WHY IS DONALD TRUMP OUR PRESIDENT? [CHEERS] IF YOU TURN ON CABLE NEWS, YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS OUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF RUSSIA, RACISM, FACEBOOK, THE FBI, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, ON AND ON. BUT WE KNOW DIFFERENT. I'M A NUMBERS GUY, NEW HAMPSHIRE. I WAS WELL EDUCATED HERE. THE NUMBERS TELL A VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT STORY AS TO WHY DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT TODAY. HE'S A PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE ELIMINATED 4 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY IN MICHIGAN, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, MISSOURI, IOWA, AND IT HAPPENED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU LOST 12,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. WHEN YOU GO TO THOSE TOWNS AFTER THE MILL CLOSES, THE SHOPPING CENTER OF PEOPLE LEFT, THE SCHOOLS SHRANK. THE TOWN HAS NEVER RECOVERED. THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED IN MISERY, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN. THIS IS WHY DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHAT WE MUST FIGHT FOR. WE MADE A MISTAKE WHEN WE ACT LIKE DONALD TRUMP THE SOURCE OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. HE'S NOT. HE'S A SYMPTOM OF A DISEASE THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING UP IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR YEARS AND DECADES. [CHEERS] THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE CURE THE DISEASE? IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN, YOU HEARD THAT I'M SAYING, WE SHOULD GIVE EVERY AMERICAN $1000 A MONTH FROM AGE 18 UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE. [CHEERS] I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY DRAMATIC POLICY. THIS IS NOT MY IDEA. IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA. , IS FOR THIS AT THE FOUNDING OF OUR COUNTRY. MARTIN LUTHER KING FOUGHT FOR IT IN THE 60'S. MILTON FRIEDMAN ENDORSED IT. IT PASSED THE U.S. HOUSE TWICE AND 71. ONE STATE ACTUALLY HAS A DIVIDEND WHERE EVERYONE IN THE STATE GETS BETWEEN $1000 AND $2000 A YEAR, NO QUESTION ASKED. WHAT STATE IS THAT? HOW DO THEY PAY FOR IT? WHAT IS THE OIL OF THE 21ST CENTURY? TECHNOLOGY, DATA, AI, SELF DRIVING CARS AND TRUCKS. A STUDY JUST CAME OUT THAT SAID OUR DATA, YOUR DATA IS NOW WORTH MORE THAN OIL. HOW MANY OF YOU SAW THAT STUDY? HOW MANY OF YOU GOT YOUR DATA CHECK IN THE MAIL LAST MONTH? IF YOU DIDN'T GET THE DATA CHECK, WHERE DID IT GO? AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, APPLE, THE TRILLION DOLLAR TECH COMPANIES THAT ARE PAYING NEXT TO NOTHING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS WHAT WE MUST FIGHT FOR, NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE RECORD HIGH CORPORATE PROFITS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. WHAT ELSE ARE AT RECORD HIGHS? SUICIDE, DRUG OVERDOSE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, STRESS, FINANCIAL INSECURITY, STUDENT LOAN DEBT, MEDICAL BANKRUPTCY, MENTAL ILLNESS, DEPRESSION. WHAT ARE AT RECORD LOWS IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW? GETTING MARRIED, HAVING A CHILD, STARTING A BUSINESS FOR A YOUNG PERSON. WE ARE FOLLOWING GDP AND CORPORATE PROFITS OFF A CLIFF, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THEY ARE LEADING US THE WRONG DIRECTION. I KNOW HOW OFF OUR ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS ARE. MY WIFE IS AT HOME EVERY DAY WITH OUR BOYS, ONE IS AUTISTIC. HOW MUCH IS HER WORK VALUED AT IN A MARKET ECONOMY? SHE GETS A ZERO AS DOES EVERY'S OTHER STAY-AT-HOME PARENT IN OUR COUNTRY. HOW ABOUT CAREGIVERS TAKING CARE OF AILING LOVED ONES? ALSO ZERO. HOW ABOUT VOLUNTEERS AND ACTIVISTS TRYING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER IN OUR COMMUNITIES? HOW ABOUT COACHES AND MENTORS INVESTIGATE OUR KIDS? HOW ABOUT MOST ARTISTS? AND INCREASINGLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT'S A PROBLEM YOU SHOULD CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. HOW ABOUT LOCAL JOURNALISTS? IT IS VERY HARD TO HAVE A DEMOCRACY FUNCTION WHEN PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. [CHEERS] THESE ARE THE THINGS WE CLAIM TO VALUE MOST IN OUR LIVES, OUR CHILDREN, OUR FAMILIES, OUR COMMUNITY, OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE GETTING ZEROED OUT ONE BY ONE. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST REVERSE. WE HAVE TO LET OUR FELLOW AMERICANS KNOW THAT ECONOMIC VALUES AND HUMAN VALUES ARE NOT THE SAME THING. THAT WE EACH HAVE INTRINSIC VALUE AS AMERICANS, AS PEOPLE, AND AS OWNERS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [CHEERS] NEW HAMPSHIRE, I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I DREAMT ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT. THOSE WERE NOT THE CONVERSATIONS IN THE YANG HOUSEHOLD. MY PARENTS WERE NOT LIKE, YOU WILL BE PRESIDENT SOMEDAY. THEY WERE MORE LIKE, YOU ARE TERRIBLE, CLEAN YOUR ROOM. [LAUGHTER] I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I'M A PARENT AND PATRIOT. I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE THAT LIES AHEAD FOR OUR KIDS. IT IS NOT SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT FOR THEM. THEY DESERVE BETTER AND WE MUST GIVE THEM BETTER, STARTING ON TUESDAY. [CHEERS] NEW HAMPSHIRE, DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT TODAY BECAUSE HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE, COMPELLING MESSAGE FOR OUR COUNTRY. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHAT DID HILLARY CLINTON SAY IN RESPONSE? AMERICA IS ALREADY GREAT. YOUR MEMBER THAT? THAT RESPONSE DID NOT WORK FOR MANY AMERICANS BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ALL TOO REAL. WE HAVE TO WOULD KNOWLEDGE THEIR DEPTH AND SEVERITY AND REALITY. WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD. WHAT WERE DONALD TRUMP'S SOLUTIONS? BUILD A WALL, TURN THE CLOCK BACK, BRING THE OLD JOBS BACK. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF THESE THINGS. WE HAVE TO TURN THE CLOCK FORWARD. WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE OUR ECONOMY AND ARRIVE TO THE REAL CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE TO EVOLVE IN THE WAY WE SEE OURSELVES AND OUR WORK AND OUR VALUES. I AM THE IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR THIS JOB, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE OPPOSITE OF DONALD TRUMP IS AN ASIAN MAN WHO LIKES MATH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. LET'S MAKE AMERICA THINK CARTER AND MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD ON TUESDAY. LET'S GIVE OUR KIDS OF FUTURE WE WILL BE PROUD TO LEAVE TO THEM. THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE, I LOVE YOU. [CHEERS] WE KNOW THAT , I SAID LAST NIGHT ON TV, DONALD TRUMP CAN WIN UNLESS WE TAKE HIS , KICK HIS ASS ON THE ECONOMY. IF YOU SAW THE UNION LEADER YESTERDAY, HE TOOK OUT A FULL-PAGE AD. THE TOP OF IT WAS, DEMOCRATS WILL KILL NEW HAMPSHIRE JOBS. THE BOTTOM HALF WAS HOW GREAT HE WAS. WE WILL HAVE TO KICK HIS ASS ON THE ECONOMY AND SEND HIM HOME IN NEW VENDOR. , NOVEMBER. [CHEERS] LET ME JUST SAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME, MY MOM TAUGHT IN THE NEW YORK SCHOOLS. WHEN SHE RETIRED, SHE TAUGHT THE PRISONERS IN THE BROOKLYN HOUSE OF DETENTION. MY DAD GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AT THE AGE OF 18. HE BECAME A LAWYER, HE QUIT THE LAW TO GO INTO THE NAVY. HE ENDED UP PROSECUTING NAZI WAR CRIMINALS AFTER THE WAR. [CHEERS] WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING WRONG IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, FIGHT IT. I STARTED A BUSINESS. I BUILT A BUSINESS. I WALKED AWAY FROM THE BUSINESS. I TOOK THE PLEDGE TO GIVE THE BULK OF MY MONEY AWAY WHILE I'M ALIVE TO GOOD CAUSES. FOR 10 YEARS, I'VE ORGANIZED COALITIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND UNION MEMBERS TO BEAT CORPORATIONS. [CHEERS] LET ME TELL YOU THIS, WE'VE NEVER LOST. WE BEAT THE OIL COMPANIES. WE BEAT THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. WE BEAT THE DRUG COMPANIES AND UTILITIES. THEY ARE NOT THAT SMART. WE CAN BEAT THEM EVERY TIME. LET ME SAY THIS. THAT'S AS AN OUTSIDER WHAT I'VE DONE. AS AN OUTSIDER, I WILL BE TO THOSE CORPORATIONS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT'S WHY I AM FOR TERM LIMITS. 12 YEARS, CONGRESS PEOPLE AND SENATORS. YOU WANT CHANGE, GET NEW AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN CHARGE. [CHEERS] LET ME SAY THIS. I'M ALSO THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WILL SAY, CLIMATE IS MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. IT HAS TO BE. IT HAS TO BE. [CHEERS] WE COULD END THE WORLD. WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT CREATES 4.5 MILLION GOOD PLAYING , PAYING UNION JOBS. WE START IN THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING POISONED EVERYDAY THROUGH THE AIR AND WATER. [CHEERS] WE WIN ON CLIMATE. BUT WE KNOW MR. TRUMP IS RUNNING ON THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO TAKE HIS ASS WHEN HE LIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY. I CAN DO IT. 30 YEARS IN BUSINESS, I CAN DO IT. THE MONEY IS ONLY GOING TO RICH PEOPLE. WHEN HE SAYS, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW. THE ANSWER IS, YES, BUT YOU CANNOT LIVE AT THE JOBS ON SEVEN DOLLARS FOR THE FIVE CENTS AN HOUR. [CHEERS] WE HAVE TO KICK HIS ASKED , ASS ON THE ECONOMY AND PULL TOGETHER THE GLORIOUSLY DIVERSE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE DON'T WIN UNLESS EVERYBODY SHOWS UP IN NOVEMBER 2020 AND WE OUTNUMBER THEM AT THE POLLS. THAT'S HOW WE WIN. WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT WHO TO NOMINATE, WE ARE ALL BETTER THAN MR. TRUMP BY A MILLION TIMES. [CHEERS] A MILLION TIMES. THE QUESTION IS, WE SHOULD ONLY NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE HIS ASS ON THE ECONOMY AND I CAN DO IT. WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER THIS FANTASTIC, DIVERSE PARTY. I CAN DO IT. WE HAVE TO SHOW UP IN NOVEMBER 20 AND NOT JUST BE TRUMP. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE WHOLE GANG. WE WILL BREAK OUR OATH, LULA NORTH THE EVIDENCE, WE WILL NOT PERMIT WITNESSES. WE WILL DO THE WRONG THING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO STAY IN POWER. I'M ASKING YOU GUYS, AS DEMOCRATS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ON TUESDAY, LET'S GO SHOW UP AND KICK THEIR ASS. THAT'S THE JOB. KICK THEIR ASS ON TUESDAY, NEXT MONTH, IN NOVEMBER. THAT'S THE JOB OF DEMOCRATS. I CAN DO IT. LET'S DO IT. [CHEERS] WE'VE HAD THE , THREE YEARS NOW OF DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL. IN FACT, IT WAS EXACTLY THREE YEARS AGO YESTERDAY THAT MITCH MCCONNELL PITCHED ME OFF THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE FOR READING A LETTER FROM RHODA SCOTT KING. MITCH MCCONNELL SAID THOSE WORDS THAT WOMEN HAVE PUT ON T-SHIRTS, HAVE EMBROIDERED ON PILLOWS, HAVE HAD TATTOOED ON THEIR BODIES. NEVERTHELESS, SHE PERSISTED. [CHEERS] NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THIS FIGHT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP MAY NOT BE WINNABLE. I'VE BEEN WINNING UNWINNABLE FIGHTS PRETTY MUCH ALL OF MY LIFE. [CHEERS] EVEN SO, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT WHAT RACES AREN'T WINNABLE OR WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE CAN'T WIN. THE WAY I SEE IT, THEY WILL KEEP SAYING THAT RIGHT UP UNTIL WE GET IN THE FIGHT, WE PERSIST, AND WE WIN. [CHEERS] NOW, IT'S BEEN THREE LONG YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP AND A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE AFRAID. THEY ARE AFRAID FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND AFRAID FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE AFRAID FOR CHILDREN, AFRAID FOR CHILDREN IN LOCKDOWN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AFRAID FOR WOMEN, AFRAID FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, AFRAID FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE, AFRAID FOR TRANS PEOPLE, ALL OF WHOSE RIGHTS ARE UP FOR GRABS IN THIS SUPREME COURT. AFRAID FOR OUR COUNTRY AND AFRAID FOR OUR PLANET. THE DANGER IS REAL. OUR DEMOCRACY HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IT'S UP TO YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT WILL BE UP TO YOU. WHAT DO YOU DO AT THIS MOMENT? DO YOU BACKUP? DO YOU LEAN BACK? OR DO YOU GET IN THE FIGHT? ME, I'M GETTING IN THE FIGHT. [CHEERS] WE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE KING TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY. WE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE SCOURGE OF SLAVERY TO PROTECT THIS UNION. WE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY. WE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST FASCISM TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY. AMERICANS ARE AT THEIR BEST WHEN THEY SEE A PROBLEM AND THEY FIGHT BACK. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. [CHEERS] THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR SMALL IDEAS. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES OF PROBLEMS. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE VAGUE AND ELUSIVE. THIS IS A TIME TO STEP UP. WHEN WE SEE A BIG PROBLEM, OFFER A BIG SOLUTION AND FIGHT FOR IT. [CHEERS] NOW, I'M NOT RUNNING A RACE THAT HAS BEEN SHAPED BY A BUNCH OF CONSULTANTS. I'M NOT OFFERING A BUNCH OF PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNED NOT TO OFFEND BIG DONORS. I PASSED THAT A LONG TIME AGO. [CHEERS] I'M RUNNING A RACE BASED ON A LIFETIME OF FIGHTING FOR WORKING FAMILIES. I'M RUNNING A RACE FROM THE HEART. I'M RUNNING A RACE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU. I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE CAN BUILD TOGETHER. I BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD AN AMERICA IN WHICH EVERY PERSON HAS VALUE. WE CAN BUILD AN AMERICA IN WHICH EVERY CHILD IS WORTH INVESTING IN. WE CAN BUILD AN AMERICA WITH A DEMOCRACY WHERE PEOPLE, NOT MONEY, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. [CHEERS] I BELIEVE IN THAT AMERICA. AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT AMERICA IS POSSIBLE AND YOU BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR, THEN I'M ASKING YOU, GET IN THIS FIGHT. JOIN ME. BUT FOR ME ON TUESDAY. THE ELIZABETH WARREN. PITCH IN FIVE THE BUCS , FIVE BUCKS, VOLUNTEER. BE PART OF THIS FIGHT. UNDERSTAND, THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY COMES TO US. THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY WILL NOT COME OUR WAY AGAIN. YOU WILL DECIDE THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY, NOT FOR FOUR YEARS, NOT FOR EIGHT YEARS, BUT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. THIS IS OUR [CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME BEGIN, LET ME BEGIN BY CONGRATULATING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AS YOUR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE RIVER, I HAVE BEEN EXCITED TO SEE THAT OVER THE YEARS, YOU HAVE ELECTED TO DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATORS, TWO DEMOCRATIC U.S. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. NOW IT'S TIME TO ELECT A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. [CHEERS] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. WHAT I WANTED TO SAY, WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND THE CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING, I KNOW THAT I SPEAK FOR EVERY CANDIDATE THAT NO MATTER WHO WINS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, WE ARE GOING TO COME TOGETHER TO DEFEAT THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS] SENATORS AND I SAT THROUGH THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. I WAS STUNNED THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE REPUBLICAN WHO HAD THE CONSCIENCE AND THE MORALITY TO VOTE TO IMPEACH THIS CORRUPT PRESIDENT WHO HAS CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS, THE CONSTITUTION, AND SEPARATION OF POWERS. [CHEERS] WE RUN THE REALIGNMENT BOAT , VOTE BY 2500. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE VOLUNTEER SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE, WE ARE GOING TO WIN HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL. [CHEERS] I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR PLAYING AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MOVING THIS COUNTRY FORWARD IN A PROGRESSIVE WAY. FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS HERE CAMPAIGNING, MANY OF THE IDEAS WE TALKED ABOUT, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO 15 BUCKS AN HOUR, THOSE IDEAS THEN WERE CONSIDERED RADICAL. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE NOT RADICAL TODAY. SEVEN STATES HAVE PASSED A $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. [CHEERS] FOUR YEARS AGO, WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION FREE AND CANCELING STUDENT DEBT. RADICAL THEN, NOT SO RADICAL TODAY. [CHEERS] ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, STATES AND CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE SAID THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. NOT A PRIVILEGE. [CHEERS] FOUR YEARS AGO, THOSE IDEAS SEEMED RADICAL. THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, WITH GREAT COURAGE, SAID NO, THESE ARE NOT RADICAL IDEAS. THESE ARE THE IDEAS THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE WORKING CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY NEEDS. [CHEERS] SO I WANT TO THANK NEW HAMPSHIRE. I WANT TO THANK NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR HELPING TO LEAD THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION THAT BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW IS THE TIME NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER, TO END THE DIVISIVENESS, THE RACISM, THE LIES, THE HOMOPHOBIA, THE XENOPHOBIA, THE RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. [CHEERS] AND NOW IS THE TIME. NOT ONLY TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP BUT TO TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY AND CREATE A GOVERNMENT AND AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US, NOT JUST THE 1%. THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT. I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CHEERS] NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY. IT DOES SEEM THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE AN UNFIT AND UNKIND PRESIDENT. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: I SAW A SIGN OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE IN CONCORD THAT READ, ANY FUNCTIONING UNTIL 2020. , ADULT 2020. I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT. BUT HAVING TALKED TO THOUSANDS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, I'M PERSUADED THAT REPLACING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN FACT NOT ENOUGH. SEE, THE CHEERY ECONOMIC INDICATORS WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW SO LONG AS YOU COUNT BOTH OR ALL THREE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS PEOPLE HAD JUST TO SURVIVE. INFLATION IS LOW. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T COUNT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE OR HOUSING OR EDUCATION, THE VERY THINGS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO LIFT THEMSELVES AND MOVE FORWARD. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: YOU KNOW IT. I DO. AND SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING AWAY TO MAKE AWAY. IN MORE THAN A FEW SUBURBS, FOLKS ARE USING CREDIT CARDS AND FOOD PANTRY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OVER ARE TRAPPED, EITHER BY STUDENT DEBT OR A CRIMINAL RECORD. SEE, IT IS TRUE THAT A PRESIDENT WHO DEMEANS THE VULNERABLE, WHO CAGES CHILDREN, WHO WAKES UP EVERY DAY TRYING TO DIVIDE US MAKES IT WORSE. BUT IT WAS TRUE BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THE POOR WERE STUCK IN POVERTY AND THE MIDDLE CLASS WERE JUST A PAYCHECK OR TWO AWAY FROM BEING POOR. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKING THEMSELVES TODAY QUESTIONS NOT JUST ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATE OR THE PARTY, BUT ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE ASKING WHETHER THERE IS A PLACE FOR THEM IN AMERICA'S FUTURE. AND IT IS THE SAME QUESTION ASKED FOR GENERATIONS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I GREW UP IN. ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF CHICAGO IN POVERTY, WE WERE SURROUNDED BY BROKEN SIDEWALKS, BROKEN SCHOOLS, BROKEN FAMILIES. AND YET, THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD NO REASON TO GAVE ME A REASON TO HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND WITH THAT FAITH, I HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL TO SERVE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER AND CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, AS A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE AND A BUSINESS FOUNDER, AND A TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: AND THAT WORK , YOU SEE, I DIDN'T DISCOVER IN JUSTICE JUST LATELY. , INJUSTICE JUST LATELY. I THOUGHT AGAINST IT AND BUY ONE. , I WON. I UNDERSTAND THE NAGGING INSECURITIES AND UNFAIRNESS THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING ALL OVER AMERICA TODAY. I UNDERSTAND HOW UNSEEN AND UNHEARD THEY ARE. AND WE NEED TO ANSWER THEM. NOT WITH A PROPOSAL TO JUST GET EVEN, BUT WITH A PROPOSAL TO GET BETTER. TO BE BETTER. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: I SEE THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE POLICY, THE VOICES I HEAR OVER THE APPLAUSE LINE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO SEE THE PEOPLE WE SERVE OR SEEK TO SERVE. BECAUSE WE DID, I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT AFTER EIGHT YEARS, THE CHILDREN OF MASSACHUSETTS RANK AS HIGH AS YOU CAN GET IN AMERICA IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. 99% OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS HAVE HEALTH CARE TODAY. THAT THE COAL PLANTS IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE CLOSED, THE ENERGY IS CLEANER, AND WE REACHED THE GOALS OF THE PARIS ACCORD SIX YEARS AGO. [CHEERS] [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE CAME OUT OF RECESSION AND EIGHT , AT A 25 YEAR EMPLOYMENT HIGH. WHY? WE SEE THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. WE HEAR THEIR VOICES ABOVE THE APPLAUSE LINE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE ABOUT. WE ALSO HAVE TO REJECT FALSE CHOICES. I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HATE REPUBLICANS TO BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HATE BUSINESS TO BE A SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIOR. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HATE POLICE TO BELIEVE BLACK LIVES MATTER. REJECT FALSE CHOICES. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: HOW ABOUT WE SET ASIDE THE TRAFFICKING AND START MAKING ROOM IN OUR PLANS AND IN OUR HEARTS FOR THE WOKE AND THE STILL WAKING? GOV. PATRICK: , [CHEERS] HOW ABOUT WE ALSO START TRUSTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? ALL OF THEM. THEY ARE READY. THEY ARE READY. THEY ARE READY FOR A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA THAT SPEAKS TO THEM. IF WE WILL MAKE ROOM FOR THEM. ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I KNOW THEY ARE READY. AT THE END OF MY SECOND TERM, WE WERE DEALING WITH A CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER VERY LIKE THE ONE TODAY. THOUSANDS OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN FLEEING VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, RUNNING ACROSS OUR BORDERS. THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WERE OVERWHELMED THEN JUST AS THEY ARE TODAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED A NUMBER OF GOVERNORS IF WE WOULD SHELTER THOSE CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE BEING PROCESSED AS REFUGEES. I AGREE. , AGREED. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: AND I EXPLAINED MY DECISION AS COMING FROM A PLACE OF BOTH PATRIOTISM AND FAITH. EVEN SO, ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I WAS CALLED EVERYTHING BUT A CHILD OF GOD. A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THAT DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED, I WAS RUNNING ERRANDS AT THE LOCAL HOME DEPOT. I WAS CONFRONTED BY A VERY ANGRY MAN IN THE CHECKOUT LINE. HE SHOUTED AT ME. HE SAID, GOVERNOR, I THINK YOUR DECISION WAS WRONG. MY OWN WIFE CAME HERE AS A LEGAL IMMIGRANT. THAT'S THE WAY YOU NOT TO BE. I JUST THINK YOU WANT TO KNOW I THINK YOU ARE WRONG. I THANKED HIM FOR HIS FEEDBACK. NOW I HAD SIX OTHER ENCOUNTERS IN THAT STORE THAT SAME DAY ON THE SAME SUBJECT. AND IN EACH OF THOSE, SOMEONE WHISPERED, GOVERNOR YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. GOVERNOR, THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR THOSE KIDS. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: THE CALLS TO THE OFFICE WHERE THREE TO ONE IN FAVOR OF SHELTERING THOSE CHILDREN. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO SHOUT OUR ANGER AND TO WHISPER OUR KINDNESS AND IT IS COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN. [CHEERS] GOV. PATRICK: WE NEED TO LEARN AGAIN TO SHOUT KINDNESS, TO SHOUT COMPASSION, DISH OUT JUSTICE. THAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. IF THAT'S THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP YOU WANT, YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO REMINDS YOU TO SHOUT JUSTICE, I AM YOUR GUY. I ASK FOR YOUR HELP AND YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND GOOD NIGHT. [CHEERS] I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. I'VE SPENT MORE TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN THE SELECTION. [CHEERS] [CHEERS] , THIS ELECTION. [CHEERS] I'VE STARTED TO RUN OUT OF PLACES TO GO. THAT'S WHY TOMORROW, I WILL MAKE MY WAY TO DIX FIELD BOX IN THE NORTH COUNTRY. I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW. THE UNITED STATES SENATE HAS A 9% APPROVAL RATING. A 9% APPROVAL RATING. I ONCE TOOK A CHART TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND ASKED, WHAT ELSE HAS A 9% APPROVAL RATE? NOBODY ELSE DOES. THE IRS HAS A 40% APPROVAL RATING. [LAUGHTER] MORE PEOPLE WANT THIS COUNTRY TO BE A COMMUNIST COUNTRY, 11%, THEN APPROVE OF THE SENATE. FIDEL CASTRO HAS A 5% APPROVAL RATING. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS. IF WE JUST HAD A FEW MORE SENATORS LIKE THE ONES HERE, WE WOULD HAVE A 90% APPROVAL RATING , NOT A 9% APPROVAL RATING. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] , SEN. BENNET: IF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN TO ONE OF MY TOWN HALLS, YOU KNOW I START THEM BY SAYING, I WILL TAKE EVERY QUESTION AND I WILL TAKE ANY CRITICISM. I SAY TO PEOPLE, ASK ME THE QUESTIONS YOU WOULDN'T ASK ANOTHER POLITICIAN BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE WORRIED THAT YOU WOULD HURT THEIR FEELINGS. I TELL THEM, I WAS AN URBAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT FOR YEARS. YOU CAN'T HURT MY FEELINGS. THEY'VE BEEN BEATEN OUT OF ME A LONG TIME AGO. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE HAD A VERY CANDID CONVERSATION HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU'VE ASKED ALL OF US TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. ONE IS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP? THAT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. THE OTHER QUESTION YOU ASKED EACH OF US IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THAT QUESTION IS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE BACK THERE? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE? THAT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION TO ASK. OUR GOVERNMENT IS IMMOBILIZED. OUR GOVERNMENT IS BROKEN. IT'S NOT BY ACCIDENT. IT HAS BEEN BROKEN BY THE IDEOLOGICAL AMBITION OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS. IT HAS BEEN BROKEN BY THE CYNICISM OF MITCH MCCONNELL. IT HAS BEEN BROKEN BY THE INCOMPETENCE OF DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY I KNOW TO BE AS CYNICAL AND MALEVOLENT AS MITCH MCCONNELL. I THINK IT IS HIGH TIME THAT WE WERE AS STRATEGIC AS MITCH MCCONNELL. [APPLAUSE] LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND FROM YESTERDAY'S NEWSPAPER. MITCH MCCONNELL WAS TAKING A VICTORY LAP FROM HIS COVER-UP OF THE PRESIDENT'S MISDEEDS IN WASHINGTON. HE WAS TAKING A VICTORY LAP FOR THE INABILITY OF THE SENATE TO HEAR WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD LITERALLY POUND ON THE DOORS OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL. WE ARE TOO BUSY TO HEAR THAT, THE SENATE SAYS. A SENATE THAT VOTED ON 26 AMENDMENTS LAST YEAR. A SENATE THAT PASSED EIGHT AMENDMENTS LAST YEAR. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE FREEDOM CAUCUS WANTS. THAT'S WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL WANTS. AS LONG AS HE'S PUTTING RIGHT-WING JUDGES ON THE COURT AND CUTTING THE TAXES OF RICH PEOPLE EVERY NOW AND THEN, HE'S GETTING WHAT HE WANTS. THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS. THIS IS HIS END STATE. YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY IN THE NEWSPAPER, WHAT HE SAID WAS, I DIDN'T HOLD BACK WITNESSES. I DIDN'T HOLD BACK DOCUMENTS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES. HE SAID THEY, THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES. AND THEN HE SAID, THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND WIN MORE ELECTIONS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE VOTES. I HATE TO SAY IT, GUESS WHAT? MITCH MCCONNELL IS RIGHT. WE NEED TO GO OUT AND WIN MORE ELECTIONS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE OTHERWISE, THESE IDEAS DON'T MATTER THAT YOU HEARD TONIGHT. OTHERWISE, THESE IDEAS ARE JUST BUMPER STICKERS OR WAYS OF RAISING MONEY ONLINE. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO WIN ELECTIONS. WE HAVE TO WIN ELECTIONS AND PURPLE STATES. I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO WON TWO NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN A PURPLE STATE. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN RUNNING IN THE BLESSED COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN RUNNING IN VERMONT. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN RUNNING IN CALIFORNIA. I AM RUNNING ON AN AGENDA THAT CAN UNIFY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ALLOW US TO WIN IN THESE PURPLE STATES. IT'S CALLED THE REAL DEAL. IT IS PROGRESSIVE AND IT ADDRESSES DIRECTLY THE NEEDS OF OUR MIDDLE-CLASS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE OF CLASS. LET ME TELL YOU, BEFORE I WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THIS JOB AND BEFORE I WAS IN THE SENATE, I WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 95,000 KIDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU WARM PEOPLE, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. 95,000 KIDS, MOST OF WHOM ARE KIDS IN POVERTY AND KIDS OF COLOR. THEIR PARENTS COME INTO MY TOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING THREE JOBS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD SAY? MICHAEL, WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES AND NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, WE CAN'T GET OUR KIDS OUT OF POVERTY. AND IF WE DON'T WIN ELECTIONS, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. AND OUR KIDS CAN'T FIX THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. OUR KIDS CAN'T FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. OUR KIDS CAN'T FIX CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR KIDS CAN'T CHANGE OUR TAX CODE SO WORK PACE AGAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S THE WORK WE HAVE TO DO. THAT'S WHY WE CANNOT LOSE. THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO BE A ONE TERM PRESIDENT. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP ON TUESDAY. I CAN BE DONALD TRUMP. BEST BEAT DONALD TRUMP. , I CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THEY DO COME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [CHEERS] (music) HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE. ALOHA. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

I AM THAT PERSON BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH. I HAVE BEEN SERVING NOW IN CONGRESS GOING ON EIGHT YEARS, FOCUSED ON OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY, SERVING ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, ON THE ARMED SERVICES AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN SERVING AS A SOLDIER. I AM A MAJOR IN THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD SERVING FOR 17 YEARS. I WAS DEPLOYED TWICE TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE I'VE EXPERIENCED THE HIGH HUMAN COST OF WAR. I BRING THE COMBINATION OF THIS EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS MORE EXPERIENCE IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY THAN MOST OTHER CANDIDATES COMBINED. TO BE PREPARED TO WALK IN ON DAY ONE AND SERVE YOU AS YOU ARE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THE CHOICE IS OURS. THE CHOICE IS OURS TO USHER IN A FRESH NEW ERA, WHERE OUR CAN ONCE AGAIN BE A BEACON OF LIGHT. A BEACON OF HOPE. A BEACON OF OPPORTUNITY. MY PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IS TO BRING A SOLDIER VALUES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THESE VALUES OF HONOR AND RESPECT, INTEGRITY AND SERVICE. PUTTING THE WELL-BEING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST. THIS IS THE CHANGE THAT WE TOGETHER SEEK TO BRING ABOUT FOR OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU ARE READY TO DELIVER DEFEAT TO DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR, AND TO USHER IN A VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEN I INVITE YOU TO STAND WITH ME. IF YOU ARE READY TO USHER IN A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, A FUTURE THAT ENSURES FREEDOM, RESPECT AND TRUE EQUALITY FOR ALL AMERICANS, I INVITE YOU TO STAND WITH ME.

CSPANJB92202046	Joe Biden	2020-02-09	Joe Biden Campaign Event in Hudson New Hampshire	IMPORTANT TO ME. WE HAVE A LARGE FIELD OF TALENTED CANDIDATES BUT ONLY ONE STANDS OUT WITH THE QUALITIES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. FOR ME, IT IS VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. AND I AM PROUD TO ENDORSE HIM FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS A PROVEN LEADER. HE IS A STATESMAN. AND A FIGHTER WHEN HE NEEDS TO BE. HE IS A MAN WHO HAVE SHOWN US WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE HAS DONE. HE HAS CHAMPIONED IMPORTANT CAUSES SUCH AS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, FIGHTING FOR THE A FORMAL CARE ACT, AND TURNING PERSONAL TRAGEDY INTO A CHALLENGE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH THE NATIONAL CANCER MOON SHOT INITIATIVE. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS JOE BIDEN WHO CAN MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD TOGETHER. AND WILL ENGAGE THE MANY BRILLIANT CIVIL-SERVICE WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO RESTORE FAITH IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THE LEADERS WE ELECT NOW WILL DETERMINE OUR NATIONS TRAJECTORY FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS AND BEYON D. THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT. WE MUST CHOOSE LEADERS WHO WILL BRING US TOGETHER AND TO ENSURE WE BUILD A PATH TO THE FUTURE THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND PROSPEROUS FOR ALL OF US. LEADERS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO FIGHT FOR OUR SHARED VALUES, LIKE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, LIKE ACTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND REPAIRING OUR STANDING ON THE WORLD STAGE. THIS ELECTION IS TOO IMPORTANT TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES. IF WE WANT TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY, WE MUST FIGHT FOR IT. THAT STARTS WITH ELECTING A LEADER WHO WE CAN BE PROUD OF. AND WHO WILL WORK TIRELESSLY FOR ALL OF US. [APPLAUSE] BOY, MY HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL GAMES NEVER DREW CROWDS LIKE THIS. HELLO. WE'RE DOWN TO THE WIRE NOW. WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I AM MICHELLE, I AM AN OVERWORKED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, GRANITE STATER AND A PROUD MOM OF TWO AMAZING BOYS WHO ARE ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WE ARE STANDING JOE BIDEN TODAY. [APPLAUSE] I WANT YOU ALL TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU ARE EATING ICE CREAM WITH YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD, GRANDCHILD, KNEES OR NEPHEW, AND SUDDENLY THEY START TO STARE OFF, THEY START TO SLUR THEIR WORDS AND THEY FALL OVER WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO STAND UP. NEXT, YOU ARE IN THE PARKING LOT OF A MALL CALLING 911. NOW IMAGINE AFTER A YEAR OF ANTI-SEIZURE MEDICATIONS AND FEARING EVERY DAY YOUR CHILD WILL HAVE A VERY DANGEROUS SEIZURE, YOU ARE ACTUALLY TOLD YOUR FOUR-YEAR-OLD DOES NOT HAVE EPILEPSY, BUT HAS A RARE NEAR A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT OCCURS IN LESS THAN 20 CHILDREN BORN IN THE U.S. EACH YEAR. YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOUR CHILD WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SEIZURES THAT WILL ONLY WORSEN, HE WILL RAPIDLY PROGRESSED TO DEMENTIA. HE WILL LOSE THE ABILITY TO WALK AND TALK AND WILL BECOME BLIND. BY SIX YEARS OF AGE, YOUR CHILD WILL BE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON CAREGIVERS AND WILL LOSE HIS LIFE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 8 AND 12 YEARS OLD. YOU ARE TOLD BY THE DOCTORS OF ONE OF THE BEST HOSPITALS IN THE WORLD TO GO HOME, HUG YOUR CHILD, AND SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO CURE. THIS IS OUR STORY. AND WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FIGHTING FOR. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BLESSED TO GIVE OUR FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON INTO A CLINICAL TRIAL WHICH ACTUALLY IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO AN APPROVED TREATMENT, THE FIRST EVER TREATMENT FOR HIS DISEASE. WE ARE STILL FIGHTING BUT AT LEAST NOW WE FEEL WE HAVE TIME. OUR SON GOES FOR BIWEEKLY TREATMENTS. IF WE LOSE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WE LOSE OUR INSURANCE BECAUSE OF HIS PRE-EXISTING CONDITION OR BECAUSE OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN PUT ONTO US, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD ONE OF HIS TREATMENTS. OUR SON IS ABOUT TO TURN 10 YEARS OLD NEXT MONTH. [APPLAUSE] AND HE IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST CHILD EVER IN THE U.S. WITH HIS FORM OF BATTEN DISEASE THAT IS STILL WALKING ON HIS OWN AND TALKING. [APPLAUSE] MY FAMILY, WE HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND MY HUSBAND AND I KNEW FROM THE VERY MOMENT WE MET HIM, HE SAW US, HE HEARD US, AND HE WOULD REMEMBER US. [APPLAUSE] HE IS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIS OWN AGENDA. HE'S NOT ABOUT MAKING CHANGE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE. HE IS ALL ABOUT FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES LIKE OURS AND ALL OF YOURS. NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FIGHTING FOR AMERICANS. IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE HAS TO. IT IS BECAUSE THAT IS A PART OF WHOO HE IS. [APPLAUSE] NOW, HELP ME WELCOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] (music) WHOA, HELLO, EVERYBODY. HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. IT'S GREAT TO BE IN HUDSON.

THAT IS ALL ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE MY MOM AND DAD, MY SISTER AND MY BROTHERS WHO I WAS RAISED WITH. ORDINARY PEOPLE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE TO DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. BUT NEVER BEING PUT BEHIND THE 8BALL WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET UP, DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET BACK. AS I LISTEN TO YOU, MICHELLE, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE SAME THOUGHTS I HSAD WHEN BEAU CAME HOME. WHEN THEY DIAGNOSED HIS CONDITION COMING HOME AFTER BEING IN IRAQ. I SAID, WHAT DO WE DO? GO HOME AND LOVE HIM. THEY SAID, HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE. HE CAME FROM IRAQ. A WAR HERO, BRONZE STAR. AND DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS, STAGE IV NEAL BLASPHEMER. , NEO BLASTOMA. WE ASKED THE DOCTOR. WHAT DO YOU DO? HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. NO ONE WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST HIM. HAVE HIM GO HOME AND RUN FOR GOVERNOR. BUT, DOC, YOU TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE THERE. HE SAID, NO, BUT THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE. THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE. AND I DO REMEMBER, MICHELLE, YOU BROUGHT IT BACK. THAT THINKING TO MYSELF THAT WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT INSURANCE I HAD, THAT THEY GAVE HIM JUST MONTHS. AND HE OUTLIVED THE TIME. HE LASTED 14 MONTHS, IN A LOT OF PAIN. I KEPT PICKING TO MYSELF FOR REAL, WHAT THE HELL WOULD I DO IF, IN FACT, THE INSURANCE, AND HE DID NOT HAVE WE DID NOT CHANGE THE LAW. THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD SAY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE NOW. LIVE THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE IN PAIN ON EUROPE. , ON YOUR OWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE FACE THAT. A LOT OF AMERICANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE GONE THROUGH THINGS LIKE THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN IT IS ABOUT ME. I HAD A LOT OF HELP. PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT MORE THAN I HAVE GONE THROUGH, AND WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP AND FAMILY FRIENDS THAT I HAD. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT COMING IN A, ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL SO, SO STRONGLY ABOUT PROTECTING AND EXPANDING OBAMACARE IS BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED MY OWN FAMILY HOW IT WORKS. AND HOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO A TERMINAL DISEASE, PARTICULARLY CANCER, A LOVED ONE? RAISE YOUR HAND. ALMOST EVERY AUDIENCE I EVER SPEAK TO IN THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY I STARTED, THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT ALLOWED ME TO RUN A THING CALLED, WHEN WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO FOCUS ON CANCER AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND THAT IS WHY AFTER , I STARTED THE BIDEN FOUNDATION ON CANCER. BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO. WE CAN CHANGE MANY OF THESE 204 STRAINS OF CANCER THAT EXIST OUT THERE AND CHRONIC DISEASES, WE CAN CURE MANY OF THEM. MOST OF ALL, WHAT I FOUND, AND YOU FOUND, MICHELLE, YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE HOPE. IT DOES SPRING INTERNAL BECAUSE EVERY DAY THERE FINDING CURES FOR DISEASES THAT ARE NOT ANTICIPATED WHAT HAPPENS. BUT IT HAPPENS, IT TURNS THE CORNER. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE THING I CARE ABOUT AND LIKE ABOUT MICHE LLE BEYOND HER TENACITY, SHE IS ALSO A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. SHE KNOWS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF , WE NOW ONLY HAVE IN AMERICA ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1507 KIDS. ALL THE EXPERTS SAY YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 500 AND THE HIGH NUMBER 700 KIDS, BECAUSE THEY CAN PICK O UT EVERYTHING AND WE NEED MORE SCHOOL NURSES. WE NEED TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND SCHOOL HORSES. THEY CAN DETECT THINGS EARLY ON THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PICK UP, PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE IN A LOW INCOME CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE DOES NOT MATTER YOUR COLOR, YOUR RACE, WHERE A LOT LESS MONEY IS SPENT IN THAT SCHOOL WHERE PEOPLE COMING FROM DISTRESSED BACKGROUNDS ECONOMICALLY. THAT'S WHY I DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF NOT ONLY FOR SO-CALLED TITLE I SCHOOLS BECAUSE YOU CAN DETECT IN A KID, EVERYBODY HAS FIGURED OUT, SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS CAN TELL YOU, IT IS NOT DRUG ABUSE IS NOT CAUSED BY, MENTAL UNLESS IS NOT , DOES NOT CAUSE DRUG ABUSE. MENTAL ILLNESS IS CAUSED NOT BY DRUG ABUSE. IT OCCURS. IT CAUSES DRUG ABUSE. AND SO, WHEN YOU CAN IDENTIFY EARLY ON A KID, YOU CAN TELL WHEN THEY ARE 3, 4, 5 YEARS OLD, YOU CAN PICK IT UP, AND YOU CAN HELP THEM WITH THE ANXIETY THEY FEEL THAT RESULTS IN BEHAVIORS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND SO, SCHOOL NURSES. I DON'T KNOW, IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN DISTRICTS WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN HIRE A FEW MORE SCHOOLTEACHERS, OR SCHOOL NURSES OR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS OR SOCIAL WORKERS. BECAUSE FOLKS, HERE IS WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST. WHAT IS GOING ON NOW AS WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT THINK IN TERMS OF PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T THINK IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS. I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AT ALL OVER THE STATE. THE THINK ABOUT YOU ALL UP HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS YOU BASICALLY NO ONE ANOTHER, YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU CAN SENSE WHEN THINGS ARE WRONG. YOU CAN SENSE WHEN THINGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE AMERICAN CHARACTER, THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT TODAY. IT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED IN 2020 IN NOVEMBER. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. WHAT DO WE CARE ABOUT? WHAT OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING? WHAT IS THE LAWS WE ARE SEEKING TO PASS, AND WHAT IS THEIR PURPOSE? HOW MUCH WILL THEY COST AND ARE ABLE TO GET THEM DONE? FOLKS, AS I GO AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE NATION AND WORKING ON ROPE LINES, AND PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME. I WAS IN CLAREMONT WEEK AGO, I GUESS IT WAS. A GUY SAYS, CAN I TALK TO? I SAID, YEAH, I'LL GO THROUGH THIS ROPE LINE. I HAD STAFF TAKEN IN THE BACK. I WALKED BACK. HE WAS SHAKING. I'M GOING TO LOSE MY JOB, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, TO TELL MY FAMILY. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR HOUSE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WHAT DO I DO? AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING HE ASKED ME WHAT COULD HE DO. I TOLD HIM A STORY BAG AS HE HEADED HEARD , HE HAD HEARD IT. WHEN I WAS A KID MY DAD HAD TO MAKE THE SAME DECISION. MY DAD, I REMEMBER WALKING UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT HAS TO MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO TELL THEIR CHILD YOU CANNOT LIVE HERE ANY MORE. WE HAVE TO MOVE. DADDY OR MOMMY DOES NOT HAVE A JOB. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH GRANDPA OR GRANDMA IF YOU HAVE ONE. MY DAD MADE THAT WALK IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, JOEY, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE. HE BELIEVE IN THOSE DAYS, BACK IN THE 1950'S, IF GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE, HE COULD MAKE IT, AS LONG AS WE MOVE WITH THE , TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WERE JOBS. HE MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE WHERE HE LIVED FROM THIRD TO 11TH GRADE AND HE GOT A JOB. TOOK HIM ABOUT THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE FOR US, BUT WE FINALLY GOT A HOUSE, A THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE. FOUR KIDS AND GRAND POP LIVING WITH US BUT IT WAS OK. HE BELIEVE IT TODAY. HOW MANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS WHO HAD TO MAKE THAT LONG WALK AND YOU KNOW MADE THAT LONG WALK OR YOU'VE MADE THAT LONG WALK, HOW MANY OF YOU OUT THERE KNOW TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK? WE DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY LOOK AROUND. THE WORKING-CLASS IS GETTING CLOBBERED. THE BOTTOM HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE LISTED AS MIDDLE-CLASS THINKER CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAVE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? WHAT IS GOING ON NOW? WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? WHAT IS, YOU KNOW, WOODROW WILSON SAID A PARTY IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THAT FOR WHICH IT STANDS. WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE, GOOD, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE GOT AN EVEN SHOT. WE'RE NOT GETTING AN EVEN SHOT NOW. I SEE ITA ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE COMING UP UP TO ME. EVEN THE PRESS HE USED TO SAY, HE'S HUGGING WOMEN. GUESS WHAT? THEY ARE HUGGING ME , NOT BECAUSE THEY LOVE ME. THEY ARE HUGGING BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIGHTENED. THE HUNDREDS OF STORIES I HAVE BEEN TOLD. A WOMAN WALKED UP TO ME NOT LONG AGO , IT WAS A MAN WHO GAVE ME A HUG. HIS NAME WAS GENE. HE HAD TERMINAL CANCER IN YOUR STATE. I SAID, GENE, WHAT YOU DOING HERE? I HAVE PROSTATE CANCER, IT IS TERMINAL. I CAN'T MAKE IT. I'VE HAD MY SHOCKED BACK TO LIFE 8 TIMES. BECAUSE OF CARDIAC ISSUES IN ADDITION I SAID, WHY ARE YOU HERE? YOU SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF. HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT HE SAID, I'M HERE BECAUSE I GOT TO HAVE SOME PURPOSE. GOT TO HAVE SOME PURPOSE. AND HE SAID BUT THANK GOD, AT LEAST I HAVE SOME COVERAGE. BUT THIS IS A GUY. HIS WIFE. GOT TO HAVE PURPOSE. I'M IN TROUBLE. I'VE STAGE IV CANCER. AND NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT EVEN KNOWS THOSE PEOPLE EXIST OUT THERE? THERE FOR THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS. HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT APPEARING WE DO NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. I WAS INTRODUCED TO , I GUESS IT WAS FOUR, FIVE SIX DAYS AGO.. I CAN'T REMEMBER I AM LOSING TRACK OF TIME. BY A WOMAN NAMED CHRISSY. I WAS IN CONCORD. I HADN'T MET HER BEFORE. AS SHE TOLD THE TALE OF BEING VICTIMIZED BY HER HUSBAND. BEING BATTERED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY HIM. THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD GET OUT WITH HER YOUNG BABY, SON, WAS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. SHE WAS HOMELESS. HOMELESS FOR A LONG TIME. DIDN'T HAVE A CAR. SHE AID, THEN I GOT SOME HOPE. I SAW NEWSPAPER. THEY SAY THERE IS A GUY NAMED BIDEN. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ME. HE WAS WRITING THIS THING CALLED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT TO GET HOUSING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ON THE STREET ARE THERE BECAUSE, BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS ARE BATTERED WOMEN. DO YOU REALIZE THE OTHER PORTION OF THOSE WHO ARE KIDS KICKED OUT OF THEIR OWN HOMES BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY OR LESBIAN, NOT EXCEPTED BY THEIR FAMILY. THESE ARE CHILDREN. THEN SHE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT. HOW SHE WORK TO WAY THROUGH AND HOW SHE GOT BACK. BUT HERE WE ARE. AS I SPEAK TO YOU, THE VERY LAW I WROTE WITH MY OWN PAW, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH NOBODY WANTED TO SUPPORT INITIALLY AND WE GOT IT DONE, IS CHANGING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE BUT GUESS WHAT? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I SAY IT. HERE'S THE POINT. BECAUSE OF TRUMP AND THE GUN LOBBY IT MAY BE OVER. IT HAS TO BE REAUTHORIZED. IT'S PASSED THE HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY. IT IS IN THE SENATE SITTING ON MCCONNELL'S DESK. YOU KNOW WHY THEY WON'T PASS IT? BECAUSE I PUT IN PROVISIONS SAYING AN ABUSER CANNOT OWN A WEAPON. HE HAS A STAY ORDER TO STAY AWAY FROM HIS WIFE OR HIS GIRL FOR YOU CANNOT OWN A WEAPON. HE SHOULD BE DENIED. GUESS WHAT? [APPLAUSE] BUT HERE'S THE POINT. I WAS ABLE TO GET THAT PASS FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT THERE IS A BOYFRIEND EXCEPTION. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BABY BY THE ABUSER, YOU AREN'T MARRIED TO THE ABUSER, JUST A BOYFRIEND ABUSING YOU, HE WAS NOT DENIED THE RIGHT TO OWN A GUN. GUESS WHAT? MOST WOMEN DIE IN THOSE SITUATIONS GETTING THEIR BRAINS BLOWN UP BY SOMEONE HOLDING A GUN. IT'S BEING HELD UP BECAUSE TRUMP IS OWNED BY THE NRA. THEY WILL NOT LET IT PASS. IT'S WRONG! IT'S WRONG! IT'S WRONG! [APPLAUSE] ONE MORE EXAMPLE. TWO DAYS AGO IN MANCHESTER, ACTUALLY, NOT TWO DAYS AGO, SATURDAY, IT SEEMS LIKE TWO DAYS DAYS AGO. SATURDAY, JILL AND MY DECEASED SON'S CHILDREN WERE WITH ME. WE WERE AT A FEED THE CHILDREN PROGRAM IN MANCHESTER. STANDING IN A PARKING LOT WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDRED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. HANDING OUT BREAD, FOOD. LITTLE KIDS, WAS 22 DEGREES AND THE WIND WASS BLOWING HARD. IT WAS COLD AS HELL. AND PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THIS WHOLE SITE. WOMEN AND CHILDREN BEING HANDED BOXES SO THEY CAN WALK ALONG THE TABLES WHO ARE STANDING THERE HANDING OUT BRED AND FOOD, BREAD AND FOOD. KIDS CANNOT EVEN PICK THE BOXES UP. TAKE AN EXTRA LOAF. I DON'T NEED IT. SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT NEED IT. AND THIS PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, AS I SPEAK, IS CUTTING FOOD STAMPS! WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS HAPPENING TO US? THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT MAKES ME ANGRY. THE IDEA THAT IN A COUNTRY AS WEALTHY AS WE ARE YOU GOT KIDS , ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS THEY DO IT RAIN OR SHINE, GOD L OVE THEM. GUESS WHAT? IT WAS SO COLD. ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS GAVE ME A STOCKING CAP. I LOOKED AT IT I SAW THIS LITTLE KID. THIS HAS A YOUNG MAN AND A SWEATER. NO GLOVES. FREEZING. I'M THINKING, WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS GOING ON? I DID WHAT YOU DID. I GAVE THE HATE TO HIM , THE HAT TO HIM. BUT SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE'RE CUTTING FOOD STAMPS? NOW CALLED THE SNAP PROGRAM. FOLKS, THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG THAT'S SO EASY TO FIX. YOU IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU KNOW ONE ANOTHER. YOU CAN FEEL THE PAIN OF YOUR NEXT OUR NEIGHBOR, YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING SOMETIMES. AND YOU REACH OUT. YOU ARE NOT DISTANT. FOLKS, THIS ELECTION, AMERICA'S CHARACTER IS ON THE PALETTE. , THE BALLOT. THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING IS ON THE BALLOT. FOLKS, WE GOT TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN A BAD, BAD WAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I , ALL THESE PROBLEMS ARE WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO SOLVE. NOT HURTING ANYBODY, NOT DENYING ANYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. WE HAVE OVER $1, 600 BILLION TAX LOOPHOLES, MONEY NOT COLLECTED. WE GIVE PEOPLE BREAKS FOR RESOURCES. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? FOLKS, LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE AMERICA THAT I WAS RAISED IN. BEING LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO EMPATHY. NO COMPASSION. DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE A SHRED OF DECENCY. I READING , I REALLY MEAN THIS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT REPUBLICAN-DEMOCRAT, THIS IS WAY BEYOND THAT. WHEN I SAW COLONEL VINDMAN BEING PHYSICALLY ESCORTED, A HERO, PHYSICALLY ESCORTED OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, BY GUARDS. WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT, HIGH-RANKING PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE UNDER OATH AND ANSWERED HONESTLY,. NO, BIDEN DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG. BIDEN IS AN HONORABLE MAN. ALL LINED UP AND FIRED. AS WE SPEAK, READ THE PAPERS TODAY, LISTEN TO THE NEWS. AGAINST THE ADVICE OF ALL OF HIS POLITICAL ADVISERS. THIS IS VENOMOUS. FOLKS, THIS ISN'T AMERICA. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THOSE WARRIORS IN IRAQ WHO AT THE OTHER END OF THE MISSILE ATTACK IN IRAN, IN A SENSELESS CONFLICT HE STARTED. DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN INJURY, THOSE ARE JUST HEADACHES. HE STOOD BEFORE THEM AND CALLED THEM LOSERS, TO THEIR FACE. BABIES. THIS IS A GUY WHO, IN FACT, EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACISTS. WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED DOWN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHEN THOSE FOLKS, CLOSE YOUR EYES, REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW. FOLKS WALKING OUT OF FEELS CARRYING TORCHES WITH VEINS BUL GING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC SAYINGS, THE SAME ONE SHOUTED IN GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. A YOUNG WOMAN GETS KILLED. THEY ASK HIM TO COMMENT. HE SAID, THEY ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. THIS IS A GUY WHO BOWS DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, SAYS BEFORE THE WORLD, I BELIEVE, PUTIN, HE HAD NO REASON TO DO ANYTHING IN OUR ELECTIONS. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT AFTER 18 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TOLD HIM THEY DID. TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND DEGRADING , DEMEANING, DEMONIZING. MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE OF DISABILITIES. MIMICKING THEM. LOOK, THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. YOU KNOW, I KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT LOSING. GUESS WHAT? LIKE MANY OF YOU I HAVE LOST A LOT IN MY LIFETIME. LOST A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I LOST MY SON TO CANCER. BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GOING TO STAND BY AND LOSE MY COUNTRY. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. PERIOD. PERIOD. PERIOD. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN! SO, FOLKS , [APPLAUSE] TIME TO STAY UP AND GET READY TO , I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND. I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT FOLKS, THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER, I SWEAR TO GOD. I'M OPTIMISTIC IF WE GET RID OF THIS GUY BY OUR ABILITY TO PUT THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER ON A NEW PATH AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IN A WAY WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE IN A LONG TIME. MY MOTHER, SHE WOULD SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. ANYBODY GOT QUESTIONS, RAISE YOUR HAND. DO WE HAVE FOLKS WITH MICS AROUND HERE? OH. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE DEBATE. I THOUGHT EVERYBODY DID A GREAT JOB. BUT I'M AFRAID THAT ONE OF YOU CANNOT BEAT HIM. BUT I THINK ALL OF YOU COULD. IS THERE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU GUYS COULD PUT A DREAM TEAM TOGETHER AND PRESENT THAT YOU AMERICAN PEOPLE AT, SAY AMY'S GOING TO BE VICE PRESIDENT AND ANDREW IN CHARGE OF COMMERCE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE COULD GET A HOLD VISION TO , A WHOLE VISION TO TAKE HIM DOWN. [APPLAUSE] WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S TWO WAYS TO BE IN THE DREAM TEAM. RUN IT OR BE PICKED. IT WOULD BE VERY PRESENT IS OF ME TO TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO. BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT THE ONLY THING I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IS THE VICE PRESIDENCY. AND I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN AND LITERALLY THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL HISTORICALLY THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE SAID THERE HAS BEEN NO , TEAM CLOSER PERSONALLY AND POLITICALLY THEN BARACK AND I HAVE BEEN. I SAY THAT FOR THIS REASON. SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS ONLY A COUPLE OF THINGS I CAN TELL YOU FOR CERTAIN. I'M YOUR NOMINEE WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT, BECAUSE IF I AM YOUR NOMINEE I WILL BEAT HIM. [APPLAUSE] BUT MY ADMINISTRATION WILL LOOK LIKE THE COUNTRY. BE MADE UP OF WOMEN AND BLACKS AND BROWNS AND PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF THE COUNTRY, JUST LIKE OUR MINISTRIES AND DID , OUR ADMINISTRATION DID. THERE ARE SIX WOMEN I CAN THINK OF ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A MOMENTS HESITATION AND ASKING TO BE MY VICE PRESIDENT. I CAN SAY THE SAME THING FOR AT LEAST FOUR LEADING AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT I KNOW. AND SO, THE LIST GOES ON. WHAT THE ONE THING I DO KNOW THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE AN A VICE PRESIDENT , IN A VICE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE SOMEBODY, AND THIS IS WHY IT WORKS SO WELL FOR BARACK AND ME WHO NOT ONLY TRUST BUT WITH WHOM YOU ARE SYNTHETIC. , SYMPATICO. BECAUSE THE ROLE OF A PRESIDENT AND THE 21ST CENTURY IS NOT ABLE TO BE HANDLED BY A SINGLE MAN OR WOMAN. THEY CAN'T DO IT ALL. TOO MANY THINGS LAND ON YOUR DESK THAT IN FACT REQUIRE YOU TO BE ABLE TO SIGN SING AGAIN PORTIONS TO SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU CANNOT DO IT TO A CABINET MEMBER. THEY CAN BE HELPFUL. WE HAD GREAT CABINET MEMBERS AND OUR MINISTRIES AND CUT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO YOU CAN GET PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE WERE GOING TO, ABOUT TO LOSE THE VOTE ON THE $900 BILLION RECOVERY ACT, NO PROGRAM HAS EVER BEEN PASSED THAT BIG IN ALL OF HISTORY. $900 BILLION. I MADE A MISTAKE OF WRITING A MEMO TO THE PRESIDENT OF HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE THAT. WE HAD A PRIVATE LUNCH ONCE A WEEK AND HE TOOK THE MEMO AND SLID IT BACK TO ME AND SAID, DO IT. IT WAS THE LAST MEMO I WROTE. I REMEMBER HE USED TO LOVE THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS TO SAY WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST, HE'D SAY, THIS $900 BILLION BILL TO GET PASSED AND I WILL GET JOE TO RUN. HE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY. HE DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES, SO HE SENT ME AND I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE VOTES OF THREE REPUBLICANS AND WE GOT IT PASSED AND LITERALLY SAVED THE ECONOMY. [APPLAUSE] BUT, IT IS NOT ABOUT ME. HE HAD THE CONFIDENCE IN ME TO KNOW THAT HE AND I AGREED AND HE COULD TRUST ME TO RUN THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION. I SPOKE TO WELL OVER 150 MAYORS, GOVERNORS, AS TO HOW IT HAD TO BE AS AMENDED. IT WAS NOT JUST, YOU CANNOT DO IT ANYMORE AND JUST SAY, HAVE THE BUREAUCRATS, AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD RUN IT, BUT I WOULD CALL FOR, MARY WOULD SAY, MR. MAYOR, YOU ARE GOING TO GET X MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE THE LIGHTING AND HIRE BACK YOUR TEACHERS. BUT YOU GOT TO USE MODERN LIGHTING THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT LASTING POWER AND USES LESS ENERGY. HE SAID, BUT THE LAW SAYS I CAN DO IT. MY WORD. I SAID, I'M COMING OUT OF HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE SAYING YOU'RE WASTING MONEY. HE SAID, YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT. TRY ME. ? GUESS WHAT THEY PUT IT IN. THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT SAID THEY WERE I WANT TO SET THE FRISBEE PARK. I SAID, I CAN DO IT. I SAID, NO, YOU CAN'T. IT IS NOT PASS THE SMELL TEST. I'M GOING TO COME OUT AND DO. WE RAN A PROGRAM LESS THAN 1/10 OF 1%, LESS THAN 1% WASTE OR FRAUD, THE LARGEST PROGRAM I'VE EVER RUN. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS NOT THAT I'M SO GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOMEBODY PRESIDENTIAL POWER. I WAS ABLE TO HIRE, FIRE, TEST ANYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATOR TO DO WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO. SO, THAT IS THE FIRST THING FOR ME TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU. IN TERMS IF I AM THE NOMINEE PICKING THE VICE PRESIDENT THAT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEY ARE ON THE SAME PAGE. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THEY CAN DO. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE, NOT BE VICE PRESIDENT. FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL NOT GIVE AN EXAMPLE I WILL GET IN TROUBLE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING NOW, I WOULD NOT HESITATE IS SECOND TO ASKED TO BE PART OF A CABINET OR TO TAKE ON A HIGH POSITION IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I MEAN, NOT A SECOND. NOT A SECOND. [APPLAUSE] LASTLY, LASTLY, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO INHERIT A DIVIDED COUNTRY. WE'RE DIVIDED NOW, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING. AND A NATION IN DISARRAY. AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIP IN DISARRAY. AND WILL HELP TO DATE ONE , DAY ONE, THERE IS NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO IS WE CAN IN FACT FIRST UNIFY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO COME EVEN BEFORE UNIFY THE NATION. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF THIS PRIMARY CAMPAIGN, OR THIS, WELL, CAUCUSES, I WAS THE GUY WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT UNIFYING THE PARTY AND UNIFY THE COUNTRY PRETTY SAID, WE CANNOT UNIFYING THE COUNTRY. COMMON HE TIME TO DO HERE EVERYBODY IN THE FIRST FIVE DEBATES , HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU HEAR THAT IN THE FIRST FIVE DEBATES? WE CAN'T UNIFY THE REPUBLICANS. GUESS WHAT? IWEF WE'RE CAN'T,W WE'RE DEAD. BIDEN'S DONE IT BEFORE BUT NOT ANYMORE. HE DOES NOT KNOW THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I KNOW THEM BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN, NOW EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT UNITY, THANK GOD. IF I HAVE DONE NOTHING ELSE I GOT THE ENTIRE CAST RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, WE HAVE TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY. REMEMBERED FOR THREE-MONTH AGO, WE CANNOT UNIFY THE COUNTRY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN DO THIS, AND WE WILL FIRST HAVE TO BEGIN BY UNIFYING THE PARTY, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT AND I'M DETERMINED TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] I'M FROM IOWA. I FOLLOW JOE BIDEN SINCE 2007. I WORKED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. I WORKED FOR JOE BIDEN. A FUTURE PROVEN LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES. I WAS A VOLUNTEER FROM IOWA, WORKING FOR YOU TODAY. ALSO, MY QUESTION IS THAT IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVELY DOING ANYTHING FOR A COUNTRY. I'M FROM IOWA HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IS. I WANT TO ASK YOU , WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO , TO HAVE GUN CONTROL, TO MAKE OUR SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES? ALL RIGHT. BY THE WAY, HE IS A PROFESSOR. HE HAS AN OFF A LOT OF STUDENTS. THAT'S NOT A SET UP. I DIDN'T PICK HIM TO ASKED THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. IT IS A GOOD QUESTION. WHAT I DO ABOUT SAFETY IN SCHOOLS AND RATIONAL GUN POLICY? LOOK, FOLKS, EVERYBODY HAS IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT A RATIONAL GUN POLICY. THERE IS A SECOND AMENDMENT AND YOU DO HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BUT NOT UNLIMITED RIGHTS. NO AMENDMENT IS ABSOLUTE. I OWN A .20 GAUGE SHOTGUN. I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN A MINUTE, SIR. AND A .10 GAUGE SHOTGUN. I SKEET SHOOT. I DON'T HUNT. WE PROTECT, BY THE WAY GEESE CROSSING THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY MORE THAN WE DO PEOPLE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHELLS IN YOUR SHOTGUN IF YOU ARE GOING GOOSE HUNTING. FOR YOU CAN HAVE 100 ROUNDS IN A MAGAZINE THAT YOU CAN BUY TODAY. I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS EVER BEAT THE NRA NATIONALLY. I BEAT THEM FLAT OUT TWICE. I'M THE GUY THAT GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED, THE BACKGROUND CHECK BILL. I HAD DEMOCRATS ON THE STATION VOTED AGAINST THE BRADY BILL. IT IS WRONG. THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY ANYBODY CAN OWN A WEAPON. IT SAYS ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN OWN WEAPONS. IF YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF THINKING, YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL, YOU CANNOT OWN A WEAPON, IF YOU ARE TERRORISTS, YOU CANNOT OWN A WEAPON, YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OWN A WEAPON IF YOU ARE IN ABUSER. SO ON SO FORTH. THERE IS NEVER BEEN A LIMIT ON ANYONE CAN OWN A WEAPON. P[ERIOD. THOSE WHO SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS. A GREAT LINE. THE GTHE FACT IS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THE GOVERNMENT YOU NEED AN F-15 WITH MISSILES. THERE IS NO WAY AN AK-47 IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU IF YOU WORRY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT KNOCKING DOWN YOUR DOOR. IT IS BIZARRE. WE NEVER SAID YOU COULD OWN ANY WEAPON AT ALL FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU CANNOT OWN A MACHINE GUN. YOU CANNOT OWN A BAZOOKA, YOU CANNOT OWN AN M-1 TANK. YOU CAN LIMIT THE KIND OF WEAPONS THAT CAN BE OWNED. BY THE WAY, ALL THE WORK I HAVE DONE ON THIS, INCLUDING IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, I NOW HAVE OVER 58% OF NRA MEMBERS AND KNOWLEDGE AND YOU CANNOT OWN AN ASSAULT WEAPON. THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT. CAN'T HAVE A MAGAZINE THAT IS MORE THAN 10 ROUNDS IN IT. I'LL DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS. THINK ABOUT, TALK ABOUT MORAL DEPRAVITY. THESE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG KIDS THAT ARE HERE. I HOPE I'M NOT SAYING TOO MUCH WITH THEM HERE. THESE KIDS BETTER HERE, WHEN YOU SENT THOSE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH GRADE, WHAT IS THE FIRST THING THEY LEARN TO DO? IT USED TO BE WE WORRIED ABOUT FIRES IN SCHOOLS. DROP AND COVER. NOW IT IS DUCK AND COVER. LITERALLY TRAINED TO DUCK AND COVER. RUN DOWN THE HALLWAYS EXACTING. , ZIG ZAGGING. TALK ABOUT LOSS OF A SOUL. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE UNWILLING TO HAVE A RATIONAL POLICY. SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE 20, 30, 40 ,50 CLIPS IN A WEAPON. I VISITED ALL OF THOSE. LITERALLY. ALL THOSE PARENTS UP IN CONNECTICUT WHEN THOSE KIDS WERE KILLED. I VISITED THE SAME, ANYWAY. EVERY MASS SHOOTING, AND GUESS WHAT? WHAT IS LEFT BEHIND IS DEVASTATING. DEVASTATING. NOT JUST THE LOSS OF LIFE, WHICH IS WARBLED. , WHICH IS HORRIBLE. NOTHING WORSE THAN LOSING A CHILD. IN ADDITION, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THAT IS DONE. THESE KIDS. THE SINGLE GREATEST CONCERN PEOPLE HAVE, GENERATION Z, THEY CALL IT, 7 TO 17 YEARS OLD YOU KNOW THE SINGLE GREATEST CONCERN THEY HAVE? LITERALLY , BY HARVARD INSTITUTE WITH FIVE BEING EXTREME. GETTING SHOT IN SCHOOL. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVERY SINGLE DAY IN AMERICA THERE IS A MASS SHOOTING THAT OCCURS ON OR STREETS AND OUR CITIES IN TOUGH NEIGHBORHOODS. WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. AND SO MUCH OF IT CAN BE PRINTED. , BE PREVENTED. SO MUCH. I'LL S ONEAY ONE LAST THING. I WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS HOLLERING WE SHOULD GO AFTER THE DRUG COMPANIES ON THE OPIOD CRISIS. WE SHOULD NOT ONLY GO AFTER THEM WE SHOULD PUT SOME OF THE CEO'S IN JAIL. BECAUSE THEY KNOW FENTANYL CAN BE ADDICTIVE IN FIVE DAYS. DO YOU EVER SEE THAT ADVERTISE ON TELEVISION? YOU EVER SEE THAT WHEN THEY ARE ADVERTISING THESE DRUGS? GUESS WHAT? IMAGINE IF WE COULD NOT SUE THEM, THEY HAD AN EXCEPTION AND COULD NOT BE SUED. THAT'S THE EXACT EXEMPTION WE HAVE GIVEN GUN MANUFACTURING. YOU CANNOT SUE THEM. THE ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRY IN AMERICA AND AN EXEMPTION VOTED FOR BY THE CONGRESS. SIGNED BY A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. SAYING YOU CANNOT SUE THEM. HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST, THOUSANDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST 15 YEARS TO GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA? YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WITH THE SINGLE GREATEST CAUSE OF DEATH FROM A GUN IS? SUICIDE. SUICIDE. SO, FOLKS, I'M GOING TO CHANGE THAT LAW. I'M GOING TO WORK LIKE HECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CHANGE BECAUSE ONE THING TO GET THEIR ATTENTION IS TO SAY I WILL HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARNAGE. SIR, YOU HAD A QUESTION. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY FAMILY AND EVERYBODY HERE, PLEASE EXCEPT THE CONDOLENCES OF EVERYBODY FOR YOUR LOSSES AND DR. BIDEN'S LOSSES THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED. I DON'T HAVE ONE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I'VE BEEN ALL MY LIFE, I HAVEN'T BEEN A POLITICIAN DOWN OUR I WAS BORN, WAS BORN IN 1928. MY FAMILY, WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT POLITICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT I ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A CHECK AND BALANCE THAT PREVENTED SOMEONE LIKE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT FROM DOING WHAT HE IS DOING AND DOING WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. AND I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I'M GOING TO SAY WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT , [APPLAUSE] I WANT YOU TO REINFORCE THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING, BECAUSE I GOT SCARED A LITTLE BIT, COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN I SAID TO MYSELF, GOOD GOD, THIS CANNOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. I APPRECIATE IT. AND I WISH YOU LUCK. GO, JOE. SEMPER FI, MAN. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] YOU WONDER WHY THEY ARE CALLED THE GREATEST GENERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THANK YOU, DAD. LET'S GIVE HIM APPLAUSE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I KNOW HE, YOU DIDN'T STAND UP FOR THAT REASON, DAD, THAT YOU DESERVE IT AND YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH. LOOK, I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY. THE BALANCE OF POWER, I TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR 22 YEARS AND I TAUGHT A COURSE THAT WAS A THREE CREDIT COURSE, A SEMINAR IN SEPARATION OF POWERS. WHAT POWERS WERE APPROPRIATED BY, WHAT POWERS WERE AWARDED TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, AND THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AND THERE'S A GREAT LINE THAT SAYS THAT THE CONSTITUTION GAVE AN INVITATION TO TO FOR THE POWER THEY WANT TO EXERCISE. IT'S A TWO WAY STREET. THE FIRST THING THAT IS HOPE FOR AND THE FOUNDERS DID NOT COUNT ON IT, DID NOT COUNT ON IT, BUT WAS THE GOOD JUDGMENT AND INTEGRITY AND HONESTY OF ELECTED PEOPLE, THEY WOULD NOT ABUSE THE POWER THAT HAD. BUT THEY DID NOT COUNT ON THAT. THAT IS WHY THEY SET UP THE SEPARATED POWERS. NOW, BUT THAT REQUIRES EACH BRANCH TO EXERCISE AND FIGHT FOR THEIR POWER WHEN IT IS BEING ABUSED. SO, IT IS ONE THING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO OVERREACH IN HIS POWER, WHICH HE HAS CLEARLY DONE, EXCEEDED THAT OF ANY MODERN PRESIDENT. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT IS A FACT. THAT IS THE FACT. BUT THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE WERE DESIGNED TO PUT A CHECK, , I'LL AS YOUR QUESTIONS IN A MINUTE. TO PUT A CHECK ON THE ABUSE OF POWER BY ANY, EITHER OF THE OTHER BRANCHES. OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE HAVE REFUSED TO DO THAT UNTIL WE FINALLY CHANGE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LAST HOUSE AND ELECTED A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE. NOW YOU HAVE, I WAS PROUD, PROUD, PROUD, PROUD TO SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR 36 YEARS. I GOT ELECTED THERE WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD. I COME FROM A MODEST BACKGROUND HERE IS THE POINT. I'VE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN TERMS OF WAR POWERS AND A POINT JUSTICES. I HAVE WRITTEN LAW REVIEW ARTICLES AND HELPED WRITE THE WAR POWERS ACT. IT REQUIRES A BEING ENFORCED WHEN THE PRESIDENT ABUSES IT. AND THIS SENATE HAS EMBARRASSED ME, AN IS A FUSION GREAT, GREAT, HOPE AND FAITH IN, HAS EMBARRASSED ME. I'M A DEMOCRAT. WE DO NOT HAVE , WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR HIM OR NOT, HE WAS AN HONEST, HONORABLE MAN WHO EXERCISE THE SENATE POWER. WE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE I SERVED WITH OVER THE YEARS LIKE DICKEL LUGAR IN INDIANA, A REPUBLICAN. WE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE NERVE TO STAND UP. I GOT A CALL FROM DICK'S WIFE WHEN HE PASSED, HE SAID HE WANTED TO DO ONE THING TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH, VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM IF I HAD A CHOICE. LOOK, THEY HAVE TO EXERCISE THE POWER GIVEN TO THEM. THEY COULD HAVE EASILY HAVE DONE IN THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. BUT THEY WITHERED, BECAUSE THIS GUY HAS SUCH AN ABSOLUTE VENOMOUS STREAK IN HIM, THEY KNOW HE WILL GO AFTER THEM NO MATTER WHAT , WIN OR LOSE. THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE. THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. THE SENATE AND HOUSE HAVE TO EXERCISE THE POWER. THAT IS WHY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REASON MY WIFE WANTED ME TO RUN THIS TIME FOR PRESIDENT, SHE WAS NOT THE ONE WANTED TO GET INTO THIS TO BEGIN WITH, AS BECAUSE OF THE COURTS, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE FEDERAL COURTS. THE SUPREME COURT. WE ARE POINTING PEOPLE TO THE COURT THROUGH THE SENATE BY THIS PRESIDENT THAT IN FACT DO NOT INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION, I DON'T WANT TO GET TO COMPLICATED, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IT BUT, LOOK, THERE IS , A VERY CONSERVATIVE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT SAYS UNLESS A POWER IS EXPLICITLY ENUMERATED, STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION, THAT A RIGHT IS PHYSICALLY STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION, IT DOES NOT EXIST. IT IS NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED. IT HAS TO BE LEGISLATED. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION WHERE IT SAYS, USES THE WORD WOMEN. THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION, YOU USED THE WORD CHOICE. THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION WHERE IT SAYS THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY CLEARLY, YOU ARE RIGHTS. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FOUNDERS DID NOT WANT TO HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS. THOSE AMENDMENTS CALLED THE BILL OF RIGHTS. THE REASON WAS THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD LEAVE SOMETHING OUT AND IT WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS NOT HAVING MEANT TO BE PROTECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I DO NOT WANT TO TURN THIS INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLASS. THAT IS WHY THEY HAD THE NINTH AND THEN IT. IT SAYS ANYTHING NOT STATED , IN THE NINTH AMENDMENT, IS RETAINED BY THE PEOPLE. A RIGHT RETAINED BY THE PEOPLE. AND SO, WHAT WE HAVE A COURT NOW THAT IS SAYING, AND LESS YOU EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE CONSTITUTION THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL STATEMENT ABOUT THE RIGHT OF A WOMAN IN THE CONSTITUTION. WE GOT A 13TH AMENDMENT ON AFRICAN-AMERICANS BUT THINK ABOUT IT. SO, WEW BA BASTARDIZED IN A LITERAL SENSE, AS IT RELATES TO THE COURTS OF LATE, AS WELL AS THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THAT IS WHY MY CONCLUDING COMMENT IS THIS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE NEFF NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO WIN AND BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HELP SENATORS WIN AND TAKE THAT THE SENATE, TOO. [APPLAUSE] I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC BEING USED. AND I WAS WONDERING BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS, IT GETS INTO THE FISHES BODY AND WE EITHER , EAT THE FISH. IT'S BASICALLY HURTING EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY. AS PRESIDENT, HOW WILL YOU AFFECT THAT, HOW WE HELP THAT? THAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION, KIDDO. THERE IS MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF PLASTICS BEING DUMPED INTO THE OCEANS, MILLIONS OF POUNDS. AND I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO, JUST LIKE WE DID WITH PLASTIC BOTTLES, I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT IN MOST STATES, A LOT OF STATES TO IT, THEY SHOULD DO IT FEDERALLY THAT THERE HAS TO BE A DEPOSIT ON THE BOTTOM. , THE BOTTLE. YOU ARE GOING TO PAY MORE FOR THAT BOTTLE OF WATER IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER, UNLESS YOU RETURN AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK FOR THE PLASTIC BOTTLE. THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE NOT TO , I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD BE USING PLASTIC STRAWS ANYMORE AND RESTAURANTS. , IN RESTAURANTS. ONE OF THE REASONS I LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG SENATOR, I WROTE A LAW WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE COASTAL ZONE ACT. I WAS WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALL ALONG THE DELAWARE RIVER, WHICH IS EVEN WIDER THAN THE MISSISSIPPI. AND ALL OF THE SHELL LIFE AND THE LIFE ALONG THE ESTUARY THERE WAS BEING WIPED OUT, BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING PLANTS AND FACILITIES. WE ENDED UP PASSING A LAW SAYING YOU CANNOT BUILD ANYTHING AT ALL WITHIN 1 MILE , WITHIN 1 MILE OF THE DELAWARE RIVER. BECAUSE, IN FACT, IT WOULD CAUSE PLANT SPECIES AS WELL AS LIFE SPECIES TO BE ELIMINATED. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS NOW WITH THE LOSS OF AN AWFUL LOT OF PLANT AND ANIMAL MATERIAL. IN THE WATERS AS WELL AS IN THE FOREST, THE AIR. BUTTERFLIES ARE DYING, BUMBLEBEES ARE DYING. AND THAT MEANS WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. THAT IS WHY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO DO IS DEAL WITH A THING CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAYBE I CAN TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT AFTER THIS, OK? I DON'T WANT TO HALF YOU , HAVE YOU WAIT AROUND TOO LONG. BUT WE HAVE TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM PLASTICS. THAT IS WHY A LOT OF SUPERMARKETS NOW ARE GOING BACK TO THE OLD PAPER BAGS WERE GIVING YOU A CANVAS CARRYOUT BAG YOU BRING IN AND YOU GET YOUR ORDERS IN. I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM INDIANAPOLIS WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS. WE SUPPORT B-2 JUDGE , WE SUPPORT PETE BUTTIGIEG BUT WE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT ALL THE CANDIDATES. I AM ORIGINALLY FROM THE ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO. THAT ISLAND SEPARATED BY BIG WATER WHERE OVER 3.4 ONE MILLION AMERICANS LIVE AT. AN ISLAND THAT WENT THROUGH A HURRICANE TWO YEARS AGO, THAT HAS BEEN TREMBLING SINCE DECEMBER 23 AND HAS NOT STOPPED. AN ISLAND THAT VOTED TO BECOME A STATE. I WANT TO KNOW, BECAUSE I HAVE NOT HEARD PETE SPEAK ABOUT PUERTO RICO, I HAVE NOT HEARD BERNIE SPEAK ABOUT PUERTO RICO. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY CANDIDATE TALK ABOUT THEIR PLANS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO FOR PUERTO RICO. BY THE WAY, I HAVE DONE A LOT FOR PUERTO RICO. NUMBER ONE, PUERTO RICO IS IN THE THIRD COURT CIRCUIT OF APPEALS. TO PROVIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN PUERTO RICO. THREE, MY WIFE HEADED UPSTATE THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAM AND HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO AFTER THE HURRICANE WORKING THERE TO TRY TO HELP. FOUR, THIS PRESIDENT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. NUMBER FIVE, I AM FULLY AWARE OF THE LAW THAT SAYS , MOST OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW , RIGHT NOW THERE 'S A LAW THAT EXISTS, IF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO VOTE, THEY HAVE THREE OPTIONS. ONE, THEY CAN VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE. THEY CAN VOTE FOR CONTINGENT STATUS. THEY CAN VOTE FOR STATEHOOD. I GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE I SAID I HOPE THEY VOTE FOR STATEHOOD. BUT WHATEVER THEY VOTE FOR, AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FULLY SUPPORT, COMPLETELY SUPPORT. AND I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOWN THERE WITH PREVIOUS GOVERNORS. I KNOW THE ISLAND REALLY WELL. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS PUERTO RICO IS AND CAN BE A THRIVING COMMUNITY. BY THE WAY, THE LARGEST POPULATION IN DELLA RICO , POPULATION IN DELAWARE IS PUERTO RICAN. THAT IS WHY I HAVE HAD SUCH OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM THE PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE HISPANIC, BUT THEY ARE CITIZENS, THE HISPANIC POPULATION IN DELAWARE UP UNTIL THE 2020 CENCUS, WHICH MEANS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE IS IN DELAWARE. MY GENERIC POINT IS THAT THE CONTRIBUTION IS ENORMOUS THAT CAN BE MADE, AND THE INVESTMENT SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT, AND WE SHOULD DO MORE THAN THROW PAPER TOWELS OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU SHOW UP. , TOWELS AT PEOPLE WHEN YOU SHOW UP. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T NEED A MICROPHONE. I AM LOUD. MY QUESTION IS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE FIRST QUESTION. JOB ONE IS BEATING DONALD TRUMP. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US IS A POWERFUL MAN THAT CAN DO US , DO IT. BUT WHY NOT HEDGE OUR BETS? BILL CLINTON PICKED AL GORE AND THE UNSEEDED A REPUBLICAN. WHAT IF HILLARY HAD PICKED BERNIE SANDERS AS A RUNNING MATE? TRUMP WOULD HAD NEVER BEATEN HER. BARACK OBAMA PICKED JOE BIDEN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. WHY NOT PICK YOUR RUNNING MATE FROM THE TOP FIVE FINISHERS IN THIS DEMOCRATIC RACE? I SEE MORE AGREEMENT THAN I DO DISAGREEMENT. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE. OUR VALUES ARE AT STAKE. THE EVOLUTION, THE PLANET IS AT STAKE. SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. YOU EMBODY ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU GET IT. WHY NOT BUILD ON OUR STRENGTH AND PICK A RUNNING MATE FROM THE TOP FINISHERS? BARACK OBAMA DID THE SAME THING WITH YOU AND LOOK AT WHERE YOU ARE TODAY. SO WHEN YOU WIN, WILL YOU CONSIDER THAT? I THINK THAT IS HOW WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. I HATE THE MAN. I HATE HIM. AND I PRAY TO GOD, DEAR LORD, CONTROL THE RAGE INSIDE OF ME OF HOW MUCH HE HAS TAKEN AWAY. I LIVED THROUGH NIXON AND ALL THAT AND THIS MAN IS WORSE. WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU THINK, JOE? I AM TRUSTING YOU. SAVE OUR COUNTRY, JOE. YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU ARE RIGHT. FIRST THING, IF I COULD ANSWER THIS QUESTION DIRECTLY, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE EVERY NEWS PERSON TELLING THAT I AM BEING PRESUMPTUOUS. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR THAT. TWO, LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT IT. IT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN THOUGH I THINK I'M IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AND I KNOW I CAN TAKE TRUMP, PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY, BUT , [APPLAUSE] BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THEY ARE GOING TO SAY I CHALLENGE THE TRUMP, I AM NOT CHALLENGING HIM TO A FIGHT OR ANYTHING. I WOULD CHALLENGE HIM TO A GOLF GAME IF HE CARRIED HIS OWN BAG. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, I HAVE TO PICK SOMEBODY WHO, IN FACT, REASSURES PEOPLE THAT IF TOMORROW LIGHTNING STRIKES AND I DIE, AND I RELEASED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS , I DON'T WANT TO JINX MYSELF, AS MY MOTHER SAID, KNOCK ON WOOD, I AM IN GREAT SHAPE. BUT I HAVE TO PICK SOMEONE WHO MEETS TWO CRITERIA. ONE, THEY ARE YOUNGER THAN I AM. NO, I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. AND TWO, THAT THEY ARE READY ON DAY ONE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN THEIR VIEWS AND MINE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I PICK SOMEONE WHO HAD A VIEW THAT THEY INSISTED THAT WE DO MEDICARE FOR ALL, WHICH COSTS OVER $35 TRILLION AND HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW AND WOULD NOT SUPPORT MY PLAN FOR MEDICARE FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT BUILDING ON OBAMACARE AND ADDING THE PUBLIC OPTION, THAT WOULD BE A REAL PROBLEM. HOW DO YOU DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS? BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE RUNNING THAT ARE SIMPATICO WITH WHERE I AM, STARTING WITH INDIANA AND OTHER PLACES. AND DON'T READ THAT AS BIDEN THINKS , I AM GETTING IN TROUBLE HERE, ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT YES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE RUN AND DROPPED OUT ALREADY WHO ARE COMPLETELY CAPABLE AND COMPETENT TO BE VICE PRESIDENT OR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE OR SECRETARY OF STATE OR NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, ETC. THE ONE GOOD THING THAT I DO HAVE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE HIS I HAVE MORE MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE, 300 OF THEM, WITH CREDENTIALS ON BOTH PARTIES WHO HAVE ENDORSED THEM. SO I WILL NOT HAVE A PROBLEM FILLING THE STATE DEPARTMENT, DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, BECAUSE THESE FOLKS HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY ENDORSED ME AND THEY'RE READY TO GO. THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING. I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. YOU CANNOT WAIT AROUND UNTIL YOU DECIDE YOU HAVE THE NOMINATION AND THEN START TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU PUT A TRANSITION TEAM TOGETHER. I AM NOT BEING RESUMPTION. PLEASE DON'T , THIS IS COMPLICATED STUFF AND YOU CAN READ IT THE WRONG WAY. BUT WE NEED TO NOT JUST UNITE THE PARTY , IT HELPS IF YOU HAVE ALREADY HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THEM AND YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY CAN DO, WHAT THEY CANNOT DO. AND I THINK THAT IS A RATIONAL POSITION. I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING. I WOULD LIKE WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT, AND I AM SURE IF YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, YOU WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN, BECAUSE MR. TRUMP IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. GOD LOVES YOU. CAME FROM L.A. HOLY MACKEREL. I TELL YOU WHAT, MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN , AT LEAST THE OLDER PEOPLE HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF MY MOM. TELL ME IF SHE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MY MOM. AND BY THE WAY, MY MOM WAS THE FINEST PERSON WHO EVER LIVED, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. I AM SERIOUS. THANK YOU, MOM, YOU ARE NICE TO SAY THAT. SOMEBODY IN THE BACK, DO WE HAVE A MICROPHONE OVER AT THAT SIDE? OK, GIVE IT TO ONE OF THESE FOLKS. YOU PICK SOMEBODY. THE LIGHTS ARE IN MY EYES, I CANNOT SEE. TOTALLY OPPOSED TO IT. COMPLETELY, TOTALLY OPPOSED TO IT. I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE RUNNING WHO HAS BEEN IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. REMEMBER THE GREAT OIL SPILL THAT OCCURRED? WHEN I WENT UP IN A HELICOPTER AND SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THE GLACIERS BEGAN TO MELT, AND HOW THE CARIBOU AND EVERYTHING , THERE'S A LOT GOING ON UP THERE AND IT IS A GIGANTIC PROBLEM. BY THE WAY, NO MORE DRILLING ON FEDERAL LANDS, PERIOD. PERIOD. PERIOD. THE ARCTIC CIRCLE IS A DISASTER TO DO THAT, A BIG DISASTER IN MY VIEW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA REALLY RESTORED OUR IMAGE AFTER THE BUSH YEARS. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS DONALD TRUMP HAS LEFT THIS NATION UNSAFE, IS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND OUR IMAGE ACROSS THE WORLD IS REALLY DOWN IN THE DRAIN RIGHT NOW. IF YOU COULD JUST COMMENT ON HOW TO RETURN, MAKE A SAFER RETURN TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR BAN AND THE PARIS TREATY AND OUR IMAGE ACROSS THE WORLD. THANK YOU. LOOK, I WILL DO THIS REAL QUICKLY. I SAID AT THE OUTSET, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT A WORLD IN DISARRAY. ON DAY ONE , AND IT IS NOT A CRITICISM OF ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING, OK? BUT ON DAY ONE, AS THE CATHOLICS SAY, EXAMINE YOUR CONSCIENCE. IF YOU ARE QUIETLY THINKING TO YOURSELF, ON DAY ONE, THE PRESIDENT ELECT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL INTERNATIONALLY, NO ON THE JOB TRAINING. THERE WILL BE NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. IT IS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER TIME IN MODERN HISTORY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP THE ALLIANCES WHICH ARE CRUMBLING, PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, NUMBER ONE. I HAVE MET EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. NOT BECAUSE I AM IMPORTANT, BUT THE NATURE OF THE JOB I HAD. BEING IN THAT COMMITTEE FOR OVER 40 YEARS. THAT'S NOT TRUE, 36 YEARS. BUT THE POINT IS, ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS BARACK PICKED ME IS BECAUSE MY BACKGROUND IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY. I KNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE. SO, ONE OF THE THINGS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE DAY HE OR SHE STANDS BEHIND THE PODIUM, OR IN FRONT OF THAT DESK, WILL HAVE TO SPEAK, IN THE WORLD LEADERS WILL HAVE TO KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS AND UNDERSTAND HIM OR HER, AND HE HAS TO DEMONSTRATE HE KNOWS THEM. HE KNOWS THEM. I KNOW. I KNOW VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE KNOWS I KNOW HIM. I ALSO KNOW , I SPENT MORE TIME WITH XI JINPING THAN ANY WORLD LEADER HAS BEFORE WE LEFT OFFICE. I KNOW THESE GUYS AND THEY KNOW I KNOW THEM. BARACK USED TO ALWAYS KID ME, BECAUSE I WOULD ALWAYS BE QUOTING MY MOM OR MY DAD, SAYING ALL POLITICS IS PERSONAL, PARTICULARLY FOREIGN POLICY. YOU BETTER DARN WELL UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER GUY HAS. I DO NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE SECOND ADDITIONAL , ADDITION OF PROFILES IN COURAGE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY STAND FOR, FOR GOOD AND BAD. IT WILL HAVE TO , THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO DO , I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO IF I GOT ELECTED AND IT WAS TOMORROW. I WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ON THE PHONE , NOT A JOKE , WITH OUR NATO ALLIES SAYING WE ARE BACK. WE KEEP OUR COMMITMENTS. WE ARE BACK. NOT TO GO TO WAR, TO KEEP US FROM GOING TO WAR. I WOULD BE ON THE PHONE WITH ERDOGAN, WHO I KNOW AS WELL IS ANY WORLD LEADER. HE HAS BECOME AN AUTOCRAT. REPRESENTS A DEMOCRACY AND HE HAS BECOME AN AUTOCRAT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW, THE GAME HAS CHANGED. I WOULD BE ON THE PHONE TO ABE IN JAPAN WHO I KNOW WELL. I WOULD BE PUTTING BACK THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE WE NEED TO , I REALLY MEAN IT. THESE ARE THINGS I HAVE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING TO GO TO WAR, WE ARE LOOKING TO AVOID GOING TO WAR. FOLSK , FOLKS, LOOK, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER COALITIONS, WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DO WITH 60 NATIONS WITH VERY FEW AMERICAN FORCES TO BEAT SIS AN , ISIS AND PREVENT THE CALIPHATE FROM FORMING IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. YOU SAW WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DID. HE WANT TO HEAD AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS GENERALS, AGAINST THE ADVICE OF EVERYONE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. HE MADE A DEAL WITH ERDOGAN OF TURKEY, WITHDREW OUR TROOPS FROM THAT BUFFER ZONE. 10,000 KURDS WERE KILLED DEFEATING ISIS. ISIS WAS COMING FOR US. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID , ERDOGAN SAID, IN FACT IF YOU PUT ANY SANCTIONS ON ME, I AM GOING TO LET THESE PEOPLE COME THROUGH INTO EUROPE. GREAT ALLY, RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED? QGA , AGAIN, WHAT HAPPENED? CLOSE YOUR EYES, MEMBER THE SCENE , THE NUMBER IS CLASSIFIED BUT FEWER THAN 5000 SPECIAL FORCES WERE PULLING OUT. YOU SAW WOMEN HOLDING UP THEIR BABIES SAYING DON'T LEAVE, DON'T LEAVE. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU SAW OUR MILITARY WOMEN AND MEN WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN. THEY WERE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. THEY WERE ASHAMED. WHO IS GOING TO TRUST US? WE MADE A SACRED COMMITMENT TO THEM, AND 65 OTHER NATIONS THAT WERE HELPING US DO THAT. WHO TRUSTS US AGAIN UNLESS WE REASSERT OUR COMMITMENT? BARACK AND I KNEW THE VALUE OF NATO WAS TO PREVENT WARS, NOT TO START WARS. AND GUESS WHAT? THIS PRESIDENT TREATS NATO LIKE IT IS A PROTECTION RACKET. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE MORE MONEY ON SUCH AND SUCH, THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO KEEP ARTICLE FIVE. ARTICLE FIVE IS A SACRED COMMITMENT. IT SAYS IF ONE IS ATTACKED, IT'S AN ATTACK ON ALL. THAT IS WHY RUSSIA DOES NOT DO ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IT IS ABOUT PREVENTING WAR, PREVENTING WAR. AND IT CANNOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS ONE-OFF. THOSE OTHER LEADERS HAVE TO KNOW YOU. I DON'T CARE HOW SMART OR BRILLIANT YOU ARE, HOW GOOD YOU ARE, YOU HAVE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET THIS DONE. GET IT DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO TIME TO WAIT. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF BARACK OBAMA WAS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , WELL, I WILL NOT GO INTO THAT. IF THIS GUY GETS ELECTED AGAIN, WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN HERE IS THERE WILL BE NO NATO IN FOUR YEARS. AND REMEMBER WHY NATO WAS PUT IN PLACE. IT WAS PUT IN PLACE NOT JUST TO KEEP THE SOVIET INVASION OF WESTERN EUROPE FROM HAPPENING, IT WAS PUT IN PLACE SO YOU HAD 28 NATIONS AND NO ONE NATION COULD GET SO POWERFUL THAT IT OVERTOOK OTHER NATIONS. WE GOT INTO WORLD WARS BECAUSE A EUROPEAN NATION DECIDED THAT IT WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE OTHER NATIONS AND BEGAN TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE, TWICE. THAT IS HOW IT HAPPENED. SO WHAT IS THIS GUIDE TO? THE EUROPEAN UNION ISN'T AN ECONOMIC THREAT TO THE U.S., FOR GOD SAKE. WE WITH THEM ALL THE TIME ECONOMICALLY. BUT TO TALK ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE EU? THE EU IS TO MAKE SURE NO ONE COUNTRY IS TO EXERCISE POWER THAT DOMINATES THE REST. HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY IDEA, ANY IDEA OF STRATEGIC DOCTRINE, OR WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO. SO FOLKS, THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE. BY THE WAY , YOU GO THERE? GRADE SCHOOL. GRADE SCHOOL. , GREAT SCHOOL. VERY EXPENSIVE. I AM STILL PAYING FOR IT. YOU ALL THINK I'M GETTING. SHE MAJORED IN SOCIAL WORK AND ANTHROPOLOGY AND THEN WENT TO THE EMBERS OF THE A PENNSYLVANIA AND GRADUATED WITH HONORS. SHE NOW GETS PAID LESS THAN TUITION COSTS. MOSHE IS A BRILLIANT, , BUT SHE IS A BRILLIANT, WONDERFUL KID. I AM GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY MAD HERE. MY DAD AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND FOR THE MORTGAGE LENDING. BECAUSE THAT SAVED OUR HOUSE AND IT SAVED MY LIFE MULTIPLE TIMES. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I OWE YOU MY LIFE MULTIPLE TIMES OVER. I ALSO WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU PLAN ON DOING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC ILLNESSES, BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL. AND I AM ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. A NUMBER OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, GOD LOVE YOU, BEING ABLE TO STAND UP AND ASK THAT QUESTION. REALLY AND TRULY. I REALLY MEAN IT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] I CAN SAY THREE THINGS AND I WILL DO IT QUICKLY AND THEN MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TALK AFTERWARDS AND GO INTO MORE DETAILS. NUMBER ONE, IN OBAMACARE , AND IT WILL BE MADE EVEN STRONGER IN OBAMA AMENDED BY AYDEN WITH THE PUBLIC OPTION , THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE HAS TO BE COMPLETE PARITY BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS. THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT AT ALL. AND SO YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY CANNOT SAY TO YOU, YOU HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM, WELL WE ARE NOT GOING TO HELP OUT. ONLY IF YOU BROKE YOUR BACK OR YOUR LEG OR DEVELOPED A DISEASE. IT IS A DISEASE OF THE BRAIN, THAT IS ALL IT IS, AND IT CAN BE FIXED. THAT IS NUMBER ONE. THERE HAS TO BE ABSOLUTE PARITY. ONE OF THE THINGS I DID, YOU SAW THOSE GUYS AND WOMEN CALLED THE WOUNDED WARRIORS, THEY WALKED ACROSS THE , AMERICA. MY WIFE AND I WALKED ACROSS AMERICA WITH THEM , NOT ALL OF IT, BUT THREE SECTIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING? THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT THAT, IN FACT, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF SEEKING HELP AND MENTAL ILLNESS. BECAUSE TODAY MANY, MANY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE , I WILL GET TO YOU, I PROMISE YOU. THEY ARE GOING TO BE WORRIED IF I DO NOT GET YOU, AND THEN YOU WILL BE THE LAST QUESTION. BUT HANG ON A SECOND. AND SO, THE REASON WE WALKED WITH THEM WAS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM WAR WHO ARE , I CARRY A CARD WITH ME EVERY DAY. IT IS MY DAILY SCHEDULE. LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE IN THAT BLACK BOX. WHAT DOES IT SAY? USER GLASSES. IT SAYS DAILY U.S. TROOP UPDATE. WHAT I MAKE SURE WE CHECK EVERY SINGLE MORNING IS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND MEN KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. AND THE NUMBER WOUNDED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE FALLEN ANGELS LEFT BEHIND A COMMUNITY. IT WAS NOT ROUGHLY 6905. EVERY DAY WE CHECK. THEY LEAVE BEHIND A WHOLE COMMITTEE. SECONDLY, WHAT IS NOT ON HERE IS 300,000 , 300,000 VETS OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS COMING HOME WITH NOT JUST TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES, BUT WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS. WE ENSURED 37,000 PSYCHIATRIC NURSES IN OUR HOSPITALS TODAY. WE HAVE 22 VETERANS PER DAY COMMITTING SUICIDE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 22. RETIREES, VETERANS, OR ACTIVE DUTY. 22. IT'S A DISGRACE. WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO, THOSE GUYS LIKE YOU WITH YOUR PRIDE AND YOUR SPUNK, THOSE GUYS ARE TRAINED NEVER TO COMPLAIN. IT IS THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO DO TO SAY I HAVE THESE AWFUL HEADACHES AND THESE BLINDING HEADACHES, AND I'M HAVING THESE DREAMS AND I'M HAVING THIS AND THAT. SO FIRST WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY THE STIGMA, THE STIGMA. THERE SHOULD BE NO STIGMA WITH MENTAL HEALTH. IN TERMS OF , I KNOW YOU KNOW THE LAW, THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. WE HAVE NOT FUNDED IT YET. I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE FUND IT COMPLETELY. WHICH IS GOING TO COST ANOTHER $45 BILLION. [APPLAUSE] PARDON ME? IT MAKES SURE THAT ALL THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS DISABILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE HELP THEY NEED AND IT GETS PAID FOR. NOT BY THEM BUT BY THE GOVERNMENT. PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT. AND ALSO, YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IF IN FACT YOU NEED ADDITIONAL HELP FOR WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS, INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THEY WILL GET SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED UNDER THE PROPOSAL I HAVE PUT FORWARD. I REALLY MEAN IT, NOT A JOKE. THERE IS A THING CALLED THE GERMAN SYSTEM, WHERE ANY NEW DRUG THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON A PERSON'S ABILITY, MENTAL OR PHYSICAL, HAS ON THEIR HEALTH, THAT THAT DRUG HAS TO BE APPROVED BY A GROUP OF 25 PEOPLE WHO ARE , WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THEY SIT WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES AHEAD OF TIME AND THEY HAVEN'T NATION WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES WHAT IT COSTS THEM TO DEVELOP THE DRUG, AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THAT. THEY MAKE A PROFIT, BUT THEY CANNOT CHARGE AN UNLIMITED NUMBER AND THE PRICE WILL BE SET. IF THEY DID NOT ABIDE BY THE PRICE THAT IS SET, THEN THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE IN A DIRECTION WHERE WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE MEDICARE MAKING SURE THEY NEGOTIATE FOR THAT DRUG AND THEY WILL NOT BUY THAT DRUG PERIOD UNLESS THEY AGREED TO THE PRICE. THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE PRICES. AND DRUGS ACROSS THE BOARD THAT PEOPLE NEED. I HAD A SON WHO WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM KOSOVO, HE WAS OVER IN THE BALKANS, HE CAME HOME AND TURNS OUT HE WAS EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT BACTERIA INFECTION. TURNS OUT HE HAD A MARKER FOR BAMBOO SPINE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE THIS. THE REASON THEY CANNOT STRAIGHTEN UP IS THERE VERTEBRAE WILL CRACK, IT FUSES TOGETHER. THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG ON THE MARKET HE GOT INTO A STUDY ON. HE HAD TO TAKE A SHOT ONCE A WEEK FOR $5,000 A SHOT. IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE MAKING A $102,000 A YEAR, A LOT OF MONEY, BUT HE HAD TO DO $5,000 A WEEK. UNTIL IT GOT APPROVED AND WENT ON THE MARKET, AND WENT ON THE MARKET AT A REASONABLE PRICE. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE , I BET YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS PAYING AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR AN INHALER OR EPIPEN OR ANYTHING ELSE. WHEN IT STARTED 10 YEARS AGO, I AM MAKING THIS UP, IT COST ONE DOLLAR AND NOW COSTS $10. REPUBLICANS WILL VOTE FOR THIS. THAT YOU CANNOT INCREASE THE PRICE OF A DRUG THAT IS AUTHORIZED BEYOND MEDICAL INFLATION, UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY WAS DIFFERENT TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT MORE TO TALK ABOUT HERE, BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENGAGE IN AND PROVIDE FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO IN FACT HAVE DISABILITIES. AND ALSO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN THE COUNTRY'S INTEREST. EVERYONE IS BETTER OFF, INCLUDING THE PROGRAM WE PUT TOGETHER FOR EMPLOYMENT. THERE ARE WAYS , BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE. NOBODY WANTS TO JUST BE GIVEN ANYTHING. THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE. AND YOU CAN AND YOU ARE BEASTLY ALREADY ARE. THERE IS A LOT MORE TO SAY, BUT IF I DID NOT GET THIS YOUNG MAN HERE, I AM DEAD AND MY STAFF WILL KILL ME BECAUSE I'M KEEPING YOU ALSO LAW. -0, ALL SO LONG. A GREAT QUESTION. HE SAID TRUMP MET ME IN DERRY, AND TRUMP , YOU CAME TWICE, GOD LOVE YOU. TRUMP HAS WEAKENED THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. WOULD I CHANGE THAT AND HOW WOULD I STRENGTHEN IT? THE ANSWER IS I WOULD STRENGTHEN IT, AND THE REASON IS THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM , FOR EXAMPLE, I TALKED , FOR AN EXAMPLE, IF THE CRUSTACEANS ALONG THE RIVERS AREN'T THERE, AND THEY CANNOT EAT OTHER SPECIES THERE, THAN THEY CANNOT GET EATEN BY THE FISH AND SO ON. IT AS A WHOLE CHAIN. IF YOU INTERRUPT THAT CHAIN, THEN YOU DO NOT JUST KILL THAT SPECIES, YOU KILL OTHER SPECIES. SO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS OVERWHELMINGLY, CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL SPECIES, INCLUDING HUMANS. WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A KID IN THE U.S. SENATE, I WORKED VERY HARD ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, MOM WILL EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU LATER, THERE'S AN OLD EXPRESSION WHEN YOU COME FROM A MINING TOWN ABOUT A CANARY IN A COAL MINE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE IS A LOT OF METHANE GAS AND THINGS IN A COAL MINE. YOU PUT CANARIES DOWN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T HEAR THEM CHIRPING AWAY, THE METHANE KILL THEM. YOU CANNOT SMELL IT, YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS. THERE ARE A LOT OF CANARIES OUT THERE, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING. THE ENTIRE ECHO SYSTEM, THE ENTIRE FOOD CHAIN , LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW. YOU HAVE GLOBAL WARMING, YOU EVER GO NORTH HERE IN YOUR MAGNIFICENT STATE? I WAS JUST IN IDAHO AS WELL. ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL, GREEN, TALL EVERGREENS. THEY ARE KIND OF GETTING BROWN, ON TODAY? , AREN'T THEY? IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING HOTTER, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPECIES NOW EATING UP THAT MATERIAL. THE GREEN. THEY ARE GOING TO KILL ALL OF THAT PHONE AND FLORA. THE POINT I AM MAKING IS IT IS ALL CONNECTED. THIS GUY THINKS EVERYTHING CAN BE SEGREGATED, LIKE HE WANTS TO SEGREGATE PEOPLE. BACK TO YOUR QUESTION MA'AM, IMMEDIATELY WHAT I WOULD DO IS I WOULD TAKE, GET RID OF ALL THE CAGES, NO FAMILY SEPARATION, SEN D , [APPLAUSE] NO NO, I MEAN IT. SEND AN IMMIGRATION BILL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TODAY FOR PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED, AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT DACA CHILDREN ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY ARE ALREADY THERE. AND I WOULD NOT BE DEPORTING ANYBODY OTHER THAN ARRESTING THEM FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN COMMISSION OF A FELONY IN THIS COUNTRY. A FELONY. PEOPLE GO BACK TO SCHOOL , I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. OUTSIDE OF DOCTORS OFFICES, OUTSIDE OF MASS, ARRESTING PEOPLE COMING OUT. THE CARNAGE OCCURRING IN THE MENTAL ILLNESS AND ANXIETY CREATED BY ALL THE CHILDREN WORRYING THEY ARE GOING TO GET HOME AND THEIR PARENTS WILL NOT BE THERE. WALKING OUT OF CHURCH AND GET ARRESTED. LOOK, I WILL END WITH THIS. I REALLY WILL END WITH THIS. YOU HAVE SO MANY GOOD QUESTIONS THOUGH, I'M EMBARRASSED TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT ANSWERING THEM ALL. BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WORRY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND ALL THE STUFF YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS GUY, THIS GUY IS JUST , I MEAN, THINK WHAT HE DID IN 2018. HE KEPT SHOWING, THE INVASION IS COMING. THE INVASION OF THESE RAPIST MEXICANS. THE INVASION OF ALL THESE FOLKS COMING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. AT THE SAME TIME, HE CUT OFF THE $740 BILLION REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR TO MAKE SURE WE CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCE ON THE GROUND SO PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY LEAVE FOR A REASON. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHERE WE ARE NOW IS YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE, IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 12TH GRADE THROUGHOUT THE U.S., 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 STUDENTS IS HISPANIC, LATINO. 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 STUDENTS. NOW I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU HAVE A PREJUDICE OR NOT. IF YOU DO NOT THINK IT IS IN THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST OF THE U.S. FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE THROUGH IT THAT THEY ARE EDUCATED AND INTEGRATED IN THIS SOCIETY, IF YOU DO NOT THINK THAT MAKES SENSE, THAN AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, YOU ARE BITING YOUR NOSE OFF TO SPITE YOUR FACE. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING. I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR ATLANTIC ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT HAVING TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA, AND WHY THINGS ARE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE IN AMERICA. A GUY I BECAME FRIENDS WITH WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE SOUL OF AMERICA. BESTSELLER. YES, JOHN BEAUCHAMP. , JOHN MEECHAM. I SPOKE TO OVER 84,000 PEOPLE ON THE BOOK TOUR. THE COMPANY WANTED ME TO SHOW UP IN THE CITIES WITH LARGE CROWDS. THEY BRING IN OTHER AUTHORS TO QUESTION ME ABOUT THE BOOK, ASK ME ABOUT THE BOOK. I TALKED TO MERRCHAM. , MEECHAM. HE SAID I THOUGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU COULD DEFEAT. YOU COULD DEFEAT PREJUDICE. I COME FROM A CITY THAT IS OVER 60% BLACK, A STATE THAT IS THE 8TH HIGHEST POPULATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN AMERICA, A TOTAL OF 19.8% OF MY STATE IS AFRICAN-AMERICAN. THAT IS HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS, BECAUSE I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS A KID, HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL, WHEN I GRADUATED WAS WHEN DR. KING WAS ASSASSINATED. THE ONLY OTHER POLITICAL HERO I EVER HAD WAS A WOMAN'S UNCLE WHO JUST ENDORSED ME, AND HER NAME IS KENNEDY. BOBBY KENNEDY. AND I CAME HOME AND I HAD A JOB WITH A WHITE SHOE OFFERING, THEY CALLED IT. IT WAS A VERY PRESTIGIOUS FIRM. I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE GOTTEN THE JOB. BUT YOU TAKE THE BAR EXAM TO BECOME A LAWYER IN LATE SEPTEMBER, YOU GET ADMITTED IN JANUARY. WHAT HAPPENED WAS AFTER DR. KING WAS ASSASSINATED, MY CITY WAS THE ONLY ONE IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY FOR 10 MONTHS WITH BAYONETS DOWN EVERY CORNER. JUST AS MY WIFE WOULD SAY, GOOGLE IT. I COULD NOT DO WHAT I WAS DOING. AND I QUIT AND BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER. I USED TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE DOWN ON FRONT STREET. THE EAST SIDE OF THE TOWN WAS BURNED DOWN. IF YOU EVER RIDE UP I-95 WHEN YOU GO ON THE EAST COAST, YOU GO THROUGH DELAWARE, THAT WAS ALL BURNED OUT. ANOTHER PART CALLED EAST LAKE. I THOUGHT THESE WOULD NEVER, EVER GET BETTER. I INTERVIEWED MY CLIENTS DOWN THERE BEFORE THEY WOULD BE REARRANGED. 30 YEARS LATER, STILL IN THAT SAME PLATFORM AT THE TRAIN STATION. JUST WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 27 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PICK ME UP, WHILE 10,000 PEOPLE WERE DOWN BELOW WEDDING ALONG THE TRACKS TO TAKE ME TO WASHINGTON TO BE SWORN IN AS VICE PRESIDENT. I CALLED MY THREE CHILDREN UP. M S, MY SON BEAU, MY OTHER SON, HUNTER. AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A SOCIAL WORKER. I SAID DO NOT TELL ME THINGS CANNOT GET BETTER. I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD EVER BE IN THIS PLACE. THIS IS THE VERY PLACE I DID THE INTERVIEWS. HERE I AM WAITING FOR BARACK OBAMA, A BLACK MAN TO PICK ME UP TO BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT, GOD, THINGS HAD CHANGED. WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS HATE DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT ONLY HIDES. IT HIDES UNDER ROCKS. WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COMING OUT, IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, NOT A JOKE, I DECIDED, GOD , AND M EECHAM IS RIGHT. HE TALKED ABOUT IT ONLY HIDING. IT IS IN THE FIRST THIRD OF HIS BOOK. THERE'S A PICTURE OF OVER 30,000 KU KLUX KLAN MEMBERS IN FULL GARB MARCHING DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN 1924. YOU KNOW WHAT FOR? TO STOP CATHOLICS LIKE ME FROM BEING ABLE TO COME TO THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE CATHOLICS WERE GOING TO POLLUTE THE COUNTRY. A SIGNIFICANT INFLUX AFTER THE 1950'S WHEN THE FAMINE WAS IN IRELAND. YOU HAD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFTER WORLD WAR I COMING TO THE U.S. THERE WERE THEN 37 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO WERE OPEN MEMBERS OF THE CLICK LOOKS CLINT. SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE , MEMBERS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. EVERY DENOMINATION. BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES, LED THEN BY A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT SAYING THIS HAS TO STOP. WE HAVE TO STOP IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO STOP IT AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT IS HAPPENING. THIS , NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE AS OVERTLY AS WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE TO TRY TO DIVIDE US ON RACE, RELIGION, AND ETHNICITY. WE WILL STOP IT. GOD LOVE YOU ALL.

[APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU JOHN, YOU ARE INCREDIBLE. IT TAKES IN THE NORMA'S AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO GET UP AND DO WHAT YOU SAID BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU GIVE HOPE TO. ALMOST EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA HAS GONE THROUGH WHAT YOUR FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH, WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH. VIRTUALLY EVERY FAMILY, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NOT HAD SOMEBODY OR FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HELP BECAUSE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAPTURE THEM. WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOU, I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS, I WORKED IN THIS AREA LONG, LONG TIME, AS YOU ARE DOING NOW, WHEN PEOPLE SEE YOU YOU GET ONE THING MOST NEEDED AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE REALLY DOWN, HOPE.

AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT SENATE PRESIDENT, GREAT LEADER INTEGRATE GENTLEMEN. IN SOME YOUR CHARACTER TO STAND UP AND SUPPORT ME. I REALLY MEAN IT, IT MEANS A A LOT TO ME. [APPLAUSE] GUESS WHO ELSE IS IN MANCHESTER TONIGHT, DONALD TRUMP. [CROWD BOOS] WHAT A COINCIDENCE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT A COINCIDENCE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE HE IS FOLLOWING ME AROUND. HE SEEMS VERY INTERESTED AT WHO THE NOMINEES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL BE. [SHOUTING] I WONDER WHY HE IS SO INTERESTED. I WONDER WHY HE IS SO INTERESTED. I GUESS I'VE BEEN THE OBJECT FOR SO LONG NOW. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES HE COMES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE WILL NOT WIN NO HAMPSHIRE IN NOVEMBER. [CHEERING] AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW THE OLD JOKE BILLY SHAHEEN, WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU, BILLY, BILLY SAYS HEY JOE, LET'S TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO THINK, RIGHT BILLY. HE SAYS I'M HERE TO ASK YOU, I NEED YOUR HELP AND THANK YOU FOR OFFERING IT. STICK WITH ME 24 MORE HOURS AND I PROMISE YOU WE WILL DO JUST FINE HEADING SOUTH AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL WIN THIS NOMINATION. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, I ALREADY , WEIRD HE GOT RID OF A PRESIDENT WHO CALLS GENERAL TO THEIR FACES, LOSERS AND BABIES. I KNOW WHO I AM, I'M READY TO GET THEM OUT OF PRESIDENT BIRD AT YOUR EROTIC BRAIN INJURY, A HEADACHE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS RUSH LIMBAUGH, A A DECORATED WAR HERO OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH AND HAS COURAGE IN EXPORTING HIM OUT. ARE YOU READY TO GET RID OF A PRESIDENT WHO IS TRYING TO DESTROY OBAMACARE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE, KICKING MILLIONS AND KIDS OF PARENTS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS, I KNOW I AM. [CHEERING] ARE YOU READY TO GET RID OF A PRESIDENT THAT BUILDS WALLS, PUT KIDS IN CAGES, CALLS AND WHITE SUPREMACIST, I AM DAMN WELL READY TO GET RID OF THEM. [CHEERING] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. ENOUGH ABOUT TRUMP, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE . I THINK IT IS TIME TO GET A PRESIDENT THAT WILL DEFEND AND PROTECT OBAMACARE. IF YOU SELL THE PAPER TODAY HE INTRODUCED HIS BUDGET, TRUMP SLASHES MEDICAID IN THE SAFETY NET BY OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS. [CROWD BOOS] ANDY CUTS OBAMACARE IF NOT PROCESSED, A LOT OF FOLKS ARE RUNNING AND WANT TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE, I DO NOT, I WANT TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] A MEDICARE -LIKE OPTION, PUBLIC OPTION. MY CLAIM WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER CO-PAYS, LOWER DRUG COST AND EXPAND COVERAGE TO EVERYBODY. AND IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET IT. THIS IS HOW WE WILL TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN HEALTHCARE. AND I GET IT DONE. I WAS THERE ON THE WAR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, I GOT THE BOATS AND GOT EVERY DEMOCRAT OUT THERE TO VOTE IN PAST WITH A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE. AND I CAN GET MY JOB DONE WITHOUT IN FACT FORCING ANYONE OFF YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF THAT'S ONE YOU WANT, AND YOU HAVE NEGOTIATED . WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS, I THINK THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO WILL TAKE ON THE CRISIS OVER TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO HUMANITY. ALL THE WAY BACK IN 1986 I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL OVERPASS. THEY SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER. AS VICE PRESIDENT I JOINED WITH JOHN KERRY TO GET THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT DONE. THE FIRST THING I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT IS REJOINED INNKEEPER COMMITMENT. [CHEERING] PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY IN ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY, BECAUSE WE CAME TO THE RECOVERY ACT. A 900 BILLION-DOLLAR BILL HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF, WE INVESTED $90 BILLION IN CLEAN ENERGY, BROUGHT DOWN THE PIPE UNDER PRICE OF SOLAR, BROUGHT DOWN THE PRICE OF WIND, AND COLD. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE SURE WE GET TO NET-ZERO BEFORE 2050 AND WE WILL INVEST $400 BILLION IN 2000 TWICE WHAT WE INVESTED. TO MAKE WE SURE WE HAVE CLEAN ENERGY. MAKE SURE THAT EVERY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT, HIGHWAYS, SCHOOLS, BUILDINGS, FROM THIS POINT ON IS A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ON THE NEW HIGHWAYS. OWNING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET, CREATING 10 MILLION NEW JOBS NOT $15 AN HOUR BUT $50 AN HOUR WITH BENEFITS. I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COURAGE TO STAND UP. [CHEERING] I'M THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING, A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING, I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S BEEN THE NRA NATIONALLY. I HAVE BEATEN THEM TWICE. I'M THE GUY THAT GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN FOR TEN YEARS AND I LIMITED THE NUMBER OF BULLET YOU CAN HAVE IN A MAGAZINE, NOT 15, NOT 100 ROUNDS, THAT KILL PEOPLE INSTANTLY, DO REALIZE HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE IN THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN SOMEONE WALKS IN WITH A MAGAZINE THAT HAS 100 ROUNDS OR 50 ROUNDS, IT IS UNSIGHTLY, IT IS IMMORAL. I HAVE BEATEN THE NRA BEFORE AND I PROMISE I WILL BEAT THEM AGAIN. [CHEERING] BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. I AM GOING TO GET RID OF MAYBE THE WORST VOTES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THAT IS, GIVING IMMUNITY TO GUN MANUFACTURERS FOR THE DEATHS, CHAOS AND THEY HAVE CAUSED. [CHEERING] MORE PEOPLE DIE IN OUR STREETS THE LAST DECADE OR MORE, MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS, MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN MASS SHOOTINGS THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE SOME IN THIS RACE GIVING IMMUNITY TO GUN MANY FACTORS IS A GOOD IDEA, THEY ARE BUT DEAD WRONG, WE DON'T PROTECT THE TOBACCO COMPANIES, THEY DON'T GET IMMUNITY, IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T, THEY WERE PROTECTED. IMAGINE IF THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS WERE PROTECTED LIKE THE GUN METER FRACTURES. IMAGINE. IMAGINE THE OIL COMPANIES CANNOT BE SUED FOR THE DAMAGE THAT THEY DO LIKE GUN MANUFACTURERS. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE SURE SHOULDN'T PROTECT THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. CAUGHT. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THOSE DAYS WILL BE OVER AND THEY WILL PAY AN ENORMOUS PRICE. I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT THAT UNDERSTOOD THE WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEO DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS. AND I MIGHT ADD, UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERING] IT IS TIME WE REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST WEALTH. IT IS TIME WE STOP TREATING PEOPLE , IT'S TIME WE STOP THE MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY AND STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, IS TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STOOD UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES ON THE WORLD STAGE. [CHEERING] REBUILDER ALLIANCE, THEY ARE CRUMBLING AROUND THE WORLD IN ASIA AS WELL AS IN EUROPE. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ALLIANCES. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING NATO. AND I WILL REINFORCE IT AS A PRESIDENT. AND I WILL NOT BOW DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE KNOWS ME. [CHEERING] AND I WILL BE SENDING KIM JONG-UN ANY LOVE LETTERS. LOOK, BELIEVE ME THE WORLD DICTATORS, THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE PRESIDENT STANDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD AND THE CAMERA WAS ON HIS LEFT AND HE SAYS WHY WOULD HE INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION, BECAUSE 18 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TOLD YOU HE DID. THAT'S WHY. AND WHY WOULD YOU THINK HE WOULD NOT ENGAGE TO TRY TO AFFECT OUR ELECTION? WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES TO OUR STANDING AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES AS THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE YOU WORK WITH. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES AND HOW MUCH THEY TRUST HER JUDGMENT WHEN THAT OCCURRED. LOOK, YOU GOT IT KID. [LAUGHTER] THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE MATTERS. POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS LIKE THE NRA MATTERS, WORKING WITH THE WORLD LEADERS WHO KNOW WE WILL KEEP OUR WORD MATTERS. FIGHTING CONGRESS FROM HEALTHCARE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO EDUCATION, THEY MATTER. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY EXPERIENCE DOES NOT MATTER, WELL, I THINK IT DOES. IT'S A REASON WHY I AM RUNNING. I HAVE BEEN THERE. CAUGHT. AND I THINK WE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT OF BOTH RIGHT NOW, EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER, THE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT THIS COUNTRY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. WE GIVE THEM A CHANCE AND WE GIVE THEM AN EVEN SHOT, THEY WILL NOT LET US DOWN NOW. AND WE ARE SO READY, THE COUNTRY IS SO READY, THINK ABOUT IT, I REALLY MEAN IT. INCLUDING REPUBLICAN VOTERS, INDEPENDENT VOTERS, DEMOCRATIC VOTERS BECAUSE ABANDONED HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF BY THIS PRESIDENT. HE HAS SHOWN THAT UGLY OF WHAT HE'S ABOUT. I HAVE SAID FOR THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY, I BELIEVE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. I WROTE A PIECE FOR THE ATLANTIC ATLANTIC, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THOSE FOLKS COME OUT CARRYING TORCHES, THEY WERE ON TELEVISION, VEINS BULGING CARRYING NOT THE BANNERS AND STANDING IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 30s, THE COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACIST AND THE YOUNG GIRL WAS KILLED IN THE PRESS ASKED HIM, MR. PRESIDENT WHAT DO YOU THINK AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID, HE MADE A MORAL EQUIVALENCY SAID WE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. IT STUNNED AMERICA AND SHOCK THE WORLD, SPONTANEOUSLY. OUR ALLIES AND OTHER COUNTRIES SPOKE ABOUT HIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN AMERICA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S ENORMOUS DAMAGE, I BELIEVE FROM THAT MOMENT ON WHEN I ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE IN A FIGHT FOR AMERICA, EVEN MORE SO TODAY, EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR, EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE, IS SOLID STEAK, OUR CORE VALUES, OUR LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD IS AT STAKE. OUR VERY DEMOCRACY AT STAKE. LOOK THIS YEAR SAID CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS GROWING UP I CAN. ASK ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO SUPPORT HIM, YOU WANT YOUR KID TO GROW UP I CAN, THE SAME VALUE SET. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS, WE HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. [CHEERING] FOLKS, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. [CHEERING] WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. UNITY OVER DIVISION. [CHEERING] INFRACTION OF ACCRUAL TO. [CHEERING] AND TRUTH OVERLIES. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH WITH DONALD TRUMP IN PRESIDENT, WE HAVE LOST TIME TO DO A CLIMATE CRISIS, WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF OUR ALLIES, WE LOST THE RESPECT OF MUCH OF THE WORLD, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. LIKE A LOT OF YOU, I LOST A LOT OF MY LIFETIME AS YOU HAVE, I LOST A LOT. BUT I TELL YOU, I'D BE DM DIFF I'M GOING TO STAND BY AND LOSES COUNTRY TO DONALD TRUMP FOR MORE YEARS. [CHEERING] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO. NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO TOGETHER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS TIME WE LIFT OUR HEADS UP AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, WE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER SET A GOAL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE DONE IT TOGETHER AND ACT WITH AMERICAN VALUES TO KNOW WHO WE ARE, NEVER, NEVER EVER. SO LET'S GET UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY, TAKE IT BACK NOW. GOD BUSHY WELL AND MAY GOD PROTECT HER CHILDREN. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

HE SPOKE FROM SYLVIA , COLUMBIA, SOUTH THANK YOU. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE BACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. ALL OF YOU. I HOPE YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU. I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE A LONG TIME. WHEN I DIE, I HOPE TO BE BORN IN CHARLESTON. [LAUGHTER] I LIKE THE LOW COUNTRY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I HOPE, THANK YOU, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, I WORK FOR CEDRIC RICHMOND. [LAUGHTER] DAVID MACK IS TAKING ME TO SCHOOL. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS CAME TO SEE ME. THEY ARE IN SESSION RIGHT NOW. I THANK THEM FOR MAKING THE EFFORT. SO MANY PEOPLE HERE FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU TO. I SPOKE TO OUR FOLKS UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA ARE WATCHING, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, WE PRAISE THEIR DIVERSITY AS A STATE, AND I WILL BE OUT THERE SEEING THEM SOON. TONIGHT, THOUGH, WE JUST HEARD OF THE FIRST TWO OF 50 STATES. TWO OF THEM. NOT ALL THE NATION, NOT HALF THE NATION, NOT A QUARTER OF THE NATION, NOT 10%. TWO. NOW, WHERE I COME FROM THAT'S THE OPENING BELL, NOT THE CLOSING BELL, AND THE FIGHT TO END DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY IS JUST BEGINNING. JUST BEGINNING. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IOWA HAS SPOKEN, BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA, SUPER TUESDAY AND BEYOND. UP UNTIL NOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MOST COMMITTED CONSTITUENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY! AND THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF SOCIETY, THE LATINO COMMUNITY! I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK OF A NUMBER. 99.9%, THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN AMERICA. ONE MORE NUMBER. 99.8%, THE PERCENT OF LATINO VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THESE EXPERTS, CABLE TV TALKERS TALKING ABOUT THE RACE, TELL THEM IT AIN'T OVER, MAN, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. [APPLAUSE] OUR VOTES COUNT, TOO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE TAKE THIS ELECTION AWAY. I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES, YOU CAN'T BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION WITHOUT OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. IT IS SIMPLE. IT'S A NATURAL FACT. IT IS TRUE, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO WON AGAINST INCUMBENTS, FROM JIMMY CARTER TO A GUY NAMED CLINTON, A GUY NAMED OBAMA, MY GOOD FRIEND, GUESS WHAT? THEY HAD OVERWHELMING AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, NOBODY'S EVER WON. REALLY. AND YOU ALL KNOW. MORE IMPORTANT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT WITHOUT BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. TOO OFTEN YOUR LOYALTY AND SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THIS PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'VE NEVER ONCE IN MY CAREER TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD AS A BIDEN THAT I NEVER, EVER WILL. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER CANDIDATES WILL DO IN THE FUTURE, THE TENDENCY IS TO LOOK AT THE PAST. I LEFT A LAW FIRM WHEN I WAS A KID WITH A GREAT JOB, AT A FANCY LAW FIRM, TO BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER, TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY I USED TO WORK IN, ON THE EAST SIDE, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD A LAWYER. ON THE COUNTY COUNSEL, I FOUGHT AGAINST REDLINING. IN THE U.S. SENATE, I PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AND I HAD THE BACK OF A GREAT PRESIDENT NAMED BARACK OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE INCREASED ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. GIVEN A CHANCE, THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE, QUITE FRANKLY BETTER, AND THEY BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY BUILT COMMUNITIES! WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL POPULATION. SPEAKING OF HBCU'S , I GOT $70 BILLION COMING TO HBCU'S, NOT A JOKE. MINORITY UNIVERSITIES. WE SAVED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, PASSED OBAMACARE, STOPPED INSURANCE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE BUILT AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. I LISTEN. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. WE DON'T LISTEN ENOUGH. WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED. WHAT YOUR FAMILIES NEED. WE NEED TO DEFEND AND BUILD ON OBAMACARE. TRUMP WON'S TO GET RID OF IT. EVEN SOME OF THE FOLKS IN MY OWN OUTFIT WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. BUT I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VICE PRESIDENT. AND TO BECOME A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BEST BUDDIES. I WAS NEVER PROUDER THAN THE DAY WE PASSED OBAMACARE. WE WILL EXPAND THAT. WE WILL GET RID OF ALL THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE CURTAILED IT. WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING INTO RESEARCH FOR FINDING CURES. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A INCREDIBLE DISPARITY. IT IS SINFUL. IT IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. EVERY CHILD HAS THE SAME CAPACITY WHEN THEY ARE BORN. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS THE SAME CAPACITY. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE OR INCOME LEVEL. I WILL PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. WE WILL GIVE TEACHERS THE PAYRAISE THEY NEED. WE ARE ALREADY SHORT. WHO WILL GET SHORTCHANGED? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT THEY ARE. WE WILL GIVE OUR TEACHERS A PAY RAISE. WE WILL AND ALL PRIVATE PRISONS. NO MORE JAIL TIME FOR ADDICTION. BUILD MORE TREATMENT FACILITIES. MAKE SURE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEGALLY SAY, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. ALL OF THESE STATES ARE OUT THERE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. WE SHOULD TAKE A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE PROFITS AND PUT AN END TO PRISONS. WE NEED TO BE A COUNTRY OF SECOND CHANCES. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ALL TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES. BUT WHAT DO WE DO? WE SAY YOU ARE DENIED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HELP YOU. WE WILL GIVE YOU $25 AND A BUS TICKET. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THOSE BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON AND COMING BACK FROM SERVING THEIR TIME, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PELL GRANTS. HOUSING. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE THEM A CHANCE. WHILE THEY ARE THERE, WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM SKILLS. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND A GREAT PEOPLE. THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD GET PAID LIKE WE ARE THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TOO MANY FAMILIES WORKING THEIR TAILS OFF. TOO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DO WHAT MY DAD DID. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING THEIR ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. MY DAD LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE BELIEVED IT. TODAY, THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR KIDS AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE OVER 50% OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE SAME STANDING THEY HAVE. WHAT A GOD AWFUL THING. IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN ROADS AND BRIDGES, BROADBAND, SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL GET TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY. THE WEALTHY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE WORKING CLASS. WHEN EVERYONE DOES BETTER, EVERYTHING WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HAVE THE SAME CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH. YOU LIVE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU HAVE THE SAME WEIGHT , HOUSES THE GUY LIVING ACROSS THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOURS IS VALUED LESS. YOU PAY MORE FOR INSURANCE. HOW DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH? THAT IS NOT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE DREAMS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY RAKED IN THEIR FAVOR. WE WILL INVESTED IN FAMILIES INSTEAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I HAVE DONE IT. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN GET DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING THOSE TORCHES, I NEVER WOULD'VE LEAPT IT. , BELIEVED IT. SCREECHING HATE. CARRYING NAZI BANNERS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY. THAT IS THAT THEY JILL AND I KNEW, AND MY GRANDCHILDREN KNEW, WE HAD NO CHANCE BUT TO RUN. I THOUGHT WE HAD FINALLY TURNED A CORNER. I HAD BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED ALL OF MY LIFE. BUT I LEARNED HATE DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT JUST HIDES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BREATHE OXYGEN INTO THAT HATE. BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS. AT HIS RALLIES, HE SPREADS THE MESSAGE OF PREJUDICE AND DIVISION. IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WELCOME AND SEND GUN MANUFACTURERS WHY , WHILE I KIDS ARE BEING GUNNED DOWN IN THE STREETS AND IN SCHOOLS. HE HAS 35 STATES SUPPRESSING THE BOAT, PRIMARILY TO KEEP PRODUCT , BLACK FOLKS AND BROWN FOLKS FROM VOTING. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT HAS TO STOP. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS DAY, 30 YEARS AGO, NELSON MANDELA WALKED OUT OF PRISON. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF MEETING HIM. HE WALKED IN. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. HE SAID THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO COME AND SEE ME. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHAOS. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE IS A SAMPLE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I WILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST TRUMP FOR GOING AFTER MY SON. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY SON. THAT MAKES ME ANGRY. PRESIDENTS CANNOT JUST FIGHT. THEY HAVE TO DEAL. WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SAME KIND OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION. BY THE WAY, I AM NOT NELSON MANDELA. I AM NOT MAKING THAT COMPARISON. ALL OF YOU MINISTERS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS THE KIND OF CONVICTION WE NEED TO MOVE THIS NATION FORWARD. LORD, GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO CLIMB. TOGETHER WE WILL BE DONALD TRUMP. JEFF AND AND ANN SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN. LET'S GET TO WORK. THANK YOU. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD AFFECT OUR TROOPS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?469284-1/joe-biden-columbia-south-carolina	Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, held a rally in the South Carolina state capital of Columbia.	469284-1	Speech

WE HAVE HAD THE MOST DIVERSE CABINET IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I THINK WE HAD THE BEST CABINET IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I LISTENED TO YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE . I WAS ASTOUNDED. YOU ASKED YOUR HUSBAND TO MARRY YOU. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, I HAD TO ASK MY WIFE, JILL, FIVE TIMES TO MARRY ME. NOT A JOKE. FIVE TIMES. FINALLY, I SAID, AND YOU WILL APPRECIATE THIS BECAUSE WE ARE ALL FROM IMMIGRANT PATHS. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY THEY GOT MY IRISH UP. I CAME BACK FROM SOUTH AFRICA TRYING TO SEE NO SIN MANDALA AND GETTING ARRESTED FOR TRYING TO SEE HIM ON ROBYN ISLAND. WHEN I CAME BACK, THE FIRST THING I DID, I LANDED IN PHILADELPHIA. I WENT BACK TO HER APARTMENT IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. I KNOCKED ON HER DOOR. SHE SAID, COME ON IN. I SAID, I'M NOT COMING IN. I SAID, YOU'RE FINALLY GOT MY IRISH UP. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TELL ME WHEN, JUST IF WE WILL MARRY ME. I SAID, WILL YOU MARRY ME? SHE WENT LIKE THIS. OK. MY SISTER ASKED , MY SISTER VALERIE , I ASKED HER, , HE ASKED HER, WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. I HAD MY TWO BOYS. SHE SAID, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. I ENVY YOUR HUSBAND NOTWITHSTANDING. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A SPOUSE. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS COMING, THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A RELATIVE OF OURS FROM IRELAND. I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS GOING TO BE HERE. MY MOTHER'S MOTHER'S NAME WAS BLEWITT. MY FATHER'S NAME WAS FINNEGAN. ONE WAS FROM COUNTY MAYO IN IRELAND. DURING THE TERRIBLE POTATO FAMINE WHEN THE BRITISH WERE DOING VERY BAD THINGS TO THE IRISH AT THE TIME, NOT A JOKE, MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER GOT ON A SHIP IN 1842 AND HEADED WITH SEVERAL OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, I BELIEVE ILLEGALLY, TO LOUISIANA. NEW ORLEANS. MADE HIS WAY NORTH. WHERE ARE YOU SITTING? ARE YOU OUT THERE SOMEWHERE? THERE SHE IS. BY THE WAY, WE CAUGHT UP , I HAVE BEEN TO IRELAND MANY TIMES. WE CAUGHT UP WHEN BARACK OBAMA , THE EQUIVALENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER KEPT SAYING, LET JOE COME TO IRELAND. WE WANT TO GIVE HIM 100,000 WELCOMES. I WENT TO IRELAND AND I FOUND OUT , I HAD NEVER MET MY FAMILY. SHE HEADS UP HOSPICE IRELAND. THEY JUST DEDICATED A $4 MILLION FACILITY TO MY DECEASED SON WHO DIED OF CANCER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: THE REASON I BOTHERED TO TELL YOU THAT IS BECAUSE GARY IS TALKING OF FAMILIES. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT FAMILY. NOT A JOKE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT FAMILY. EACH OF YOUR FAMILIES WHEN THEY DECIDED TO GET ON A BOAT OR A PLANE OR HOWEVER THEY GOT HERE AND HEAD OF TO THE UNITED STATES, THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY WERE NOT AT ALL CERTAIN THINGS WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. BUT THEY HAD THE COURAGE AND THE TENACITY AND THE RESILIENCE AND THE OPTIMISM TO THINK THEY COULD MAKE IT, THAT THEY COULD DO IT. I MET , I WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA NOT LONG AGO. ACTUALLY, I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF LEADERS. I SAID TO THEM, THE REASON WHY AMERICA IS WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHERRY PICK THE BEST , AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY , WE ARE THE MOST UNIQUE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHERRY PICK THE BEST FROM EVERY CONTINENT AND CULTURE. THE PEOPLE WHO, ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESILIENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE COURAGE. PEOPLE WHO ARE READY TO WORK AND WORK AND PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THAT IS WHO WE ARE, TRULY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. THE IDEA THIS PRESIDENT AND MANY OF HIS COHORTS TREAT THIS LIKE IT IS A PROBLEM , IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE IF WE DID NOT HAVE IMMIGRATION. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF JAPAN AND I HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. ABE. IN JAPANESE CULTURE, AND A WOMAN AS WELL EDUCATED AND MARRIES AND HAS CHILDREN, SHE IS ENCOURAGED TO STOP ENGAGING IN THE WORKFORCE. WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WORKFORCE REPLACEMENT. THAT IS ONE OF OUR STRENGTHS BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP COMING. AN AWFUL LOT OF NATIONS ARE MORE XENOPHOBIC. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING? I CAME BACK FROM JAPAN, I SAID, MARK MY WORDS. THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY JUST LIKE CHINA IS GOING TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY ABOUT ONE CHILD. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN CHINA RETIRED THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK. THEY CANNOT SUSTAIN IT. THEY DID AWAY WITH THE ONE CHILD POLICY. JAPAN, MY GENERIC POINT IS, THE UNITED STATES IS THE MOST UNIQUE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. YOU'RE A PRODUCT OF AN IDEA. YOU CANNOT DEFINE AN AMERICAN FOR ME. YOU CANNOT DEFINE WHEN BASED ON ETHNICITY, RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS AN IDEA. THE IDEA WE DECIDED THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN, WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. IT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT IT IS TRUE. NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS EVER BEEN ORGANIZED BASED ON AN IDEA. YOU CAN DEFINE PALMIST , YOU CAN DEFINE A MOST EVERY OTHER NATION BASED ON ETHNICITY OR TRIBE. THIS KIND OF WHITE HOUSE HAS NO IDEA OF IT. ZERO. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS QUICKLY. THE FACT IS THAT THE SUPPORT OF YOUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. AS SOON AS THIS IS OVER, THEY ARE GOING TO MARCH ME TO THE DOOR. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE PEOPLE , I'M GOING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE API COMMUNITY. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE HISPANIC OR LATINO COMMUNITY. THE IDEA WE ARE GOING TO DECIDED NOMINATION BEFORE WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OF THOSE FOLKS IS RIDICULOUS. THE FACT IS THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO VOTE AND VOTE EARLY IN THE STATE. THE FACT IS, THAT IS WHY BARACK AND I , I CALL HIM BARACK BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH THAT OTHER GUY WHO IS THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHY WE TOOK THE COMMUNITY SO SERIOUSLY. WE APPOINTED MORE AA PI JUDGES TO THE FEDERAL BENCH THEN ANY TIME IN HISTORY. MORE AI , MORE AA PI WOMEN THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINED. WE EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR FILIPINO WAR VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II, WHICH WAS LONG OVERDUE. BUT WE GOT IT DONE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHO WE OWE DEBTS OF GRATITUDE TO. MOST PEOPLE ONLY THINK ABOUT LATINO IMMIGRANTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. ? DACA OFFERED OPPORTUNITY TO THOUSANDS OF FILIPINO DREAMERS. MY PLAN IS GOING TO LEGALIZE DREAMERS AND INCLUDE A ROAD TO CITIZENSHIP. BY THE WAY, GARY, I HAVE PROPOSED WE NOT ONLY DEAL WITH THE 800 TO 200,000 , WE SHOULD INCREASE TO 3 MILLION PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN COME FOR FAMILY UNIFICATION. I THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. THIS IS A BIG, STRONG, VIBRANT COUNTRY. THE IDEA WE CANNOT REUNITE MORE FAMILIES IS BIZARRE. IT IS WHAT MAKES US STRONG. IT IS THE WEB THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER. THE UNIVERSITY OF LAS VEGAS , NEVADA LAS VEGAS USES THE GRANT MONEY WE SUPPLY TO STUDENTS FOR SUPPORTING 4000 AA PI STUDENTS. THE IDEA THERE IS SOME LIMITATION ON THE CAPACITY OF THE IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY IS BIZARRE. CRITICALLY THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WE CUT IN HALF THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE AA PI COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY I AM FIGHTING SO HARD TO PROTECT OBAMACARE AND BUILD ON IT AND NOT TEAR IT DOWN AND START OVER. 20 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE GAINED COVERAGE UNDER OBAMACARE. 2 MILLION IN THE AA PI COMMUNITY. 100 MILLION PEOPLE. IN THIS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A MILLION HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WHERE THEY COULD NOT GET COVERAGE. A CHILD WITH ASTHMA OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM. I WAS STUNNED TO FIND OUT TWO WEEKS AGO DONALD TRUMP SAID THE REASON WE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED IS BECAUSE OF HIM. HE IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I AM TAKING TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. I APOLOGIZE. THERE IS SO MUCH TO SAY, SO MUCH TO DO. SO MANY GOOD FRIENDS TO DO IT WITH. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE DECENCY AND HONOR. THE REASON WHY AMERICA HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE WORLD IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY. IT IS THE IDEA, NOT THE POWER OF MILITARY, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS CAUSED THE REST OF THE WORLD TO REPAIR TO US. YOU TALK TO PEOPLE FROM WHERE YOU HAVE EMIGRATED. WHAT ARE THEY ASKING YOU? WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA? WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT HAS CHANGED? WE ARE REDUCING OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD IN A MATTER OF YEARS UNLIKE ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HAVE TO REESTABLISH THE DECENCY AND HONOR. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS DO NOT WANT TO , DO NOT WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP LIKE HIM. I AM BEING DEADLY EARNEST. WE THOUGHT THERE IS A BASIC AMERICAN CODE OF HONESTY, DECENCY, LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. THAT IS WHO WE HAVE BEEN. LOOK AT HOW IT HAS CHANGED SO RAPIDLY. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO SHOW WHO WE ARE. WHAT I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE DO IS WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER AFFECTION. , OVER AFFECTION. FICTION. WE CHOOSE TRUTHS OVER LIVE , WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIVES. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET UP. WE HAVE NEVER SET A GOAL WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY, AND BECOME THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AGAIN. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. [APPLAUSE] THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WE ARE NOT DONE YET. NOW COMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. WE NEED ALL OF YOU TO HEAD OVER TO THE CHINATOWN MODEL TO CAST YOUR BALLOT. WE ALL NEED TO BE AN LINE BY 8:00 P.M. EVERYTHING WE HAVE WORKED FOR HAS LED UP TO THIS. I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU CAN CAST YOUR BALLOT AND HEAD-ON BACK. WE WILL HAVE A BUFFET FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

CSPANJB202202050	Joe Biden	2020-02-20	Joe Biden Remarks on Gun Violence	"MORE FROM CAMPAIGN 2020 NOW WITH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN. HE SPEAKS ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AT A COMMUNITY CENTER IN LAS VEGAS AND TALKS ABOUT HIS HISTORY REGARDING GUN LEGISLATION AND WHAT HE HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH AS PRESIDENT, SAYING THE NUMBER OF LIVES LOST AND IMPACTED BY GUN VIOLENCE IS TOO HIGH. THIS IS JUST OVER 20 MINUTES. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE, AND I'M A LAS VEGAS NATIVE. I'M A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER OF 16 YEARS. I'M AN EVERYDAY AND PRETTY AVERAGE AMERICAN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'M A MOTHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. I HAVE TWINS, A BOY AND A GIRL. MY SON IS NOW 13, AND MY DAUGHTER WILL FOREVER BE 4. YOU SEE, MY DAUGHTER WAS EXACTLY 4 YEARS, 2 MONTHS AND 3 DAYS OLD ON MARCH 6, 2011. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SAW HER LAUGH, SMILE, OR GIGGLE. SHE WAS A VIVACIOUS LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO MAKE A MARK IN THIS WORLD. THAT DAY I REMEMBER SITTING WITH HER ON THE COUCH BRUSHING HER CURLY LIGHT BRUNETTE HAIR, BRAIDING IT BACK SO IT WOULDN'T BE IN HER FACE FOR THE DAY, BUT LATER THAT DAY, OUR LIVES WOULD BE FOREVER CHANGED. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS SHOT BY A STRAY BULLET. THE BRAIDS, THE BRAIDS I HAD SO HAPPILY MADE IN MY DAUGHTER'S HAIR JUST THAT MORNING WOULD BE HANDED TO ME BY A NURSE PLACED IN A PLASTIC BAG SHAVED FROM HER HEAD. HER CURLS WOULD BE REPLACED BY WIRES. MY DAUGHTER WOULD LAY IN A HOSPITAL BED AFTER BRAIN SURGERY HOOKED UP TO LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES WHILE WE WAITED TO SEE IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY PULL THROUGH THIS, IF THERE WAS ANY SIGN. TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS SHOT ON MARCH 8, 2011, WE MADE THE DECISION TO TURN OFF LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES. THEY LET ME HOLD HER ONE LAST TIME BEFORE TAKING HER BACK FROM ME. NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE THIS PAIN. IT WAS WHEN I LEARNED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD NOT BE COMING HOME AND I WOULD NEVER KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HELP PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING TO ANOTHER FAMILY, TO ANOTHER INNOCENT CHILD. WE'VE SEEN A MOVIE THEATER SHOOTING IN COLORADO, A DEADLY SHOOTING AT A CHURCH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THE VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTINGS IN A PLACE OF WORK, COUNTLESS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND THE LARGEST AND DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN, LAS VEGAS. BUT THERE IS A DAILY TOLL OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, TOO. 100 AMERICANS A DAY ARE SHOT AND KILLED, AND HUNDREDS MORE ARE INJURED. THEY ARE NOT MAKING NATIONAL HEADLINES, JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTER. THIS IS NOT JUST A LOCAL PROBLEM. THIS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC. A CRISIS. AND IT REQUIRES A NATIONAL SOLUTION. SINCE LOSING MY DAUGHTER, PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT THEY CAN DO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO? YOU CAN VOTE. VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE THAT HAS A GUN POLICY. VOTE NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO NO LONGER CAN. VOTE SO THAT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THIS PAIN. THANK YOU. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU, STEPHANIE, FOR YOUR COURAGE AND FOR REMINDING US WHAT'S AT STAKE. I AM NOT HERE AS A CONGRESSMAN. I'M HERE AS THE SON WHO LOST MY FATHER TO GUN VIOLENCE WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OLD. RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS. A BLOCK AWAY FROM WHERE I GREW UP AND WHERE I WOULD LATER WORK AS THE HEAD OF THE CULINARY ACADEMY. MY FATHER WAS SHOT AND KILLED WHILE I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA-RENO. AND ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE, HE PASSED. AND SO THE NEXT TIME I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MY FATHER WAS AT HIS FUNERAL. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ME FINISH SCHOOL, TO START MY OWN FAMILY, OR TO SERVE MY COMMUNITY NOW AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER FAMILY TO FEEL THE PAIN OF LOSING A LOVED ONE. TO SENSELESS GUN VIOLENCE. AND I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO DO OUR JOB, TO PASS GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION THAT WILL KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE, BUT I'M ALSO SUPPORTING SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT WHO I KNOW UNDERSTANDS THE TRUE SACRIFICE AND THE LOSS THAT SO MANY FAMILIES HAVE FELT. BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED THAT SAME LOSS HIMSELF. HE'S ALSO SOMEONE WHO LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO BROUGHT UP THAT TRAGIC SHOOTING ON 1 OCTOBER. THE BIGGEST MASS SHOOTING IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. HE'S ALSO THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TAKEN ON THE N.R.A. AND WON. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED HIM AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M PROUD THAT HE'S HERE IN NEVADA TALKING TO VOTERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST. WE KNOW JOE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, JOE BIDEN KNOWS US. HE KNOWS OUR PAIN. HE KNOWS OUR HOPES. AND OUR AMBITIONS. AND IT GIVES ME A GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. THIS BEAUTIFUL LAS VEGAS MORNING. THE SUN IS SHINING. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WORK, THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. VOTERS IN NEVADA ARE GEARING UP TO VOTE IN THE CAUCUS. BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY, THE END OF THIS DAY, APPROXIMATELY 100 MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DEAD BECAUSE OF BEING SHOT WITH A GUN. BECAUSE OF CRIME, BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT, BECAUSE OF A SELF-INFLICTED WOUND OR A STRAY BULLET OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR INDISCRIMINATE MASS SHOOTINGS BECAUSE OF GUNS. ANOTHER NORMAL DAY IN AMERICA. BUT FOR THE CONGRESSMAN, WHO WAS JUST 19 YEARS OLD, AS HE JUST POINTED OUT, LOST HIS FATHER TO A GUN, AND FOR ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE WITH ME TODAY STANDING BEHIND ME AND NEXT TO ME, FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NORMAL, NORMAL HAS BECOME LIVING A NIGHTMARE. ON OCTOBER 1, 2017, IT WAS A NORMAL DAY IN LAS VEGAS. UNTIL ONE MAN IN POSSESSION OF A SMALL ARSENAL, ASSAULT WEAPONS, MANY MODIFIED WITH BUMP STOCKS INCREASING THE SPEED WITH WHICH HE COULD FIRE THE WEAPONS, AND 100 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WITH EACH OF THOSE ASSAULT WEAPONS WAS ABLE TO IN JUST 10 MINUTES TAKE OUT 58 INNOCENT LIVES AND HUNDREDS MORE WERE WOUNDED. THE LARGEST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND NORMAL? NORMAL, TO ME, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME, IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. NO, MOMS LIKE STEPHANIE, THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A WORLD WHERE HER BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER GETS CUT DOWN BY A STRAY BULLET IN FRONT OF HER TWIN BROTHER AND NOTHING CHANGES. I WANT TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY, IT TAKES ENORMOUS COURAGE TO BE HERE. TAKES ENORMOUS COURAGE. EVERY SINGLE TIME I KNOW, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SHOW UP AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR YOU SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE, YOU RELIVE AS IF THE MOMENT HAPPENED THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU'RE GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE AROUND THE COUNTRY. I DON'T ACCEPT THAT WE CAN'T STAND UP AND SAY, NO MORE. TO THE VOICES WHO OFFER THOSE EMPTY WORDS OF SYMPATHY AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO YOU, AND THEN OPPOSE , OPPOSE A CHANGE IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD CURE THIS GOD-AWFUL PROBLEM. I'VE BEATEN THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION NATIONALLY TWICE. PASSED MEANINGFUL GUN LEGISLATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. BUT IT WON'T JUST BE BECAUSE I'LL DO IT. IT'S BECAUSE MOMS AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE ARE NOW MOBILIZED. YOUNG VICTIMS, SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE MOBILIZED, PRICKING THE CONSCIENCE OF EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO SAYS MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, I , I THINK THAT , I THINK THE COUNTRY'S READY. YOU KNOW, AND I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF HAVING WORKED SO HARD WHEN I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN PASSING THE BRADY BILL WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT KEPT A WEAPON OUT OF THE HANDS OF THREE MILLION PEOPLE. THREE MILLION PEOPLE. THREE MILLION. OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE. NOW, WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NEVADA LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. THEY'VE SHOWN, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS HERE IN NEVADA. REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR EVERY SINGLE GUN SALE. JUST COMMON SENSE. IT'S SUPPORTED BY 90% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHARE THAT VIEW. WE HAVE TO GET IT DONE NATIONALLY. JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF BACKBONE TO STAND UP TO THE THUGS. WORKING WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN I WAS ABLE TO GET ASSAULT WEAPONS WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES DECLARED TO BE ILLEGAL, BANNED. WE GOT THEM BANNED FOR 10 YEARS. IT HAD TO BE REAUTHORIZED, AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SUPPORT THAT. WE LOST THE CONGRESS. WE PASSED IT IN SPITE OF THE N.R.A. BECAUSE NO ONE NEEDS AN AR-15. SOMETHING DESIGNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE, NONE, OTHER THAN TO KILL HUMAN BEINGS. THERE'S NO OTHER RATIONALE FOR ITS EXISTENCE. AND TO KILL THEM AS QUICKLY AND AS BRUTALLY AS POSSIBLE. EVERY DAY THAT WE DO NOTHING ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC OF ASSAULTS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS, HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES ON OUR STREETS IS AN INSULT. AND THE INNUMERABLE LIVES ACROSS THIS NATION THAT HAVE BEEN FOREVER SHATTERED BY THIS VIOLENCE. AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL GET THESE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREET AGAIN. AND OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW, IT'S SO LONG PASTIME THAT WE CORRECT ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS SPECIAL INTERESTS , GIVEAWAYS THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS EVER ENGAGED IN. THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROTECTIONS GRANTED TO GUN MANUFACTURERS AGAINST BEING SUED BY THE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE. ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRY , AND BY THE WAY, WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE KILLED IN WAR. DO Y'ALL REALIZE COUNTING THE VIETNAM WAR AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THIS DAY, THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY WARRIOR KILLED IN VIETNAM TO THIS MOMENT. THREE TIMES. 150,000 PEOPLE MURDERED, JUST SINCE 2005. 150,000 PEOPLE MURDERED! SINCE 2005. WE DON'T GRANT THAT KIND OF IMMUNITY TO ANYBODY ELSE. IMAGINE IF I STOOD UP HERE AND SAID TODAY, I VOTED TO GIVE IMMUNITY TO THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. I VOTED TO GIVE IMMUNE AT THIS, IF I DID, TO SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE TO GIVE IMMUNITY TO DRUG MANUFACTURERS WHO POURED NINE BILLION OPIOIDS OUT ON THE MARKET. IMAGINE, IMAGINE IF I STOOD HERE AND SAID TO YOU Y'ALL THAT I THINK THAT , OR I VOTED FOR GIVING IMMUNITY TO OIL COMPANIES FOR THE POLLUTION AND DAMAGE THEY DO TO THE GROUND WATER SUPPLIES, TO THE AIR, ETC. FOLKS, IT'S JUST FLAT-OUT IMMORAL. IT'S JUST FLAT-OUT IMMORAL. YOU KNOW, TOO MANY REPUBLICANS AND SOME DEMOCRATS LIKE BERNIE SANDERS VOTED FIVE TIMES AGAINST THE BRADY BILL THAT I WAS PASSING. FIVE TIMES. AGAINST BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WAITING PERIODS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DENIED HAVING ACCESS TO A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T QUALIFY, THEY WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO OWN ONE. YOU KNOW, ANY ONE OF YOU AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK INTO A COURT OF LAW AND DEMAND THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS WITH THEIR ENORMOUS PROFITS, ENORMOUS PROFITS, BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CARNAGE THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFLICTING ON OUR SOCIETY. I PROMISE YOU IF I'M YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE I AM COMING AFTER THEM. 150,000 DEAD ON OUR STREETS. THAT'S NOT COUNTING SUICIDES. 150,000 DEAD ON OUR STREETS BECAUSE OF THE GLAMOURIZATION OF AR-15'S, ASSAULT WEAPONS. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BUY A MAGAZINE THAT HAS 100 ROUNDS IN IT, 100 BULLETS IN IT? IN FACT, MY FIRST DAY OF OFFICE, I'M GOING TO SEND A BILL TO THE CONGRESS REPEALING THE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR GUN MANUFACTURERS, CLOSING THE BACKGROUND CHECK LOOPHOLES AND WAITING PERIOD, AND THAT NOW LET TOO MANY PEOPLE SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND I STAND WITH ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TODAY WHO CARE ABOUT SAVING THEIR CHILDREN, CARE ABOUT NOT HAVING ENTIRE GENERAL , ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE SCARRED BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TO BE SHOT AT SCHOOL. WHAT DO WE DO WHEN A VETERAN COMES HOME AND HE OR SHE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF THE VICTIM , HE OR SHE HAS BEEN INJURED OR SHOT IN A WAR? WE TRY TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH MENTAL HELP AS THEY CAN, AS MUCH SUPPORT AS THEY CAN DEALING WITH THE NIGHTMARE OF WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN? THE IMPACT ON THEIR PSYCHE? ON THEIR VERY STABILITY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? LOOK, I WROTE AN ACT. WE PUT PROTECTIONS IN THAT ACT SAYING AN ABUSER THAT HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF ABUSE CAN OWN A WEAPON BECAUSE THAT'S THE WEAPON OF CHOICE, TO KILL THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER. AND EACH TIME THAT WAS AUTHORIZED, I FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO GET MORE PROTECTION FOR THE ABUSED, SAYING THOSE WHO HAVE AN ORDER AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE ABUSED COULD NOT OWN A WEAPON. THERE'S A BILL SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK RIGHT NOW AS I SPEAK, BEING HELD UP BY THE N.R.A. AND THE PRESIDENT WHO IS OWNED BY THE N.R.A., THAT SAYS IF A BOYFRIEND ABUSES YOU, BEATS YOU UP, HAS , WHATEVER IT IS, THEY ARE NOT , THEY'RE EXEMPT FROM BEING ABLE TO BE TOLD THEY CAN'T OWN A WEAPON. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH US? LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE CARE A LOT ABOUT THE YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS GETTING HOME SAFELY AFTER SCHOOL TODAY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ALSO KNOW, JILL AND I KNOW, IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THE PAIN OF LOSING SOMEONE. BY INDISCRIMINATE CHANCE. TERRIBLE CAR CRASH TOOK THE LIVES OF MY FIRST WIFE AND MY BABY DAUGHTER. TRAGEDY MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN THROUGH. BUT NO ONE THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THINGS TO MAKE CARS SAFER. NO ONE SAID, BY THE WAY, DON'T TELL THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY THAT THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE SEATBELTS, BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AIRBAGS, THEY HAVE TO TAKE OTHER PRECAUTIONS. NOBODY SAID THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT DEALING WITH THE CARNAGE ON THE HIGHWAY. SO WE PASSED THE SEATBELT LAW, REQUIRED AIRBAGS, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CARS SAFER, REQUIRE A LICENSE TO DRIVE. AND FOR CARS TO BE REGISTERED AND INSURED. JILL AND I KNOW THE LOSS. CANCER TOOK OUR SON'S LIFE. BUT NO ONE SAID TO JILL OR ME THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE PASSING LAWS THAT DEAL WITH THE CAUSES OF THE TOXINS THAT CAUSE CANCER. NO ONE SAID TO JILL OR ME THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING THE TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T DIE OF BRAIN CANCER. NO ONE HAS SAID THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO TRY TO SAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' LIVES OR DYING OF CANCER. WHY IN GOD'S NAME CAN WE SAY THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE? BEING SHOT DEAD? IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, MURDERED? BECAUSE OF GUN VIOLENCE? LOOK, WHY ARE GUNS DIFFERENT? BECAUSE OF COWARDICE. BECAUSE OF COWARDS. COWARDS WHO ARE AFRAID TO TAKE ON THESE SPECIAL INTERESTS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DAMN POWERFUL. OUR POLITICIANS AND ELECTED LEADERS UP TO NOW HAVE JUST BEEN TOO AFRAID. THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS STAND UP TO THEM, BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DO WHAT THEY KNOW, AS THEY SAY WHAT THEY KNOW IN THEIR HEART, THEY KNOW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT'S NOT VIOLATING ANYBODY'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE, IF YOU'RE HUNTING GEESE, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHELLS IN YOUR SHOTGUN. WE PROTECT GEESE BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE. NOT ME. I'VE LOOKED IN THE EYES OF TOO MANY PARENTS AND I MEAN LITERALLY SCORES OF THEM, WHO'VE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO GUN VIOLENCE. AND LOOKED IN THE EYES OF BRAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. AND I MADE EACH OF THEM A PROMISE AND MADE MYSELF A PROMISE. I PROMISED THEM, AND I PROMISE ALL OF YOU, I WILL MAKE THIS PROMISE TODAY, THOSE FAMILIES HURTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO , WON'T STOP UNTIL WE BEAT THE N.R.A. AND IT WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE BAN KILLER ASSAULT WEAPONS, UNTIL WE HOLD GUN MANUFACTURERS LIABLE. THAT IS MY PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHETHER I'M YOUR PRESIDENT OR I AM A CITIZEN. FIGHTING FOR IT. I PROMISE YOU I WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE BEAT THESE GUYS BECAUSE IT IS IMMORAL WHAT'S HAPPENING. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I'M GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THESE FOLKS. THANK YOU. SOME NEWS FROM THE CAM PAPER TRAIL TODAY.

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I'VE STUDIED HISTORY, USED TO TEACH HISTORY, AND I'VE SAID OFTEN TO THE STUDENTS THAT I USED TO TEACH WHO WOULD QUESTION WHY DO WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME READING AND STUDYING AND DISCUSSING THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WAY BACK YONDER? I'VE OFTEN SAID THAT THEM, WE STUDY HISTORY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT AND TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE CAN HAPPEN AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND TONIGHT, AS I STAND HERE, I AM THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THAT HISTORY. AND I'M RECALLING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY ATTRIBUTED TO A GREAT FRESHMAN WHO CAME TO STUDY OUR PENAL SYSTEM AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MAGICAL ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOW, IN MY RESEARCH, I HAVE NOT FOUND THAT HE ACTUALLY SAID THIS OR WROTE THIS, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAVING SAID IT. IF HE DIDN'T SAY IT OR DIDN'T WRITE IT, THEN , THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE GOODNESS THAT EXISTS IN AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE SUPPOSEDLY SAID THAT IF AMERICANS EVER CEASE T5OO BE GOOD, AMERICA WILL CEASE TO BE GREAT. [APPLAUSE] THIS CAMPAIGN, THIS YEAR IS ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE AS OUR CANDIDATE A REAL GOOD MAN. [APPLAUSE] AS I TALK TO PEOPLE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT PATTERNS TAKING PLACE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MANY WERE PEOPLE , PEOPLE WERE SAYING, IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO ONE FACT.

WOULD HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WE THEM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER-ENDING WAR. ABOVE ALL, IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP. THE COUNTRY IS SO READY. SO READY. ONCE AGAIN, FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITIONS THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME. BUT WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT. WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE UNTIL THIS PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AND IT IS THE REASON WHY JIM AND I AND ALL OF US ARE IN THIS.

I SPOKE WITH REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON, WHOSE WIFE MYRA WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF HER BIBLE WITH EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS AT MOTHER EMMANUEL FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO. IT WAS A WEEKLY ROUTINE, READING SCRIPTURE AND FINDING PURPOSE AND FAITH IN GOD AND EACH OTHER, AND IN AN INSTANT, HATE, VENGEANCE, WHITE SUPREMACY PIERCED THAT FAITH AND THEY WERE LOST FOREVER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND THE MOST REMARKABLE THING IN MY CAREER THUS FAR? A REMARK ABOUT REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF THE EMMANUEL NINE, IS THROUGH ALL THAT PAIN, ALL THE GRIEF, THEY FORGIVE. HERE'S THE DEAL. IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, THEY BROUGHT MORE CHANGE TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAN ANY THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PREVIOUS 100 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: THINK ABOUT IT. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: REAL CHANGE. THAT'S WHY THE SUNDAY AFTER, JILL AND I AND MY FAMILY, WE CAME BACK TO MOTHER EMMANUELLE ON SUMMER SHOULD , SUNDAY SERVICES AT THE FUNERAL OF THE VICTIMS. SIX WEEKS EARLIER, WE HAD LOST OUR SON BEAU AND WE NEEDED TO BE HEALED TOO. I REALLY MEAN THIS. WE NEEDED WHATEVER THEY WERE EXUDING, AND WITH EVERY PIECE SEASON THAT HAS PASSED, THEY GOT UP AND FOUND PURPOSE TO LIVE LIFE WORTHY OF THE ONES THEY LOST, WORTHY OF THE LESSONS , BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY. WE LEFT HERE HAVING ARRIVED IN OVERWHELMING PAIN, THINKING WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT IS NO SMALL REASON WHY I'M IN THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE ALL OF YOU HERE TONIGHT ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: AND AS JIM QUOTED, HE WAS RIGHT.

BOTH OF WHOM RECENTLY ENDORSED MR. BIDEN. THIS IS JUST OVER 50 MINUTES. I WANT TO TELL YOU MY FAVORITE JOE BIDEN STORY. I WAS GOVERNOR IN 2008, THE FIRST ELECTED OFFICIAL OUTSIDE VIRGINIA TO ENDORSED BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT. IT WAS ELECTION DAY. BECAUSE I WAS GOVERNOR, I WAS ALSO SWEATING, NOT JUST WHO WOULD WIN, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE VOTING BOOTHS IN THE POLLS, WHERE THE LINES TOO LONG. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING ON ELECTION DAY, I GOT A CALL. THE CALL WAS FROM THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN AND IT SAID SENATOR BIDEN HAS JUST VOTED IN WILMINGTON. ON HIS WAY TO CHICAGO FOR WHAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE A VICTORY PARTY, HE WANTS TO STOP IN RICHMOND AND DRIVE TO A VOTING BOOTH JUST TO SAY HI TO SOME VOTERS. I TOLD HIM, THERE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I FIVE MINUTE DRIVE FROM THE RICHMOND AIRPORT. TELL ME WHAT TIME YOU WILL BE THERE AND I WILL MEET YOU. I SHOWED UP. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN LINE. THEY THOUGHT I WAS JUST THERE TO SHAKE HANDS AND THEY DID NOT KNOW I HAD A SURPRISE PLANNED FOR THEM. A GUY WALKED OUT, HE HAD JUST VOTED. I KNEW HIM FROM THE CARVER NEIGHBORHOOD. HE SAID, I HAVE JUST VOTED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I HAVE SOMETHING MORE EXCITING, NIGHT , MY NEPHEW HAS SICKLE CELL ANEMIA, JUST TURNED 18, HE IS SITTING IN THE CAR APPEARED HE IS TOO SICK TO GO INTO VOTE. HE HAS DRIVEN WITH ME, THE POLL WORKERS ARE GOING TO TAKE THE VOTING MACHINERY OUT OF TO THE CAR SO HE CAN VOTE. [APPLAUSE] PRETTY COOL. SO I SAID, DO YOU WANT A SURPRISE AFTER YOU VOTE? CAN YOU WAIT A FEW MINUTES? HE SAID WHAT KIND OF SURPRISE? I SAID I'M NOT TELLING YOU. [LAUGHTER] THEY TOOK THE MACHINERY OUT TO THE CAR, THIS YOUNG MAN WHO IS VERY SICK IN THE BACKSEAT VOTED AND I SAID SIT HERE FOR A COUPLE MOMENTS, SOMETHING COOL IS GOING TO HAPPEN. FIVE MINUTES LATER A BIG BUS CAME UP AND ALL KINDS OF SECURITY, JOE BIDEN HOPS OUT AND HE IS SHAKING EVERYBODY'S HAND. I SAID JOE, THERE IS A YOUNG GUY WHO IS CASTING HIS FIRST VOTE TODAY HE AND , AND HE JUST VOTED FOR YOU AND BARACK. HE IS TOO SICK TO GO IN, CAN YOU SAY HELLO TO HIM? THIS WAS THE MOST INTENSE DAY OF HIS LIFE, HE HAD STAFFERS TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO AND A CREW OF PRESS PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM. HE SAID ABSOLUTELY. WHERE IS THIS YOUNG MAN? WE WALKED OVER TO THE CAR. THE GUY SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? JOE BIDEN IS COMING OVER TO MY CAR? THE PRESS IS FOLLOWING JOE. JOE INSTINCTIVELY OPENS THE DOOR, GETS IN THE CAR, SHUTS THE DOOR, NO ONE CAN HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON. [LAUGHTER] THE PRESS IS SURROUNDING THE CAR AND THEY ARE SHOOTING FOOTAGE OF JOE TALKING TO THIS VERY ILL 18-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY TO BE DOING SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT ON SUCH A MOMENTOUS DAY. JOE STAYED THERE TALKING, THE STAFFERS SAID WE HAVE TO GO, EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO RUSH HIM. HE IS HAVING SUCH AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION WITH THIS YOUNG MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SAID BUT THEY TALKED FOR A LONG TIME. I KNOW THAT THAT IS A MOMENT THAT THAT YOUNG MAN WILL CARRY WITH HIM FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE. AREN'T YOU READY TO HAVE SOME DECENCY BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM TIRED THAT WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST KNOWN AMERICAN IN THE WORLD , THAT PROBABLY MEANS IN SOME WAY, THE MOST KNOWN PERSON IN THE WORLD , IS NOT A PERSON THAT ANY PARENT OR ANY TEACHER OR ANY MINISTER OR ANY MORAL LEADER SAYS TO A YOUNG PERSON, ACT LIKE THAT MAN. TALK LIKE THAT MAN. TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT MAN DOES. NO ONE IS HOLDING UP THE MOST KNOWN AMERICAN IN THE WORLD AS A ROLE MODEL FOR ANYONE.

WE SAW ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, WE GOT GREAT NEW DYNAMIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. WHO IS IT? THE GREAT THING ABOUT JOE BIDEN, YOU NEED SWING VOTERS. WHO IS AND WE CAN SEND TO SOUTH SIDE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA TO TAKE OUR MESSAGE ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH? JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] HIS SPEECH, YOU SAW HIM. THE EMPATHY. HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. HE TALKED ABOUT PATRIOTISM. WE GOT A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PATRIOTISM OR EMPATHY. HE SAID THE CORONAVIRUS WAS A HOAX. REMEMBER THIS, WHEN WE HAD THAT TRAGIC DAY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHEN 1000 NEO-NAZI CAME TO OUR STATE. I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT THAT DAY AND I BAKED PRESIDENT TRUMP, COME OUT AND CONDEMN HATRED. DO NOTE HE DID? HE SAID THERE WERE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. [BOOING] GOD LOVE YOU. WOW! I'VE GOT TO START OFF WITH MY MOTHER. SHE SAID JOEY WITH PLEASE EXCUSE MY BACK WHEN I'M TALKING, I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY BACK HERE BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION THE ONCE AND FUTURE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD , LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A PRIMARY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. [CHEERS] I JUST WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL THANKS BEFORE I GO MUCH FURTHER TO MY FRIEND. YOUR SENATOR, TIM KAINE, A TEACHER'S SON, AN IRONWORKER'S SON, A GUY WHO, IN FACT, AS LAWYER WHO FOUGHT FOR PEOPLE HIS WHOLE LIFE, HE'S A GOVERNOR WHO I'M PROUD TO HAVE TIM IN THIS FIGHT WITH ME BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER HAVE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK A FEW MORE OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANTS. CONGRESSMAN DONALD , HE'S BEEN WITH ME A LONG TIME. WHERE ARE YOU? DON, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IF I'M YOUR NOMINEE IT'S ALL DON'S FAULT. HE'S BEEN PUSHING ME TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME. HE'S BEEN WITH ME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT, DON. I REALLY MEAN IT. I CALL HER COMMANDER , [LAUGHTER] I CAME DOWN AND CAMPAIGNED FOR HER AND SHE WON IN SPITE OF IT. SHE WAS WINNING BY 20 POINTS, SHE STILL WON AFTER I CAMPAIGNED FOR HER. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'RE DOING A HECK OF A JOB, COMMANDER, AND YOU HELPED US WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2018. AND THE GUY WHO HAS FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT REFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE THAN MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER KNOW, CONGRESSMAN BOBBY SCOTT. BOBBY HAS BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. WE SERVED IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TOGETHER, AND, BOBBY, I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO WHEN I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, GOD WILLING, IS I'M GOING TO SIGN INTO LAW YOUR SAFE JUSTICE ACT WHICH WILL CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS. NO, FOR REAL. YOU KNOW IT. YOU KNOW IT. AND, FOLKS, MAYOR , WHERE ARE YOU? THANK YOU, MAN. THE PASSPORT INTO THE PLACE. RICHMOND IS A DIFFERENT PLACE BECAUSE OF YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND GOVERNOR TERRY MCAULIFFE. IT THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS BEEN A LEADER, WHO FOUGHT FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE, THAT WHEN I STARTED OFF, HE WAS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, BACK 180 YEARS AGO, VIRGINIA WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE IDEA THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD FIND A WAY THROUGH GETTING TO THE PRESIDENCY, IS THROUGH VIRGINIA. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU AND TIM HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE HERE. YOU HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF THE COUNTRY AND HERE'S THE DEAL. TO ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. SIX DAYS AGO THE PRESS AND THE PUNDITS DECLARED MY CANDIDACY DEAD. NOW, THANKS TO THE HEART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I'M VERY MUCH ALIVE. [CHEERS] AND, YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING THING IS, THAT ON TUESDAY, HERE IN VIRGINIA, YOU COULD BE THE LAUNCHING PAD TO THE PATH TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS] YOU KNOW, THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN OFF, SO I ASK Y'ALL, I ASK Y'ALL TO JOIN US, AND ANYBODY WATCHING THIS ON TELEVISION, I WANT TO TELL YOU, GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. SIGN UP. VOLUNTEER. CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. WE NEED YOU AND WE'LL USE YOU AND WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL YOUR HELP. THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR YOU. FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS DEMOCRATS ALL ACROSS THE NATION AND HERE IN VIRGINIA WILL BE VOTING ON SUPER TUESDAY. THE MOMENT TO CHOOSE THE PATH FORWARD FOR OUR PARTY HAS ARRIVED. MAYBE SOONER THAN MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD. MAYBE SOONER THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BUT IT'S HERE AND THE DECISION DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE ACROSS AMERICA IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL DETERMINE WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR, WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET DONE. IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP, KEEP NANCY PELOSI AS SPEAKER, HOLD THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND TAKE BACK THE U.S. SENATE, THE STATE LEGISLATURE, LIKE WE DID IN VIRGINIA, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, NOW IS THE MOMENT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS, THE DECISION THE DEMOCRATS MAKE ALL ACROSS AMERICA IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL DETERMINE, AS I SAID WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMA CARE, NOT SCRAP IT. [CHEERS] IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ON THE NRA AND NOT PROTECT THEM, IF THEY WANT TO STAND UP FOR THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS, WELL, FOLKS, WE'VE ARRIVED AT THAT MOMENT. THAT'S THE CHANGE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAND UP AND MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE CLASS DOESN'T HAVE TO RAISE THEIR TAXES, AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAKES A PROMISE THAT CAN BE KEPT, THEN JOIN US. AND IF DEMOCRATS WANT, IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO BUILD A COALITION AND A LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRAT IN OUR LIFETIME, BARACK OBAMA , CHEERS] YOU CAN DO THIS, WE CAN DO THIS BY BUILDING A COALITION, WE CAN DO THIS BY BRINGING TOGETHER AMERICANS OF EVERY RACE, EVERY ETHNICITY, EVERY GENDER, EVERY ECONOMIC STATION, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS RACE IS BIGGER THAN JUST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE CHARACTER OF AMERICA IS ON THE BALLOT. LITERALLY. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN EITHER WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. I SAID WINNING BIG OR LOSING BIG, THAT'S THE CHOICE. MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT THE PROMISE OF A REVOLUTION. WHAT THEY WANT IS RESULTS. RESULTS. THEY WANT TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER, AND AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT FUNDS OUR SCHOOLS, PAYS OUR TEACHERS, AND MAKES SURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS FREE, A NATION THAT'S ABLE TO STAND UP SUCCESSFULLY TO THE NRA, REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] AND AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. A JOB, AS MY DAD USED TO SAY, IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE, AFTER HAVING LOST A JOB, IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WE HAD TO MOVE TO DELAWARE. IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER HOME, BUT HE WOULD SAY, IT MEANS WHO YOU ARE. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. MY DAD LIKE MANY OF YOURS MADE THAT LONGEST WALK, UP A SHORT SLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KID'S BEDROOM AND SAY, HONEY, DAD LOST HIS JOB, MOM LOST HER JOB, WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE THIS WALK. WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME AND LIVE WITH GRANDPA AND MOM IS GOING TO AND YOUR BROTHERS ARE GOING TO GO HOME, TOO BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. YOUR SISTER. BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE. IT'S ONLY 157 MAILS AWAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON WHEN HE SAID IT. NO, I REALLY DID, SO I CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. AND WHEN I GET IT PUT TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, I PROMISE YOU. MY DAD BELIEVED IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN EVEN CHANCE IF HE WORKED LIKE HELL HE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BUT GO BACK TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOODS, ASK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT WALK TODAY, ASK THEM WHO THEY THINK THEY CAN LOOK THEIR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE NOW NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD, THE POOR ARE GETTING KILLED. WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECEIVE A BILL FOR $400 PER MONTH THEY DIDN'T EXPECT, GUESS WHAT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO BORROW THE MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. FOLKS, THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE , THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'VE BEEN OR HAVE TO BE. LOOK, I'M IN THIS FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES. FOR ALL OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US DEMOCRATS. TALK IS CHEAP. FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE. THE TALK OF REVOLUTION ISN'T CHANGING ANYONE'S LIFE RIGHT NOW. THE FACT IS, YOU NEED REAL RESULTS AND WE NEED THEM NOW. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER AND I'LL DO IT AS PRESIDENT. IT ISN'T AN ELECTION TO SPENDS OUR TIME IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT'S GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY ALL OF YOU. BUT WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYONE HERE IN TERMS OF POLITICS. YOU'VE NEVER VOTED IN AN ELECTION, NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, THAT'S MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING, THAT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY UP IN PHILADELPHIA. WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SELLING MORE DIVISION. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING BUT HEALING THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] YOU'VE GOT TO HEAL IT. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CAN'T BECOME THEM. I GET CRITICIZED IN THIS CAUCUS IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, FOR TALKING ABOUT, WE'RE NOT , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENDLESS WAR. FOLKS, SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK WITH ENDLESS WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT CONTINUES, I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE CAN'T BRING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T ALL THAT'S LEFT, ALL THAT'S LEFT IS THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. IT'S NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION. FOLKS, LOOK, WE MUST HEAL OUR DIVISIONS AND REPAIR THIS DEMOCRACY AND ABOVE ALL, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP, AND ONCE AGAIN, FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION, AS CORNY AS I SOUNDS, THE PROPOSITION, THE TRUTH IS SO SELF EVIDENT, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. [APPLAUSE] WE, THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, LOOK, LOOK, WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE WORDS OF JEFFERSON, BUT WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. LIKE WE HAVE UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE THOSE WORDS WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING. I SAW A FEW DAYS AGO IN A TOWN HALL ON CNN IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU KNOW, A GENTLEMAN SPOKE UP OR REVEREND, HE STOOD UP AND HE ASKED ME A QUESTION IN THAT TOWN HALL, HIS NAME IS REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON, WHOSE WIFE MYRA, WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF HER BIBLE WITH EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS, WITH MOTHER EMANUEL 4 1/2 YEARS AGO. IT WAS THEIR WEEKLY BIBLE STUDY. AND, YOU KNOW, A WHITE SUPREMACIST WALKED IN, THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND PURPOSE IN FAITH AND IN GOD AND IN EACH OTHER. AND IN AN INSTANT, IN AN INSTANT, WHAT HAPPENED. HATE'S VENGEANCE PIERCED THEIR FAITH. THEY ARE LOST FOREVER. ONCE MOST INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT CONGREGATION, WHAT'S MOST REMARKABLE, IS REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF EMMANUEL NINE IS THAT THROUGH THEIR PAIN AND GRIEF, THEY FOR GAVE. REMEMBER, THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER, AND IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, MORE CHANGE, MORE CHANGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAN IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. BASICALLY SHAMED THE LEGISLATURE IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND REAL CHANGE BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE. THAT WAS SIX WEEKS AFTER MY SON BO BIDEN HAD JUST DIED. AFTER A LONG, LONG ILLNESS. AND MY WIFE AND MY SON AND DAUGHTER AND I, WE STAYED DOWN ANOTHER TWO DAYS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE SUNDAY SERVICE AT MOTHER EMMANUEL. AFTER THE FUNERALS HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND THE MEMORIAL SERVICE HAD ENDED. BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO HEAL. WE NEEDED TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE, WHERE WE, THE FAMILY, COULD FIND THE KIND OF PEACE. GOD KNOWS HOW THEY FOUND IT. FOLKS, WE WENT BACK TO THAT CHURCH AND WITH EVERY DAY THAT'S PASSED, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, THEY HAVE GOTTEN UP AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP, BECAUSE WE LEARNED, AND I'M NOT PROSELYTIZING, I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTINUE ANY PARTICULAR FAITH, BUT IT WAS FAITH THAT GOT US BACK UP. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] BUT EVERY DAY, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, YOU KNOW, WHAT I LEARNED, AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS MUCH OR WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE, LOSING CHILDREN AND A WIFE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT , BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU FIND OUT WHAT I FOUND, AND THAT'S WHY I WENT BACK TO THE CHURCH, I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, BACK TO THEIR CHURCH, IS THAT I FOUND THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH REAL LOSS IS TO FIND PURPOSE. TO FIND PURPOSE. AND TO DO THINGS THAT ARE WORTHY OF THE BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY AND THE THINGS THAT YOU HOPE AND PRAY, THAT WHAT YOU LOST WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU FOR DOING. HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM, IN THIS GYMNASIUM, HAVE LOST A CHILD, MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, SISTER, LOOK AROUND, ANYWHERE FROM HALF TO 2/3 OF THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH WITHOUT ANY KIND OF HELP FROM THE FAMILY THAT I HAD. MY POINT IS. YOU'RE THE REASON I'M IN THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU HERE TONIGHT AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS HAS TO COME TO AN END. [APPLAUSE] WITH NO APATHY, NO CONCERN, NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. THEY HAVE TO END. BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THIS. THEY NOW KNOW, THEY NOW KNOW, THERE ARE TWO WAYS PEOPLE GET INSPIRED. BY INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS FROM LINCOLN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO OBAMA, OR BY REALLY BAD PEOPLE. BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR AND COMPASSION. GUESS WHAT? THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP HAVE, IN FACT, MADE PEOPLE REALIZE WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. WE HAVE TO BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. SO MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS SIMPLE. FOLKS, LET'S GET BACK UP. WE'RE DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET UP. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER FAILED WHEN WE'VE SET OUR MIND TO IT AND DONE IT TOGETHER. I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. IT'S TIME TO GET UP, TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY, AND LEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

OUT OF THE BELLY OF OPPRESSION CAME HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES, I AM A SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS MAJOR HERE AT THE TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. I WELCOME YOU ALL TO MY HISTORICAL AND BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS OF TEXAS SOUTHERN. WHEN I WAS CHOOSING WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO SUPPORT, ONE THING WAS VERY IMPORTANT ME. THEIR VOCAL SUPPORT OF HBCU'S LIKE MY OWN. HBCU'S ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE ACROSS THE NATION. HBCU'S HAVE AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT, CREATE SKILLED WORKERS, SERVE AS ECONOMIC HUBS FOR THE AREAS THAT SURROUND OUR CAMPUSES AENED BEYOND. SOME OF THE NATION'S BRIGHTEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL MINDS CAME OUT OF HBCU'S. JOE BIDEN HAS MADE IT CLEAR NOT JUST THROUGH HIS CAMPAIGNS BUT THROUGH DECADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT HE PUTS HBCU'S AT THE TOP OF HIS PRIORITY LIST. I'VE MET HIM PERSONALLY. I KNOW WITH HIM A PROMISE ISN'T JUST WORDS. IT HAS A MEANING. WHEN HE SAID HE WANTS TO FIGHT TO GET ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR HBCU'S LIKE THIS ONE, HE MEANS IT. WHEN HE LAUNCHED THE PROGRAM HBCU STUDENTS FOR BIDEN THAT I'M PART OF, IT'S BECAUSE HE DEEPLY CARES ABOUT US. WE SAW IN SOUTH CAROLINA THE POWER THAT VOTERS OF COLOR HAVE. WE HAVE THE POWER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] . WE HAVE THE POWER TO SWING THIS ENTIRE RACE TOWARD A CANDIDATE THAT CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE FALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE THAT POWER IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND WE MOST DEFINITELY HAVE THAT POWER HERE IN TEXAS. YOU CAN'T SAY HOUSTON WITHOUT INCLUDING C.S.U., THE HEART AND SOUL OF HOUSTON. , T.S.U., THE HEART AND SOUL OF HOUSTON. WE ARE A FEARLESS GENERATION. HERE IN HOUSTON, HERE IN TEXAS WE WORK HARD AND WE GO BIG. BIG DREAMS, BIG PLAN, BIG MOVES, BIG RESULTS. SO FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND MY T.S.U. TIGERS JOIN ME TOMORROW IN VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN AN PLEASE HELP ME GIVE A BIG , HELP ME GIVE A BIG T.S.U. WELCOME TO THE 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. (music) JOE BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. LET ME START OFF BY THANKING SHEILA JACKSON LEE FOR THE ESCORT INTO TOWN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT TO BE BACK AT TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. DON'T JUMP, I NEED YOU. DON'T JUMP. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, GOD LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. YOU KNOW, I HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME MEETING WITH SOME OF YOU OUTSTANDING STUDENTBACKS IN SEPTEMBER, I WARNED YOU I WAS COMING BACK AND I'M BACK. I'M BACK. ONE OF THE FINEST OF AMERICA'S HISTORICALLY BLACK UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M FROM DELAWARE. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH, YOU'RE THE SECOND BEST. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE BEST. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE. THEY'RE THE ONES, THAT'S WHERE I GOT STARTED. THAT'S WHY I GOT , LOOK I'M VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT OUR HBCU'S AND MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS. AS PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY KIND OF FORGETS NOW BECAUSE YOU BECOME SO SIGNIFICANT. EVERYBODY KIND OF FORGETS WHY HBCU'S CAME ALONG IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO ANY OTHER UNIVERSITY. WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT ENDOWMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY , OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE. SO I PROMISE YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I'M GOING TO FUND HBCU'S BY $70 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. SWEAR TO GOD. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IF YOU LACK THE ENDOWMENTS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE FOR SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT MULTIMILLION, MILLION DOLLAR AND IN SEVERAL CASES BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS OUT FOR EVERYTHING FROM GEOPOSITION, LIGHTWEIGHT METALS AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THIS WILL PUT YOU IN POSITION TO COMPETE. ONE THING YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ANYBODY ELSE IN THE NATION CAN DO AND YOU CAN DO IT AS WELL OR BETTER. YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO COMPETE. SO FOLKS , [APPLAUSE] AS I SAID, I WANT TO THANK SHEILA JACKSON LEE AGAIN. ONE THING YOU LEARN WHEN YOU GO TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AS I DID, I GOT THERE , I'M ABOUT 800 YEARS OLDER THAT SHEILA JACKSON LEE BUT WHEN YOU GET THERE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER SHE CAME AND I TELL YOU WHAT SHE NOT ONLY TOOK THE PLACE BY STORM, SHE FILLED UP A VACUUM. I LEARNED A LONG TIMING TOO , TIME AGO, DON'T ARGUE WITH HER, JUST SAY YES. YES, YES, YES. YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. AND SHE NOT ONLY FIGHTS FOR TEXAS, SHE FIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT. SHE DOESN'T BACK DOWN. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE'S IN IT. WHEN I , WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 29-YEAR-OLD KID, I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN AFTER I WON WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WON BY 33% OF THE VOTE, I WON BY ,000 VOTES STATEWIDE, NEW CANDIDATES SAID, WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? I SAID I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE SECRET IS. HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? SHEILA JACKSON LEE HAS NEVER WONDERED ABOUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE GOT INVOLVED. JUST LIKE , YOU KNOW , SHE'S NOT ONLY , JUST LIKE GARCIA, THE FIRST LATINA TO REPRESENT HOUSTON IN CONGRESS. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE'S INVOLVED. SHE'S ON THE SIDE OF WORKING FAMILIES HERE IN HOUSTON, STANDING UP FOR THE VULNERABLE, FROM HER VERY FIRST DAY AS A LEGAL AID LAWYER. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I USED TO BE A PUBLIC DEFENDER WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL. HOUSTON IS IN GOOD HANDS WITH SUCH LEADERSHIP AND VISIONARY LEADERS AS YOU HAVE FIGHTING FOR YOU AND THE COMBINATION OF THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE AND HAS GREAT POWER IN THE CONGRESS, THE ONE WHO IS AMASSING POWER FOR THE SAME REASON THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE INVOLVED. AND THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, THE PUNDITS DECLARED MY CAMPAIGN DEAD. BUT THEN ALONG CAME SOUTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] SOUTH CAROLINA HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. AS I STAND HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES, I AM VERY MUCH ALIVE BECAUSE OF YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE NOT ONLY WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WON EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ELECTION DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY PRIMARILY IN SOUTH CAROLINA WE ENDED UP INCREASING THE TURNOUT 150,000 MORE PEOPLE THAN EVEN VOTED IN 2008 WHEN BARACK AND I RAN. SO NOW, TOMORROW, TEXAS IS GOING TO SPEAK. [APPLAUSE] AS MY GRANDPA WOULD SAY , WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL HERE IN TEXAS. WITH THE HELP OF ALL OF YOU. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WE DO, WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY TO DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] LOOK. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'M HERE HEART AND SOUL. WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. TO EARN EACH AND EVERY VOTE HERE. I TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. NOTHING AT ALL. BUT I'M ASKING YOU , I'M ASKING YOU, I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOUR VOTES, I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO EARN IT. LOOK. MY MESSAGE TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU. AND THERE'S A PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR CAMPAIGN. SO JOIN US. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. SIGN UP. VOLUNTEER. CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. BUT WE NEED YOU VERY BADLY. EVERY VOTE MATTERS TOMORROW. MOST IMPORTANT VOTE IS THAT YOU THEN BACK SHEILA JACKSON LEE AS THE NOMINEE WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. THAT'S THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. TOMORROW IS SUPER TUESDAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL , I'M RUSHING AHEAD, AREN'T I? I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO DEMOCRATS HERE IN TEXAS AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT YOU CHOOSE A PATH FORWARD HAS ARRIVED FOR OUR PARTY. MAYBE SOONER THAN WHEN PEOPLE ANTICIPATED. MAYBE SOONER THAN PEOPLE GUESSED IT WOULD OCCUR OR WANTED IT TO OCCUR BUT IT'S HERE. THE DECISION, THE DECISION DEMOCRATS MAKE TOMORROW AND THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL DETERMINE WHAT WE STAND FOR, WHAT WE BELIEVE, AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AND HOW WE'LL GET THERE. IF DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, KEEP A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND ELECT THE U.S. SENATE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, THEN JOIN US. THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE, NOT SCRAP IT, THEN JOIN US. BY THE WAY, I WAS ASKED A QUESTION TODAY ON ONE OF THE NEWS PROGRAMS. PEOPLE ARE NOW WORRIED AND THE CORONAVIRUS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. THEY GAVE ME AN EXAMPLE THAT IN FACT ONE MAN GOT TESTED, WENT IN TO GET TESTED, HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE HE HAD A COLD, HAD BEEN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, THEN HE GOT A BILL FOR $3,000. UNDER OBAMACARE WHICH THEY'RE TRYING TO WIPE OUT ALL TESTS ARE FREE. FREE, FREE, FREE. ALL VACCINES WILL BE FREE TO DEAL WITH THESE CRISES. YOU AND IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL TAKE ON THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS, I'M YOUR GUY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING POOR, LOOK, WE'RE GOING TONIGHT ONES TO DO IT. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY IN TERMS OF WORKING FOLKS. AND I MAKE THIS PROMISE AND I CAN KEEP IT. THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THAT IS NEEDED AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT OTHERS ARE PROPOSING TO GET THINGS DONE, HAVE TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS AND WORKING CLASS FOLKS. YOU KNOW, IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO IS A DEMOCRAT , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] , A LIFE-LONG DEMOCRAT, A PROUD DEMOCRAT, AND OBAMA-BIDEN DEMOCRAT, THEN JOIN US. LOOK, WE CAN WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT'S UPON US NOW. WE NEED TO BUILD ON A COALITION OF LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES, BARACK OBAMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE'LL DO THIS BY BRINGING AMERICANS TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, DISABILITY OR ECONOMIC STATION. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENTS OF EVERY STRIPE, LOOK, WE DID IT, WE WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LIKE I, GOD WILLING, WILL WIN IN TEXAS TOMORROW. LIKE WE'LL DO ALL ACROSS AMERICA. THE COUNTRY IS HUNGRY. HUNGRY, HUNGRY TO BE UNITED. LOOK, WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG, THAT'S THE CHOICE. MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT A PROMISE OF A REPUBLICLUSION, THEY WANT A GUARANTEE OF RESULTS ON THE THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WANT TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY. AFFORDABLE, AVAILABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER AND AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT FRONTS SCHOOLS, PAYS FOR OUR TEACHERS, MAKES COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE, DEALS WITH THE OVERWHELMING DEBT. THE AVERAGE PERSON GRADUATING FROM AN HBCU THIS YEAR WILL GRADUATE $29,000 IN DEBT. WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT IN A SECOND. WE'RE A NATION, BUT WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO AND BEAT THE N.R.A. AND REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LONG TIME. MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. A NATION WHERE WE LIVE BY THE VALUES THAT EMBRACES IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS. DOES NOT SLAM THE DOOR ON THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION, VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION. DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM HAVE TO STAY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY TO DO IT. WE'VE NEVER, EVER , GET CHILDREN OUT OF CAGES. REUNITE FAMILIES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN IT. A NATION THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ENRICHING OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY. WE ARE BETTER FOR IT, NOT WORSE OFF FOR IT. LOOK, WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH, LIKE IT DOES TODAY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. A JOB IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I REALLY MEAN THIS, AFTER HE LOST A JOB AND DIED, TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRANDPOP LIVING WITH US. MY LORD, I WONDER HOW MY PARENTS LIVED WITH THOSE THIN WALLS, LOOKING BACK ON IT. ANYWAY. THIS IS ABOUT ALL OUR FAMILIES. IT'S ABOUT ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. THE WAY I LOOK AT EVERYTHING, AND I MEAN THIS, I'M CRITICIZED FOR IT OCCASIONALLY. I LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE PRISM OF HOW IT AFFECTS YOU, BUT YOUR FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY, ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY I'M A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, FOLKS, TALK IS CHEAP. FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE. AND TALK OF REVOLUTION ISN'T CHANGING ANYONE'S LIFE. WE NEED REAL RESULTS AND WE NEED THEM NOW. I'VE DONE THAT MY WHOLE CAREER. AND I'LL DO IT AS PRESIDENT. SO THIS ISN'T AN ELECTION TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'RE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE REALLY ARE. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION. IN THE FIRST PLACE. FROM THE TIME I WAS A KID, I GOVED INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS , I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. COMING HOME, BY THE WAY, MY STATE, MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW, MY STATE IS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN AMERICA. WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT IN COMMON. WE WERE A SLAVE STATE. WE ARE JUST LIKE A LOT OF STATES IN THE SOUTH. EXCEPT WE WERE ONE OF THOSE BORDER STATES. DELAWARE, MARYLAND, THEY WERE ALL , COULD NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE, THANK GOD. SO, WHEN I WAS A KID, I WORKED WITH WHAT WAS CALLED THE EAST SIDE. I GOT DEEPLY INVOLVED. I SPENT MY TIME IN THE BLACK CHURCH ON SUNDAY, I MUST ADMIT TO YOU, AFTER GOING TO MASS EARLIER IN THE MORNING. [LAUGHTER] MOM, I REALLY DID. NOT A JOKE. BUT WE'D SIT THERE AND WE'D ORGANIZE. AND WE'D DRAW SOME HOPE FROM WHAT WAS GOING ON. WHEN I CAME HOME, I WENT AWAY TO LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE WE HAD NO LAW SCHOOL IN DELAWARE AT THE TIME. WHEN I CAME HOME, DR. KING , I HAVE TWO POLITICAL HEROES. DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY. AND, FOLKS, BOTH WERE ASSASSINATED THE LAST SEMESTER I WAS IN SCHOOL IN LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I CAME HOME AND I HAD A JOB WITH A FANCY LAW FIRM, GOOD LAW FIRM, DECENT PEOPLE. BUT MY CITY, WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, WAS THE ONLY CITY IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY, FOR 10 MONTHS, STANDING ON THE EAST CORNER WITHDRAWN BAYONETS, AS MY PROFESSOR WOULD SAY, YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. NO EXAGGERATION. AND WHAT HAPPENED? I FOUND MYSELF IN A POSITION WHERE I TALKED ABOUT ALL THIS TIME ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AFTER I GOT ADMITTED TO THE BAR IN JANUARY, I REALIZED I COULDN'T STAY IN THAT LAW FIRM. I COULDN'T , QUIT AND BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER. BECAUSE, AND I USED TO INTERVIEW MY CLIENTS DOWN WHAT THEY CALLED THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR, AMTRAK CORRIDOR, THAT GOES FROM ALL THE WAY UP THE COAST, PARTICULARLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT GOES FROM WASHINGTON TO NEW YORK, AND USED TO INTERVIEW MY COMPLIANTS DOWN THERE AID THOUGHT THINGS WOULD NEVER , CLIENTS DOWN THERE AND I THOUGHT THINGS WOULD NEVER GET BETTER. NEVER GET BETTER. I THOUGHT BLACKS AND WHITES WOULD NEVER BE TALKING TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE THE CITY WAS OVER 60% AFRICAN-AMERICAN. WELL, HERE I WAS LITERALLY 40 YEARS TO THE MONTH STANDING ON THAT SAME PLATFORM AT THAT SAME TRAIN STATION, IT HIT ME. I WAS WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 26 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA ON A TRAIN TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME A TOTAL OF 147 MILES SOUTH TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO I CALLED MY THREE CHILDREN, GROWN CHILDREN. I CALLED THEM UP WHERE I WAS STANDING AND MY SON WHO WAS A WAR HERO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE THEN, I SAID, AND I CALLED MY SON HUNTER UP. BO IS MY SOUL, HUNTER IS MY HEART. HE DID THE WORLD TROOP FOOD PROGRAM, U.S.A. AND MY DAUGHTER IS A SOCIAL WORKER. AND RANT LARGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SYSTEM IN THE STATE. I CALLED THEM UP AND SAID, LOOK, I SAID, LOOK AT THE EAST SIDE OVER HERE. IT'S REBUILT. LOOK OVER AT THIRD STREET BRIDGE. IT'S REBUILT. AND I SAID, DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN'T CHANGE. I'M ABOUT TO BE PICKED UP BY THIS MAN AND WE ALL CELEBRATED. I THOUGHT I KNEW AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH HATE IN THIS , I THOUGHT COULD YOU DEFEAT HATE. BUT I WAS WRONG. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, IN 2017, THE CHARLOTTESVILLE, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE THOSE FOLKS COMING OUT OF THE FIELD WITH THEIR VAINS BULGING, CARRY , VEINS BULLING, CARRYING TORCHES, NAZI BANNERS. DAVID DUKE SAYING, THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM. ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED AND THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO COMMENT. HE SAID SOMETHING NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, QUOTE, THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. BY THE WAY, IT'S MORE THAN A BOO, IT'S A REALITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO RUN. THAT'S WHY I GOT IN THIS RACE. I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN ATLANTIC MAGAZINE SAYING, WE'RE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. AND I MEANT IT. BY THE WAY , [APPLAUSE] , IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE FOR HIM SINCE THEN. THE WAY HE MOCKS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE WAY HE TALKS DOWN TO PEOPLE. THE WAY HE TREATS MINORITIES LIKE WE'RE SUBHUMAN. THE WAY HE DEALS WITH US AND SEPARATES US, THE WAY HE EMBRACES DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD AN POKES HIS FINGER IN THE EYE OF OUR ALLIES. LOOK, HIS VIEW OF WOMEN IS NOT EVEN A VIEW. NO, I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS , I SHOULDN'T GET GOING. [LAUGHTER] BUT, FOLKS, WE'RE AT A VERY PERILOUS MOMENT. BECAUSE WE CAN, GOD WILLING, WITH THE RIGHT NOMINEE, TURN YOUR CHILDREN'S VIEW OF HISTORY INTO, WELL, FOUR YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA , FOUR YEARS AFTER BARACK OBAMA, HAVING THIS GUY AS PRESIDENT WAS AN ABERRATION, A HISTORICAL ABERRATION. BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS, HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE AND THAT'S A FACT. HE'LL CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. AND WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE AS THE ENEMY. IF WE DO THAT, WE CAN NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE. NOT SEWING MORE DISTINGUISH THAN ANGER. [APPLAUSE] NOT ONLY , THE WORDS OF PRESIDENTS MATTER. NOT ONLY MEANS FIGHTING, BUT HEALING. HEALING THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION, RE PAIR OUR DEMOCRACY. AND ABOVE ALL, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP ON ITS FEET AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. SOUNDS CORNY. NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL MEN AND WOMEN CREATED BY , YOU KNOW THE THING. YOU KNOW HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT. WE THE PEOPLE. FOLKS, INDO YOUED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INDIANA ALIENABLE RIGHTS. WEEK NEVER LIVED UP TO. THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WROTE THE WORDS NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. BUT WE'VE NEVER, EVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. NEVER. AND I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING THAT'S WHO WE STILL ARE. WE HAVE ALWAYS MOVED FORWARD. WE'VE ALWAYS INCREASED THE APPER TOUR OF INCLUSION MORE AND MORE. AND WE HAVE A CHANCE NOW, A FEW DAYS AGO I DID A TOWN MEETING IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT ON CNN. I SPOKE WITH THE REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON. WHOSE WIFE, MAYA, WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE WITH EIGHT OF HER PARISHIONERS AT MOTHER EMANUEL CHURCH WHEN A WHITE SUPREMACIST ENTERING THE CHURCH 4 1/2 YEARS AGO. AND GUNNED THEM ALL DOWN. IT WAS A WEEKLY ROUTINE, READING SCRIPTURE, FINDING PURPOSE IN FAITH AND GOD AND EACH OTHER. AND IN AN INSTANT, HATE'S VENGEANCE PIERCED THEIR FAITH AND LOST FOREVER. BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF THE EMANUEL NINE IS THAT THROUGH THEIR PAIN AND GRIEF, THEY DID SOMETHING TOTALLY REMARKABLE. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. I WAS THERE. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. AND IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, CHANGE THAT HAD BEEN FOUGHT FOR FOR OVER 100 YEARS IN SOUTH CAROLINA BEGAN TO OCCUR. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN. REAL CHANGE BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE. BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT HEALING. THAT SUNDAY I CAME BACK TO MOTHER EMANUEL QUIETLY, NO PRESS, NO ANYBODY. JUST TO SEE TO IT. BECAUSE WE, I JUST LOST OUR SON SIX WEEKS EARLIER. AND MY FAMILY NEEDED TO BE HEALED. SO WE CAME BACK AND WE WORSHIPED BECAUSE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT HEALING, IT'S ABOUT BEING REMINDED. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH SIMILAR THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH. SOME OF YOU WORSE THAN I'VE BEEN THROUGH. BUT WHAT DO YOU NEED? YOU NEED PURPOSE IN YOUR LIFE. PURPOSE, REMINDED THAT THOSE YOU LOST ARE STILL PART OF YOU. BO WAS MY SOUL. LIKE WHEN I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND MY TWO KIDS WERE NOT , [INDISCERNIBLE] , WITH EVERY DAY OF EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, REVEREND THOMPSON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION HAVE GOTTEN UP AND FOUGHT FOR PURPOSE. PURPOSE OF THEIR LIVES. A PURPOSE WORTHY OF THEIR LOVED ONES. WORTHY OF THE BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY OF OURS. AND THEY'RE THE REASON, THEY'RE THE REASON I'M IN THIS RACE. YOU'RE THE REASON ""NEW YORK TIMES"" THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT HAVE FOUGHT HERE TODAY, ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, TO DEAL WITH THE CRISES YOU'VE FACED IN YOUR LIVES. THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS, I PROMISE YOU, WILL SOON BE OVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE CAN AND WE MUST BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. SO LET'S GET BACK UP. WE'RE DECENT, WE'RE BRAVE, WE'RE RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET UP AND LET'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. LET'S TAKE IT BACK NOW! NOW, NOW, NOW! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU.

(music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] THANK YOU! UNBELIEVABLE. HOW GREAT IS IT TO BE HERE IN DALLAS, TEXAS? [CHEERING] AND HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE HERE WITH MY FAMILY, JOHN AND ABIGAIL AND WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. AND HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO BE STANDING NEXT TO HIM ON THE STAGE WHEN IT ISN'T THE DEBATE STAGE. [CHEERING] SO, I ACTUALLY ASKED YOU ALL KNOW ANNOUNCED MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A MINNESOTA BLIZZARD JUST SO I COULD IMPRESS EVERYONE IN TEXAS. [CHEERING] AND IN PARTICULAR, EVERYONE IN DALLAS. SO, WE DIDN'T LET THE SNOW STOP US. WE DIDN'T LET THE COLD STOP US. WE DID CONTINUE THROUGH THAT SPEECH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE HEARTLAND. WE MADE THE CAMPAIGN GO A LONG WAY, AND OUR HOMEGROWN CAMPAIGN WITH A TREMENDOUS STAFF THAT STUCK TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING AND VOLUNTEERS BEAT THE ODDS AND THAT GOT ME UP HERE RIGHT NOW ON THIS STAGE IN DALLAS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE MOST AMAZING THING WAS GETTING TO KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT DOES THIS AS WELL. THE VIETNAM VET AS HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING HIS SON FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. THE RANCHER THAT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT AFTER HE SAW HIM GIVE A SPEECH IN FRONT OF THAT SACRED WALL WITH A CIA STAR OF THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE OF DUTY DECIDED HE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] THE IMMIGRANT MOM WHO TOLD ME SHE WORKS TWO JOBS OLD FOR HER KIDS, AND THROUGH IT ALL I SAID TO THEM, AND I BELIEVE THIS NOW STANDING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT, IF YOU FEEL TIRED OF THE NOISE AND NONSENSE IN OUR POLITICS, AND IF YOU ARE TIRED OF THE EXTREMES, YOU HAVE A HOME WITH ME AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO MANY PEOPLE JOINED US, SUPPORTED US AS WE CARRIED FORWARD WITH THIS SIMPLE BUT FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE IN THAT IT IS TIME FOR AMERICANS TO JOIN HANDS AND STICK OF POINTING FINGERS , INSTEAD OF POINTING FINGERS. IT IS TIME TO TURN BACK THE DIVISION AND HATE AND EXCLUSION AND BITTERNESS COMING INTO THIS TIME TO WORK TOGETHER TO LIFT UP THOSE WHO ARE LEFT OUT AND TO BRING PEOPLE WITH US INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM AWAY. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IT IS THE REASON I END AM UP HERE THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO OUT DIVIDE THE DECIDER IN CHIEF. WE MUST AS AMERICANS DREAM BIGGER THAN THAT. WE HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THAT. BECAUSE IF WE SPEND THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS DIVIDING OUR PARTY AND GOING AT EACH OTHER, WE WILL SPEND THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WATCHING DONALD TRUMP TEAR APART THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TEXANS, WE NEED TO UNITE OUR PARTY AND OUR COUNTRY. AND TO DO IT, NOT JUST WITH OUR WORDS BUT WITH OUR ACTION IT IS UP TO US, ALL OF US TO PUT THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER, TO HEAL THE COUNTRY AND THEN TO BUILD SOMETHING EVEN GREATER. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY TODAY I AM ENDING MY CAMPAIGN AND ENDORSING JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS TO SAY. [LAUGHTER] JOE BIDEN HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE. NOT FOR THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL, BUT FOR THE MOMS, THE FARMER, THE DREAMER, FOR THE BUILDER, FOR THE VETERAN. HE CAN BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AND FILLED THAT COALITION OF OUR FIGHTERS OF DEMOCRATIC FAITH AND AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE WE DO NOT IN OUR PARTY WANT TO GET BY A VICTORY, WE WANT TO WIN BIG. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW FROM ALL THE WORK HE HAS DONE, HE WILL NOT JUST GOVERN WITH HIS HAT. HE HAS A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS, BUT HE WILL ALSO GOVERN WITH HIS HEART AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IN THIS GREAT STATE OF TEXAS THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY IS BIGGER THAN THE HEART OF THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] THIS TIME, AND AMERICA, AMERICA, FOR A PRESIDENT THAT UNDERSTAND THAT SERVICE IS NOT ABOUT SELF-INTEREST. IT IS ABOUT SACRIFICE. [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT THAT REPRESENTS ALL OF AMERICA, INCLUDING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY, AT A TIME WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE IN THE EXTREMES THAT ARE TRYING TO DROWN OUT PEOPLE. AND MOST OF ALL, IT IS TIME , AND THIS IS WHAT I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT , IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT THAT WILL BRING DECENCY AND DIGNITY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [CHANTING] AT ONE OF THE DEBATES, THE MANY DEBATES, I TOLD A STORY , [LAUGHTER] I TOLD THE STORY OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT AND WHEN HE DIED HE PUT HIS BODY ON A TRAIN THAT WENT FROM GEORGIA TO WASHINGTON, D.C.. THE STORY IS PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY STOOD ALONG THE STREAM TRACKS TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT. AND A REPORTER CAME UP ON A REGULAR GUY THAT JUST HAD HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS AND HE WAS SOBBING. THE REPORTER SAID TO HIM SIR, DO YOU MIND ME ASKING DID YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT? AND THE GUY SAYS NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. [CHEERING] AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS NO EMPATHY, BUT CANNOT PUT HIMSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WELL, GUESS WHO CAN DO THAT, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""WE LOVE JOE!] SO, IF YOU OUT THERE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR PAYCHECK TO PAY FOR YOUR RENT OR YOUR MORTGAGE OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY IS, YOU KNOW JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE SOMEONE TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO BE PAID FOR PAY FOR THE LONG-TERM CARE OF YOUR PARENTS AND CHILD CARE OR COLLEGE FOR YOUR KIDS, SHOW KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW AM I GOING TO FILL THAT PRESCRIPTION FOR INSULIN OR SOME OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR FILL MY REFRIGERATOR, JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. SO, I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO END MY CAMPAIGN THAN BY JOINING HIS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BECAUSE AMERICA, YOU GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF AN IRON ORE MINER, THE DAUGHTER OF A TEACHER AND A NEWSPAPER MAN. YOU GAVE ME, MINNESOTA, THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. IN AMERICA, YOU GAVE ME THIS INCREDIBLE YEAR TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAITH IN WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER. IT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR UNDYING BELIEF THAT FOR ALL OF US, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. SO, BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT, I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING REALLY PRACTICAL. TOMORROW IS SUPER TUESDAY. THERE ARE 14 SUPER TUESDAY STATES INCLUDING MY HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA. [CHEERING] SO, WHAT I WANT ALL OF YOU TO DO IS VOTE FOR JOE. VOTE FOR DECENCY, VOTE FOR DIGNITY, VOTE FOR THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY THAT IS WHAT HE WILL BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND WITH THAT, I GIVE YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. HELLO, DALLAS. AS MY MOM WOULD SAY, I APOLOGIZE FOR MY BACK. IF YOU HAVE MY BACK I PROMISE I WILL HAVE YOURS. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THE SENATOR'S ENDORSEMENT MEANS TO ME. IT'S GREAT TO SEE HER FAMILY, HER HUSBAND JOHN INTO THEIR BRILLIANT DAUGHTER AND FROM THE MOMENT ANY KLOBUCHAR ANNOUNCED IN A SNOWSTORM IT WASN'T HARD TO SEE SHE HAD THE DETERMINATION TO DO ANYTHING SHE SETS HER MIND TO TO. AMY KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S WHY AMY HAS NEVER LOST, SHE'S NOT LOSING NOW. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR A LOT FROM ANY KLOBUCHAR FOR A LONG TIME. SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SENATORS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HER CAMPAIGN WAS ALL ABOUT WHAT WE COULD GET A GUN TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER EVERY DAY IN SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS. FOLKS, THE STORY AMY TELLS ABOUT THAT PERSON FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AS THE TRAIN WENT BY. SHE BELIEVES IN THAT NOTION SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT THAT HE KNEW ME. IT'S EVERYTHING AMY IS ABOUT. NOBODY HAS EVER DEALT WITH HER DOESN'T THINK THAT SHE KNOWS THEM AND ISN'T THAT EVERYTHING MISSING TODAY AMY'S BOOK IS SOMETHING THAT I SENT TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT AS WELL AND TO COMPLETE THE TOTAL LACK OF EMPATHY AND DECENCY IN THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT, HE CANNOT STAY THERE. WE ALL KNOW IT. THERE IS NO SENSE OF DECENCY OR HONOR THE WAY HE RIDICULES PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMEANS PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT HE'S SO SELF ABSORBED HE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY. I KNEW, I BELIEVE HE WASN'T GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT, BUT I HAVE TO MENTION WITH DONALD TRUMP, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. IT'S HAVING A CORROSIVE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REPORTS OF CHILDREN IN SCHOOL MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PRESIDENT A LARGE PIECE IN THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" TALKED ABOUT THE WAY TEACHERS ARE ARE FINDING KIDS ARE BULLYING OTHER KIDS SINGLING OUT IMMIGRANTS RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT IN GODS NAME DID WE EXPECT AND WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THIS BEHAVIOR BECAME SO CLEAR. WHEN THEY TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY. I SAID MANY TIMES IN THE CAMPAIGN THIS NATION WILL BE ABLE TO OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT IF THIS MAN IS REELECTED, HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE YARD AS A NATION FOR BETTER THAN A GENERATION TO COME AND WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SO, AMY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE VOICE YOU ARE GOING TO SUPPLY IN THE RACE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT I AM TRULY HONORED TO HAVE IT. I WASN'T JOKING, AMY WONG ALL THE DEBATES AND I'M GLAD I WASN'T ON STAGE DEBATING YOU AGAIN. THE PRESS AND THE PUNDITS DECLARED THIS CAMPAIGN DAVID BUT SOUTH CAROLINA HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. [CHEERING] TOMORROW TEXAS AND MINNESOTA AND THE REST OF THE SUPER TUESDAY STATES ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT IT. AND WHEN YOU DO WE WILL BE ON OUR WAY TO DEBATING DONALD TRUMP FOR A SECOND TERM. MY MESSAGE TO EVERYONE, EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. JOIN JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS. LOOK, TOMORROW ACROSS THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IT WILL DETERMINE WHAT THE PARTY STANDS FOR. WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. IF THEY WANT A NOMINEE TO BEAT DONALDBEATDONALD TRUMP ANDBEDONALD TRUMP, KEEP NANCY PELOSI SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WE KEEP SURE WE TAKE BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THEY WILL BUILD OBAMACARE, NOT TOSCRAP IT, TAKE ON THE FRA, STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, NOT RAISE THEIR TAXES AND BIG PROMISES THAT CAN'T BE KEPT. THEN JOIN US. THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE THAT IS A DEMOCRAT. AND OBAMA BIDEN DEMOCRAT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WEEKEND WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. THAT IS A CHOICE. WE NEED TO BUILD A COALITION AND A LEGACY OF THE SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENTS OF A LIFETIME. BARACK OBAMA. AND WE WILL DO THIS BY BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT UNITED AMY AND ME ALL ALONG. THE IDEA WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. REMEMBER HOW FOLKS MADE FUN SAYING IT CAN'T BE DONE. WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT REPUBLICANS ARE OUR ENEMY, THEY ARE THE OPPOSITION. WHAT, FOLKS, THIS TIME WE HAVE TO BRING A AROUND EVERYBODY, EVERY SITUATION DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, OF EVERY STRIPE. THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT FOR THE CAMPAIGN. SHE SHARES IN THAT VIEW. WE NOW HAVE OVER 1,500 ENDORSEMENTS INCLUDING 36 CONGRESSMEN MAYERS COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS JOINING THE CAMPAIGN THE LAST TWO DAYS. THEY DON'T WANT THE PROMISE OF A REVOLUTION. THEY WANT RESULTS, THEY WON'T HONOR AND CHARACTER AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY THAT PAYS TEACHERS A DECENT WAGE AND THINKS , A NATION WHERE WE STAND UP AND BEAT THE NRA REFORM SYSTEM. MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, THE WHOLE WORLD. A NATION WHERE WE LIVE OUR VALUES AND PLACE IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS BODYSLAM THE DOOR IN THE FACE OF THOSE. FOLKS, FOLKS, 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 STUDENTS IN SCHOOL IS LATINO. .. REWARDS WORK. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, JOEY A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT IS ABOUT DECENCY, RESPECT, TO LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON , I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS WHAT HE SAID, LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY. AMERICA IS JUST ASKING FOR AN EVEN CHANCE IN THEIR BEING DENIED THAT. THIS IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IT IS ABOUT ALL OF OUR FAMILIES, ALL OF HER COMMUNITIES. AMY AND I LOOK AT EVERYTHING , THERE GOES TRUMP'S, ANYWAY. HOW IT AFFECTS YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY, ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS, IT IS SIMPLE, THAT'S WHY I'M A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS ELECTION IS NOT A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND IN THE MOST PERILOUS MOMENT WE FACE IN ANYONE'S LIFETIME HERE, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA NOT MAKING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING AS PRESIDENT BUT A PRESIDENT WHO HEALS THE COUNTRY. A COUNTRY HAS TO BE HEALED, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. [CHEERING] WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL THE DIVISION, REPAIRED DEMOCRACY. I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT, NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS BUT INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW WE HAVE TO HEAL THIS COUNTRY. ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION, AS CORNY AS IT SOUNDS. WE HOLD THE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. THE ALLMAN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. THAT IS A UNIQUE OF AMERICA, WERE BASED ON AN IDEA, WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT BUT WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY LIKE THIS PRESIDENT HAS. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN ME, WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH EVERY GENERATION HAS OPENED CONCLUSION CONCLUSION, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SHOT. , I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR CAREERS TO FIGHTING FOR MORE PERFECT UNION, COLIN, HE FLIPPED HIS DISTRICT TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE IN 2016. [CHEERING] HE DID WHAT I ONLY DREAMED OF DOING. PLAYING IN THE NFL. WHAT A HELL OF AN ATHLETE AND A GREAT CONGRESSMAN. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HE HOLDS THAT SEAT IN NOVEMBER. IN MARK BEEBE, GOD LOVE HIM, HE'S DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. HELP LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST THE EROSION OF VOTING IN HIS NATION. HALF THE NATION , HALF THE STATES IN THE NATION HAVE PUT UP BARRIERS, IT'S A NEW JIM CROW ALL OVER AGAIN. AND JOHNSON AS ALLEGING OF WHOM I MONITOR SHARE THE STAGE. SHE KNOWS HOW TO THINK AND TO GET THINGS DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF DALLAS AND SHE LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. TODAY IS DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. I GUARANTEE YOU, WE CAN BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NOW SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. FOLKS THERE'S TWO WAYS PEOPLE GET INSPIRE, THEY GET INSPIRED BY GREAT LEADERS LIKE LINCOLN AND ROOSEVELT AND KENNEDY AND OBAMA. THANK YOU BUT THEY ALSO GET INSPIRED BY VERY BAD LEADERS. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS PRESIDENT HAS RIPPED THE BAND-AID OFF. EXPOSED HOW VENAL HE HAS BECOME AND HOW HE HAS LITERALLY STRANGLED THE LIFE OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SO FOLKS, WE HAVE A SHOT. THIS IS BIGGER THAN WHETHER A DEMOCRAT WINS. THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING THE CHARACTER OF AMERICA. NOT A JOKE. BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN DAMAGED ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE'VE BEEN DAMAGED BADLY. HIS RACE OF THUGS AND DICTATORS, THE WAY HE TREATS HER MILITARY AND TALKS ABOUT THEM. THE WAY HE DEMEANED PEOPLE. LADIES AND DELTA MEN AT HOME, HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEEK DIVISION. IT IS TIME TO GET BACK OUT. [CHEERING] WE ARE DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE AND WE CAN LEAD AGAIN, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT SO GET UP GRADE THAT'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND PROTECTIVE TROOPS. [CHEERING] FOLKS, THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE, ONE MORE PERSON I WANT TO THINK.

I AM GOING TO START BY REJOINING AN OUTFIT I PUT TOGETHER, THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND WE WILL MOVE ALONG. A COUNTRY WITH OUR QUALITY OF EDUCATION DOES NOT , WHERE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION DOES NOT DEFEND A NEW ZIP CODE. PROVIDING RAISES FOR TEACHERS. PRESCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD AND FIVE YEARS OLD, AND INCREASING THEIR PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS. FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROVIDING TRAINING FOR EVERY JOB OF THE 21ST CENTURY. AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE COST OF GOING TO COLLEGE AND STOOD IN DEBT. IF YOU VOLUNTEER, YOU PAY NOTHING. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE CAN DO THIS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILD THIS COUNTRY. AND UNIONS BUILD A MIDDLE-CLASS. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [APPLAUSE] [BOOS] LOOK, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GETTING CLOBBERED. TOO MANY OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS JILL AND I GREW UP IN. THEY ARE GETTING HURT. BADLY HURT. MANY OF THE PLACES WE COME FROM, MANY OF YOU COME FROM. IT IS WHERE WE WERE RAISED. THE PEOPLE, THEY ARE THE REASON WHY I AM RUNNING. WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT OUR ROADS, WHO KEEP OUR WATER SAFE, WHO TEACH OUR KIDS. WHO GROW OUR FOOD AND BUILD OUR CARS, PICK UP OUR GARBAGE. VETERANS, D.R.E.A.M.E.R.S., SINGLE MOM.

EVERYBODY. REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, DISABILITY, EVERY STRIPE. LOOK. LIKE WE DID IN SOUTH CAROLINA, LIKELY DID ACROSS AMERICA TODAY. LIKE WE WILL DO ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS WHY I WAS SO PROUD YESTERDAY, BEING EMBRACED BY AMY KLOBUCHAR. [APPLAUSE] WE WON MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF AMY KLOBUCHAR. AND WE ARE DOING WELL IN TEXAS BECAUSE OF BETO O'ROURKE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY I AM SO PROUD, SO INCREDIBLY PROUD TO HAVE MAYOR PETE'S ENDORSEMENT AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND COURAGE. BY THE WAY, I WAS PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY JIM CLYBURN. MAN, HE IS SOMETHING ELSE.

THIS ALL STARTS WITH THE REVIVAL OF DECENCY, HONOR AND CHARACTER. TRUMP HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE AND SALT TO DIVIDE US. HE HAS INSULTED, DEMONIZED , HATE AND SOUGHT TO DIVIDE US. HE HAS INSULTED, DEMONIZED, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EMPATHY, COMPASSION. NO REGARD FOR THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE WAY WE ARE. NOT THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED BY YOUR MOM AND DAD. HE LACKS THE HONESTY, DECENCY AND RESPECT. HE USES IT AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE A BEACON OF THE WORLD. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. THAT IS WHY I SAID THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED THIS CANDIDACY, WE ARE LIVING IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING SEEDS OF DIVISION AND ANGER AND HATE. WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE HIM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER ENDING WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIGHT. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, I CAN FIGHT. BUT LOOK, WE NEED AS BADLY, SOMEONE WHO CAN HEAL. WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DID, SAVING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, WHAT WE DID TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. IT WAS JUST A START. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN HEAL THE COUNTRY AS WELL. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. I PROMISE YOU. IT IS ABOUT DELIVERING REAL RESULTS FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, JILL, OR VALERIE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. PARAPHRASING ROBERT BROWN. HE SAID, ""OUR REACH SHOULD EXCEED OUR GRASP."" THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE CAN GRASP WHAT EVER WE REACH FOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I QUOTE AN ENGLISH POET , LET ME CLICK A REAL POET NOW, AN IRISH POET. [APPLAUSE] HE WROTE A POEM CALLED ""THE CURE OF TROY."" I BELIEVE THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BEING. HE SAID, HISTORY SAYS, DON'T HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME, THE TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE IN HISTORY RISE. WE CAN MAKE HOPE IN HISTORY RHYME. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT DO. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. NOT ABOUT THE PAST. IT IS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. IT IS ABOUT LEADING THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. BY LORD, THIS IS USENET OFFICIAL AMERICA. IT IS TIME FOR THEM , THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN STAND UP TO THE POSITION THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN WERE CREATED EQUAL. WE HAVE TO REALIZE HOW PROFOUND THAT STATEMENT IS. WE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE WORDS. AFTER THIS PRESIDENT, WE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT THAT IS WHO WE ARE. SO LET'S GET BACK UP, WE ARE A DECENT, BRAVE AND RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT.

AND TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM ALL ACROSS THE NATION WITH VICTORIES IN TEXAS, VIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA, ARKANSAS, ALABAMA, TENNESSEE, OKLAHOMA. MINNESOTA. MASSACHUSETTS AND JUST THIS MORNING WE WON MAINE AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: IT WILL BE A WHILE FOR THE FINAL RESULTS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THOSE WHO OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO BRING TOGETHER ALL AMERICANS. AND WE SHOWED THAT LAST NIGHT REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE OR GENDER, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, EVERY STRIPE. I REALLY MEAN THAT. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO WIN AND UNIFY THE NATION. I RAN IN THE FIRST PLACE TO UNIFY. WE WELCOME ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO JOIN US. AND TO BUILD A MOVEMENT. AND THIS IS A MOVEMENT. IT IS A MOVEMENT. AND WE NEED THAT MOVEMENT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND TO BUILD A FUTURE WE ALL KNOW IS POSSIBLE. I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF OUR CAMPAIGN THAT IS DRIVING UP VOTER TURNOUT. THIS IDEA THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A MOVEMENT. LOOK AT THE RESULTS AND LOOK WHO IS SHOWING UP. THIS CAMPAIGN, THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME ARE BRINGING OUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED. IT'S WAY UP. WAY UP. POSITIVE PROGRESSIVE VISION IS RESONATING, RESONATING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. HEALTH CARE IS AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD GETS A QUALITY EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THE ZIP CODE THEY LIVE IN. AND TO TAKE ON AND BEAT THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS WHICH I PROMISE YOU, I WILL DO AND NOT ONLY PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT WHAT I HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR SOME TIME, INCREASING BENEFITS FOR SENIORS THAT ARE IN NEED NOW WHO HAVE LOST A SPOUSE OR RUN OUT OF THEIR COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING A LONG TIME AND SECURING IT FOR EVERY GENERATION THAT FOLLOWS. THAT IS THE PROPOSAL. AND TAKE ON THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU KNOW, IT IS THE THREAT TO OUR PLANET. AND CREATING IN THE PROCESS, WE WILL CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS. NOT $15 AN HOUR. THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISPLACED, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO GET THOSE JOBS. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS. BUT FROM PASSING OBAMACARE AND THE WORK WE DID TO RESCUE THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND THE NATION'S ECONOMY, EVERYBODY FORGETS. MY MOTHER HAD AN EXPRESSION, THE GREATEST ABILITY WAS THE ABILITY TOM FORGET. IF THAT WEREN'T THE CASE, WE WOULD HAVE ONE CHILD. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, WE FORGET WHERE WE WERE. AND WE WERE JUST GETTING READY AND JUST GOT THE ECONOMY UP AND RUNNING IN A BIG WAY AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN A BIG WAY. WE TOOK ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE. EVERYTHING WAS JUST BEGINNING. WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. WE HAVE TO PUT IN A BIGGER BROADER VISION FOR THIS NATION AND MAKE IT HAPPEN. BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO KEEP NANCY PELOSI AS THE SPEAKER. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO WIN THE SENATE BACK AND THIS VISION THAT I HAVE FOR THE FUTURE, WE WILL MAKE IT A REALITY. WHAT WE CAN'T LET HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IS LET THIS PRIMARY TURN INTO A CAMPAIGN OF NEGATIVE ATTACK SM THE ONLY THING IS HELP DONALD TRUMP AND DOESN'T HELP ANY ONE OF THE CANDIDATES LEFT IN THE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL. WE HAVE TO KEEP THE EYE ON THE SOUL. IF DONALD TRUMP POSES A THREAT TO OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. HE DOES. THEY ALL KNOW HE HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE AND SOUGHT TO DIVIDE US AND WATCHED INSULT OUR ALLIES AND EMBRACE DEMAGOGS AND EMBRACED DICTATORS AND OUR ALLIANCES ARE WEAKENED. EVERY ALLIANCE WE HAVE HAD IS WEAKEND. ANOTHER FOUR YEARS WILL CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY THE MOMENT I ENTERED THIS RACE, WE ARE IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WE ARE.

THERE IS A PLACE FOR YOU IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOUR ENERGY. WE NEED YOUR DEDICATION HERE WE NEED YOUR SKILL. AND YES, WE NEED YOUR MONEY. THERE IS A PLACE FOR EVERYONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE ARE REACHING OUT TO ALL OWNERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE ARE LOOKING OUT FOR ALL INDEPENDENTS AND WE ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE USED TO BELONG THAT USED TO BE CALLED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEFORE IT WAS HIJACKED BY DONALD TRUMP WE WANT THESE PEOPLE AND WE NEED THESE PEOPLE. YOU ARE ALL WELCOME HERE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHEN I WAS THE INVESTOR TO IRELAND. WE WORKED IN DUBLIN ON MATTERS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE, TERRORISM, AND IMMIGRATION. BECAUSE OF THAT, I GET TO KNOW , GOT TO KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. I AM HERE TO TESTIFY TO YOU THIS MORNING IN ST. LOUIS ON THIS PITIFUL DAY ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN NAMED JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] HE AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY , WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOST HIM WITH HIS FAMILY AND WE SPENT A WEEK DOING IRISH TOURISM AND I CAN TELL YOU THE PERSON I KNEW BEFORE AND THE PERSON THAT YOU KNOW FROM TELEVISION AND FROM RALLIES LIKE THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PERSON UPFRONT AND CLOSE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PUBLIC JOE BIDEN OR PRIVATE JOE BIDEN. THERE IS JUST THE JOE BIDEN THAT YOU KNOW AND IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THAT YOU ALREADY DO KNOW. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WEARS HIS LARGE AND WARM HEART ON HIS SLEEVE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET AND WHAT YOU GET IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR GREAT COUNTRY NEEDS AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF COERCION, CORRUPTION AND CHAOS OF THE REALITY SHOW ON MAN DONALD TRUMP. LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE SCIENCE IS ACCEPTED [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU REAL HAPPY WITH THE STABLE GENIUS FOR TAKING CARE OF THE CORONAVIRUS? WHICH LEGACY A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE TRUMP IS THE RULE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE AND BELIEVE IN? FINALLY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT YOU CONNECT RESPECT? WELL, THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IT WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL GET WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. OUR CANDIDATE HAS A HISTORY OF BOTH PROGRESS AND OF GETTING THINGS DONE , THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT AND GOD BLESS HIM, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS US , MEDICATION , EDUCATION, AND EVEN MARRIED A TEACHER, AND I BELIEVE HE WOULD RETIRE BETSY DEVOS. [APPLAUSE] FAIR HOUSING AND HE CAN ALSO RETIRE BEN CARSON. HE WOULD REBUILD THE ENTIRE TOP ECHELON OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ROTATION , PROTECTION AGENCY AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. HE CAN DISASSEMBLE THE CAGES. EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION. HE CAN RETIRE ELAINE CHAO. THAT IS MITCH MCCONNELL'S WIFE. CLOSING THE WEALTH GAP, WORKERS RIGHTS, EQUALITY IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, SENDING BILL BARR BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. [APPLAUSE] SENDING BILL BARR BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND RESCUING THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM A SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT OR CONTRIBUTE ENOUGH MONEY TO THE PRESIDENT FOR IF YOU CAN GET YOURSELF ON FOX NEWS ENOUGH, HE WILL INTERFERE WITH YOUR CRIMINAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO JAIL FOR THE EYES YOU COMMITTED. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HEALTH CARE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULD EXPAND ON OBAMACARE THAT WE HAVE ALL COME TO KNOW AND LOVE. THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE AND WHAT YOU WOULD GET. A GOVERNMENT NOT GOVERNED UNDER THE RULES OF DIVISION, SUSPICION, AND EVEN HATRED. THERE IS AN IRISH PROVERB, COMPASSION IS THE BASIS OF ALL MORALITY AND JOE BIDEN IS A COMPASSIONATE AND IMMORAL MAN , AND A MORAL MAN. IF NOT BEFORE, YOU COULD FEEL THIS CRAVING IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AS VOTERS IN STATE AFTER STATE HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND COALESCED AFTER OUR GUIDE, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] EVEN DONALD TRUMP FIGURE IT OUT EARLIER , HE KNEW THAT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN WAS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND HE GOT IMPEACHED FOR TRYING TO PREVENT IT. I KNOW AND I TESTIFIED THAT WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU WILL GET AND WHAT YOU WILL GET IS A BETTER, SAFER AMERICA. WHILE SERVING AS AN AMBASSADOR, I LEARNED FIRSTHAND THAT EVERYONE ON THIS PLANET UNDERSTANDS THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. THAT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF OUR WEALTH OR BECAUSE OF OUR MILITARY MIND, IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY AND OUR ENERGY AND COMPASSION. WE ARE THE WORLD LEADERS. ALL OF CIVILIZATION LOOKS TO US TO LEAD THEM TO A BETTER LIFE BUT DONALD TRUMP IS TEARING US DOWN ONE AMERICAN CUSTOM AFTER ANOTHER, ONE RELISHED AMERICAN TRADITION AFTER ANOTHER, AND ONE AMERICAN LAW AFTER ANOTHER. [BOOING] [CHANTING] TRUMP IS TEARING DOWN OUR DEMOCRACY. AUTOCRATS ARE ATTRACTED TO HIM AND HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON IS ATTRACTED TO THEM. TRUMP HAS GIVEN INTERNATIONAL OXYGEN TO ALMOST ALL ANTIDEMOCRATIC FORCES AT WORK IN THE WORLD. IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN THAT THE UNITED STATES CANNOT SURVIVE AS AN ISLAND OF DEMOCRACY IN A SEA OF AUTOCRACY. THE TERM RESIDENCY IS LEADING US TO THAT PERILOUS POSITION RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER, THE MOMENT THAT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WIRE ALLOWED OVER THE OCEANS, THE WORLD WILL KNOW WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE THAT JOSEPH BIDEN HAS BEEN ELECTED OUR 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] THEY WILL KNOW THAT WORLD ORDER CAN AGAIN BE ESTABLISHED. OUR FRIENDS WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE NOW BACK IN BUSINESS. OUR FOES WILL KNOW THEY ARE NOT BACK IN BUSINESS. THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE TWO, WHO ARE OUR FRIENDS AND FOES OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WILL END. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AS VICE PRESIDENT WILL REBUILD ALLIANCES AND RECAPTURE WHAT HAS BEEN CEDED TO OUR ENEMIES AND AS A RESULT, THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD WILL BE A SAFER PLACE. JOE BIDEN WILL RECAPTURE, REKINDLE, AND REFURBISH THE VERY SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS OUR GREATNESS, NOT BLUSTER, NOT STUPID TWEETS, NOT THIRD-GRADE NICKNAMES, NOT LIES. CONSTANT HARMFUL, HATEFUL LIES. JOE BIDEN HAS NOT FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM AND KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING. GUIDED BY AMERICAN PRINCIPLES THAT WILL MAKE US PROUD AGAIN OF OUR PRESIDENT. SO THE ASK TODAY IS NOT THAT YOU JUST GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON TUESDAY, MARCH 10 , THE ASK IS THAT YOU BRING TO FAMILY MEMBERS , , BRING TWO FAMILY MEMBERS, THREE NEIGHBORS, FOUR FRIENDS. WE NEED MISSOURI TO CONTINUE THE CASCADE AROUND JOE BIDEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT DAYS. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET BEFORE ACCEPTING VICE PRESIDENCY, JOE BIDEN RECEIVED A PROMISE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT HE WOULD BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM WHENEVER A BIG DECISION WAS TO BE MADE. PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD LISTEN TO ALL OF THE ADVISORS AND READ ALL OF THE BRIEFING BOOKS AND WHEN EVERYONE LEFT THE ROOM AND IT WAS DECISION TIME, THEY WERE TOGETHER. THEY FORMED A TRUE PARTNERSHIP AND GOVERNING OUR COUNTRY. ON HIS FINAL DAY IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT OBAMA STATED THAT THE WISEST POLITICAL DECISION HE HAD EVER MADE IN HIS LIFE WAS IN SELECTING JOE BIDEN TO BE HIS VICE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] SO TESTED, TRUSTED, PRACTICAL, PROVEN, PLEASE GIVE A THUNDEROUS ST. LOUIS WELCOMING , [APPLAUSE] AND A THUNDEROUS ST. PATRICK'S DAY WELCOME TO MY FRIEND, MORE IMPORTANTLY TO YOUR FRIEND AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. (music) THANK YOU.

SOUTH CAROLINA HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT AREA THEN CAME SUPER TUESDAY. TODAY WE NEED THE DELEGATES IN THE NATIONAL BOAT. , NATIONAL VOTE.

[APPLAUSE] AND SOMETHING I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT, PREPARING AND REDUCING STUDENT DEBT AND WIPING OUT TO 50,000 DOLLARS IF YOU ARE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC SERVICE. AND RESTORE THE LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS EMBRACED AUTOCRATS AND DICTATORS LIKE PUTIN AND KIM JONG-UN, BUT I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE AND MET EVERY MAJOR FOREIGN LEADER IN THE LAST 40 YEARS. I PROMISE YOU, I WILL REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES AND MAKE IT CLEAR TO OUR ALLIES THAT WE CAN BE TRUSTED AGAIN. I WILL NOT TREAT NATO LIKE IT IS A PROTECTION RACKET. I WILL BUILD ON THE ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU DID, MY DAD DID. HE USED TO SAY JOBS ARE ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK.

THIS IS NOT AN ELECTION JUST FOR THE SOLE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT FOR AMERICA'S SOUL. UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING BUT HEALING THE COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. FINALLY PEOPLE ARE COMING AROUND. WE MUST BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE TRUMP. PRESIDENTS HAVE TO FIGHT, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO FORGIVE AND THEY HAVE TO JOIN PEOPLE TOGETHER. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO HEAL THE DIVISIONS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. OUR CHILDREN ARE LITERALLY WATCHING.

MY MOM WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER, MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A NEWBORN. THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNIQUE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THAT. I WAS ALSO FIGHTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING MY MOMS CHEMOTHERAPY. I HAVE COMMISERATED WITH JOE BIDEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE BRAIN TUMOR THAT KILLED MY MOTHER IS THE SAME ONE THAT TOOK BEAU BIDEN'S LIFE. I KNOW THAT HE AND BARACK OBAMA EXPANDED HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY ALMOST 700,000 MICHIGANDERS GOT HEALTHCARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF THAT IS NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH TO MANY OF US HERE IN MICHIGAN, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS. WHEN WE WERE ON THE ROPES, WHEN OUR AUTO INDUSTRY WAS STRUGGLING, WHO HAD OUR BACK? THAT'S RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN PAID THEY CAME TO THE RESCUE WHEN PEOPLE COUNTED AND WHAT PEOPLE SAID LET IT FAIL FAIL, THEY SAID NO, WE ARE IN BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS IMPORTANT. THEY HAD OUR BACKS AND TODAY I SAY LET'S HAVE JOE BIDEN'S BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN A POLITICAL DISCOURSE WHERE IT IS SO NASTY AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FRACTURE US AND DIVIDE US, BURN BRIDGES, BUILD WALLS, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT WE WON IN 2018 BY BIG NUMBERS BECAUSE WHY? WE SHOWED UP WE STAYED FOCUS ON THE DINNER TABLE ISSUES. WE SHOWED A RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE AND WE BUILT A COALITION. AS A DEMOCRAT I CAN SAY THIS, I AM PROUD OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THEIR NAMES ON THIS BALLOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE IS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IN EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHETHER IT WAS PETE BUTTIGIEG OR ELIZABETH WARREN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OR AMY KLOBUCHAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHETHER IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE I'M THINKING ABOUT. [LAUGHTER] HOLD ON, I'M GETTING THERE.

THIS IS THE PARTY OF CIVIL RIGHTS, OF VOTING RIGHTS, OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, OF WORKERS RIGHTS AND UNION AND SUPPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THE PARTY THAT BELIEVES THIS RADICAL CONCEPT , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF IT , IS CALLED SCIENCE BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. WE'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH NOW. OUR NATION WHICH EVERY GENERATION WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MORE PERFECT UNION ELECTED PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO RIP US APART. YOU LOOK AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HE DOESN'T TRY TO LIFT THEM UP, HE TRIES TO PARE THEM DOWN. IT SEEMS HE TAKES PLEASURE IN PUTTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS. WE GOT KNOCKED BACK AND KNOCKED DOWN FOUR YEARS AGO LIKE THIS HIGH SCHOOL WHO WAS VERY MASCOT IS THE PHOENIX [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR US AS A NATION TO RUN UP. WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, WE DON'T SHUT UP OR GIVE UP, WE STAND UP AND WE RISE UP.

BRIAN STEVENSON SAID WHERE PEOPLE WORK HARD. YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY UNLESS YOU LOVE YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN. I WANT TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW ARE YOU READY TO WORK FOR JOE BIDEN BUT TOMORROW IT STARTS. I GO TO THE SENATE AND FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME MOMENTUM I SOMETIMES HAVE TO CALL IN TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE I KNOW JOE IS ABOUT TO COME ONTO THE STAGE BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON THAT IS A RISING STAR IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] LIGHTNING BRINGING THE LIGHT, ONE OF OUR POWERFUL PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN WINS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND SO ONE MORE VOICE, A VOICE OF CHANGE AND HOPE AND TOMORROW. A VOICE OF TODAY I BRING TO THE STAGE A GREAT SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] (music)(music) WHAT'S UP, DETROIT! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING] WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WORK WE ARE ABOUT TO DO FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO, EVERYBODY. MICHIGAN, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS GREAT STATE, IT IS THE MEASURE OF HOW AMERICA IS DOING AND WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE KIND OF FIGHT AND WORK THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS PUT INTO INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE JOE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THEY ARE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND HELP US TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DISILLUSION US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THE SYSTEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT EVER WORK FOR US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MATTER, POWERFUL FORCES THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO YOU YOU DON'T MATTER, SO DON'T PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK A DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY TO US DO NOT TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT THEY ARE A LOAN. LET'S SEE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT POWERTHEPOWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND WE WILL NOT BE CANCELED. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT SAYING WE KNOW WHAT MATTERS AND WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY AND YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WE KNOW IF WE STOP FIGHTING WE WILL NEVER GET THERE AND SO WE FIGHT. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION HAS BEEN ABOUT FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEAS. [CHEERING] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOE WE KNOW. I'M PROUD TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE IN JOE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO REFLECTIVE OF HIS PERSONALITY IS WHEN HE SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, BUT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE IS. HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS LIVED A LIFE OF INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OTHERS. SHE HAD MADE GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICES IN HIS LIFE. HE IS EXPERIENCED IN LIFE GREAT PAIN AND GLORY. HE UNDERSTANDS WHO PEOPLE ARE. I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T GET IT. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE. THE ONLY PEOPLE HE SEES ARE THE PEOPLE HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES. HE DOESN'T SEE THE PEOPLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO FEELS, WHO UNDERSTANDS, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN HE'S WORKING TWO JOBS AND HE KNOWS HE'S MISSING HIS SON'S BALLGAME. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND KNOWING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH WITH HER SICK CHILD IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POCKET MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR HER DEDUCTIBLE. NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE POWER TO SEE AND FEEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND BEEN LEFT UP TO PEOPLE. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I GOT TO KNOW JOE BEST THROUGH HIS SON. HOW THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING ACTIVITIES, SO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND JOE BIDEN STOOD WITH ME EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF STATE OF DELAWARE HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS HARD AS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. I GOT TO KNOW JOE THROUGHBO. IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS SON. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD. AND HE SHOWED COURAGE ALL THE TIME AND CONVICTION. HE SPOKE WITH SO MUCH LOVE ABOUT THE FATHER RAISED HIM INTO THE MAN HE WAS. I KNOW JOE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND MY FINAL POINT IS MICHIGAN, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. RACIAL JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. AND JOE BIDEN IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WITH THAT I INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] HELLO, DETROIT. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

SENATOR SANDERS LIKES TO SAY WE ARE ONLY GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP BY GENERATING EXCITEMENT AND TURNOUT. ON SUPER TUESDAY WE TURNOUT MORE VOTERS. THEY VOTE FOR US NORTH CAROLINA 19%, TEXAS, 40% MORE VOTERS. I CAN GO ON. BUT FOLKS, HE'S RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT IS THIS MOVEMENT WE STARTED IS GENERATING IN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT AROUND THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, WE CAN'T CREATE A MOVEMENT WITHOUT THE BASIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [INAUDIBLE] I DIDN'T , ARE YOU WITH DONALD TRUMP? CHANTING] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM GO. IT'S NOT A TRUMP RALLY. LET HIM GO. FOLKS, LET HIM GO, THAT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. LET HIM GO. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP RALLY. FOLKS , [CHANTING] [CHANTING] /THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN POLITICIANS. LET THEM GO. [CHANTING] I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. IT'S A REFLECTION OF WHAT IS WRONG IN AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. [CHANTING] THERE IS ONE OTHER THING DONALD TRUMP TELLS GENERATED. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY OR AS A PEOPLE. WE HAD A LOT OF CRAZY FOLKS AROUND. I'M SORRY, FOLKS. EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU TO BE PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN SO JOIN US. JOIN JOE BIDEN.COM AND SIGN UP.

[APPLAUSE] A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT, PROUD DEMOCRAT, OBAMA BIDEN DEMOCRAT, JOIN US TO BRING IT TOGETHER AND NOT TEAR IT APART. WE ARE BUILDING ON A COALITION OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THINGS IN OUR LIFETIME. BARACK OBAMA. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BY BRINGING IT BACK TOGETHER, BRINGING AMERICA BACK TOGETHER IN EVERY ETHNICITY, RACE, GENDER, ECONOMIC STATION. FOLKS, LOOK WE ARE GOING TO UNITE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS BUT THAT IS WHAT THE NATION NEEDS IS TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A STATE WE HAVE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT HERE. HE IS A HELL OF A GUY AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU WE WORK SIDE-BY-SIDE TO SUPPORT THE CITY. THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN DETROIT LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MICHIGAN. DURINGDURING BEAT OBAMA BY AN ADMINISTRATION, WE LOST THE RESTORATION PROJECT AND INVESTED $2.5 BILLION TO HELP MITIGATE POLLUTION. PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES, HABITATS, THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF THE GREAT LAKES IN DECADES AND IT'S DELIVERED AN INCREDIBLE RESULT. REVITALIZATION FOR THE WATERFRONT ALL ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE DRAWING DRAWING INTO NEW BUSINESSES ANDIN THE NEWBUSINESSES AND THE TOURISM ACTIVITY LIKE FISHING AND BOATING ON THE LAKE. FOLKS, YOU ARE THE GREATEST SOURCE OF FRESH WATER AND ALL OF THE WORLD. I'M ACTUALLY DELIVERING FOR MICHIGAN. SO MANY MICHIGANDERS HAVE JOINED US IN THIS DYNAMIC POLITICIAN BUT FIGHT HAS ONLY EXCEEDED BY CHARACTER. THERE ARE SOME AMAZING WOMEN THAT ONE IN 2018 AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE REELECTED. I THINK WE'VE BEEN DELIVERED TO A MOVEMENT WHERE YOU CAN NOT ONLY DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. IF WE THINK BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH TO BUILD A FUTURE IN THIS NATION, MAKING HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, LOWERING DRUG PRICES AND ENSURING AND PROTECTING HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LIVE ON JUST MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. WE SHOULD BE BUILDING ON OBAMACARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. LEADING THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF OUR TIME AND THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE CLIMATE ACCORD AND I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS RE- JOIN THAT ACCORD AND SOME OF THE POLLUTERS IN THE UNITED STATES SAY IT'S TIME TO UP THE ANTE. WE ARE 15% OF THE WORLDS PROBLEMS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IF THEY DON'T, IT WON'T MATTER SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO DEMAND THE WHOLE WORLD COME WITH US TO ENSURE THE QUALITY SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON YOUR ZIP CODE. BY TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CALLED FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED. THERE IS 150,000 TEACHERS TODAY. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND COMPATIBLE WE WILL BE DOWN 2.5 MILLION EXCUSE ME, 300,000 BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2025. BAKING SURE IF WE DO THIS WE CAN SEND EVERY THREE, FOUR, 5-YEAR-OLD TO SCHOOL. REDUCING STUDENT AT BECAUSE IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN. ALL OF THOSE THAT ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE INCLUDING TEACHING THAT UP TO 50,000-DOLLAR REDUCTION AND TEACHING IN THEIR STUDENT DEBT. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHO WE HAVE TO BE. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD HAS TO CHANGE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS EMBRACED EVERY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT A JOKE. FROM PUTIN, WE'VE GOT TO REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES. I MEANT EVERY ONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO MAKE SURE MY JOB IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE SOLITARY ONE THAT WOULD TRADE PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES IF THEY COULD GUESS WHAT IT'S WE WILL HONOR THE COMMITMENT IF YOU PAY ME MORE MONEY. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ASIA WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AS WELL. THEY NEED US. [CHEERING] WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF SO MANY OF OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO ALSO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK BECAUSE LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA, YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND PLACE IN COMMUNITY AND THE OWN SELF-WORTH BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T THINK THEY CAN SAVE TO THEIR KIDS TODAY. GETTING CRUSHED. THE WORKING POOR ARE GETTING MORE POOR ON THE WAY UP. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL ABOUT DECENCY AND DIGNITY AND GIVING PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT. [CHEERING] I THOUGHT WHEN THEY CAME OUT CARRYING TORCHES CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE WHAT IT WAS LIKE A COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN I WROTE AN ARTICLE SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA AND WE REALLY ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IN ITS MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IT MEANS HAVING TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT DEFINE FOR ME BASED ON ETHNICITY AND GENDER, BASED ON RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. YOU CAN'T DO IT. WE ARE UNIQUE TO MOST UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON AN IDEA AND THEY ARE. IT DIVIDES US THE WAY THAT HE IS USING US TO SOW DIVISION OF ANGER. PRESIDENTS NOT ONLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT, THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO HEAL. [CHEERING] AND FOLKS, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS THAT ARE AIDING AND ABETTING BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE ARE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR WITH THE PARTY AND ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT IN FACT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE IS BY CRUSHING THE OTHER TEAM. FOLKS, WE CAN'T GET STUFF DONE IF WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO HEAL AND WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION OR ELSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO BE IN A JEOPARDY BEYOND WHAT IT IS NOW. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING AND OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY. LOOK AT THE WAY HE TALKS AND TREATS PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMONIZES PEOPLE AND RIDICULES PEOPLE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS. HE HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY AND ON OUR CHILDREN. THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" REPORTED WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE REPORTS IN SCHOOL OF KIDS MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR. SINGLING OUT EMIGRANTS FOR RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THIS MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TEACHERS TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IT ANY SURPRISE KIDS WOULD SAY THIS IS THE REPORT OF A STUDY DONE BY THE ""WASHINGTON POST,"" WHILE THE PRESIDENT. NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, WHETHER FOR GOOD OR BAD AND THE WORDS HE UTTERS HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT AND LOOK, FOLKS I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DONALD TRUMP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS READ ABOUT IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. [CHEERING] THE WORLD IS WATCHING LOOKING AT US INTO SAYING WHAT AND SAYING WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA. EMBRACE OUR ENEMIES, WALK AWAY FROM OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT SO THEY KNOW ONCE AGAIN THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED. THAT'S FOR OUR SECURITY ECONOMIC AS WELL AS SECURITY. FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE WATCHING AND IN THE YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS MOMENT AND SAY WHEN IT MATTERED MOST, WHAT DID THEY DO? DID IT SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY OR WERE THEY PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH FEAR IN THIS COUNTRY, SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IN FACT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS CALLED INTO QUESTION, WE NEED HONEST TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROVIDE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD TO BE SELF-EVIDENT AND FIGHT FOR THE NOTION THAT AMERICA HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD TO THIS NEW GENERATION. I VIEW MYSELF AS A BRIDGE, NOT AS ANYONE ELSE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE CANDIDACY IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAID I THAT I WANTED TO DO IT IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE DECLARATION AND THE CONSTITUTION WERE FIRST UNVEILED UNVEILED. ALTHOUGH WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SAVE EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENT AND MOVE THE ARK OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER. WE CAN'T LET IT SHUT DOWN. THE DAYS OF THE DIVISIVENESS ARE SOON GOING TO BE OVER. AND WHEN HE IS GONE WE WILL COME BACK WE ARE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK FROM ST. PATRICK'S DAY SO IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT I QUOTE HISTORY TEACHES US BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME IT RISES UP AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OPEN HISTORY RISE. WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE FAIL TO FAILED TO DO WHEN WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE AMERICANS CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND TRUTH OVER LIES. SO LET'S TAKE THIS BACK NOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. TAKE IT BACK. IT'S TIME. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] IT COMES OUT TO BE A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH WE HAVE ONE CANDIDATE STANDING UP TO THE WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT ELECTION. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. A LOOK AT EFFORTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND PROPAGANDA, PARTICULARLY FROM CHINA AND RUSSIA.

HE SPOKE AND A EVENT WITH VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS AT COLUMBUS OHIO. THIS RUNS 35 MINUTES. [BACKGROUND SOUNDS]. [APPLAUSE]. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE, IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. TO SUPPORT JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE]. ON BEHALF OF BRADY, I AM THRILLED TO SHARE IN OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS CAMPAIGN AND TO ENSURING THAT JOE BIDEN DEFEATS DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. BRADY IS ONE SINGULAR MISSION AND THAT IS TO END GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN, SHARES THAT GOAL AND A BINDING ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY ON DAY ONE. THERE IS NO CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE AS COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE AS JOE BIDEN. THAT IS BECAUSE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN KNOWS, THAT THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN OUR COUNTRY IS A TRUE BUT PREVENTABLE CRISIS. HE KNOWS THAT WHEN WE SAY, 100 PEOPLE A DAY, DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY, IT IS 100 FATHERS, MOTHERS, SISTERS, AND BROTHERS. THAT IS 100 PEOPLE TOO MANY. IT'S HUNDREDS OF LIVES, RIPPED APART IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. COMMUNITIES LIKE RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. JUSTICE EATS FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW, DIAZ WAS SHOT AND KILLED LAST AUGUST WHILE DRIVING BY THIS VERY COMMUNITY CENTER . VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TESTING IS A CLOSE. AS A SENATOR AND AS A VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN HAS MOURNED WITH ALL AMERICANS AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND TRAGEDY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HIS BLOOD, TO ENSURE THAT THOSE MOMENTS ARE NEVER REPEATED. HISTORY STRETCHES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 1990s AND THEN SENATOR BIDEN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING OUR NATION BACKGROUND CHECKS SYSTEM THE BRADY BILL. WHICH IS NOW STOPPED MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION SALES OF FIREARMS. JOE BIDEN, HIS LEADERSHIP ALSO HELP TO PASS THE FEDERAL BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS. STOPPING THE SALE AND MANUFACTURE OF WEAPONS OF WAR IN THIS COUNTRY. IN 2005, HE VOTED AGAINST THE PROTECTION OF LAWFUL AND COMMERCE, WHICH GIVES THE GUN INDUSTRY UNPRECEDENTED PROTECTIONS UNDER LAW. HE WAS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, THE LOCKET IS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ESCAPE FROM AND FIND SUPPORT AFTER SITUATIONS AS INTIMATE PARTNER AND FAMILY VIOLENCE. AS A SENATOR, JOE BIDEN KNEW THE VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T TOTALLY OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. IN THE AFTERMATH, THE MASS SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK, IN NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT, AND THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND FACING A CONGRESS THAT REFUSED TO ACT TO STOP MORE MASS KILLINGS, PRESIDENT OBAMA, NEEDED A CHAMPION TO LEAD THE ADMINISTRATION GUN VIOLENCE TASK FORCE. HE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. HE NEEDED SOMEONE WHO HAD FOUGHT THE NRA, AND ONE. THAT SOMEONE WAS JOE BIDEN. THAT SOMEONE IS JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE IS STILL FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN THIS CAMPAIGN, JOE BIDEN HAS VISITED AND SPOKEN WITH COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE AND WITH SURVIVORS. HE HAS MET WITH THEM . HE HAS MOURNED WITH THEM, HE KNOWS US. A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL FIGHT FOR A NEW ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. HE WILL EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN THE BABY BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS AND HE WILL REPEAL AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN HOLD THE GUN MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROFITING OFF OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN WILL TAKE THE FIGHTS TO THE GUN INDUSTRY THROUGH THE NRA AND HE KNOWS HOW TO WIN. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BY THIS CAMPAIGN, WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, OR LEFT BEHIND. IT IS WHY HE IS IN THIS FIGHT AND HIS WIFE WE ARE IN IT WITH HIM. I WANT MY DAUGHTERS KATIE AND SOPHIA, TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY ARE FREE FROM THE FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE IN CONSTANT FEAR IN THEIR SCHOOLS, IN THEIR HOMES, AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE OWE ALL OF THEM A BETTER FUTURE. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WITH A RECORD, WITH THE COMMENCEMENT, WITH THE PLAN, AND WITH THE HEART. TO CREATE THAT FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS. THAT SOMEONE IS JOE BIDEN. HE KNOWS US, HE KNOWS WHAT WE NEED TO END THIS EPIDEMIC. WE KNOW HIM. AND WE KNOW THAT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THIS FIGHT THAT CAN GET IT DONE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MY NAME IS SHANNON AND I AM THE FOUNDER OF MOMS COMMAND ACTION. THE GRASSROOT GUN SAFETY AND YESTERDAY OUR ORGANIZATION WAS SO THRILLED AND HONORED TO ENDORSE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. THE CHOICE WAS CLEAR. WHILE EVERY CANDIDATE LEFT IN THE RACE SAYS THEY WILL TAKE ACTION ON GUN SAFETY AS PRESIDENT, ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS A TRACK RECORD TO PROVE THAT HE WILL ACTUALLY PRIORITIZE GUN SAFETY ACT ON AND WHEN. AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TAKING ON THE NRA AND WINNING. IN FACT, MANY PEOPLE REFER TO ME AS THE NRA WORST NIGHTMARE. I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT TRUE, IT IS JOE BIDEN. HE HAS HELPED PASS THE BILL IN 1994 THAT ESTABLISHED THE MODERN DAY BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM. IN HIS STEP NOW OVER $3M PROHIBITED PURCHASES FROM GETTING GUNS. HE WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. THE BILL THAT WAS NOT A PHRASE THIS YEAR BECAUSE REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO SUPPORT A PROVISION IN IT. IT WAS DISARMED CONVICTED STOCKERS AND DATING PARTNERS. AND GUESS WHO ALSO OPPOSES THAT POSITION. THE NRA. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ALSO OPPOSES GRANTING IMMUNITY TO THE GUN INDUSTRY A LAW THAT SINCE 2005, HAS PROTECTED GUN MANUFACTURERS FROM BEING HELD LIABLE FOR CRIMES COMMITTED WITH THE PRODUCTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE PRESIDENT BIDEN, REPEALING THAT LAW. AND IN 2012, AFTER THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING AND SENDING A, IT WAS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED TO LEAD HIS GUN SAFETY TASK FORCE. SOMETHING HE HAS REMAINED COMMITTED TO FOR YEARS. DESPITE BATTLING A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, BEHOLDEN TO THE NRA. AND THAT IS WHEN I FIRST MET JOE BIDEN IN 2013, ALONG WITH SO MANY MOMS AND ACTION VOLUNTEERS AND WE KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE OUR CHAMPION. HIS COMMITMENT TO REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE ISN'T WITHOUT PARALLEL, WHICH IS WHY HE'S PRIORITIZE GOOD SAFETY IN HIS CAMPAIGN, AND IS PLEDGED ACTION, AND THE FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE. HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT OF CITY GOING VIOLENCE AND HIS PLAN IS PRESIDENT, WOULD IMPROVE OR INCLUDE A 900-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN LOCAL PILOT INTERVENTIONS AND INTERRUPTION PROGRAMS. WE KNOW JOE BIDEN. WE KNOW THERE IS NO STOPPING THE VICE PRESIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING OUR FAMILIES SAFE. AND THERE IS NO STOPPING OUR MILLIONS OF VOLUNTEERS SUPPORTERS AND GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS, FROM GETTING HIM INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THE MOTHERS AND WOMEN ARE ORGANIZING IN AMERICA. IN MY WORKING TOGETHER, BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER, WE WILL STOP THE GUN LOBBY DANGEROUS AND PAST FIVE SENDING FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE WAITED FOR DECADES. THE MOMENT IS FINALLY HERE AND MOMS DEMAND ACTION GRASSROOTS ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS WILL FIGHT LIKE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]. MY NAME IS CRYSTAL. I AM HERE TODAY TO HONOR MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER. THEY WERE BOTH SHOT AND KILLED ON APRIL 1st, 2015, BY THE HUSBAND, BECAUSE OF THE PENDING DIVORCE. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT CAN NEVER PREPARE YOU FOR GETTING THE CALL TO LEARN THAT YOUR WORLD HAS JUST BEEN SHATTERED. NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE. MY CHILDREN WERE SMART AND KIND AND HARD-WORKING. THEY WERE COMMITTED TO THEIR COMMUNITY. MY DAUGHTER HAD OPENED A CHILDCARE BUSINESS WHICH WHICH WE RAN HIS FAMILY TOGETHER. AND SHE HAD ALSO BEEN NAMED THE 2015 COLUMBUS SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF THE YEAR AWARD . JUST SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE HER MURDER. I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD TO BE THE MOTHER. HOWEVER ALL OF THAT WAS STOLEN FROM ME IN AN INSTANT. I AM NOW RAISING HER TWO CHILDREN AND MY GRANDSON IS HERE WITH ME TODAY. AND I TRY HARD TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE SO THEY UNDERSTAND JUST HOW SPECIAL THEIR MOTHER AND PINNACLES WORK. SEE TODAY WE STAND HERE SEVERAL WEEKS FROM WHAT WOULD BE HIS MOTHER'S 33rd BIRTHDAY. AND SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT, WILL ALSO CELEBRATE THE FIFTH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS UNCLES PASSING. AS BROKENHEARTED AS I AM, I TRY TO CELEBRATE MY CHILDREN'S LIVES SO THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN KNOW THE MOTHER AND UNCLE WERE SPECIAL. AND THEY WERE LOVED. NO ONE, NO ONE, DESERVES THE PAIN IN MY FAMILY I HAVE LIVED EVERYDAY. I NOW LIVE A LIFE CLEAR BIOLOGICALLY, I AM MY GRANDCHILDREN'S GRANDMOTHER, LEGALLY THE LAW DEFINES ME AS THEIR GUARDIAN. AND EMOTIONALLY, I AM MOTHER, AND MOMMY TO ONE AND YAYA AND MOMMY TO ANOTHER. THAT SHOULD NOT BE MY STORY. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ELECTING JOE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT, GIVES US ONE STEP CLOSER TO ENDING THIS GUN VIOLENCE. I HAVE THE HONOR OF MEETING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW DEEPLY HE EMPHASIZES THE GUN SURVIVORS. JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THE LEGAL CONNECTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS. IN HIS WORK TIRELESSLY TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MY DAUGHTER. AND KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DOMESTIC ABUSERS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS HOW TO KEEP THE NRA HAS PLANNED TO DO IT AGAIN. MOMS DEMANDING ACTION, VOLUNTEERS AND GUN SURVIVORS, SOME OF WHOM ARE STANDING BEHIND ME TODAY. OUR ALL IN FOR JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ABLE, HE IS BEEN ALL IN DECADES. I AM GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND READY AND DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE HIM OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT, I BRING YOU OUR NEXT PRESIDENT FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE]. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I HAVE A SENSE EXCUSE ME. BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE A TRAGIC LOSS, MATTER HOW LONG AGO IT WAS, WASN'T VERY LONG AGO IN THE CASE WHEN YOU BRING ENOUGH EVERYTHING COMES BACK. HE READ OF IT. YOU RELIVE THAT MOMENT. I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE AND I WISH I HAD THE COURAGE YOU HAD YEARS AGO WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. NOBODY GUN BUT IT TRAGIC INCIDENT. FOLKS WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR THE PAST FOUR INTO TOWN AS WELL AS FOR HIS SUPPORT. HE IS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP, ALONG WITH MANY OF THE MAYORS, TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. JOE BIDEN. WE HAVE TO MOVE. WE ARE HERE TODAY, BECAUSE THIS COMMUNITY DRIVING PART, IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS SUFFERED GREATLY TO THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. ON AVERAGE, 526 OHIO ANTS, ARE KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. JUST AS HOMICIDES. GUNS ARE THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS. NATIONALLY WE LOSE 100 PEOPLE TO GUN VIOLENCE EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND IT'S INTOLERABLE. AND WE SEEM TO ACCEPT IT AS NORMAL. WE SEEM TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THAT. FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE, NORMAL IS A LIVING NIGHTMARE. FOR FAMILIES IN DAYTON, WHO LEARNED LAST YEAR WHEN MEANS TO HAVE A MASS SHOOTING RIP THROUGH THE COMMUNITY, NORMAL IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR FAMILIES RIGHT HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY, AS LOSSES DON'T MAKE HEADLINES AND NATIONAL NEWS EVERYDAY, BUT THE GRIEF IS JUST AS DEEP. NORMAL IS AN INSULT. THE DIGNITY AND PRIDE OF THE COMMUNITIES, IT DID DISHONOR THE VALUES OF THE LIVES, AND CHRIS AND SHARON AND CRYSTAL, THANK YOU FOR NOT JUST WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ENDORSING ME BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY IMPORTANTLY FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES. I AM SO DEEPLY HONORED TO BE JOINED BY YOU AT THIS MOMENT. THESE WOMEN ARE DRIVING GRASSROOTS ACTIONS MOBILIZING OUR COMMUNITIES THE WEIGHT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE. I'M OFTEN ASKED, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I CAN GET THESE THINGS DONE NOW. AND IT WILL BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE STANDING BEHIND ME. BECAUSE OF THE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT OCCURRED AND IS OCCURRING NOW. FOLKS, THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE. AS I SAID, THESE WOMEN ARE DRIVING THE GRASSROOTS ACTIONS, MOBILIZING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND GALVANIZING NATION TO ACTION. I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES, I GET ASKED WITH A OF PEOPLE, HAVE TRIED ABOUT GUN SAFETY REFORMS AND THEY HAVE FAILED. WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME. THE ANSWER IS STANDING AGAIN BEHIND ME. IT IS NOT JUST WOMEN DEMANDING ACTION, SOUGHT JUST BRADY, IS NOT JUST THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEHIND ME. IT IS ALSO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. I WAS THERE, I WASN'T VICE PRESIDENT. I WAS UP AT WASHINGTON WHEN ALL OF THIS COULD COME UP WITH THEIR PARENTS FROM DOWN IN FLORIDA. WITHOUT HORRIFIC INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. I LOOK TO THE FACES OF THESE KIDS. IN THEIR DETERMINATION. IN THE FEAR THAT THE CONGRESSMAN OF HAVING TO MEET WITH THEM. AND LOOK THEM IN THE EYE. THESE KIDS EMERGING FOR THEIR LIVES. STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. RIGHT THROUGH ENOUGH TO THE DOORS OF CONGRESS. DEMANDING CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU, IT MATTERS. ANSWER IS THE REASON WHY WE WILL WIN, IS BECAUSE ALL OF YOU BEHIND ME. THIS MOVEMENT ISN'T BEING LED TO WASHINGTON, IT IS GOING UP FROM THE GROUND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. JUST LIKE THIS ONE. ALL ACROSS AMERICA, IT CAN'T BE BOUGHT OR INFLUENCED BY GUN MANUFACTURERS, IT CAN'T BE SWAYED BY THE NRA, THAT'S WHY THE CITY CURIOUS PEOPLE IN AMERICA, FOR THE NRA. THEY ARE FOLKS LIKE SHARON AND CHRIS. SCORES OF VOLUNTEERS LIKE CRYSTAL. WHO HAD THEIR LIVES DEVASTATED BY GUN VIOLENCE. RETURNING THE PAIN TO PURPOSE. WE TALKED A WHILE AGO CRYSTAL, AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW U.S. ME, HOW I WAS HANDLING IT MY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I SAID YOU GOT TO FIND PURPOSE. BOTH OF YOUR CHILDREN, ARE LOOKING DOWN NOW. I BELIEVE IT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE PURPOSE. IN YOUR HELPING OTHERS. HELPING CHILDREN. OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO LOSE A CHILD. I KNOW THE GRIEF IS OVERWHELMING. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING SUCKED INTO A BLACK HOLE IN HER CHEST BUT NO WAY OUT PRETTY JUST FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING CONSUMED. FINDING PURPOSE, MOST PEOPLE I SPEAK TO FIND, IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE AGAIN. FINDING WORK TO GET YOU UP EVERY MORNING, MOTIVATE YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT MATTERS. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON IS GOING TO HAVE YOUR BACK AND, I MEAN. IT OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER WILL NOT ABIDE STANDING BY AND NOT DOING ANYTHING. WHILE THOUSANDS OF LIVES ARE CUT SHORT BY GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL ACT. I HAVE BEATEN NRA BEFORE, TWICE. MEANINGFUL GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. AND I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD. ... ... ... IF I COULD HOLD FOR JUST A SECOND TIER, I AM NOT OPPOSED TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS AN ABSOLUTE IF ONE OF YOU INHERENT YELLS FIRE, AND SOMEONE GETS HURT, THEY CAN BE SUED, IT IS NOT FREE SPEECH YOU ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER. PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER. IN THE VERY BEGINNING THE SECOND AMENDMENT DID NOT SAY ANYBODY CAN OWN ANY KIND OF WEAPON. THE IDEA OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND FOLKS I ENCOUNTER SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS. THEY NEED HELLFIRE BY THE GOVERNMENT. AR-15 IS NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT IS NOT GOING TO PROTECT THEM. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT STRAIGHTER, A SHOTGUN WILL HELP YOU A LOT BETTER. MY POINT IS, EVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE NRA, THE MAJORITY NO AR-15 AND CLIPS WITH 30, 40 COUNT OF 50, 100 ROUNDS AND IT MAKE NO SENSE. YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE NRA OUT THERE YOU'RE CHANGING IDEAS OF THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NRA. SIGNIFICANT RATIONAL PEOPLE. AND I COMPLEMENT YOU FOR. AS PRESIDENT, I AM NOT GOING TO JUST GET US TO UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CLOSE THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE SO YOU CANNOT HAVE THE TIME RUN OUT TO ALLOW YOU TO GET A GUN. YOU ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT MOST EVIL DON'T KNOW. THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM THERE SOMETHING CALLED THAT NICK'S SYSTEM. SUPPOSEDLY, NOT SUPPOSEDLY BUT EACH OF THE STATES ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM OWNING A GUN, SEND THEIR NAME AND MATERIAL TO THIS NATIONAL REGISTRY. AND THEN, WHEN YOU GO TO PURCHASE A WEAPON, AT THAT GUN SHOP THEY'D CHECK IN AND GO TO THE NIXON SAKE CAN THIS PERSON OWN A WEAPON OR NOT? THE PROBLEM IS NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE UPDATED THEIR RECORDS. AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CANNOT WAIT A MATTER OF MINUTES OR A DAY, TO BE ABLE TO OWN THAT GUN, IS BIZARRE. THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE IS THE LOOPHOLE THAT SAID YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT WITHIN 24 HOURS, IF IT DOESN'T COME BACK ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY PURCHASE THE GUN. WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THAT BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE. WHEN THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST ACT THAT SET ABUSERS HUSBANDS OR SOMEONE YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH IS AN ABUSER, THEY CANNOT OWN A FIREARM IF THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF ABUSING YOU THERE'S THIS THING CALLED THE BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE. THEY WERE TRYING TO GET PAST. IF YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, WHO YOU HAVE NOT HAD A CHILD BY, AND HE BEAT YOU ALL THE TIME, HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A STAY AWAY ORDER, HE CAN STILL OWN A WEAPON. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN ARE KILLED, ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. BY THEIR PERPETRATOR. WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ABUSERS. HOW IN GODS NAME AND THE PRESIDENT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT? WE ARE GOING TO GET WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREETS. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOW COMMON IS NOT BEEN GIVEN LIMITS. NO ONE NEEDS AN AR-15 OR 100 ROUNDS IN A MAGAZINE TO GO HUNTING OR FOR SELF-DEFENSE IT IS DESIGNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO KILL, KILL QUICKLY AND BRUTALLY. THINK BACK TO LAST AUGUST THINK BACK TO A NATION REELING FROM THE HORRORS OF A LATINO COMMUNITY BEING SPECIFICALLY TARGETED BY GUNMEN IN EL PASO. IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS, BEING HIT AGAIN. POLICE WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 20 SECONDS. LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT NOW, IT WITHIN 20 SECONDS THEY DID THEIR JOB. IT TOOK ONLY TEN MORE SECONDS FOR THEM TO TAKE DOWN THE SHOOTER. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE USING AR-15 STYLE WEAPON, FITTED WITH 100 ROUND MAGAZINE OPENING FIRE. IN JUST 30 SECONDS, HE WAS STILL ABLE TO KILL NINE PEOPLE AND INJURED 27. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. ASSAULT WEAPONS AND HIGH-CAPACITY WEAPONS IS NO PERSON THAN OTHER TO KILL QUICKLY AND AS BRUTALLY AS POSSIBLE. NO ONE NEEDS THEM. WORKING WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN WE GOT THAT VANDEN HIGH-CAPACITY MAN FOR TEN YEARS. THEN WE HAD THAT THING WITH HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA. WE LOST AN ELECTION. AND PRESIDENT BUSH LET IT EXPIRE, IT HAD TO RENEW. THE ONLY WAY TO GET PAST THE FIRST TIME AROUND. IT PASSED AT THE TIME DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE NRA. MY POINT IS WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN. ANYTHING LESS IS AN INSULT TO THE FAMILIES ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE BEEN TERRORIZED BY GUN VIOLENCE. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY I'M GOING TO SEND A BILL TO CONGRESS REVOKING ONE OF THE BIGGEST GIVEAWAYS IN HIS REPORT WE ARE GOING TO END THE CIVIL LIABILITY THAT'S GIVEN TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. AND BY THE WAY, THINK ABOUT THAT FOR SECOND PERIOD IF I STOOD UP AND SAID BY THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CIVIL LIABILITIES FOR DRUG DRUG COMPANIES TO PUT 9 BILLION PILLS OUT ON THE MARKET YOU TO JOE THAT MAKE SENSE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD A SUIT TOBACCO COMPANY'S FOR LYING TO US ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THEIR PRODUCT. WHAT ARE WE DOING? RIGHT NOW, GRIEVING FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE THE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURED THESE GUNS, FALSE ADVERTISING THAT CAUSES SO MUCH CARNAGE. WE DON'T GIVE THAT PROTECTION TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES INTO THE DRUG COMPANIES BUT TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. OVER 150,000 PEOPLE A BEEN MURDERED IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT COUNTING SUICIDES SINCE 2005. SINCE WE PASSED THAT EXEMPTION. 6405 OF THEM RIGHT HERE IN OHIO. NOT ONE OF THEIR FAMILIES CONSUME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU USE THE TERM, BUT IT IS IMMORAL. WE HAVE TO END IT. FOLKS, WE CAN'T STAND BY WHILE THIS CRISIS CONTINUES TO WORSEN. WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP AND SAY THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE. THERE'S PLENTY TO BE DONE. AND NOW, MR. MAYER, AND THE CITY ATTORNEY ZACH KLEIN, THEY ARE FIGHTING LIKE HELL TO PASS SOME SENSIBLE GUN REFORM POLICY RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. INCLUDING PASSING A CITY ORDINANCE THAT BANDS OF BUMP STOCKS. HERE IN OHIO, WE ARE GOING TO MAKING CHANGE, WE NEED THAT AT STATE LEVEL. THE TRAGEDY IN DAYTON, AFTER THE GOVERNOR AND DONALD TRUMP MADE OVERTURES ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS AND RED FLAG LAWS. LIKE MY SON GOT PASSED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE BEFORE HE DIED. THAT'S WITH THE MAYOR WANTS. THAT'S WHAT ADVOCATES THE FRONTLINE WENT. WHAT THEN HAPPENED? NRA MOVED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT DO A DARN THING THAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO RELATIVE TO GUN SAFETY. ALL THE SUDDEN, GUNS ARE NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM ANYMORE. FOLKS, IT MATTERS WHO ELECT, IT MATTERS WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO LET'S START GETTING RID OF DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT WITH THE INITIATIVES OF THE NRA AND THE OVAL OFFICE ARE CONTINUING TO DICTATE. REPLACING THEM WITH SOMEONE WHO WILL GO AFTER THE NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURERS. THEY HAVE A FULL OFFICE AND IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE INTERJECTION HERE. FOLKS, I MET WITH SOME OF THE LEADING TECH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN PURCHASE , YOU CAN MAKE A WEAPON A GUN WHERE ONLY YOUR BIOMETRICS CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. IF ANY OF YOU TODAY, LEFT YOUR KEY IN THE AUTOMOBILE OUT OF THE PARKING LOT, AND A 14-YEAR-OLD KID GETS IN THE CAR, STARTS IT UP AND GETS IN AN ACCIDENT, YOU ARE LIABLE. CIVILLY LIABLE. HOW DOES THAT VIOLATE ANYONE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IF YOU PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU CAN PURCHASE A GUN, BUT ONLY YOU CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. WILL GUESS WHAT? MONTHS AGO, I CAME UP WITH CERTAIN PISTOLS I COULD DO THAT. THE STORES ARE BEGINNING TO SELL THEM, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GOT NOTICE FROM THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THEM WE ARE GOING TO OUT YOU. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOU. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SELL TO YOU. GUESS WHAT, THEY TOOK THEM OFF THE MARKET. THIS IS ABOUT GUN SALES, SALES , MONEY, PROFIT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. SO AS PRESIDENT, NOT ONLY IN MY GOING TO WORK ON THIS I'M GOING TO TRY TO RALLY THE TECH SECTOR TO MAKE SURE THEY RISE UP AND DO SOMETHING THAT CAN INFECT AFFECT AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS. BY THE WAY, SANDY HOOK WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE MOM LEFT ALL THOSE GUNS OUT. THE KID WHO COULD NOT PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK, GOT THE GUNS WENT TO SCHOOL KILLED ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HOLD THE HOUSE, THAT IS WE THE DEMOCRATS HOLD THE HOUSE AND FLIP THE SENATE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ELECT DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT IN THAT SILLY PLACE WORKING TO FIND THE COURAGE TO GET THINGS DONE. NOT THAT EVERY DEMOCRAT IS VOTED THE RIGHT WAY. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE NRA, SUPPORT A MAJORITY OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT MAKE SENSE. FIGHT FOR OUR KIDS. FIGHT FOR A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE TERRIFIED OF GOING TO SCHOOL. AGAIN, THE PRESS THAT FOLLOWS ME KNOWS I HAVE QUOTED FROM NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. KIDS ARE MOST FRIGHTENED, WHAT IS IT ON THE SCALE ONE TO FIVE WITH THEIR MOST FRIGHTENED ABOUT? GETTING SHOT IN SCHOOL. IT'S A MORAL DISGRACE. FIGHT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE. FIGHT FOR COMMITTEES LIKE THIS WHEN TO MAKE THEM SECURE. LOOK, I HAVE LOOKED IT TO ME DEVASTATED FAMILY MEMBERS, TOO MANY BRAVES SCHOOL SHOOTING SURVIVORS IN THE EYE AND I HAVE MADE THEM ALL A SIMPLE PROMISE AND I'VE MADE THIS PROMISE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER, I WILL NEVER GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. UNTIL WE STOP AT THE CARNAGE THAT IS OCCURRING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. IF YOU STAND WITH ME, WE WILL PASS LAWS TO BAN KILLER ASSAULT WEAPONS. HOLD GUN MAKERS LIABLE. WE CAN DO THIS. AND THE REASON WE CAN IS BECAUSE OF THE MOMS STANDING BEHIND ME. THANK YOU.

AS THE RESULTS WERE COMING IN, THE VICE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO CAMPAIGN STAFF AFTER CANCELING THE CAMPAIGN , A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN CLEVELAND. BERNIE SANDERS ALSO CANCELED A RALLY IN OHIO FOR THE SAME REASON, BUT DECLINED TO MAKE PUBLIC REMARKS ON PRIMARY NIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE WERE NOT PLANNING A RALLY, BUT OUR HEADQUARTERS IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, AND THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO GET THANK YOU TO MY SISTER VALERIE, MY SON-IN-LAW, AND FOLKS, LOOK. WE WERE PLANNING A BIG RALLY IN CLEVELAND TONIGHT, BUT THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO ASKED THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS TO CANCEL THEIR INDOOR PUBLIC EVENTS IN CLEVELAND, WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHAT WE DID, DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AS I SAID ALL ALONG, THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE CDC, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CAMPAIGN EVENTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. , THIS WHOLE CORONAVIRUS IS A MATTER OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. LATER THIS WEEK, I WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU ON WHAT I BELIEVE THE NATION SHOULD BE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS VIRUS. TONIGHT I WENT TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA, WHERE WE ANNOUNCED OUR CAMPAIGN AT THE FRONT END, WHERE WE DID OUR ANNOUNCEMENT. TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. JUST OVER ONE WEEK AGO, MANY OF THE PUNDITS DECLARED THAT THIS CANDIDACY WAS DEAD. NOW WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH VICTORIES IN MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, MICHIGAN AND WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM IDAHO, NORTH DAKOTA AND WASHINGTON STATE. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, THIS ELECTION IS ONE THAT HAS CHARACTER ON THE BALLOT. THAT CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES AND OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. IT IS MORE THAN A COMEBACK IN MY VIEW, OUR CAMPAIGN, IT IS A COMEBACK FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. THIS CAMPAIGN IS TAKING OFF, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL FROM THIS POINT ON. TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. I WANT TO EARN EVERY SINGLE VOTE IN EVERY SINGLE STATE, BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING, IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US, GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIGN UP, VOLUNTEER AND CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU. THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR EACH OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK BERNIE SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR TIRELESS ENERGY AND THEIR PASSION. WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL AND TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE WILL DEFEAT HIM TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS NATION TOGETHER. WE ARE REGENERATING A DEMOCRATIC BASE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS LIKE THE ONES I GREW UP WITH IN CLAREMONT NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE, IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, SO MANY MORE. PEOPLE OF EVERY ECONOMIC STATION. THE POOR WHO ARE STRUGGLING , AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT , THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHO WONDER WHETHER THERE WILL BE ABLE TO HANG ON AND MAINTAIN THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY, THEY ARE THE REASON JILL AND I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE THE REASON WHY I BECAME A DEMOCRAT SO LONG AGO. I CAN'T TELL YOU, I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART , I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE SHOWN IN ME THUS FAR. THE WAY THEY TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR ME. MY FIRST CAMPAIGN WHEN I WAS A KID, LONG TIME AGO, I HAD A BILLBOARD THAT SAID ONE THING ON IT. I HAD A PICTURE OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND IT SAID, ""FOR OF OUR FAMILIES."" THAT IS ALL IT WAS. ""FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES."" IT INCLUDED DEMOCRATIC FAMILIES, FAMILIES OF INDEPENDENT VOTERS, REPUBLICAN FAMILIES, EVERYONE OF EVERY STRIPE. FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. AND LOOK, THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THAT IS WHAT WE DID ON SUPER TUESDAY, AND IT APPEARS, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE PREMATURE, IT APPEARS THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN JUST THE PAST WEEK, SO MANY OF MY INCREDIBLE COMPETITORS HAVE ENDORSED ME. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, AMY KLOBUCHAR, BETO O'ROURKE MICHAEL , BLOOMBERG, CORY BOOKER AND KAMALA HARRIS. TOGETHER WE ARE BRINGING THIS PARTY TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. TONIGHT WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO RESTORING DECENCY, DIGNITY AND HONOR TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. [APPLAUSE] AND AT THIS MOMENT, WITH SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD, WE NEED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. WE NEED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. THAT IS HONEST, TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL AND STEADY. REASSURING LEADERSHIP. IF I AM GIVEN THE HONOR OF BECOMING YOUR PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL STRIVE TO GIVE THE NATION THAT VERY LEADERSHIP EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY. THAT IS THE REASON WHY ARE YOU , THAT IS THE REASON WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER A BOLD PROGRESSIVE VISION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, TOTAL HEALTH CARE. NOT A PRIVILEGE, BUT A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] BUILDING ON OBAMACARE, PROVIDING EVERY CHILD ACCESS TO GOOD EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE. TO DEAL WITH THE MORAL DEPRAVITY OF OUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO LEARN AT SCHOOL, LITTLE CHILDREN, TO DUCK AND COVER, ZIGZAG DOWN THE HALLWAY BECAUSE THEY FEAR SOMEONE WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON MAY BE COMING IN. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND THE NRA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA FIRST POLICIES MADE AMERICA ALONE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE TO RALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ACT AND ACT NOW. REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD ON DAY ONE, MAKE IT CLEAR TO OUR ALLIES THAT WE WILL HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT OUR WORD CAN BE TRUSTED. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, I AM SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER, NOT FAR FROM WHERE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN ALL OF HISTORY WERE WRITTEN, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. ""WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT."" THOSE WORDS BECAME THE AMERICAN CREED KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. ""WE THE PEOPLE."" THESE WORDS LITERALLY CHANGED THE WORLD. WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THE PROMISE OF EITHER OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, BUT WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. THEY ARE A REMINDER OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. OUR VERY DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I SAID FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED NOT FAR FROM HERE THAT I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WHEN DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, OUR CORE VALUES, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA, IS TRULY AT STAKE. I BELIEVE THIS NATION CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT GIVEN EIGHT, FOUR MORE YEARS, COULD FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. BUT WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SOWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT, BUT KNOWS HOW TO HEAL. [APPLAUSE] IT MEANS REPLACING A PRESIDENT WHO DEMEANS AND DEMONIZES HIS PEOPLE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION AND RESPECT FOR EVERYONE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE DAYS OF DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. WE ARE A DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT WE ARE IN. WE HAVE TO DO, WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. WE ARE CLOSE TO THE EVE OF ST. PATRICK'S DAY, I HAVE THOUGHT OF A QUOTE , SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME QUOTE MANY TIMES, A FELLOW I ADMIRE VERY MUCH WHO PASSED AWAY NOT LONG AGO, A POET NAMED SEAMUS HEANEY. HE WROTE A POEM, AND HERE IS WHAT HE SAID IN ONE STANZA, HE SAID, ""HISTORY TEACHES US NOT TO HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME, THAT LONG FORWARD TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE AND HISTORY RHYMES."" I TRULY BELIEVE IT IS IN OUR POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE POWER TO MAKE HOPE IN , HOPE AND HISTORY RHYME. THAT IS WHAT WE GOING TO DO. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) DURING THIS ELECTION SEASON, THE CANDIDATES BEYOND THE TALKING POET , POINTS ARE ONLY REVEALED OVER TIME. BUT SINCE YOU CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE, THERE IS C-SPAN. OUR CAMPAIGN 2020 PROGRAMMING DIFFERS FROM OTHER POLITICAL COVERAGE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON , IT IS C-SPAN. WE HAVE BROUGHT YOU YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT EVERY DAY SINCE 1979, AND THIS YOU , THIS YEAR WE ARE BRINGING YOU A VIEW OF THE PEOPLE HOPING TO STEER THAT GOVERNMENT.

CSPANJB123202064	Joe Biden	2020-03-12	Joe Biden on Coronavirus Outbreak	GOOD MORNING, ALL. OUR TOP PRIORITY AS OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR COUNTRY IS TO FIGHT THIS DISEASE AND PREVENT ITS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT I THINK TOOK DECISIVE AND THE CORRECT ACTION THAT WAS NEEDED. THESE MEASURES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT THE PRESIDENT TOOK EARLIER. THE PRESIDENT STOPPING THE FLIGHT FROM CHINA HAS ACTUALLY SAVED LIVES. NOW IN CONGRESS, WE HAVE TAKEN SOME ACTION AS WELL. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, JUST LAST WEEK WE PASSED $8 BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN TO FOCUS ON THREE MAJOR THINGS. THE TESTING, THE TREATMENT, AND TELEHEALTH. WHICH WILL HELP US NOT ONLY IN RURAL AREAS BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS WE TRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. ALONG WITH THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE, WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON MITIGATING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS FROM THIS VIRUS AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT SAID WE ARE COMMITTED TO HELPING THOSE WHO WILL FACE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AS A RESULT OF WORK DISRUPTIONS AND ILLNESS. THE COUNTRY IS LOOKING TO THE GOVERNMENT TO COME TOGETHER AND MEET THESE CHALLENGES. BUT THE BILL THAT WE SAW THAT JUST CAME FORTH LAST NIGHT AT 11:00 P.M. COMES UP SHORT. THERE'S A COUPLE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH IT. HERE'S ONE GLARING PROBLEM. UNDER PELOSI'S BILL, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE SET UP TO ADMINISTER THE PAID SICK LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS WILL TAKE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SO IT WON'T WORK IN TIME. IT ALSO WILL HAMPER THE ADMINISTRATION FROM PUTTING OUT SOCIAL SECURITY FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN HARM'S WAY. THIS WILL HURT THE VERY POPULATION THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING. IT FORCES PERMANENT PAID SICK LEAVE FOR ALL BUSINESSES WITHOUT EXEMPTIONS AND NO SUNSETS. INSTEAD, WE'RE COMMITTING TO GET THIS RIGHT SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, , [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2020] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TODAY ACROSS THE NATION MANY OF US ARE FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 KNOWN AS THE CORONAVIRUS. AND THREAT IT POSES TO OUR HEALTH, OUR LOVED ONES, OUR FAMILIES, OUR LIVELIHOODS. YOU KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY FIGHTING THIS VIRUS. THOSE INFECTED, FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS, FIRST RESPONDERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES ON THE LINE AS I SPEAK FOR OTHERS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY MAKING SACRIFICES TO PROTECT US, WHETHER THAT'S SELF-QUARANTINE THEMSELVES OR CANCELING EVENTS AND CLOSING CAMPUSES. BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE INFECTED OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS INFECTED OR HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED PERSON, THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A NATIONAL RESPONSE. NOT JUST FROM OUR ELECTED LEADERS OR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, BUT FROM ALL OF US. WE MUST, ALL OF US, FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OF THE HEALTH OFFICIALS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND, AND CRITICALLY TO PROTECT OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST AT RISK FROM THIS DISEASE. IT'S GOING TO MEAN MAKING RADICAL CHANGES IN OUR PERSONAL BEHAVIORS. MORE FREQUENT AND MORE THOROUGH HAND WASHING. STAYING HOME FROM WORK IF YOU'RE ILL. BUT ALSO ALL DURING THE DEEPLY ENGRAGED HABITS IN OUR COUNTRY LIKE HANDSHAKES AND HUGS. THAT'S WHY EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF OFFICIALS, MY CAMPAIGN CANCELED ELECTION NIGHT RALLIES THAT WE'D PLANNED TO HOLD IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. WE'RE ALSO REIMAGINING THE FORMAT FOR LARGE-CROWD EVENTS WE HAD PLANNED IN CHICAGO AND MIAMI IN THE COMING DAYS. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND ADJUST HOW WE CONDUCT OUR CAMPAIGNS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND FINAL NEW WAYS TO SHARE OUR , FIND NEW WAYS TO SHARE OUR MESSAGE WITH THE PUBLIC WHILE PUTTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST, ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE. YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS WHO WILL CONTINUE TO COUNSEL MY CAMPAIGN AND ME, HELP GUIDE OUR DECISIONS ON THE STEPS TO MINIMIZE FURTHER RISKS. WE WILL LEAD BY SCIENCE. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION NOW HAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED COVID-19 A PANAMA , PANDEMIC. DOWN PLAYING IT, BEING OVERLY DISMISSIVE OR SPREADING MISINFORMATION IS ONLY GOING TO HURT US AND FURTHER ADVANTAGE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. BUT NEITHER SHOULD WE PANIC OR FALL BACK OGNJEN PHOBIA , XENOPHOBIA, LABELING COVID-19 A FOREIGN VIRUS DOES NOT DISPLACE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MISJUDGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN THUS FAR BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE CORONAVIRUS DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL AFFILIATION, WILL AFFECT REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE AND WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, GENDER OR ZIP CODE. IT WILL TOUCH PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER, AS WELL AS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT WILL NOT STOP. BANNING ALL TRAVEL FROM EUROPE OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD MAY SLOW IT, BUT AS WE'VE SEEN, IT WILL NOT STOP IT. AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BASED ON FAVORITISM AND POLITICS RATHER THAN RISK WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THIS DISEASE COULD IMPACT EVERY NATION AND ANY PERSON ON THE PLANET. WE NEED TO PLAN ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE HERE AT HOME. YOU KNOW, WE ALL DO KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET THIS MOMENT. WE'RE GOING TO FACE THIS WITH THE SAME SPIRIT THAT HAS GUIDED US THROUGH PREVIOUS CRISES. AND WE'LL COME TOGETHER AS A NATION, WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND DO OUR PART AS CITIZENS. WE HAVE TO BE , WE HAVE TO HARNESS THE INGENUITY OF OUR SCIENTISTS AND THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF OUR PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO HELP THE WORLD, HELP THE WORLD TO DRIVE COORDINATED GLOBAL STRATEGY. NOT SHUT OURSELVES OFF FROM THE WORLD. PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF ANY PRESIDENT AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS VIRUS LAID BEAR THE SEVERE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. PUBLIC FEARS ARE BEING COMPOUNDED BY PERVASIVE LACK OF TRUST IN THIS PRESIDENT. FUELED BY ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TRUTH THAT IT CONTINUES TO HAVE. OUR GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY HOLLOWING OUT OUR AGENCIES AND DISPARAGEMENT OF SCIENCE. AND OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE A GLOBAL RESPONSE IS DRAMATICALLY, DRAMATICALLY UNDERCUT BY THE DAMAGE TRUMP HAS DONE TO OUR CREDIBILITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY TO DIG OURSELVES OUT OF THIS HOLE. AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M RELEASING A PLAN TO COMBAT AND OVERCOME THE CORONAVIRUS. A FULL DE, THE FULL DETAILS OF THE PLAN, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM, WHERE I LAY OUT THE IMMEDIATE STEPS WE HAVE TO TAKE TO DELIVER ONE DECISIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO CURB THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT AND A DECISIVE ECONOMIC RESPONSE THAT DELIVERS REAL RELIEF TO AMERICAN WORKERS, FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND PROTECTS THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. I OFFER IT AS A ROAD MAP, NOT FOR WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT 10 MONTH INTERESTS NOW, BUT FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT I BELIEVE IS NEEDED, REQUIRED AT THIS VERY MOMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WELCOME TO ADOPT ALL OF IT TODAY. THE CORE PRINCIPLE IS SIMPLE. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MUST BE THE ONES MAKING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS. AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IT WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD RECLAIMING PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS WELL. TOWARD STOPPING THE FEAR AND CHAOS THAT CAN OVERTAKE COMMUNITIES FASTER THAN THIS PANDEMIC CAN OVERTAKE THEM. IT'S CRITICAL TO MONITOR AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL RESPONSE THAT WILL SAVE LIVES, PROTECT OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH WORKERS, SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, FIRST. ANYONE, ANYONE WHO NEED TO BE TESTED SHOULD BE TESTED AT NO CHARGE. AT NO CHARGE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE ON TESTING IS COLOSSAL. AND IT'S A FAILURE OF PLANNING, LEADERSHIP AND EXECUTION. THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD MEASURE AND REPORT EACH DAY, EACH AND EVERY DAY HOW MANY TESTS HAVE BEEN ORDERED, HOW MANY TESTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, AND HOW MANY HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. BY NEXT WEEK THE NUMBER OF TESTS SHOULD BE IN THE MILLIONS, NOT THE THOUSANDS. WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY PERSON IN THE NURSING HOME AVAILABLE FOR TESTING. EVERY SENIOR CENTER OR VULNERABLE POPULATION HAS TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE TEST AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH HUNDREDS OF MOBILE TESTING SITES, AT LEAST 10 PER STATE, AND DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING CENTERS TO SPEED TESTING AND PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR WORKERS. THE C.D.C., PRIVATE LABS, UNIVERSITIES AND MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE WORKING LOCK-STEP TO GET THIS DONE AND GET IT DONE CORRECTLY. NO EFFORT SHOULD BE SPARED. NONE. NO EXCUSES SHOULD BE MADE. TESTS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO NEED THEM. AND THE GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP AT NOTHING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE MUST KNOW THE TRUEX TENT OF THIS OUTBREAK SO WE CAN , TRUE EXTENT OF THE OUTBREAK, SO WE CAN MAP IT, TRACE IT AND CONTAIN IT. NOR SHOULD WE HIDE THE TRUE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN HOPETS OF , HOPES OF PROTECTING POLITICAL INTERESTS OR THE STOCK MARKET. THE MARKETS WILL RESPOND STRONG, TO STRONG AND STEADY AND CAPABLE LEADERSHIP THAT ADDRESSES THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, NOT EFFORTS TO COVER IT UP. SECONDLY, WE NEED TO SURGE OUR CAPACITY TO BOTH PREVENT AND TREAT THE CORONAVIRUS. AND PREPARE OUR HOSPITALS TO DEAL WITH THE INFLUX OF THOSE NEEDING CARE, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS. THIS MEANS NOT JUST GETTING OUT THE TESTING KITS AND PROCESSING THEM QUICKLY, BUT MAKING SURE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE HOSPITAL BEDS AVAILABLE, THE STAFF, THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES, THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO TREAT THE PATIENTS. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD ORDER FEMA TO PREPARE THE CAPACITY WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH TEMPORARY HOSPITALS WITH HUNDREDS OF BEDS AND SERVE NOTICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHOULD BE PLANNING NOW, SHOULD HAVE EVENT PLANNING TO PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT OF THE RESOURCES PROVIDED, MEDICAL FACILITY CAPACITY ON LOGISTIC SUPPORT THAT ONLY THEY CAN DO. A WEEK FROM NOW, A MONTH FROM NOW, WE CAN HAVE A 5, 500-BED HOSPITAL TO TREAT PATIENTS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN DO THAT. BUT WE ARE NOT READY YESTERDAY AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING , YET AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AS WE TAKE THESE STEPS, STATE, FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCURATE, UP TO DATE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN. TO EVERYONE. SO EVERYONE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHEN TO GET TESTED, WHEN TO SELF-QUARANTINE, WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES WITH CLEAR GUIDANCE OF WHEN TO TRIGGER MORE AGGRESSIVE MITIGATION POLICIES SUCH AS CLOSING SCHOOLS. THIRD, WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT OF A VACCINE. SCIENCE TAKES TIME. IT WILL STILL BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE WE HAVE A VACCINE THAT CAN BE PROVEN SAFE FOR PUBLIC USE AND PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT THERAPEUTICS CAN AND SHOULD COME SOONER. THIS WILL SAVE LIVES. WHEN I PUT TOGETHER AND WE PASSED THE CURES ACT OF 2016 TO ACCELERATE WORK ON THE NATIONAL , AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, BUT NOW IT HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE, MAKE AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO SPEED UP, SPEED THAT PROCESS ALONG. WE HAVE TO FAST TRACK CLINICAL TRIALS WITHIN N.I.H. WHILE CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH THE F.D.A., THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ON TRIAL APPROVALS. SO THAT SCIENCE IS NOT HINDERED BY THE BUREAUCRACY. AND WHEN A VACCINE IS READY TO GO, IT SHOULD ALSO BE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND, AGAIN, FREE OF CHARGE. WE SHOULD ALSO IMMEDIATELY RESTORE THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DIRECTORATE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY AND BIODEFENSE. WITH A FULL-TIME DEDICATED COORDINATOR TO OVERSEE THAT RESPONSE. OUR ADMINISTRATION, OUR LAST ADMINISTRATION, WE CREATED THAT OFFICE TO BETTER RESPOND TO FUTURE GLOBAL THREATS AFTER THE EBOLA CRISIS OF 2014. IT WAS DESIGNED FOR EXACTLY THIS SCENARIO. FOR SOME REASON I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND, PRESIDENT TRUMP ELIMINATED THAT OFFICE TWO YEARS AGO. LOOK, HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO BEAT THE CHALLENGE, BEAT THIS CHALLENGE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WE WILL BEAT IT. I ASSURE YOU, IF WE WAIT FOR IT TO WORSEN, THEN SCRAMBLE TO CATCH UP, THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC TOLL WILL GROW FASTER, LARGER AND MORE DANGEROUS. CONGRESS GAVE THIS ADMINISTRATION $8 BILLION LAST WEEK TO FIGHT THE VIRUS. WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR. HOW QUICKLY IT'S GOING OUT THE DOOR. AND EXACTLY HOW IT'S BEING SPENT. THIS BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DISLOCATION. THE CORONAVIRUS IS GOING TO CAUSE IN OUR COUNTRY. WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES, TO DELIVER FOR OUR FAMILIES AND ENSURE THE STABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY. TAKING IMMEDIATE BOLD MEASURES TO HELP AMERICANS WHO ARE HURTING ECONOMICALLY RIGHT THIS MINUTE. IT MEANS WE'LL NEED BIGGER AND BROADER MEASURES TO SHORE UP THE ECONOMIC DEMAND, PROTECT JOBS, KEEP CREDIT FLOWING TO OUR JOB CREATORS, AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC FIRE POWER WE NEED TO WEATHER THE STORM AND GET THE PEOPLE AND THIS ECONOMY BACK TO FULL STRENGTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS CRISIS WILL HIT EVERYONE. BUT IT WILL HIT FOLKS WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THE HARDEST. INCLUDING WORKING PEOPLE AND SENIORS AND OTHER , SENIORS. ANOTHER TAX CUT TO GOOGLE OR GOLDMAN AND MILLIONAIRES WON'T GET THE JOB DONE. ANOTHER TAX CUT TO THESE FOLKS WILL NOT GET THE JOB DONE. INDISCRIMINATE CORPORATE TAX SUBSIDIES WON'T EFFECTIVELY TARGET THOSE WHO REALLY NEED THE HELP NOW. WE NEED TO PLACE OUR FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO GET BY. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LOSING JOBS. WE NEED TO REPLACE THEIR WAGES. THAT INCLUDES WORKERS IN THE GIG ECONOMY WHO LACK UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. PARENTS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH CHILD CARE COSTS. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM RELIEF. CHILDREN WHO RELY ON SCHOOL LUNCHES. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEM. SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO HELP ENSURING CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS TO COMPUTERS CAN STILL LEARN IF THEIR SCHOOL IS SHUT DOWN. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY PAYING THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LAID OFF OR HAD THEIR HOURS CUT BACK NEED HELP TO STAY IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND HOMES. SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE DEVASTATED AS CUSTOMERS STAY HOME. AND EVENTS ARE CANCELED. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INTEREST-FREE LOANS. NOT LOANS WITH INTEREST. INTEREST-FREE LOANS. IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE THAT MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS DON'T HAVE A SINGLE DAY OF PAID SICK LEAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE NEED BOTH A PERMANENT PLAN FOR PAID SICK LEAVE AND AN EMERGENCY PLAN FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS IT DUE TO THE OUTBREAK NOW. BEYOND THESE NATIONAL MEASURES, MY PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A STATE, LOCAL EMERGENCY FUND TO MAKE SURE GOVERNORS, MAYORS AND LOCAL LEADERS WHO ARE BATTLING THE CORONAVIRUS ON THE GROUND AS I SPEAK HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET THIS CRISIS HEAD-ON NOW. THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL LEADERS FOR WHATEVER THEY NEED MOST. FROM EXPANDING CRITICAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, HIRING ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL, OR CUSHIONING THE WIDER ECONOMIC BLOWS THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO CREATE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE NEED SMART, BOLD, COMPASSIONATE LEADERSHIP THAT'S GOING TO HELP CONTAIN THE CRISIS, REDUCE THE HARDSHIPS TO OUR PEOPLE, AND HELP OUR ECONOMY REBOUND. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL JUST BE A START. WE MUST PREPARE NOW TO TAKE FURTHER DECISIVE ACTION, INCLUDING RELIEF THAT WILL BE LARGE IN SCALE, FOCUSED ON BROADER HEALTH AND STABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY. LOOK, WE CAN ONLY PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY IF WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR PEOPLE. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THIS. WE'LL NEVER FULLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF WE'RE UNWILLING TO LOOK BEYOND OUR OWN BORDERS AND ENGAGE FULLY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. A DISEASE AT THAT STARTS ANYPLACE ON THE PLANET CAN GET ON A PLANE TO ANY CITY ON EARTH WITHIN A FEW HOURS. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE CORONAVIRUS EVERYWHERE. WE SHOULD BE LEADING A COORDINATED GLOBAL RESPONSE, JUST AS WE DID TO THE EBOLA CRISIS. THAT DRAWS ON THE INCREDIBLE CAPABILITY OF U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OUR STATE DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST VULNERABLE NATIONS IN DETECTING AND TREATING THE CORONAVIRUS WHEREVER IT SPREADS. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN REBUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY AGENDA, WHICH WE LAUNCHED DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION. SPECIFICALLY TO MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST THE THREATS OF NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASES. LOOK, IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE THE CONCRETE VALUE OF THIS WORK WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING WELL IN THE WORLD. BUT BY CUTTING OUR INVESTMENT IN GLOBAL HEALTH, THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS LEFT US WOEFULLY UNPREPARED FOR THE EXACT CRISIS WE NOW FACE. NO PRESIDENT CAN PROMISE TO PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS. BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, WE WILL BE BETTER PREPARED, RESPOND BETTER AND RECOVER BETTER. WE'LL LEAD WITH SCIENCE. WE'LL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS. WE'LL HEED THEIR ADVICE AND WE'LL BUILD AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND REBUILD IT TO RALLY THE WORLD TO MEET A GLOBAL , THE GLOBAL THREATS THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO FACE AGAIN. YOU KNOW, AND I'LL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH, THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT IS OWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW, IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD, I KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL SUMMON THE SPIRIT, THE EMPATHY, THE DECENCY AND THE UNITY NEEDED BECAUSE IN TIMES OF CRISIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS, ALWAYS STAND AS ONE IF TOLD THE TRUTH. VOLUNTEERS RAISE THEIR HANDS TO HELP. NEIGHBORS LOOK OUT FOR NEIGHBORS. BUSINESSES TAKE CARE OF THEIR WORKERS. SO WE'LL MEET THIS CHALLENGE TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT OF IT. BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE AND MOVE NOW. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

BUT SINCE YOU CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE, THERE'S C-SPAN. OUR CAMPAIGN 2020 PROGRAM DIFFERS FROM ALL OTHER POLITICAL COVERAGE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON, IT IS C-SPAN.

AFTER WINNING PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN TWO STATES, FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS. HE WOULD GO ON TO WIN ARIZONA LATER IN THE NIGHT. GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. LAST WEEK, I HAD THE HONOR OF SPEAKING TO ALL OF YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA. THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. TONIGHT IN KEEPING WITH THE LATEST GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC, TO AVOID GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN 10 PEOPLE, I'M SPEAKING TO YOU FROM MY HOME IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. I HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE STAYING SAFE. TALKING AND TAKING THE RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS AND TALKING IT TO THE DOCTORS IF YOU HAVE ONE, TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. AND EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CAMPAIGN. MOST OF ALL, MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THOSE WHO CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. ALL OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WORKING HARDER THAN EVER TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS. TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN AT HOME OR SCHOOL AND ARE WORRIED AND DON'T KNOW WHY. DOCTORS, NURSES, EMTS, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS FRONT-LINE EMERGENCY WORKERS LIKE FIREFIGHTERS AND DEDICATED FOLKS WORKING TO KEEP SHELVES STOCKED IN THE GROCERY STORES. TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, LOOK INTO FIGHTING A WAR. IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION FROM EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO MOVE THOUGHTFULLY AND DECISIVELY TO QUICKLY ADDRESS BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IT WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US TO DO OUR PART. YES, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO LEAD, BUT ALSO A MOMENT WHERE THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS WE MAKE AS INDIVIDUALS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS. MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERITY OF THIS OUTBREAK AND PREPARING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS TO HANDLE IT. I KNOW WE AS A PEOPLE ARE UP TO THIS CHALLENGE, WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE WILL ANSWER THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS WITH THE BEST WE FIND IN ALL OF US. THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND WHAT WE DO. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN THE NEED ARISES. TODAY, WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY TO ATTRACT OUR ROUTINES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE. AMERICANS IN THREE STRAIGHT , STATES WENT TO THE POLLS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND POLL WORKERS WHO WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO SHARE SAFE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTING. MAKING SURE THE VOTERS CAN CAST THEIR BALLOTS WHILE MAINTAINING A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT WAS SAFE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS, PROTECTING BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEMOCRACY. TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN IN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS, WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM ARIZONA, OUR CAMPAIGN HAS A GOOD NIGHT. WE MOVE CLOSER TO SECURING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE DOING IT BY DOING A BROAD COALITION. WE NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. WITH STRONG SUPPORT TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, LATINO COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS I GREW UP WITH IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. TEACHERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, AND SO MANY MORE. WE ARE DOING IT WITH A COMMON VISION. SENATOR SANDERS AND I MAY DISAGREE ON TACTICS, BUT WE SHARE A COMMON VISION. FOR THE NEED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS, REDUCING COMMON EQUITY THAT HAS RISEN SO DRASTICALLY, TO TACKLING THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF OUR TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE. SENATOR SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE BROUGHT A REMARKABLE TENACITY TO ALL OF THESE ISSUES. TOGETHER, THEY SHIFTED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONVERSATION IN THIS COUNTRY. LET ME SAY ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG VOTERS INSPIRED BY SENATOR SANDERS, I HEAR YOU. I KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. OUR GOAL IS TO CAMPAIGN, AND MY GOAL IS TO UNIFY THIS PARTY AND UNIFY THE NATION. IT'S A MOMENT LIKE THESE WERE WE REALIZE WE NEED TO PUT POLITICS INSIDE , ASIDE. THE CORONAVIRUS DOESN'T CARE IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. IT WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, GENDER, OR YOUR ZIP CODE. IT WILL TOUCH PEOPLE OF POSITIONS OF POWER. THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS FOR EACH OF US TO SEE AND BELIEVE THE BEST AND EVERY ONE OF US. TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBOR. UNDERSTAND THE FEAR AND STRESS SO MANY ARE FEELING TO CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. THE ELDERLY COUPLE DOWN THE STREET, TO THINK THE HEALTH CARE WORKER, DOCTORS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS. THE GROCERY STORE CASHIER AND PEOPLE RESTOCKING THE SHELVES. TO BELIEVE IN ONE ANOTHER. BECAUSE I ASSURE YOU, WHEN WE SEE THE BEST IN EACH OF US, WE LIFT THIS NATION UP, WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MY SPECIAL PRAYER FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CRISIS. DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, CARING FOR THE VIRUS VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY. MY PRAYERS ARE GOING OUT FOR EVERYONE. MY HOPES ARE HIGH, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STEPPED UP. WE HAVE TO STEP UP AND CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER.

THE PRESIDENT OF THAT UNION AND HERE IN OUR STUDIOS AND NATHAN BOMEY OF USA TODAY TO BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON NEWSMAKERS, BE SAFE. TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT RICHARD TRUMKA ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND HOW THE PANDEMIC COULD AFFECT THAT. UP NEXT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN, A 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THIS HAPPENED JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. IT'S ABOUT 15 MINUTES. GOOD MORNING. I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING WELL IN THESE DIFFICULT AND ANXIOUS TIMES, CONFUSING TIMES. LIKE ALL FAMILIES, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS ADJUSTING TO NEW WAYS. LESS TIME TOGETHER, MORE WORRYING ABOUT FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ISOLATED OR SUFFERING DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. AS AMERICANS, WE MAY BE PHYSICALLY APART, BUT WE'RE TRULY ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW IT. LET ME SAY SOMETHING RIGHT UP FRONT. WHEN WE'VE STOOD AS ONE, THIS NATION HAS NEVER, EVER BEEN DEFEATED WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DEFEATED NOW. THE PANDEMIC OF 1918, THE GREAT DEPRESSION, TWO WORLD WARS, WE OVERCAME THEM ALL AND OUT OF EACH CRISIS WE EMERGED STRONGER AND WE WILL AGAIN. THIS NEW ENEMY MAY BE UNSEEN, BUT WE HAVE THE TOOLS, THE EXPERTISE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SPIRIT TO DEFEAT IT. BUT WE NEED TO MOVE AND WE NEED TO MOVE FAST. YOU KNOW, IT MATTERS HOW FAST WE MOVE FOR BOTH. LATER TODAY, YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT IN HIS DAILY BRIEFING. THESE BRIEFINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM AND REASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THEY'RE NOT A PLACE FOR POLITICAL ATTACKS OR TO LASH OUT AT THE PRESS. THEY'RE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO I HOPE TODAY AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD THE PRESIDENT WILL GIVE US THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED AND WHAT THEY DESERVE. I HOPE HE LETS THE MEDICAL EXPERTS AND FEMA LEADERS AND OTHERS CARRYING OUT THE WORK TO TAKE CENTER STAGE, TO HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY AND I HOPE WE HEAR LESS TALK AND SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF FAST ACTION. MY PRINCIPAL FOCUS TODAY AND EVERY DAY WILL BE ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO GET THIS RESPONSE FIXED TO SAVE LIVES, PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO NEED IT AND NEED IT NOW AND ARE GOING TO NEED IT IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. IT STARTS WITH ADOPTING A MINDSET OF REAL URGENCY. FOR TOO LONG, THE WARNING SIGNS WERE IGNORED. FOR TOO LONG, THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THE THREATS WERE QUOTE ""UNDER CONTROL,"" CONTAINED, LIKE THE FLU. THE PRESIDENT SAYS NO ONE SAW THIS COMING. WELL, THAT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE. OUR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS WERE WARNING OF CORONAVIRUS THREAT IN JANUARY. JUST BASED ON PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT I HAD, I WARNED THE THREAT WAS GETTING WORSE WAY BACK ON JANUARY THE 27th AND URGED THE NEED TO PUT SCIENCE FIRST, DRAW ON EMERGENCY FUNDS TO GET THE RESPONSE STARTED, THINK ABOUT INVOKING DISASTER POWERS IT TO RESPOND. MANY OF US TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO GET THE U.S. SCIENTISTS ON THE GROUND TO SEE FIRST-HAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CHINA RATHER THAN ON RELYING WHAT CAME FROM CHINA. MY POINT IS NOT SIMPLY THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS WRONG. MY POINT IS THAT THE MINDSET THAT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO TREAT IT WITH THE SERIOUSNESS IT DESERVED IS STILL TOO MUCH A PART OF HOW THE PRESIDENT IS ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. SOUTH KOREA DETECTED THEIR FIRST CASE OF CORONAVIRUS IN THE SAME DAY WE DID. PUT THEY HAD TESTS AND SOPHISTICATED TRACING PROGRAMS TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON LOCKDOWN. WE HAD NONE OF THAT. SO WE'RE LEFT WITH ONLY ONE, THE EXTREME SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES CURRENTLY IN PLACE. THAT'S A FAILURE OF PLANNING AND PREPARATION BY THE WHITE HOUSE. TODAY, MONTHS LATER, AMERICANS STILL NEED TO BE TESTED AND STILL HAVE NO ACCESS TO TESTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TEETERS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. HOSPITAL BEDS ARE FILLING. DOCTORS AND NURSES ARE ALREADY RUNNING OUT OF CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO COORDINATE GETTING MEDICAL SUPPLIES OUT TO EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY SO WE DON'T HAVE GOVERNORS COMPETING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. AS OF LATE YESTERDAY, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS NOT ACTIVATED THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT WHICH I AND OTHERS CALL HIM TO DIRECT AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES. TRUMP KEEPS SAYING THAT HE'S A WARTIME PRESIDENT. WELL, START TO ACT LIKE ONE. TO PARAPHRASE THE FRUSTRATED PRESIDENT LINCOLN WRITING TO AN INACTIVE GENERAL McLEGALEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE ARMY, MAY I BORROW IT? END OF QUOTE. WE NEED TO GET IN MOTION IT TODAY WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE SET IN MOTION WEEKS AGO. ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT WILL TELL YOU THAT IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS, YOU CAN'T MOVE TOO FAST, YOU CAN ONLY MOVE TOO SLOWLY. LET ME BE CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THE CORONAVIRUS. BUT HE DOES BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR RESPONSE. AND I ALONG WITH EVERY AMERICAN HOPE HE STEPS UP AND STARTS TO GET THIS RIGHT. NOW, THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS. THIS IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH AT STAKE, TOO MANY LIVES, TOO MANY LIVELIHOODHOODS, TOO MANY HOMES AND FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES AT RISK. I HAVE LAID OUT A VERY DETAILED IN-DEPTH PLAN FOR WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING. YOU CAN READ ON WWW.JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION ON TESTING, ON RESEARCH FOR TREATMENTS AND VACCINES, ON LEADING A GLOBAL RESPONSE TO BEAT THE VIRUS EVERYWHERE. BUT TODAY, I WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST FOUR KEY POINTS OF ACTION. FIRST, THE PRESIDENT JUST TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY, THE CAPACITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO TREAT THE SICKEST CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS SAFELY. I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT HAS FINALLY ACTIVATED THE NATIONAL GUARD. NOW, WE NEED THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP WITH HOSPITAL CAPACITY, SUPPLIES AND LOGISTICS. WE NEED TO ACTIVATE THE RESERVE CORPS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND NURSES AND BEEF UP THE NUMBER OF RESPONDERS DEALING WITH THE CRUSH OF CASES. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE IN A POSITION THAT WE'RE , WELL, LET ME GO THE SECOND THING. THE PRESIDENT MUST USE THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO RADICALLY INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF CRITICAL GOODS NEEDED TO TREAT PATIENTS AND PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS, INCLUDING THE PROTECTIVE GEAR LIKE FACE MASKS AND CRITICAL EQUIPMENT LIKE VENTILATORS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IN OUR HOSPITALS. IT MEANS WORKING WITH ALL OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO GET SUPPLIES FROM OVERSEAS WHEN AVAILABLE, DISPATCHING U.S. MILITARY ASSETS TO RETRIEVE THEM QUICKLY IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE. IT MEANS FEDERAL COORDINATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS TO ACCELERATE DELIVERIES AND GET THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACES AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MITCH MORE. AND WE NEED TO BUILD AN ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY AS WE DID IN 1940. WE CAN TAKE , WE CAN , PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT , LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL, WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DID IN THE '40s AND THE 20s IN THE 2020s AND WE CAN DO THAT. WE NEED TO BUILD A MEDICAL ARSENAL HERE. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BE IN THE , THE INFIGHTING AND BICKERING WITH HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION, LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS THAT PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING CLEAR LEADERSHIP, CLEAR ACTION AND CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY. MANAGEMENT MATTERS IN A CRISIS. I'VE BEEN THERE IN THE SITUATION ROOM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN ALL AT ONCE. YOU NEED TO BE PLANNING, NOT JUST FOR TODAY, BUT FOR TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. IS THE WHITE HOUSE ACTUALLY PLANNING FOR WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO RETURN TO SOMETHING RESEMBLING A NORMAL LIFE? I DON'T KNOW. JUST WAITING TO SEE ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED, BUILDINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE? WHAT PROTECTIONS AND PROTOCOLS DO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T SIMPLY START SPREADING AGAIN IN THE FALL? THEY NEED TO START PLANNING NOW SO THE CURRENT MEASURES STAY IN PLACE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE NEEDED, BUT NOT LONGER. AND FOURTH, THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO SET THE RIGHT PRIORITIES FOR OUR ECONOMIC RESPONSE. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE MUST BE TO KEEP EVERYONE PAID THROUGH THIS CRISIS, EVERYONE. IT SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP WORKERS ON PAYROLLS. MAKE SMALL BUSINESSES HEALTHIER. HELP THE ECONOMY COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE STRONG. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHILE STILL PROTECTING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. WE CAN DO BOTH. UNFORTUNATELY, AS OF LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MITCH McCONNELL WERE OFFERING A PLAN TO LET BIG CORPORATIONS OFF THE HOOK. THEY PROPOSED A $500 BILLION SLUSH FUND FOR CORPORATIONS WITH ALMOST NO CONDITIONS. UNDER THEIR PLAN, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COULD EVEN ALLOW COMPANIES TO USE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE BEING GIVEN TO THEM BY TAXPAYERS MONEY TO BUY BACK STOCKS, INCREASE EXECUTIVE PAY, IF THAT'S WHAT THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DECIDED. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE COMMITMENTS TO KEEP WORKERS EMPLOYED, THESE BIG CORPORATIONS. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL THE AMERICANS WHERE THE MONEY GOES FOR MONTHS. TODAY, THERE'S AN ACTIVE EFFORT TO FIX THAT BILL IN THE CONGRESS GOING ON NOW AS WE SPEAK SO FOR WORKERS AND FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THEM, NO STRINGS CORPORATE BAILOUTS MAKES NO SENSE. HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE. MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE THE FAMILY-RUN RESTAURANT THAT'S TRYING TO STAY OPEN TO PAY ITS WORKERS, THEY SHOULD GET THE FUNDS THEY NEED. BIG COMPANIES WILL NEED HELP, TOO, BUT NO BLANK CHECKS. IF CORPORATIONS TAKE MONEY FROM TAXPAYERS, THEY HAVE TO MAKE AN ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT THAT THEY WILL KEEP WORKERS ON THE PAYROLL. WORKERS, THE WORKER WHO IS SEEING THEIR WAGES SLASHED, THEY NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE, THOSE WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS, THEY NEED STRONG, SUSTAINED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, WHETHER THEY ARE GIG WORKERS OR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. THE FAMILY THAT WILL GO HUNGRY AND NEEDS FOOD ON THE TABLE, THEY NEED TO HELP NOW. SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS NEED TO BE BOOSTED NOW. STUDENT DEBT SHOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR NOW. CASH , LOOK, CASH RELIEF NEEDS TO GO OUT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND WE CAN ACT QUICKLY AND WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. WE CAN PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND MEET THE MOMENT LIKE GOVERNORS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION ARE DOING. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE, CHARLIE PARKER, GAVEN NEWSOM, WASHINGTON, MICHIGAN, NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO'S BRIEFINGS ARE A LESSON IN LEADERSHIP. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALL ARE RISING TO THE MOMENT, PUTTING ASIDE POLITICS TO DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. BUT THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTING FOR MORE HELP. FINALLY. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT TODAY IS THE 10th ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I'M PROUD OF THE ROLE I PLAYED ALONGSIDE PRESIDENT OBAMA BACKING HIM UP TO BRING OBAMACARE INTO THE LAW. MAKING THE LAW. IT'S NOW LAW. AND I'M PROUD OF THE RECORD THAT'S ACHIEVED, BUT ALSO TODAY IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES IN GENERATIONS, THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING A LAWSUIT TO INVALIDATE THE ACA IN COURT. THEY'RE WORKING TO STRIP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTHCARE AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I SENT A LETTER THIS MORNING WITH A SIMPLE REQUEST, WITHDRAW THE LAWSUIT, PLEASE. END THIS EFFORT TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE. THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT TO ADD ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR IN THIS NATION OR TO LET POLITICS TRUMP DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. GIVE AMERICANS PEACE OF MIND, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, HELP. YOU KNOW, IN CRISIS, CHARACTER IS REVEALED. AND EACH DAY WE'RE SEEING THE COURAGE AND THE HEART OF AMERICANS SHINE THROUGH. OUR MILITARY, OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, OUR DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTHCARE WORKERS, OF COURSE THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB, BUT ALSO, THOSE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT MUCH. THE GROCERY STORE WORKER, STOCKING THE SHELF, THE MAIL PACKAGE CARRIERS, THE WORKERS MANUFACTURING GEAR WE NEED TO KEEP DELIVERY TRUCKS ON THE ROAD, COOKING MEALS TO DELIVER, TENDERING TO OUR ELDERLY LOVED ONES. THE JOURNALISTS WHO KEEP US UP TO DATE AND HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE AS LEADERS. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM AND SO MANY MORE. THEY'RE PUTTING ALL OF IT ON THE LINE FOR ALL OF US. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM ALL THE HELP THEY NEED, AND NOW, THEY NEED HELP NOW. WE NEED TO BE SURE WE NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY'VE DONE. BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT DEAL. LET ME CLOSE WITH A THOUGHT. TEAM IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN I THINK THERE BURNS A FLAME. IT'S AN INHOURITANCE FROM EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS THAT'S COME BEFORE US. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE OVERCOME EVERY CRISIS WE'VE FACED BEFORE. IT'S WHAT MAKES THIS , IF OUR LEADERSHIP DOES ITS PART, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DO MORE THAN THEIR PART BECAUSE HERE'S THE SIMPLE TRUTH. ORDINARY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. SO WE NEED TO GET MOVING. MOVE FASTER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING THE VIRUS. MAY GOD PROTECT YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?470609-1/joe-biden-remarks-coronavirus-response	Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, delivered remarks on the national response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

AS WE SPEAK TODAY, MORE THAN 90,000 AMERICANS HAVE NOW LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC. SKILL , (music) I DO NOT KNOW WHO'S PHONE THAT IS. THE SCALE OF THE LOSS IS STAGGERING. MORE THAN THAT, IT IS HEARTBREAKING SH. HOW MUCH FEAR, LOSS AND AGONY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING TEST. WE COULD HAVE MARSHALED SUPPLIES IN THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, WHICH I CALLED FOR A LONG TIME AGO TO ENSURE EVERYONE COMMUNITY WAS READY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THE PUBLIC TO ACT QUICKLY TO SLOW THE SPREAD. INSTEAD, WE GOT DENIAL, DELAYS, DISTRACTION. MANY OF WHICH WERE XENOPHOBIC. WE GOT PULLED FACED LIES ABOUT TESTING CAPACITY. THAT QUOTE, ANYBODY WHO A TEST CAN GET IT. IT WAS NOT REMOTELY TRUE TWO MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL NOT. WE GOT PROMISES. ONE DAY, , GOD ALMIGHTY. HE HAD MONTHS AND MONTHS TO TAKE ACTION. TO LEAD TO HE DID NOTHING BUT MAKE FALSE PROMISES AND DISMISS THE EXPERTS. NOW, 90,000 AMERICANS ARE GONE. LEAVING THE HIND , LEAVING BEHIND PROBABLY OVER 200,000, 300,000, 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. MORE THAN 36 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT SUMMON BARELY A WORD OF EMPATHY, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EXPRESS REGRET. THERE IS NO INDICATION HE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF THE PAIN AND THE LOSS THIS CRISIS HAS BROUGHT. IT IS NOT JUST LACK OF WORDS. IT IS LACK OF ACTION. CONGRESS GAVE THE ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIED HIS OF DOLLARS FOR HELPING MAIN STREET IT WAS CALLED THE MAIN STREET LETTING PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE NGRESS GAVE THAT MONEY CAN , THAT MONEY. THEY HAVE NOT LET A SINGLE DOLLAR YET. WHY DID THEY FAIL TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT TO STAY AFLOAT? IS IT INCOMPETENCE? TRUMP IS TWEETING AGAIN THIS MORNING. REOPEN THE COUNTRY, END OF QUOTE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE MONEY SMALL BUSINESSES NEED IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE? STOP TWEETING ABOUT IT GET THE MONEY OUT TO MAIN STREET NOW. IT HAS BEEN PASSED. THIS PANDEMIC IS HITTING EVERYONE HARD. WE NEED SERIOUS COMPETENT LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER. FRANKLY, WE NEED MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THIS PANDEMIC HAS TOUCHED EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, AAPI COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO FIGHT ON AN ADDITIONAL FRONT. THE PANDEMIC HAS THE LEAST FAMILIAR FORCES OF HATE, FEAR AND XENOPHOBIA. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, IT BROUGHT , IT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT A NEW RASH OF RACIST MESSAGES, VERBAL, PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF HATE. SOME SUBTLE, SOME OVER, DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SHOULD IT IS ONE OF , PACIFIC ISLANDERS. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOLE OF THIS NATION. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT HE IS DOING. IT STRIKES AT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY. WHO WE ARE, WHO WE WANT TO BE. THAT HATE IS ESPECIALLY DESPICABLE AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE LEADING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS FIGHT. LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER NURSES, DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS. DELIVERY DRIVERS, RETAIL WORKERS , RUNNING CRITICAL BUSINESSES, KEEPING US FED. THAT SERVICE IS NOT JUST ESSENTIAL. IT IS THE BEST OF AMERICA. IT IS THE BEST OF OUR STRENGTH, OUR COMPASSION, OUR SPIRIT. IT IS ALL BORN OF OUR UNIQUE DIVERSITIES AND PEOPLE. THE COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS. THE AAPI DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAN THE FLAMES OF HATETE. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO ATTACKS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR VISITING A LOCAL CHINATOWN BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO AGGRESSIVELY AND CHILDISHLY INSULTS ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTERS. THINK OF THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE. INSULTS AND ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTER FOR DOING HER JOB AND ASKING A DIRECT QUESTION. YOU DESERVE A PARTNER AND A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU DESERVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HALLS. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ALWAYS STOOD WITH THE AAPI COMMUNITY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IPHONE HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY , OBAMA AND I FOUGHT HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. SECURE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 2 MILLION ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE PROTECTED THOUSANDS OF AAPI DREAMERS GOING UP IN AMERICA. THE VERY PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE SAVING US, DOING THE JOBS AND RISKING LIVES. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR LONG OVERDUE , LONG OVERDUE COMPENSATION TO FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II. WE APPOINTED MAURYORE AAPI JUDGES TO THE BENCH THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS TRACKS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ENSURE OUR GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING MY CABINET. WE ARE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO DELIVER FOR THIS COMMUNITY ON HEALTH CARE, ON CLIMATE, ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRAGEDY ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE PAIN WE ALL KNOW FROM FAIRLY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS IS SO STARK. SO CONSUMING. IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PAIN. WE ARE GOING TO EMERGE FROM THIS MOMENT. WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BREATHTAKING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. TO TAKE THIS. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE DOCTORS, NURSES AND EMTS PUTTING THE LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND NY LOSING THEIR LIVES. A PUBLIC TRANSIT WORKER, GROCERY STORE CLERK CARRYING THE NATION ON THEIR B BACKS. ORDINARY AMERICANS SAYING, NO TO HATE, NO TO FEAR AND NO TO APATHY. REACHING OUT TO STRANGERS, CHECKING IN ON A FRIEND. WE CAN TAKE THAT SPIRIT. THE SOUL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REBUILD THE COUNTRY IN ITS IMAGE. THIS MOMENT CAN BE AND MUST BE A STIRRING REMINDER OF WHO WE ARE, OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY ABOUT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE WORLD AND TO PROVE TO OURSELVES WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF AT OUR BEST. TO FINALLY INVEST IN WORKERS. TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY. WE KNOW JUST HOW ESSENTIAL THEY TRULY ARE. TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE HAS A MYOPIC , AN OPPORTUNITY. MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TREATED WITH DEITY AND RESPECT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. WHETHER THERE IS A GUY SHINING THE SHOES OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOTEL CHAIN. WE HAVE A STRONG AND RESILIENT SAFETY NET WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT TO KEEP US GOING WHEN HARD TIMES HIT. I REVIEW RIGHT NOW MAY BE LIMITED BY THE BACKYARD IN THE BASEMENT AND THE SCENES OF OUR DEVICES, THAT I HOPE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I SEE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEPARATED PHYSICALLY, AND ENDURING DIFFICULT TIMES, I GIVE MY WORD I SEE A NATION GETTING READY TO COME TOGETHER. THE AAPI COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. OUR COMMUNITY AS A COUNTRY, OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH IS A COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. NOT BY THIS PANDEMIC, NOT BY ANYTHING. NOT AS LONG AS WE STAND UNITED. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. WE CAN COME OUT ON THE OTHERS MUCH STRONGER, MUCH KINDER, MUCH CLOSER. JUST MORE RESILIENT THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE. MCGREW, , REMEMBER, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TO GREAT CRISES AND AT THE END COME OUOUT STRONGER. WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF WE WORK TOGETHER. COME THIS NOVEMBER, WITH YOUR HELP IN THE HELP OF THE ENTIRE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY, WE ARE GOING TO PROVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE WHO CARRIED US ON OUR , ON THEIR BACK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. ORDINARY PEOPLE GETTING A CHANGE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS MOVEMENT. MAY GOD PORTRAY OUR TRUE , MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?472279-1/joe-biden-remarks-aapi-victory-fund-progressive-summit	Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, delivered remarks from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to the AAPI Victory Fund&rsquo;s 2020 Progressive Summit. The summit, being held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, was focused on the organization of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters; AAPI Victory Fund had endorsed Mr. Biden&rsquo;s campaign in January 2020. Mr. Biden criticized President Trump&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic, saying he should &ldquo;stop tweeting about&rdquo; helping affected small businesses and expedite aid to affected enterprises.	472279-1	Speech		
CSPANJB295202068	Joe Biden	2020-05-29	Joe Biden Remarks on Events in Minnesota	"AFTER THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WHO DIED AFTER BEING ARRESTED BY MINNEAPOLIS POLICE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SAYS AMERICANS NEED TO CONFRONT INSTITUTIONAL RACISM. HE MET WITH THE FLOYD FAMILY AND MADE THESE REMARKS SHORTLY AFTER THE OFFICER WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON THIRD AGREE MURDER CHARGES , THIRD DEGREE MURDER CHARGES. VICE PRES. BIDEN: I JUST HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE FLOYD FAMILY. MOST OF THEM. THEY ARE A CLOSE, DECENT, HONORABLE FAMILY, LOVING ONE ANOTHER. ONCE AGAIN, WE HEARD THE WORDS ""I CAN'T BREATHE."" AN ACT OF BRUTALITY SO ELEMENTAL THAT IT DID NOT DENY ONE MORE BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS, IT DENIED HIM OF HIS LIFE. IT DEPRIVED GEORGE FLOYD AS IT DEPRIVED ERIC GARNER, ONE OF THE THINGS EVERY HUMAN BEING MUST BE ABLE TO DO, BRIEF. SO SIMPLE, SO BASIC, SO BRUTAL. THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH BREONNA TAYLOR, AHMAUD ARBERY. WE HAVE SPOKEN THEIR NAMES ALOUD. WE CRIED THEM OUT IN PAIN AND HORROR. WE TURNED INTO A LONG, SUFFERING CHORUS. IT IS THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE ENDLESS LIST, A LIST THAT DATES BACK MORE THAN 400 YEARS, BLACK MEN, BLACK WOMEN, BLACK CHILDREN. THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THIS COUNTRY STILL STAINS OUR NATION TODAY, AND SOMETIMES WE MANAGE TO OVERLOOK IT. WE PUSH FORWARD WITH A THOUSAND OTHER TASKS IN OUR DAILY LIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS THERE. IN WEEKS LIKE THIS, WE SEE IT PLAINLY, THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH AN OPEN WOUND. NONE OF US CAN BE SILENT. NONE OF US CAN ANY LONGER HEAR THE WORDS ""I CAN'T BREATHE"" AND DO NOTHING. WE CAN'T FAIL VICTIMS LIKE WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING CALLED THE APPALLING SILENCE OF GOOD PEOPLE. EVERY DAY, AFRICAN-AMERICANS GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITH THE CONSTANT ANXIETY. IMAGINE IF EVERY TIME YOUR HUSBAND OR SON, WIFE OR DAUGHTER LEFT THE HOUSE, YOU FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY FROM BAD ACTORS AND BAD POLICE. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO HAVE THAT TALK WITH YOUR CHILD ABOUT NOT ASSERTING YOUR RIGHTS, TAKING THE ABUSE IMAGINE HAVING POLICE CALL ON YOU, SITTING IN STARBUCKS OR RENTING AN AIRBNB OR WATCHING BIRDS. THIS IS THE NORM BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY DEAL WITH. THEY DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE IT. THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND EXHAUSTION IS UNDENIABLE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE MADE THE PROMISE OF THIS NATION REAL FOR ALL PEOPLE. THIS IS NO TIME FOR INCENDIARY TWEETS. NO TIME TO ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE. THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS, WE NEED REAL LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP THAT WILL BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE SO WE CAN TAKE MEASURES, ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM. IT IS TIME TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS, IT IS TIME FOR US TO FACE THAT DEEP, OPEN WOUND WE HAVE IN THIS NATION. WE NEED JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD. WE NEED REAL POLICE REFORM, HOLD COPS TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAT SO , THAT HOLD BAD COPS ACCOUNTABLE. THAT REPAIRS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT. WE NEED TO STAND UP AS A NATION WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY, WITH ALL MINORITY COMMUNITIES, AND COME TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE FACE. IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE THOSE OF US WHO SIT IN SOME POSITION OF INFLUENCE TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER, THE PAIN IS TOO IMMENSE FOR ONE COMMUNITY TO BEAR ALONE. I BELIEVE IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY AMERICAN TO GRAPPLE WITH IT AND GRAPPLE WITH IT NOW. WITH OUR COMPLACENCY, OUR SILENCE, WE ARE COMPLICIT IN PERPETUATING THESE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE. NOTHING ABOUT THIS WILL BE EASY OR COMFORTABLE. IF WE ALLOW THIS WOUND TO SCABBED OVER ONCE MORE WITHOUT TREATING THE UNDERLYING INDUSTRY , INJURY, WE WILL NEVER TRULY HEAL. THE VERY SOUL OF AMERICA IS AT STAKE. WE MUST COMMIT AS A NATION TO PURSUE JUSTICE WITH EVERY OUNCE OF OUR BEING, WE HAVE TO PURSUE IT WITH REAL URGENCY. WE HAVE TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF AMERICA, WHICH IT NEVER FULLY GRASPED, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL. NOT ONLY IN CREATION, BUT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. TO GEORGE'S FAMILY, INC. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO ME. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SEE TO IT THAT JUSTICE IS HAD AND YOUR BROTHER, COUSIN , FOLKS, WE HAVE TO STAND UP. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE. GOT TO CHANGE.

THIS IS JUST OVER 20 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, THANKS FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY, AND TO ALL THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE HERE, I BRING YOU GREETINGS. I CAN'T BREATHE. I CAN'T BREATHE. GEORGE FLOYD'S LAST WORDS, BUT IT DIDN'T DIE WITH THEM, ARE STILL BEING HEARD ECHOING ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE TOO OFTEN JUST THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO VIOLENCE, 40 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT WITH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THOSE DEATHS AND JOB LOSSES CONCENTRATED IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE EVERY DAY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, AND MILLIONS, NOT A MOMENT OF LOSING THE LIGHT BUT IN THE COURSE OF LIVING THE LIFE ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES, I CAN'T BREATHE. IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL TO OUR NATION IN MY VIEW. IT'S FOR ALL OF US, AND I MEAN ALL OF US. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD THOSE WORDS. THEY ARE THE SAME WORDS WE HEARD FROM ERIC GARNER WHEN HIS LIFE WAS TAKEN AWAY SIX YEARS AGO. BUT IT'S TIME TO LISTEN TO THOSE WORDS COME TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM, TO RESPOND TO THEM, RESPOND WITH ACTION. THEY COUNTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP BACK TONIGHT AS COME LEADERSHIP THAT BRINGS US TOGETHER. LEADERSHIP THAT CAN RECOGNIZE PAIN AND DEEP GRIEF OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAD A KNEE ON THEIR FOR A LONG TIME. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE, NO PLACE FOR LOOTING OR DESTROYING PROPERTY OR BURNING CHURCHES OR DESTROYING BUSINESSES. MANY OF THEM BY THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO IN THE FIRST TIME THE LIGHTS WERE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS AND BUILD WEALTH FOR THE PHILLIES. NOR IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR OUR POLICE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE ALL PEOPLE TO RESORT TO EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE. WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LEGITIMATE PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND OPPORTUNITIES VIOLENT DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT'S BEING DONE BY THIS INCUMBENT PRESIDENT TO OUR ECONOMY INTO THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. WHEN PEACEFUL PROTESTERS DISPERSED IN ORDER FOR PRESIDENT, A PRESIDENT, FROM THE DOORSTEP OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, THE WHITE HOUSE, USING TEAR GAS AND FLASH GRENADES IN ORDER TO STAGE A PHOTO OP, A PHOTO OP AMONG ONE OF THE MOST RESTORATIVE CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, RELEASE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WE CAN BE FORGIVEN FOR BELIEVING THE PRESENT IS MORE INTERESTED IN POWER THAN IN PRINCIPLE. JUST SERVING THE PASSIONS OF HIS BASE AND THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS CARE. FOR THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENCY IS, THE DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR ALL OF US, NOT JUST THOSE WHO VOTE FOR US BUT ALL OF US. NOT JUST OUR DONORS, BUT ALL OF US. THE PRESIDENT HELD UP THE BIBLE AT ST. JOHN'S CHURCH YESTERDAY. I JUST WISH HE OPENED IT ONCE IN A WHILE INSTEAD OF BRANDISHING IT. HE OPENED IT HE COULD'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. THEY ARE ALL CALLED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER THROUGH LOVE OURSELVES BUT IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD WORK BUT IT'S A WORK OF AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP ISN'T INTERESTED IN DOING THAT WORK. INSTEAD HE'S SWEEPING AWAY ALL THE GUARDRAILS THAT PAUL PROTECTED OUR DEMOCRACY, GUARDRAILS THAT HAVE HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE THIS NATION'S PATH TO A MORE PERFECT UNION. A UNION THAT CONSTANTLY REQUIRES REFORM AND REDEDICATION, AND YES, THE PROTESTS FROM VOICES THAT ARE MISTREATED, IGNORED, LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. BUT IT IS A UNION, A UNION WORTH FIGHTING FOR, , AND THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. IN ADDITION TO THE BIBLE, PRESIDENT MIGHT ALSO WANT TO OPEN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION ONCE IN A WHILE. IF HE DID HE WOULD FIND A THING CALLED THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND WHAT IT SAYS IN THE BEGINNING, IT SAYS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE, AND TO PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. THAT'S KIND OF A SENSIBLE NOTION, BUILT INTO THIS COUNTRY. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT'S AMERICA. THAT'S AMERICA. NO HORSES RISING UP ON THEIR ON THE HIND LEGS TO PUSH BACK PEACEFUL PROTESTS, NOT USING THE AMERICAN MILITARY TO MOVE AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A NATION OF VALUES. OUR FREEDOM TO SPEAK AS THEY CHERISHED KNOWLEDGE THAT LIVES INSIDE OF THE AMERICAN ALMOST FROM THE TIME YOU ARE A KID. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED ANY PRESIDENT TO QUITE OUR VOICE. WE WILL NOT LET THOSE WHO SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOW CHAOS, THREW UP A SMOKESCREEN, TO DISTRACT US FROM THE REAL LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES AT THE HEART OF THESE PROTESTS. WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS MOMENT. WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS MOMENT THINKING THAT WE CAN ONCE AGAIN TURN AWAY AND DO NOTHING. WE CAN'T DO THAT THIS TIME. WE JUST CAN'T. THE MOMENT HAS COME FOR OUR NATION TO DEAL WITH SYSTEMIC RACISM, TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING ECONOMIC INEQUITY THAT EXISTS IN OUR NATION, TO DEAL WITH THE DENIAL OF A PROMISE OF THIS NATION, MAY 2 SO MANY. YOU KNOW, , I SAID FROM THE OUTSET OF THIS ELECTION THAT WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION, AND WE ARE IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WHAT WE BELIEVE, MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT WE WANT TO BE, IT'S ALL AT STAKE. THAT'S TRUER TODAY THAN IT IS EVER BEEN AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME. AND IT'S THIS URGENCY, IT'S IN THIS URGENCY, WE CAN FIND A PATH FORWARD. NOW, THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION TEACHES US THAT IN SOME OF OUR DARKEST MOMENTS OF DESPAIR WE MADE SOME OF HER GREATEST PROGRESS, SOME OF OUR DARKEST MOMENTS, , THE 13th, 14th, 15th AMENDMENTS FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR. THE GREATEST ECONOMIC GROWTH IN WORLD HISTORY GREW OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1864 AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 65, CAME IN THE TRACKS OF BULL CONNORS ATTACKS A VICIOUS DOG. TO PARAPHRASE, IT'S THE MORNING WE FIND HOPE. IT'S IN THE MORNING WE FIND HOPE WHEN WE MOURN. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN TALK. WE HAD TALKED BEFORE. WE HAVE PROTESTS BEFORE. WE GOT TO NOW ABOUT TO MAKE IT'S AT LEAST AN ERA OF ACTION AND REVERSED THE SYSTEMIC RACISM WITH A LONG OVERDUE CONCRETE CHANGES. THE ACTION WILL NOT BE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY AND FIND FORTUNE TO HAVE TO BE ELECTED, OR EVEN IN MY ENTIRE TERM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE WORK OF A GENERATION, BUT THIS AGENDA WILL TAKE TIME TO COMPLETE, IT SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY TO GET STARTED. A DOWN PAYMENT ON WHAT IS LONG OVERDUE SHOULD COME NOW, SHOULD COME IMMEDIATELY. I CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO ACT THIS MONTH ON MEASURES THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION, STARTING WITH REAL POLICE REFORM. CONGRESSMAN JEFFRIES HAS A BILL TO OUTLAW CHOKE HOLDS. CONGRESS SHOULD PUT IT ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK IS THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES TO STOP TRANSFERRING WEAPONS ABORTIVE POLICE FORCES COME TO CREATE A MODEL USE OF FORCE STANDARD. THAT ALSO SHOULD BE MADE LAW THIS MONTH. NO MORE EXCUSES, NO DELAYS. IF MITCH McCONNELL CAN BREAK INTO THE TRADED SET IT TO CONFIRM TRUMP'S UNQUALIFIED JUDICIAL NOMINEE WHO WILL RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER OUR CONSTITUTION NOW, IT'S TIME TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WILL GIVE TOO MANY TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL PROMISE EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER LAW. LOOKING HIT IN THE FIRST ONE DEBATES ONE OF DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY I'VE COMMITTED TO GREAT AND OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONER COMMISSION. LONGLEAF WE NEED REAL COMMUNITY POLICING. WE NEED EACH AND EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY UNDERSTAND A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF, OF THEIR HIRING, TRAINING, DE-ESCALATION. SOME HAVE ALREADY DONE AND SOME ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE, GIVE THE CITY ESTATES THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS. MORE POLICE OFFICERS MEET THE HIGHER STANDARD OF THEIR , MOST OF THEM DO IT. ALL THE MARS REASON WHY BAD COP SHOULD BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY AND SWIFTLY. WE ALL NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE CULTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SENSELESS TRAGEDY THAT KEEP HAPPENING. WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE CITY'S AND THE PRECINCTS THAT ARE GETTING IT RIGHT. WE KNOW THOUGH IN ORDER TO HAVE TRUE AMERICAN JUSTICE WE DID ECONOMIC JUSTICE AS WELL. HERE, TOO, THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE. AS AN IMMEDIATE STEPS CONGRESS SHOULD ACT, , SHOULD ACT NOW TO RECTIFY RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT ALLOW COVID-19 RECOVERY FUNDS TO BE DIVERTED FROM WHERE THEY LIVE. I'LL BE SETTING FORTH MY AGENDA ON ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD, BUT IT BEGINS WITH HEALTHCARE. HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE, AND THE QUICKEST ROUTE TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO EXPAND ON OBAMACARE. WE CAN DO IT. WE SHOULD DO IT. BUT THIS PRESIDENT, EVEN NOW, IN THE MIDST OF A A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WITH MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT AS WELL WANTS TO DESTROY IT. HE DOESN'T CARE HOW MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE HURT BECAUSE HE CONSUMED WITH HIS BLINDING EGO WHEN IT COMES TO BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD WITHDRAW HIS LAWSUIT TO STRIKE AND OBAMACARE AND THE SHOULD PREPARE TO PASS THE ACT I PROPOSE TO EXPAND OBAMACARE TO MILLIONS MORE SO EVERYONE IS COVERED. THESE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE SEEN AMERICA'S TRUE HEROES. HEALTHCARE WORKERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVERS, GROCERY STORE WORKERS. WE'VE COME UP WITH A NEW PHRASE FOR THEM, ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN PRAISE OF THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM. BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT CLEAR BEFORE, IT'S CLEAR NOW. THIS COUNTRY WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOs. IT WAS BUILT BY THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS WHICH IS BUILT BY UNIONS AND ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I KNOW THERE'S A MOMENT OF UNCERTAINTY AND ANGER IN THE COUNTRY. I UNDERSTAND. I KNOW SO MANY AMERICANS ARE SUFFERING, SUFFERING THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE, SUFFERING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, WONDERING HOW THEY FEED MY FAMILY TOMORROW. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? SUFFERING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A GENERATION AFTER GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF HURT INFLICTED ON PEOPLE OF COLOR, LACK, BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. LIKE MANY OF YOU I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO GRIEVE. MY LOSSES ARE NOT THE SAME AS LOSSES FELT BY SO MANY, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN'T GO ON. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THAT BLACK HOLE IN YOUR CHEST WERE YOUR GRIEF IS BEING SUCKED INTO IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO MARKED THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF MY SONS PASSING. OF CANCER. THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS WHEN THE PAIN IS SO GREAT IT FEELS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE DAY I SAT IN THAT BED AS HE PASSED AWAY. BUT ALSO KNOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO BEAR LOSS IN PAIN IS TO TURN IT INTO THAT ANGER AND ANGUISH AND TO PURPOSE. AND AMERICANS KNOW WHAT OUR PURPOSE IS AS A NATION. IT HAS TO BE GUIDED, HAS TO BE GUIDED. IT'S GUIDED US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IT'S BEEN REPORTED TODAY THAT PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED, YOLANDA KING CAME FROM SCHOOL AND JUMPED INTO HER DADDIES ARMS AND SAID OH, DADDY, SHE SAID, NOW WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUR FREEDOM. HER DADDY WAS REASSURING, STRONG AND BRAVE. HE SAID NO, DON'T WORRY, BABY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. AMID THE VIOLENCE AND FEAR, DR. KING PERSEVERED. HE WAS DRIVEN BY HIS DREAM OF A NATION WHERE JUSTICE RUNS DOWN LIKE WATER AND RUSHES LIKE A MIGHTY STREAM. THEN IN 1968, HATE CUTTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS. A FEW DAYS BEFORE DR. KING WAS MURDERED, HE GAVE A FINAL SUNDAY SERMON IN WASHINGTON. WHERE HE TOLD US THAT THE ARK OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG, HE SAID THAT BEN'S TOWARDS JUSTICE. AND WE KNOW WE CAN BEND IT BECAUSE WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT STILL. THAT'S OUR PURPOSE. IT'S BEEN OUR PURPOSE SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. TO BECOME A NATION WHERE ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT ONLY CREATING BUT THEY ARE TREATED EQUALLY. NOT JUST CREATED EQUAL, BUT TREATED EQUALLY. TO BECOME A NATION DEFINED IN DR. KING'S WORDS NOT ONLY WRITE ABSENCE OF TENSION BUT BY THE PRESENCE OF JUSTICE, NOT JUST ATTENTION BUT JUSTICE. TODAY IN AMERICA IT'S HARD TO KEEP FAITH. I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT YOUR PAIN IS WRONG. THE PAIN IS REAL. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION, NOT THE PROBLEM. BUT THIS PRESIDENT TODAY IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND ACCELERATES IT. WHEN HE TREATED THE WORDS WHEN THE LOOTING STARTS, THE SHOOTING STARTS, THEY WEREN'T THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE WORDS OF A RACIST MIAMI POLICE CHIEF IN THE '60s. WHEN HE TWEETED THAT PROTESTERS QUOTE, WOULD HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH THE MOST VICIOUS DOGS, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT, END OF QUOTE, THOSE WERE NOT THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE THE KIND OF WORDS BULL CONNOR WHAT IT USED UNLEASHING HIS DOGS ON INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN STORY IS A STORY ABOUT ACTION AND REACTION. THAT'S HOW HISTORY WORKS. WE CAN'T BE NAIVE ABOUT IT. I WISH I COULD SAY THAT HATE BEGAN WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WILL END WITH HIM. IT DIDN'T AND IT WON'T. AMERICAN HISTORY IS IN A FAIRYTALE WITH A GUARANTEED HAPPY ENDING. THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PUSH AND PULL MORE THAN 240 YEARS, A TUG-OF-WAR BETWEEN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT WE ARE ALL GREATER EQUAL, THE HARSH REALITY THAT RACISM HAS LONG TOWARD US APART. THE HONEST TRUTH IS THAT BOTH ELEMENTS ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. BOTH ELEMENTS. AT OUR BEST THE AMERICAN IDEAL WINS OUT, BUT IT'S NEVER A ROUTE. IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT, AND THE BATTLE IS NEVER FULLY ONE. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE TRUTH THAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST WOULD OPEN OUR HEARTS RATHER THAN CLINCHED OUR FISTS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TURNED THIS COUNTRY INTO A BATTLEFIELD DRIVEN BY OLD RESENTMENTS AND FRESH TEARS. HE THINKS THE VISION HELPS HIM. HIS NARCISSISM HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NATION'S WELL-BEING THAT HE LEADS. I ASK EVERY AMERICAN, I MEAN JUST FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I ASK OF THE AMERICAN LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE NOW IN THINK ANEW. IS THIS WHO WE ARE? IS THIS WHO WE WANT TO BE? IS THIS WHAT WE WANT TO PASS ONTO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN? FEAR, ANGER, FINGER-POINTING RATHER THAN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, INCOMPETENCE AND ANXIETY, SELF ABSORPTION, SELFISHNESS? OR DO WE WANT TO BE THE AMERICA WE KNOW WE CAN BE? THE AMERICA WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS WE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE. LOOK, I LOOK AT THE PRESIDENCY AS A VERY GOOD JOB, AND NOBODY WILL GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME. AND I WON'T EITHER, BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS, I WON'T FAN THE FLAMES OF HATE. I'LL SEEK TO HEAL THE RACIAL WOUNDS THAT HAVE LONG PLAGUED OUR COUNTRY, NOT USE THEM FOR POLITICAL GAIN. I'LL DO MY JOB AND I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I WON'T BLAME OTHERS. I'LL NEVER FORGET, I WILL NEVER FORGET, I PROMISE YOU, THIS JOB IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT US. THE WORK NOW DON'T REBUILD THE NATION, BUT TO BUILD A BETTER THAN IT WAS WHERE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT GOES THE CRISIS AND COMES OUT BETTER. TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE, THAT'S WHAT AMERICA DOES, TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. WE BUILD THE FUTURE. IT MAY, IN FACT, BE THE MOST AMERICAN THING TO DO, BUILD THE FUTURE. WE HUNGER FOR LIBERTY THE WAY HARRY TUBMAN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS DID. WE THIRST FOR THE VOTE LIKE SUSAN B. ANTHONY AND ELLA BAKER AND JOHN LEWIS DID. WE STRIVE TO EXPLORE THE STARS, CURE DISEASE, MAKE AN IMPERFECT UNION MORE PERFECT THAN IT'S BEEN. WE MAY COME UP SHORT, BUT AT OUR BEST WE TRY. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE FACING A FORMIDABLE ENEMIES. THEY INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE TOTAL IMPACT AND THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS, ALSO THE SELFISHNESS AND FEAR THAT IF LOOMED OVER OUR NATIONAL LIFE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. I CHOOSE THOSE WORDS WISELY, SELFISHNESS AND FEAR. IF HE DOES ENEMIES REQUIRES US TO DO OUR DUTY, AND THAT DUTY INCLUDES REMEMBERING WHO WE SHOULD BE, WHO WE SHOULD BE. WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA OF FDR AND EISENHOWER, OF ROSA PARKS AND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., OF JONAS SALK AND NEIL ARMSTRONG. WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA THAT CHERISHES LIFE, LIBERTY AND COURAGE. AND ABOVE ALL, WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA THAT CHERISHES EACH OTHER, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. YOU KNOW, WE'RE A NATION OF PAIN. WE MUST NOT LET OUR PAIN AND DESTROY US. WE A NATION ENRAGED BUT WE CANNOT LET OUR RAGE CONSUME US. WE'RE A NATION THAT IS EXHAUSTED, BUT WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR EXHAUSTION TO DEFEAT US.

Mr. Biden said the protests were the result of years of systematic racism in the U.S. which needed to be addressed. He also called on those destroying property to cease, saying such destruction was distracting from the central goals of the protesters. During his remarks, Mr. Biden also critiqued President Trump&rsquo;s handling of the protests in the nation&rsquo;s capital, and called on Congress to immediately start acting on ways to address racial inequities in law enforcement.	472687-1	Speech

WATCH COVERAGE AT 4:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN, AT C-SPAN.ORG, OR LISTEN WITH THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING DR. ALLEN, A RESIDENT OF DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY, ONE OF THE GREAT HBCUS IN THE COUNTRY, FOR ACCOMMODATING US. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK ON CAMPUS. I WISH IT WAS A MORE CELEBRATORY OCCASION. BEFORE I SPEAK TO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, I HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS MORNING. FOR THE END OF HIS REMARKS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE HOPES THAT GEORGE FLOYD IS LOOKING DOWN AND SEEING THIS AS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE SPEAKING OF A MAN WHO WAS BRUTALLY KILLED BY AN ACT OF NEEDLESS VIOLENCE AND BY A LARGER TIDE OF INJUSTICE THAT HAS METASTASIZED ON THIS PRESIDENT'S WATCH AS HE HAS MOVED IS BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY. GEORGE FLOYD'S LAST WORDS, I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T BREATHE, HAVE ECHOED ACROSS THIS NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO PUT ANY OTHER WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF GEORGE FLOYD, I THINK IS DESPICABLE. THE FACT THAT HE DID SO ON THE DATE WHEN BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE, HISPANIC ON A LIMIT ROSE, BLACK YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT SKYROCKETED TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MAN AND WHAT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT. TODAY, LIKE ALL AMERICANS, I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE GOTTEN THEIR JOBS BACK. FOR THOSE FAMILIES, THAT IS A SIGH OF RELIEF. FOR ALL THOSE OF US, IT REMINDS US OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO THOSE AMERICANS, I'M PROUD OF YOU, HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. I WAS DISTURBED HOWEVER, TO CD THE PRESIDENT PROBING THIS MORNING, BASICALLY HANGING A MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BANNER OUT THERE, WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE, SO MANY AMERICANS ARE STILL HURTING. MORE THAN 20 MILLION AMERICANS, ONE OF EVERY SEVEN U.S. WORKERS IS OUT OF WORK. FOR AN HONEST SWATH OF OUR COUNTRY, THEIR DREAMS ARE ON HOLD AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW, CAN I PAY MY RENT? WILL I BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN MY MORTGAGE PAYMENT? THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAINS THE HIGHEST IT HAS BEEN IN NEARLY A CENTURY. AS I SAID, LIKE EMPLOYMENT WENT UP THIS MONTH. LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT JUMPED TO OVER 37%. HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT BOTCHED HIS RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND I'M WORRIED. WHEN YOU LOOK DEEPER INTO THE DATA, WHILE TEMPORARY LAYOFFS WENT DOWN, PERMANENT LAYOFFS WENT UP. DONALD TRUMP STILL DOES NOT GET IT. HE IS SPIKING THE BALL, COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING THE GREATEST STRUGGLE OF THEIR LIVES. THESE FOLKS ARE NOT FEELING ANY LESS PAIN TODAY THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY. PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE IN THE CRISIS, THEY ARE NOT CELEBRATING. ESPECIALLY WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS STILL GOING TO FEDERAL COURT, FIGHTING TO STRIP AWAY THE HEALTH CARE PROTECTIONS FOR MORE AMERICANS. THE FACT IS, ABOUT 13 MILLION FEWER JOBS TODAY FOR AMERICAN WORKERS THAN THE DAY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I LEFT OFFICE. WHILE IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE 10% OF THE FAMILIES WHO LOST THEIR JOBS DUE TO TRUMPS PANDEMIC RESPONSE START TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK, THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR MAKES ME WORRIED FOR THE 90% YOU HAVEN'T. ALL THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE SCARED, WHO ARE FRIGHTENED, HURTING, WERE WONDERING, BUT IT'S WHEN YOU HAPPEN NEXT? I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I AND A LOT OF OTHERS SEE YOU, WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU. I WANT TO BE SATISFIED UNTIL THIS COUNTRY STARTS WORKING FOR EVERYONE. WHICH IS NOT NOW. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. THE DEPTH OF THIS JOB CRISIS IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN ACT OF GOD, BUT TO A FAILURE OF A PRESIDENT. THE TRUTH IS, EVERY COUNTRY DEALT WITH THEIR JOB LOSSES DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC, BUT AMERICA WAS HIT MUCH HARDER, OUT OF THE GATE, DUE TO THE INCOMPETENCE AND MISMANAGEMENT OF THE RESPONSE. THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO COMPARE THE RESPONSE OF GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA , OK, LET'S COMPARE. GERMANY HAS ONE THIRD OF THE DEATHS PER CAPITA THAN WE DO. SOUTH KOREA HAS LESS THAN 300 DEATHS TOTAL. AMERICA HAS 4% OF THE WORLD POPULATION. AND A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S DEATH DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. 4% OF THE POPULATION, A QUARTER OF THE DEATHS. IT IS NO SECRET WHY. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ACT QUICKLY WHEN HE WAS WARNED TO ACT, WHEN HE WAS , EVEN WHEN HIS OWN TEAM TALKED ABOUT ENACTING. FOUR MONTHS, HE DOWNPLAYED THE THREAT, FALSELY PROMISING THAT EVERY THINK WAS GOING TO , EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO GET A TEST, CLAIMING THAT, LIKE AMERICA, THIS WILL DISAPPEAR. HE REPEATEDLY PRAISED CHINA'S CONTAINMENT RESPONSE, DESPITE PUBLIC APPEALS FROM MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING BE IN JANUARY, NOT TO LET AMERICAN LIVES AND THE U.S. ECONOMY HANG ON HIS CONFIDENCE TO THE CHINESE CONFIDENT , HIS CONFIDENCE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WAS BEING TRUTHFUL. HE REFUSED TO TAKE ACTION TO GET ADEQUATE TESTING IN PLACE, ALLOWING THE VIRUS TO SPREAD FURTHER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT 54,000 AMERICANS WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY, LIVES SAVED, IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD ACTED TWO WEEKS EARLIER. THIS FAILURE DID NOT JUST BECAUSE LIVES. IT COSTS JOBS. NEW STUDIES FROM MOODY'S AND BROOKINGS CONFIRM THAT HALF OR MORE OF THOSE WHO BOUGHT THEIR JOB WOULD STILL BE EMPLOYED HAD DONALD TRUMP HAD A COMPETENT RESPONSE LIKE GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA AND OTHER COUNTRIES DID. WE KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED. DONALD TRUMP WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THE STOCK WEALTH OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS THAT HE WAS ON THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY HE AND HIS TOP ECONOMIC ADVISERS ARE TELLING PEOPLE, I STOCKS, AND SET PREPARING OUR NATION TO BRACE FOR THIS PANDEMIC. AFTER 110,000 AMERICAN DEATHS, MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CLEAR. WE ARE FACING DEVASTATING UNEMPLOYMENT AND A HISTORIC HEALTH CRISIS. A CONTINUING CRISIS OF VIOLENCE AND INDIGNITY, THAT HAS DEVASTATED BLACK AMERICANS, MANY LATINOS, WE ARE LOSING THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. SOME OF THE STARTED CHALLENGES OUR NATION HAS EVER FACED, AND DONALD TRUMP IS PATTING HIMSELF ON THE BACK. HE HAS NO IDEA, IN MY VIEW, WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. HE HAS NO IDEA BE DEPTH OF THE PAIN THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ENDURING. HE REMAINS OBLIVIOUS TO THE HUMAN TOLL OF HIS INDIFFERENCE. IT IS TIME FOR HIM TO STOP OUT OF HIS BUNKER, TAKE A LOOK AROUND AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS. LET'S BE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT WHO TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THEIR JOBS DESERVES NO CREDIT WHEN A FRACTION OF THEM RETURN. BUT THERE IS A DEEPER CONCERN HERE. AS WE RECOVER, SOME OF THE TEMPORARY JOB LOSSES ARE STILL NOT ON TRACK TO GO BACK IN A WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY REALLY SERVE WORKING PEOPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL REWARDING WEALTH OVER WORK. I'LL BE HERE COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLS FOR MORE TAX CUTS, BIG INVESTORS, A CORPORATIONS, WHEN THEY DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHO I FIGHT FOR. IF TRUMP CONTINUES TO PUT THE INTEREST OF CEOS AND SHAREHOLDERS AHEAD OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, WE WILL NEVER GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY. EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE IN NOVEMBER, NOT SIMPLY TO WHO THEY WILL HAVE AS A PRESIDENT OR SENATOR OR CONGRESSPEOPLE, BUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE? WHAT KIND OF ECONOMY TO BE WANT? AND WHO WILL IT SERVE? IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN I HAVE DEVELOPED FOR MY PLAN NOT JUST TO BUILD BACK THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE COVID-19, BUT TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER. IT WAS ALREADY HURTING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. A PLAN TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH BENEFITS WHERE PEOPLE GET A FAIR RETURN ON WORK, MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER, MORE JUST. AS YOU WILL SEE, THAT PLAN IS CRATING INVESTMENTS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTING IN INNOVATION, MANUFACTURING, CAREGIVING, AND REWIRING THE FAULTY STRUCTURES OF OUR ECONOMY TO ENSURE THE DIGNITY AND EQUALITY FOR ALL AMERICAN WORKERS. THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, A JOB CRISIS, A CRISIS OF INEQUITY BEING ENTERED BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. THOSE THREE CHALLENGES ALONE ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER. THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED AS WELL. ANY ECONOMIC PLAN MUST START WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN TO ENSURE TESTS ARE AVAILABLE AND TRACING. TO BUILD BACK THE CONFIDENCE WE NEED TO BRING BACK JOBS IN SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. MY JOB PLAN TALKS ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY TO AMERICAN PEOPLE IN ADDITION TO PURSUING NEEDED REFORMS, WE NEED TO GROW WAGES, LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, CREATE TENS OF MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS TO BUILD A BETTER AMERICAN FUTURE. THERE IS A MONUMENTAL AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE INSTANTLY TWEETING SLOGANS LIKE TRANSITION TO GREATNESS WILL SOLVE ANYTHING FOR THE FAMILIES WHO ARE HURTING AND WONDERING, WHERE DO I GO NEXT? I LOOK FORWARD TO INTRODUCING , I WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE IT HAD WE NOT HAD THE DEATH , TORTA NOT BEEN HELD UP AGAINST THAT CURB, I WOULD PLAN ON INTRODUCING IT EARLIER, BUT I WILL INTRODUCE IT QUICKLY, IMPLEMENTING REAL JOB PLAN THAT WILL CREATE AND MEET THIS MORMON , THIS MOMENT. AMERICANS CANNOT AFFORD TO MORE TIME WASTED. THEY NEED AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR THEM AND THEY NEED IT NOW. THEY NEED JOBS THAT BRING DIGNITY AND NEED IT NOW. THEY NEED EQUAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NOW. THEY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM, WHO CARES ABOUT HELPING THEM HEAL NOW. I CAN'T WAIT. THE RESPONSE OF SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING MANY OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, FORMER MILITARY COMMANDERS, ETC. IS CRYING OUT. WE NEED JUSTICE, OPPORTUNITY, AND HOPE. I HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE GIVE THEM HAVE A CHANCE, THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN'T DO. WE NEED TO UNITE AS ONE NATION, WHEN WE HAVE, WE HAVE NEVER FAILED. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE US AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

COMING UP FRIDAY MORNING, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER BERNARD KERIK ON EFFORTS TO REFORM POLICING IN THE U.S. AND REVEREND HARRIS, CO CHAIR OF THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN TALKS ABOUT RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE AND THE ROLE CLERGY PLAY IN THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. WATCH C-SPAN'S ""WASHINGTON JOURNAL"" LIVE AT 7:00 EASTERN FRIDAY MORNING, AND BE SURE TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT MESSAGES AND TWEETS. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TALKED ABOUT REOPENING THE ECONOMY. HE CALLED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONGRESS TO EXTEND SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND TO CREATE MORE ACCESS TO TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING. HE SPOKE IN DARBY, PENNSYLVANIA, AFTER MEETING WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SLIGHT DELAY. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS ABLE TO GET HERE. LET ME THANK THE LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR JOINING TODAY. I KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO, AND THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN VERY VERY BUSY. BEFORE I BEGIN MY REMARKS, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY WHEN A WHITE SUPREMACIST WALKED INTO MOTHER EMANUEL CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND SLAUGHTERED A FRIEND OF MINE, CLEMENTE PINCKNEY AND EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS. IT WAS A HATE UNBRIDLED, AND IT WAS POISONOUS, A POISONOUS EXPRESSION OF WHITE SUPREMACY THAT STILL AFFECTS OUR NATION AND MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND ON THE DANGERS WE FACE AS A SOCIETY IF WE DON'T ROOT OUT THIS CORROSIVE AND DEADLY IDEOLOGY. I REFLECT ON THE AMAZING GRACE, COMPASSION, AND THE FORGIVENESS OF THE MOTHER EMANUEL COMMUNITY. I SEE THE VERY BEST IN WHAT WE SEE IN AMERICA, AS AMERICANS. BUT WE KNOW THAT GRACE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO PUT IT TO WORK, THAT GRACE. WE'RE SEEING THE BEST OF AMERICA IN THAT AS WELL. IN THE WEEKS OF PEACEFUL PROTESTS, CIVIL ACTIONS TAKING PLACE, IN CITIES AND TOWNS OF EVERY SIZE, IN THIS STATE AND OVER OTHER STATE ACROSS THE , AND EVERY OTHER STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE KEEPING THEIR EYES FOCUSED ON HOW MUCH DANGER IT IS TO LIVE A LIFE OF A BLACK OR A BROWN-SKINNED PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. AMERICANS ARE OUT THERE MARCHING, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. THAT'S HOW CRITICAL THEY THINK IT IS. ON MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID QUOTE IF WE STOPPED TESTING RIGHT NOW, FOR COVID-19, WE'D HAVE VERY FEW CASES, IF ANY. IF WE STOPPED TESTING NOW, WE WOULD HAVE VERY FEW CASES, IF ANY. IT'S A STATEMENT THAT'S NOT ONLY ABSURD, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC. YESTERDAY THE HEAD OF THE WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON CORONAVIRUS, THE VICE PRESIDENT, CLAIMED SUCCESS IN THE FIGHT BECAUSE DEATHS ARE QUOTE DOWN TO FEWER THAN 750 A DAY. 750 FATHERS, MOTHERS, SISTERS, BROTHERS, UNCLES, AUNTS, HUSBANDS, WIVES, CHILDREN, DYING EVERY DAY. MORE THAN 20,000 A MONTH. THAT'S GREATER THAN WORLD WAR II LEVEL CASUALTIES EACH MONTH. THAT'S MORE THAN FIVE 9/11S EACH MONTH. AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGING IN SELF-CONGRATULATIONS? IT MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP. BUT IT WILL NEVER EVER BE ACCEPTABLE IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT. RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAVE DIED NEEDLESSLY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WAS SLOW TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS, AND THEN WHEN HE DID, HE BUNGLED THE RESPONSE. FOR WEEKS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, I WAS RAISING MY CONCERNS ON HOW WE NEED TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY. ALL WHILE TRUMP WAS IGNORING THE REPORTING FROM HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN HIS DAILY BRIEFINGS. AND THE WARNINGS OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISORS, ALL THE WHILE PRAISING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FOR BEING TRANSPARENT IN HANDLING THIS VIRUS, INSTEAD OF DEMANDING ACCESS FOR THE CDC THAT BEIJING WAS REFUSING TO GIVE IN WUHAN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SACRIFICE SO MUCH TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS. WE'VE LOST LIVES. WE'VE LOST BUSINESSES. WE'VE LOST PAYCHECKS. AND NOW THANKS TO DONALD TRUMP'S BUNGLING, WE MAY LOSE SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE BEGUN TO MAKE, ALL BECAUSE HE'S LOST INTEREST. HE'S ONCE AGAIN IGNORING THE FACTS, THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE IS STILL WOEFULLY, WOEFULLY LACKING FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. MORE THAN 117,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WITH AN AVERAGE DAILY NUMBER OF CASES STILL CLIMBING IN 21 STATES. WE STILL DON'T HAVE WHAT WE NEED WHEN IT COMES TO RAPID RESULTS TESTING, CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY, WIDELY AVAILABLE PERSONNEL, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEM. , PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEM, OR CLEAR NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE. INSTEAD PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHES DANGEROUS DISPROVEN DRUGS, STANDS IN THE WAY OF THE CDC ISSUES GUIDELINES ON REOPENING. THEY HAD THEM, WANTED TO ISSUE THEM, AND HE WOULDN'T LET THEM. HE REFUSES TO WEAR A MASK, BASIC TESTS OF LEADERSHIP. HE SCALED BACK MEETINGS ON THE COVID-19 TASK FORCE. I GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO. IN SPITE OF EXPERTS SAYING THAT TESTING AND TRACING IS NECESSARY FOR REOPENING, HE SENT HIS TESTING CZAR HOME. THE MONEY PROVIDED TO THE PENTAGON FOR SENT MEDICAL SUPPLIES , THE MONEY PROVIDED TO THE PENTAGON FOR ESSENTIAL MEDICAL SUPPLIES, ONLY 15% HAS MADE IT OUT THE DOOR. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO STYLE HIMSELF AS A WARTIME PRESIDENT AGAINST THIS INVISIBLE ENEMY, THE CORONAVIRUS, BUT UNLIKE ANY OTHER WARTIME LEADER, HE TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY. HE EXERCISES NO LEADERSHIP. NOW HE'S JUST FLAT SURRENDERING THE FIGHT, INSTEAD OF LEADING THE CHARGE TO DEFEAT THE VIRUS, HE JUST BASICALLY WAVED A WHITE FLAG AND HAS RETREATED. SO EAGER TO GET TO HIS CAMPAIGN RALLIES, THAT HE'LL PUT PEOPLE AT RISK AS EVERYONE HAS POINTED OUT, IN VIOLATION OF THE CDC GUIDELINES THAT STILL WARN AGAINST LARGE GATHERINGS AS LONG AS , HE'S READY TO DO IT, AS LONG AS, NOTWITHSTANDING CDC GUIDANCE, AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE SHOWING UP SIGN A WAIVER PROMISING THAT THEY WILL NOT HOLD THE CAMPAIGN LIABLE. OH, MAN. DONALD TRUMP'S FAILURE TO FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS WITH THE SAME ENERGY AND FOCUS THAT HE USED TO TROLL HIS ENEMIES ON TWITTER HAS COST US LIVES AND IS PUTTING HOPE FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT RISK. JOB NUMBERS AND RETAIL SALES WERE BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN MAY. THAT'S GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT NOW DONALD TRUMP'S DESIRE TO DECLARE VICTORY AND BE DONE WITH IT IS ONLY GOING TO IMPAIR THE CONTINUED PROGRESS WE HAVE TO MAKE. OUR ECONOMY IS STILL SPUTTERING, WITH MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED AND NO CLEAR GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT BUSINESSES NEED TO DO TO REOPEN SAFELY, EFFICIENTLY, AND GENERATE A STRONG RECOVERY. THIS ISN'T A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER TO REOPEN. IT'S ABOUT HOW WE MAKE REOPENING WORK FOR EVERYONE. THE EMPLOYEES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY GET DAILY COVID-19 TESTS. THEY KNOW THEY'RE SAFE BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK. THEY KNOW THEIR COWORKERS ARE SAFE. THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO RESUME THEIR LIVES. WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AREN'T ASKING FOR DAILY TESTING. THEY ARE JUST ASKING FOR REGULAR RELIABLE ACCESS TO TESTS. DON'T THEY DESERVE THAT? IT'S NOT THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING, IT'S THAT HE'S NOT UP TO THE TASK OR DOESN'T CARE, AND NOW HE'S SEEMINGLY DECIDED THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY. BUT JUST LIKE HE COULDN'T WISH COVID-19 AWAY IN MARCH, JUST LIKE HE COULDN'T TWEET IT AWAY IN APRIL, HE CAN'T IGNORE IT AWAY IN JUNE. SO I HAVE SOME BASIC QUESTIONS FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE EVERY WORKER HAS ACCESS TO REGULAR TESTING SO THEY HAVE THE SAME CONFIDENCE TO GO INTO A STORE OR GO BACK TO WORK THAT WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS HAVE? SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS, NAVIGATING THE UNCERTAINTY ALL ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO PROTECT THE KIDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES? WHY DON'T YOU ENFORCE THE OSHA STANDARDS FOR WORKER PROTECTION DURING THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC? WHY DID THE MAINSTREAM LENDING PROGRAM CREATED MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AGO BY THE CONGRESS TO HELP STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY OPEN FOR REGISTRATION TO LENDERS TWO DAYS AGO AND STILL HASN'T DISTRIBUTED A SINGLE PENNY? WHY DON'T YOU DISCLOSE THE NAMES, MR. PRESIDENT, OF THE BUSINESSES WHO RECEIVED THE TOTAL OF 500 BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDING? WHY ARE THEY BEING HIDDEN? HOW MANY CRONIES GOT BAILOUTS? HOW MANY DONORS? HOW MANY BIG BUSINESSES THAT DIDN'T NEED IT? WHAT BUSINESS HAD TO SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE DENIED FUNDING IN APRIL? WHAT BUSINESSES DIDN'T GET SPECIAL APPROVAL THAT OTHERS GOT BY A NOD FROM THE TOP? WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE WATCHDOG, MR. PRESIDENT? WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE WATCHDOG, APPOINTED TO OVERSEE EVERY DOLLAR DISTRIBUTED, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THAT PERSON THAT CONGRESS PASSED? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE? TO BAD MANAGEMENT ON TOP OF BAD PLANNING ON TOP OF NEGLECT. IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A GREAT NATION LIKE OURS. FOLKS, HERE'S THE TRUTH, THE PANDEMIC IS STILL HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WE GET IT UNDER CONTROL OR UNTIL WE HAVE SAFE AND PROVEN WIDELY AVAILABLE VACCINE. COVID-19 IS A FACT OF NATURE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS VIRUS AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HEAD ON, HONESTLY. TELL THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HANDLE ANYTHING. JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT THE WAY YOU ARE DOING IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH IT, MR. PRESIDENT, IF WE PUT IN THE WORK, INVESTING IN BUILDING A DYNAMIC RESILIENT ECONOMY AND HEALTH SYSTEM CAPABLE OF GETTING AND THEN STAYING HADE OF NEW OUTBREAKS. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. I'VE LAID OUT BASELINE STEPS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FROM MAKE IT WORK CHECKLISTS, FOR SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNTABLE RECOVERY, THAT I PUT OUT BACK IN EARLY APRIL, TO THE STEPS OF A STRONG REOPENING THAT I RELEASED LAST WEEK. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. GRANTED I HAVE INCREDIBLE SCIENTISTS ADVISING ME ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS ON HOW TO PROCEED, BUT IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. IT IS COMMON SENSE. IT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. THAT'S WHY THIS IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST INDICTMENT OF DONALD TRUMP'S COMPLETE COMPELLING LACK OF LEADERSHIP. HE WASTED MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS PASSING THE BUCK, BLAMING EVERYONE ELSE, REFUSING TO ACT WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARING OUR COUNTRY FOR A LONG-TERM RESPONSE AND BUILDING UP OUR RESILIENCY TO RESPOND TO FUTURE FLARE-UPS. YET, WE STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING COVID-19 CASE DATA. THIS IS THE BASICS. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARING US TO WEATHER THE VALLEYS AND PEAKS OF THIS VIRUS. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING TO SHORE UP THE VULNERABILITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN LAID BARE IN THIS CRISIS AND HE'S TRYING TO ELIMINATE IN COURT. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BRIDGE THE INEQUITIES AND STRENGTHEN THE CRACKS IN THE FOUNDATION, OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO EVERYONE TO SEE. HE HASN'T DONE ANY OF IT. BECAUSE OF THE DEPTHS OF DONALD TRUMP'S FAILURES, THIS PANDEMIC WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORSE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND MUCH WORSE FOR BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS, WHO ARE GETTING HIT THE HARDEST. FOLKS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE , [INAUDIBLE] , DONALD TRUMP THINKS IF HE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THE SAND, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL TOO, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, NOT WHEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING EVERY DAY AND MILLIONS ARE UNEMPLOYED WONDERING HOW IN GOD'S NAME THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. NOT WHEN WORKERS ARE WEIGHED DOWN WITH WORRIES ABOUT THEIR SAFETY OR WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET SICK. THERE ARE STEPS WE NEED TO BE TAKING NOW TO STEER US STEADILY AND STRONGLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, SEE US THROUGH THIS TIME, TO MAKE A MORE RESILIENT FUTURE. THEY ARE AVAILABLE. FIRST WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO AVOID DEADLY SPIKES IN INFECTIONS AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO GO BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD. WE'RE NOT THAT MUCH BETTER PREPARED TODAY WITH THE RUN OF CASES THAT OVERFILLS OUR INTENSIVE CARE UNITS THAN WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO. SECOND, WE HAVE TO HELP GIVE PEOPLE THE ASSURANCE AND PRECAUTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO RESTART THE ECONOMY WITH CONFIDENCE. AND IF AMERICANS LOSE WHAT LITTLE FAITH THEY HAVE LEFT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC, WE'LL SEE MUCH DEEPER AND LONGER-LASTING ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAN WE EVEN , WITH EVEN GREATER REPERCUSSIONS FOR PEOPLE'S WELL BEINGS. MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T LEAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FACE THIS THREAT ON THEIR OWN, WITH NO GUIDANCE, RESOURCES, OR LEADERSHIP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. :: AND WORKERS NEED ASSURANCES THAT THEIR HEALTH IS YOUR FIRST CONCERN. AMERICANS NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST, NOT HIS OR HER OWN EGO. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL DO THE WORK READY ON DAY ONE AFTER MORE THAN THREE YEARS IN OFFICE WHY ISN'T DONALD TRUMP READY? MR. PRESIDENT, WAKE UP. GET TO WORK. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO BE DONE.

WITNESSES INCLUDE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBERS DR. STEPHEN HAHN, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, AND DR. ROBERT REDFIELD. LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS AT 10:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN THREE, ONLINE AT C-SPAN.ORG, OR THIS AND ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN, WITH FAMILIES IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WIDESPREAD TESTING FOR CORONAVIRUS WHEN REOPENING THE ECONOMY. 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF THE PRESIDENT WINS THIS CASE, HE KEEPS SAYING HE IS GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT HE HAS NOT FIGURED OUT ANYWAY THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. ABSENT WHAT WE HAVE DONE. AND THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT LATER, IF I'M ELECTED, I HAVE A PLAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICARE, AS WELL AS MEDICAID, OR SO MANY FOLKS. A LOT IS GOING ON BUT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU ALL , FIRE AWAY, TELL ME ABOUT , THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I AM THE MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD SON. HE COULDN'T COME TODAY, BUT THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM. HE LOVES SUPERHEROES AND STAR WARS AND ANYTHING OUTSIDE, HE IS A TYPICAL FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, BUT UNDERNEATH ALL THAT, HE HAS A LOT OF MEDICAL ISSUES GOING ON. HE HAS A DISEASE CALLED MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE. THAT AFFECTS BASICALLY EVERY CELL IN THE BODY. HE GOES THROUGH A LOT. HE HAS SPENT HALF HIS LIFE IN THE HOSPITAL. WE HAVE 30 SPECIALISTS THAT WE SEE BETWEEN LEE. HE HAS FOUR THERAPISTS WE ARE SEEING ALL THE TIME AND ABOUT TO ADD MORE TO HIS REGIMEN. THINGS CHANGE FOR HIM DAILY SOMETIMES. I ECHO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE SHARED, WHEN HE WAS FIRST BORN AND STARTED HAVING ISSUES, I HAD MY OWN INSURANCE. SOMETIMES, WE WERE SPENDING $3500 A MONTH OUT OF POCKET ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. HE IS ON SOMETHING CALLED TPN, WHICH FEEDS INTO HIS HEART. HE HAS A PERMANENT LINE THAT GOES INTO HIS CHEST, INTO HIS HEART. THEY CREATE A SOLUTION FOR HIM EVERY WEEK THAT HAS TO VITAMINS AND MINERALS, NUTRIENTS, FLUIDS THAT HE NEEDS, THAT IS HOW HE IS FED, THROUGH THAT CENTRAL LINE. THAT CAUSED IT OVER $80,000 A MONTH JUST FOR THAT ALONE, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. THANKS TO ACA, HE WAS ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID BECAUSE WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO HAVING TO LOOK AT BANKRUPTCY. WE WERE USING CREDIT CARDS, WE WERE HAVING TO MAKE THE DECISION, DO WE PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL OR BY HIS MEDICATION? SO MANY OF HIS MEDICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE. ANOTHER THING THAT THE ACA HAS AFFORDED US IS HOME CARE NURSING. THAT IS SOMETHING PRIVATE INSURANCE IS NOT PAY FOR. HE REQUIRES HOSPITAL-LEVEL CARE EVERY DAY AND BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF ACA, HE IS ABLE TO BE HOME WITH NURSES IN HIS COMMUNITY, PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE , INSTEAD OF BEING IN A HOSPITAL. THAT MEANS THE WORLD TO US. QUALITY OF LIFE IS EVERYTHING. HE HAS SOME ANY OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD OF HIM AND BECAUSE OF ACA, HE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. ANOTHER CONCERN, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE IS 26? THESE ARE THE FEARS WE HAVE AS FAMILIES MOVING FORWARD THROUGH THIS. THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING CUTTING MEDICARE BY $700 BILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL CARE ACT. THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR SITUATION COME UP WITH A RARE DISEASE, SO MANY PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR KINDS OF NEEDS. THE COSTS ARE JUST BEYOND CAPACITY FOR ANYONE TO HANDLE UNLESS YOU ARE A MULTIMILLIONAIRE. BY THE WAY, BOBBY SAYS HELLO. I WAS JUST TALKING TO HIM. HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? MY NAME IS STACY. THIS IS ONE OF MY TWINS, JAN. JAN IS 22. WHEN JAN AND HER IDENTICAL TWIN SISTER MADELINE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WHEN THEY WERE FOUR, WHICH REQUIRED STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS, WHICH THEY HAVE AT THE HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH , CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA, THEIR PROCEDURE, THE STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS, IT ISN'T READILY INSPECTED , INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. THIS IS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET ME CORRECT THAT, THE PATIENT PROTECTION. WE DID HIT A ONE MILLION-DOLLAR CAP ON OUR EMPLOYER-BASED COVERAGE. WE FORTUNATELY, AND UNFORTUNATELY, WERE ABLE TO , WE HAVE FOUR CHILDREN, THE TWINS ARE OUR OLDEST. I HAD A TODDLER AND I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY FOURTH WHEN WE FOUND OUT THIS IS CANCER. MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO TAKE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE IN ORDER TO HELP. WE WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND TAGTEAM STAYING AT THE HOSPITAL AND SEE THEM TAKING CARE OF MY SON. THERE WAS NO INCOME COMING IN BECAUSE IT IS UNPAID. WE KEPT THE COVERAGE BUT IT WAS EXPENSIVE. WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING COMING IN AND EVERYTHING GOING OUT, WE ENDED UP FILING BANKRUPTCY. FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE ABLE TO GO ON TO KATE AS A SECONDARY THROUGH THE STATE, WHICH DID HELP PICK UP SOME THINGS, BUT WE DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THAT UNTIL AFTER WE HAD , WENT BANKRUPT. NOT ONLY IS THE PATIENT PROTECTION SO IMPORTANT TO ME FOR MY KIDS, FOR THE PATIENT PROTECTIONS, BUT ONE OF THE REASONS I VOTED FOR YOU AND PRESIDENT OBAMA BACK INTO THOUSAND SEVEN , IN 2007 IS BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO WATCH YOUR MOM , MY MOM DIED AT CANCER AT 52. SHE PUT OFF GOING FOR CARE BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SHE WAS OLD SCHOOL, SHE WAS GOING TO WAIT AND GO WHEN SHE COULD UP FORD , AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT. SHE WAS PAYING OFF A PREVIOUS MEDICAL ISSUE, SO SHE WAS WAITING TO PAY THAT OFF AND BY THE TIME SHE WENT, IT WAS TOO LATE, THE CANCER SPREAD AND SHE PASSED AWAY. I KNEW AFTER READING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN THAT HE GOT IT BECAUSE OF HIS MOM, AND I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT YOU WOULD BOTH SEE THIS THROUGH AND YOU DID AND HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE, WE COULDN'T SAVE MY MOM, BUT WE CAN HELP OUR CHILDREN BY NOT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM AND MAKING SURE THEY CAN STAY ON OUR INSURANCE UNTIL THEY ARE 26. JAN HAD TO LEAVE COLLEGE FOR SOME HEALTH ISSUES AND HAS NOW GONE BACK AT 22 TO CONTINUE A DEGREE IN EDUCATION. 26, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. COVERAGE FOR THE CHRONIC CARE. MY KIDS WERE ONLY TWO OF OVER 15,000 KIDS A YEAR DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. ONLY TWO OF OVER 400,000 CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS 400,000 CHILDREN WITH THE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IS JUST CANCER. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE JUVENILE DIABETES OR WHAT YOUR SON HAS, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. HOW CAN WE, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, TAKE THAT AWAY FROM OUR CHILDREN? I JUST DON'T GET IT. WELL, I DON'T GET IT EITHER. THE FACT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I , THE CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT , THE REASON WE , EVERYBODY FORGETS WHY WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICY UNTIL 26 IS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, A WHOLE GENERATION LOST ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS, ACCESS TO INSURANCE, IT MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE. THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE. ALSO, BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO GET BASIC COVERAGE. I LOST BOTH MY PARENTS AT HOME AND THEY WERE EACH LIVED WITH ME THE LAST PART OF THEIR LIVES AND MY WIFE LOST BOTH OF HER PARENTS AT HOME AS WELL. WHAT I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOR THE SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE POPULATION, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WATCHING YOUR CHILD BE IN DISTRESS. I GOT ELECTED, I AM PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON WHO GOT SWORN IN IN A HOSPITAL WITH MY TWO SONS AFTER MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE HAD I NOT HAD INSURANCE AT THE TIME. THIS IS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEN, MY SON CAME HOME, ONE LITTLE BOY GREW UP TO BE , THEY HAVE BOTH GROWN, ONE OF THEM BECAME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE, A POOR HERO, DECORATED, COMING HOME FROM A YEAR AFTER BEING IN IRAQ AND STATES FOR GLIOBLASTOMA, MONTHS TO LIVE, WHETHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BEGET, JUST HOW LONG. I USED TO SIT THERE AND THINK, THIS IS GOD'S TRUTH, WONDER, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD SHE MADE IT FOR 17 MONTHS IN REAL PAIN? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY HAD COME WITH SIX MONTHS LEFT TO GO AND SAID, SUFFER IN PEACE, YOU HAVE OUTLIVED YOUR COVERAGE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE. NOT JUST WHAT IT DOES TO THE PATIENT, BUT TO THE PARENTS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, I APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE, SO THAT WE CAN , THERE ARE MILLIONS OF YOU AROUND THE COUNTRY IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK THAT IT GETS LOST, THE PERSONAL PIECE OF THIS GETS LOST IN THIS DEBATE. THIS IS ABOUT ONE DAY AT A TIME. WHAT I DID WHEN MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, I HAD BEEN VICE PRESIDENT, I VISITED EVERY MAJOR CANCER FACILITY IN THE WORLD, NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES, SET UP A MAJOR CANCER FOUNDATION, THE PRESIDENT SET UP A THING CALLED DEALING WITH MY ABILITY TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW WE DEAL WITH CANCER. THEN WHEN I LEFT 21 CANCER HOSPITALS AS WELL AS A TOTAL OF NINE NOBEL LAUREATE WHO WANTED ME TO CONTINUE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING DURING THE ADMINISTRATION, IT REALLY MATTERS TO PEOPLE. CHOP IS A GREAT HOSPITAL. MY DAUGHTER WASN'T CHOP, THEY DIAGNOSED EARLY ON, ANY PROBLEMS SHE HAD, A HIP DISPLACER WHEN SHE WAS AN INFANT. HAD A NOT COT IT, JUST NOT CAUGHT IT , HAD THEY NOT CAUGHT IT, SHE WOULD HAVE ONE LEG LONGER THAN THE OTHER. THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT DOCTORS OUT THERE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE NOT AS A PRIVILEGE BUT AS A BASIC RIGHT THAT EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO. I'M NOT 20 TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW I'M GOING TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE, BUT I WILL TAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND I BELIEVE WE CAN GET IT PASSED, ADDING A PUBLIC AUCTION, A MEDICARE OPTION TO THAT, AND INCREASE THE ASCUS , THE ACCESS TO OTHER MEANS OF HEALTH CARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE TO BE ABLE TO GET ANY KIND OF MEDICARE COVERAGE AT HOME, MEDICAID. THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS READY TO DO IT. WHAT I WANT TO THANK U IS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT IT TO ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. WE ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, YOU TALKED ABOUT COBRA. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND ALTHOUGH THEY TECHNICALLY ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PAY INTO COBRA, THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYERS OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY CAN'T PAY AT. , PAY IT. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKE UP THAT COBRA PAYMENT SO EVERYBODY CAN KEEP WHAT THEY HAD NEGOTIATED, WHETHER THEY HAVE A JOB OR NOT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO , I'M SUPPOSEDLY A EXPERT IN FOREIGN POLICY, HEALTH CARE IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN FOREIGN POLICY. IT REALLY IS. THINK OF ALL THE BRIGHT PEOPLE LIKE YOU FROM PHD'S TO THE GUY WHO WAS BREAKING HIS NECK MAKING SURE THAT WE KEEP THE ROADS OPEN , WHEN THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SIGN UP, THEY CAN RE-UP THEIR INSURANCE, THOSE CHOICES, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? IT IS COMPLICATED STUFF. IN ONE SENSE, IT SIMPLE. THE IDEA THAT A FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY, THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEIR CHILD IS NOT ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED IS JUST THE ULTIMATE DEPRIVATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY, YOU , YOUR JOB IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT IS BETTER PLACE IN A COMMUNITY. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR CHILD AND REALIZE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP THEM? THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO, IF GOD FOR BID, THE COURT MAKES A RULING, THAT WE CAN PASS A BEEFED UP ELEMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE REALIZING WHAT IT MEANS AND THINK ABOUT IT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST SEQUENTIAL HEALTH CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE 1918, WE ARE CUTTING ACCESS TO INSURANCE? WHILE SO MANY BUSINESSES RUN OUT OF BUSINESS AND ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE IT ON BUSINESS HEALTH INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE? IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE CLOSE TO CRUEL.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473396-4/joe-biden-roundtable-health-care	Former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, spoke in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, about the Affordable Care Act and his plan to make it available to every American.	473396-4	Speech		
CSPANJB256202073	Joe Biden	2020-06-25	Joe Biden Remarks on Health Care	"AND FOCUS WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. AND TO DO AWAY WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TALKING ABOUT COBRA, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS AND ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY THEY ARE ABLE TO PAY WORKERS THEY ARE OUT OF BUSINESS SO THEY CAN'T PAY SO THAT IS WHY PROPOSED IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES THAT COBRA PAYMENT SO THEY CAN KEEP WITH A NEGOTIATED WHETHER THEY HAVE A JOB OR NOT DURING THE PANDEMIC. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND WHEN I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO SUPPOSEDLY AM AN EXPERT IN FOREIGN POLICY THAT HEALTHCARE IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN FOREIGN-POLICY. THINK ABOUT THE BRIGHT PEOPLE WITH PHD'S TO THE GUY WHO BREAKS HIS NECK TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE ROADS OPEN AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SIGN UP AND THEN THEY CAN WE UP INSURANCE. SO IT IS COMPLICATED STAFF. THE IDEA THAT OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND THE IDEA AND THAT A CHILD IT IS JUST THE ULTIMATE DEPRIVATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOE YOUR DAD IS MORE THAN A PAYCHECK BUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT IN PLACE IN A COMMUNITY HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY TO REALIZE THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP A CHILD? SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN PASS THE BEEFED-UP ELEMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BECAUSE IN THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL HEALTH CRISIS SINCE 1918 GETTING ACCESS TO INSURANCE WHILE SO MANY BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE GOOD AFTERNOON. TODAY WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND DONALD TRUMP WILL FILE IN THE SUPREME COURT TO STRIP AWAY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IF HE SUCCEEDS MORE THAN 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE COVERAGE OVERNIGHT INCLUDING 1 MILLION IN PENNSYLVANIA. INSURANCE ONCE AGAIN DISCRIMINATE SERVICES ARE DROP COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE LIKE DIABETES OR CANCER OR ASTHMA MOST CRUELLY OF ALL DONALD TRUMP IF HE HAS HIS WAY THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLICATIONS FROM COVE IN 18 IS THE NEW PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIKE LONG SCARS OR HEART DAMAGE AND IF DONALD TRUMP PREVAILS IN COURT AND TO STRIP AWAY COVERAGE JACK UP PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY SURVIVED FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS THOSE HAVING STRUGGLED WINNING THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES WOULD HAVE THEIR PIECE OF MINE STOLE AND AT THE MOMENT THEY NEEDED IT THE MOST THEY WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES, AND ADVICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S LEGACY AND FAILURE TO PREVENT ON - - PROTECT AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AND THIS CRUSADE TO TAKE HEALTHCARE PROTECTIONS AWAY FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES. I HAVE CALLED ON DONALD TRUMP MANY TIMES TO WITHDRAW HIS LAWSUIT IN TODAY I AM RENEWING THAT CALL. DROPPED THE LAWSUIT. STOPPED TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. STOP TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE AND PEACE OF MIND. NOW MORE THAN EVER STOP TRYING TO STEAL THEIR PIECE OF MIND I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE CRUELTY TO INFLICT THOSE PEOPLE HE IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE. ONE OF THE FAMILIES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO LIVE NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MANNHEIM PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN THEIR MOM STACY HEARD THE MOST DEVASTATING WORDS A PARENT CAN HERE. THOSE OF THE TWINS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. I PROMISE STOPS YOUR HEART. AND KNOX THE ENTIRE WORLD OFFICE ACCESS ON - - AXIS IN THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR MIND IF YOU CAN AFFORD TREATMENT FOR YOUR CHILDREN. WHEN STACY'S TWINS GOT SICK THERE WAS NO AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AFTER STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS AND THE WAVES OF HOPE AND FEAR AND AFTER ENDURING MORE THAN ANY AND PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE SHE STILL FACED A FUTURE WHERE THE TWINS COULD BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS CREATED TO PUT A STOP TO THAT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE STACY TO FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS AND SAVE THEIR CHILDREN THEY WON THE FIGHT THEY BE CANCER NOW THEY ARE 22 YEARS OF AGE STUDYING EDUCATION AND THEN GRADUATING FROM ARCADIA UNIVERSITY AND BECAUSE OF THE ACA INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN NO LONGER DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE SURVIVORS OF CANCER. I AM PROUD OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THIS IS A LAW VITAL COVERAGE FOR 25 MILLION AMERICANS THAT BARS INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM TAPPING AMERICAN BENEFITS AND CHARGING WOMEN MORE FOR INSURANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMAN FOR NEARLY 12 MILLION SENIORS. TO SEE THE COST SPIKE BECAUSE OF THE MEDICARE DON'T HOLD WOULD SUDDENLY REOPEN AND THE COST HAS GONE PRECIPITOUSLY THIS SAVES LIVES BUT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE THE PANDEMIC OF 1918, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. IT'S CRUEL, HEARTLESS, CALLOUS BECAUSE HE CANNOT ABIDE THE THOUGHT LETTING ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT SAME CALLOUSNESS OF THE CORONAVIRUS JUST OVER THREE MONTHS AGO AS MOST AMERICANS WERE FIRST COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED SCALE OF DANGER AND PANDEMIC PRESIDENT TRUMP PUBLICLY CLAIMED ""ANYBODY THAT ONCE A TEST ANYBODY CAN GET IT. THAT SIMPLY WAS NOT TRUE AND HE KNEW IT AND THEN FIVE DAYS AGO AT THE CAMPAIGN RALLY AND ALSO OKLAHOMA HE ADMITTED TELLING PEOPLE SLOW THE TESTING DOWN PLEASE. HIS ONE HOUR 50 MINUTES SPEECH. SLOWED THE TESTING DOWN, PLEASE. THE FIRST THE SPOKESPEOPLE TRIED TO SAY HE WAS JOKING BUT THEN HE SAID HE WASN'T. HE CALLED IT ""A DOUBLE EDGE SWORD. THAT IS THE QUOTE. LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT. QUESTING UNEQUIVOCABLY SAVES LIVES WIDESPREAD TESTING IS THE KEY TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY AGAIN. THE OTHER EDGE THAT THEY THINK THAT FINDING OUT MORE AMERICANS ARE SICK WILL MAKE HIM LOOK BAD. THAT'S WHAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING BAD DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW HE LOOKS AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF AMERICA INCREASING IN 29 STATES DEALING WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME TRUMP CANNOT WISH IT AWAY HE CANNOT SPEND THAT TO MEET HIS POLITICAL WISHES THERE ARE NO MIRACLES COMING WE WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS BECAUSE NONE IS COMING WE HAVE TO STEP UP AS AMERICANS ALL OF US AND DO THE SIMPLE THINGS IN THE HARD THINGS TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AND EVENTUALLY PUT THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US AND DO THIS WITHOUT RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S UP TO ALL OF US. WE HAVE TO WEAR MASKS MINUS OFF BECAUSE SOCIALLY DISTANT STAND IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE I WEAR IT EVERYWHERE I GO. AND I KNOW AS AMERICANS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE USED TO BUT IT MATTERS ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT TELLS US IT COULD BE THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE LIKE WE ARE HERE TODAY IT SEEMS SO STRANGE TO US NOT AS AMERICANS BUT HUMAN BEINGS. WE ARE TAUGHT TO GATHER IT HARD AGAIN LAUGH WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR NOW WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE IT MATTERS. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING TO BRING A NUMBER OF CASES DOWN. THE PRESIDENT WANTS US TO BELIEVE THERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AMAZINGLY HE STILL HAS NOT GRASPED THE MOST BASIC FACT OF THE CRISIS TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. SAY IT AGAIN. TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. LIKE A CHILD HE CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENED TO HIM. ALL OF HIS WHINING AND SELF-PITY SELF-PITY, THIS PANDEMIC DID NOT HAPPEN TO HIM. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US HIS JOB ISN'T TO WHINE ABOUT IT BUT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND TO LEAD. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO HER ON - - EASE THE BURDEN AND PUT YOUR FAMILY FIRST THAT WOULD BEGIN WITH A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF HEALTH COVERAGE WITH BOLD STEPS TO LOWER HEALTH CARE COST WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION NOW MORE THAN EVER ESPECIALLY WHEN MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED THAT ALLOWS EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS THE CHOICE TO GET A MEDICARE -LIKE PLAN TO FORCE PRIVATE INSURERS TO KEEP PAYMENTS LOW OFFER BETTER COVERAGE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT WE WILL LOWER PREMIUMS FOR PEOPLE BUYING COVERAGE ON THE ROUND KNOW AMERICAN HAS TO SPEND MORE THAN EIGHT.5 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE. ALL THE DETAILS ARE LAID OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE WILL ALSO FURTHER REDUCE COST TO MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE TO HAVE LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES IN THE PRACTICE OF SO-CALLED SURPRISE BILLING LEAVING WITH UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH BILLS AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE MY PLAN LOWERS HEALTHCARE COST JUST AS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE QUICKLY WHEN IT IS NEEDED NOW. ENDURING ILLNESS AND RISKY CHOICES LOSING THE EMPLOYER'S PLAN AS THE EMPLOYER'S GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND NEED LIFELINES NOW. THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DESERVE. THEY DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT TO GO INTO COURT TO DENY THEM THE HEALTHCARE THEY HAD. AND ALSO YOU NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED. I LOOK FORWARD TO ENDING IT FOR HIM AND WORK QUICKLY WITH CONGRESS TO ME BUT PROTECTIONS OF LOWER HEALTHCARE COST AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS MY PROMISE I'M PRESIDENT I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY I WILL MY OWN. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND MY WIFE JILL. I WAS SWORN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, NEXT TO A HOSPITAL BED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE JUST KILLED IN A CAR CRASH LYING IN THAT BED WITH MY TWO YOUNG BOYS BOYS, SURVIVING BOYS. I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, HEALTHCARE WE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. FOUR YEARS LATER, 40 YEARS LATER MY GROWN SON AFTER THE IT ATTORNEY GENERAL COMING BACK AND THEN CONTRACTED FATAL CANCER. AND THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG HE WOULD HAVE TO LIVE, HOW MANY MONTHS. SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL JILL AND HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN FOR HIS HANDS. AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD WHAT IN THE HELL WOULD I DO IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD DO BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT TO SAY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE EXCEPT FOR THOSE LESS PAINFUL MONTHS DYING ON YOUR OWN OWN. AND SUFFER IN PEACE I CANNOT FATHOM. I CANNOT FATHOM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY FAMILIES BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO AMY, I UNDERSTAND WHEN I SAY I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. NOTHING AND TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY THAT IS MY PROMISE TO STACY AND VICTORIA AND AMY AND OTHER AMERICANS THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENCY IS. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. , ALL OF US. NO TRUST IS MORE SACRED NO PURPOSE MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN A PRESIDENT TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO NOW IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING OR WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU GET TO THE DAY, I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE AND WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE WILL BUILD A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE'LL BUILD ON IT AND BUILD THE ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY BACK TO BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THEY GOT OFF CRISIS. THAT I PROMISE YOU. LET ME AND BY THINKING THE FAMILIES THERE ARE SO MANY LIKE YOURS ACROSS AMERICA. I GET IT. THERE IS REAL SOLIDARITY. WE WILL GET THIS DONE I PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473396-1/joe-biden-remarks-health-care	Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, spoke in Lancaster, Pennsylvania about the Affordable Care Act and his plan to make it available to every American.

AND WE WILL DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT YOU. COMING UP WEDNESDAY MORNING, MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBY DINGLE WILL JOIN US. SHE TALKS ABOUT THE LATEST U.S. RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES WITH CONGRESSMAN LARRY BUSHONG, WHO IS ALSO A MEDICAL DOCTOR, ON HIS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE TESTING. WATCH C-SPAN'S ""WASHINGTON JOURNAL,"" AT 7:00 A.M. EASTERN WEDNESDAY MORNING, AND JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK THOMAS, TEXT MESSAGES, AND TWEETS. NEXT, JOE BIDEN TALKS ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND LAYS OUT HIS UPDATED PLANS FOR REOPENING THE ECONOMY. THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ALSO ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES AND THE REMOVAL OF CONFEDERATE STATUES AND OTHER MONUMENTS. FROM WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, THIS IS 50 MINUTES. I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE. THIS IS MY POLLING PLACE. I WAS TRYING TO VOTE EARLY, BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU'RE SMILING OR NOT, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING RIGHT NOW, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. FOR WEEKS, WE HAVE SEEN THE WARNING SIGNS. NUMBERS DON'T LIE. INFECTION RATES ARE NOW GOING UP IN MORE STATES THAN THEY ARE GOING DOWN. MORE THAN 125,000 PEOPLE IN THE U.S. HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. AND THOSE NUMBERS AND NEW INFECTIONS CONTINUE TO GROW AT ALARMING RATES. ONCE AGAIN, IT IS CONFRONTING THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHOUT A RIGOROUS PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. THEY ARE NOT SEPARABLE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPAGANDA THAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION, AND DESPITE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REQUEST THAT WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN TESTING BECAUSE HE THINKS IT MAKES HIM LOOK BAD, THE COVID-19 IS STILL HERE. THE DAILY THREAT TO AMERICAN HEALTH AND PROSPERITY IS CONTINUING. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. MONTH AFTER MONTH, AS OTHER LEADERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TOOK THE NECESSARY STEPS TO GET THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL, DONALD TRUMP FAILED US. MONTH AFTER MONTH, AS MANY OF US ARE URGED HIM TO STEP UP AND DO HIS JOB, HE FAILED US. JUST LOOK AT THE RECORD. IN JANUARY, I, ALONG WITH OTHERS, SOUNDED THE ALARM OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK. TRUMP TOLD THE COUNTRY COVID-19 IS ""TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL, AND EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT WELL."" IN FEBRUARY, I WARNED ABOUT THE FAILURE OF INFORMATION THAT WE NEEDED FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. WHAT I SAID WAS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DEMAND XI PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE, DEMAND IT. TRUMP SAID ""WE ARE IN GREAT SHAPE."" CHINA'S PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS ""DOING VERY WELL."" IN MARCH, I SET FORTH A DETAILED PLAN FOR 500 FEDERALLY FUNDED TESTING SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS GUARANTEED EMERGENCY PAID LEAVE. LATER THAT MONTH, I CALLED FOR FULL AND IMMEDIATE USE OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, CRITICAL FOR DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO THOSE WHERE IT WAS NEEDED. TRUMP ACCUSED HEALTH-CARE WORKERS OF STEALING A MASK. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. HEALTH-CARE WORKERS ARE STEALING THE MASKS. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE THEM. IN APRIL, I RELEASED A PLAN TO SECURE THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SURGE NATIONWIDE TESTING WITH A TWO WAY PANDEMIC TESTING BOARD, AND LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE HEALTH CORE TO FOCUS ON CONTACT TRACING. TRUMP SUGGESTED AMERICANS SHOULD INJECT DISINFECTANTS INTO THEIR BODIES. IN MAY, I CONDEMNED THE CHOICE BETWEEN PRESERVING PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR ECONOMY. I URGED THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ON THE BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES, LIKE TESTING, TO ENABLE US TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TRUMP'S RESPONSE, HE PUSHED FOR REOPENING WITHOUT REGARD TO SAFETY, AND CALLED TESTING ""FRANKLY OVERRATED."" THIS MONTH, I OUTLINED A PATH TO REOPEN OUR COUNTRY SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY. PROVIDE WORKERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, STATES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, THE RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE THEY WOULD NEED. TRUMP'S PROPOSAL? HE SAID A CUTOFF DATE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING AND TESTING SITES IN SEVERAL STATES. HE ACTUALLY WENT TO COURT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE BY TRYING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. AND NOW, DONALD TRUMP IS IN RETREAT. BACK IN MARCH, WHEN I CALLED, AND HE CALLED, TO TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS, ACTING LIKE WE WERE AT WAR WITH THE VIRUS. HE CALLED HIMSELF A WARTIME PRESIDENT. REMEMBER WHEN HE EXERTED THE NATIONS ARE SACRIFICED TOGETHER AND ""IN THE FACE OF THIS INEVITABLE AND INVISIBLE ENEMY."" WHAT HAPPENED? NOW, IT'S ALMOST JULY. IT SEEMS LIKE OUR WARTIME PRESIDENT HAS SURRENDERED. WAVED THE WHITE FLAG AND LEFT THE BATTLEFIELD. TODAY, WE ARE FACING A SERIOUS THREAT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT AS ONE COUNTRY. BUT THE PRESIDENT GIVES NO DIRECTION. HE PUTS US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. WE CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE THIS. HALF RECOVERING AND HALF GETTING WORSE. WE CAN'T CONTINUE. HALF WEARING MASKS, AND HALF REJECTING SCIENCE. WE CAN'T CONTINUE. HALF WITH A PLAN AND HALF JUST HOPING FOR THE BEST. WE WON'T DEFEAT THIS VIRUS WITH A PIECEMEAL APPROACH. LIFTING RESTRICTIONS PREMATURELY , INCREASING THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRISIS. RAISING THE LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING TO REIMPOSE RESTRICTIONS. UNTIL OUR SCIENCE CATCHES UP WITH REALITY, UNTIL WE HAVE BETTER TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO BECOME INFECTED IN NOT ONLY OUR STATE WITH PROVEN, WIDELY AVAILABLE VACCINES, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE CAN TODAY I'M RELEASING THE PLAN WITH THE STEPS I BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP SHOULD UNDERTAKE IMMEDIATELY TO BUILD ON THE ROADMAP I RELEASED BACK IN MARCH THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES THAT BEEN ADOPTED. IT'S A PLAN TO SAVE LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD BUT ONCE AGAIN, I ENCOURAGE THEM TO ADOPT THIS PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR POLITICS. FIRST, TESTING, TESTING, TESTING. MORE TESTING IS NOT ONLY HOW YOU FIND MORE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS , MR. PRESIDENT, IS HOW YOU STOP CORONAVIRUS CASES. TESTING FOLLOWED BY RIGOROUS CONTACT TRACING, QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION PROTOCOLS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. PEOPLE ARE NOT WAITING IN LINES FOR MILES AND MILES IN BAKING HOT CARS FOR DRIVE THROUGH NASAL SWABS FOR THE FUN OF IT, THEY'RE DOING IT SO THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE THE MASK ON, THEY ARE PROTECTING OTHERS. THEY ARE PROTECTING OTHERS. WE KNOW WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TESTING, THERE ARE STILL HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE TEST THEY NEED. TESTING IS HOW WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS THE EYES ON THE GROUND. WITHOUT THAT TESTING, WE'RE FLYING BLIND. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE RELIABLE ACCESS TO TESTING EVERYWHERE. WE NEED TO INCREASE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR TESTING. THAT INCLUDES DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING SITES AND KEEP INCREASING THEM UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE LINE. WE SHOULD CREATE A PANDEMIC TESTING BOARD TO SPEARHEAD A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN SO EVERY WORKER, EVERY WORKER IS CALLED BACK TO THE JOB CAN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY AND THEIR FELLOW WORKERS ARE NOT INFECTED . YOU KNOW, EXPERTS AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE CONTACT TRACERS TO TRACK THE PATH OF THIS VIRUS . INDIVIDUAL STATES LIKE NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA ALREADY HIRING AND TRAINING THOUSANDS OF TRACERS. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE, INCLUDING HIRING AT LEAST 100,000 FEDERALLY FUNDED WORKERS TO PERFORM CONTACT TRACING AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH TASKS AND THEY SHOULD BEGIN TO BE TRAINED NOW. SECOND, EVERY SINGLE FRONTLINE WORKER SHOULD HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO BE SAFE. FIVE MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, AND THEIR HEALTH CARE WORKERS STILL ARE FORCED TO SCRAMBLE FOR THEIR OWN SUPPLIES AND HAVE TO REUSE THEIR MASKS SHIFT AFTER SHIFT. HUNDREDS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19 AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BECOME INFECTED. IT SHOULD BE ZERO ON BOTH COUNTS FOR THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS IF THEY HAD THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT. HOW ARE WE BEST MANY MONTHS IN AND STILL DON'T HAVE WHAT WE NEED? THAT IS WHY WE NEED , WHY WE HAVE A DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT . USE YOUR AUTHORITY, MR. PRESIDENT. USE IT THIS WEEK SCALE UP THE PROTECTION OF N95 MASS YOU KNOW THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE. FIX THE SHORTAGE OF PPE FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS BEFORE YOU TEE OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF GOLF WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. THIRD, WE SHOULD BE LASER FOCUSED ON TREATMENTS AND VACCINES. WE SHOULD BE LEADING A COORDINATED GLOBAL APPROACH ON THE SCIENCE, NOT DISREGARDING EXPERTS WHILE PUSHING DANGEROUS AND DISAPPROVED DRUGS AS IF THEY ARE TREATMENTS. THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS TOWARD TREATMENT IN VACCINES BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T BEEN TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW THEY PLAN TO MANUFACTURE ENOUGH DOSES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION TO SCALE. I HOPE THEY ARE DOING IT NOW. I CALL FOR A WHILE AGO THEY SHOULD BE FIGHTING 250 MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE A PLAN NOW EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THIS SO EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS WHEN AND IF THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE. THEY MAY BE DOING IT, BUT WE HAVE NO TRANSPARENCY. LET US SEE, MR. PRESIDENT. THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD REPORT WEEKLY ON THIS. WE CAN'T END UP IN THE SAME SCRATCHY AND DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD IN TESTING . WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMERS AREN'T BEING GOUGED BY NEW DRUG IN THERAPIES AND PRICES WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPED. WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY RESTORE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. FOR ALL ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND MISSTEPS AROUND COVID-19, THIS IS WHY THEY WERE CREATED. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO COORDINATING THE GLOBAL RESPONSE DURING A PANDEMIC AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE LEADING THAT RESPONSE AS WE HAD IN THE PAST. COVID-19 WILL LIKELY WORSEN AT THE OUTSET OF FLU SEASON THIS YEAR, SO WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE MEASURES NOW, NOW, TO ENSURE THE SEASONAL FLU VACCINE CAN BE READY COME AVAILABLE, AND ADMINISTERED SAFELY TO THOSE WHO NEED IT UNDER SOCIAL AND DISTANCING GUIDELINES, ESPECIALLY FOR SENIORS. FOURTHLY, WE NEED REAL PLANS, REAL GUIDELINES, WITH UNIFORM NATIONWIDE STANDARDS TO HELP US CHART OUR ECONOMIC REOPENING. WHATEVER WE'VE BEEN DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING. THE STATE-BY-STATE APPROACH WILL ONLY PRODUCE CONFUSION AND SLOW ANY PROGRESS. YOU KNOW, YOU ALL REPORTED THE CDC TRIED TO CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT STAGES OF REOPENING SHOULD LOOK LIKE, THE ADMINISTRATION DELAYED AND SCALED-BACK THOSE PLANS. WE NEED CLEAR EVIDENCE, CLEAR EVIDENCE-BASED STEPS THAT STATES CAN ADOPT NOW, BOTH THE STANDARD MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO SAFELY PROCEED WITH FURTHER OPENINGS, AND THE REPOSITION OF SOCIAL DISTANCING ROLES WHEN CASES BEGIN TO RISE. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS SO PARENTS IF AND WHEN THEY CAN RETURN TO WORK ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE SAFE AND CARE D FOR. WE SHOULD BE HOLDING AND PROVIDING STICKERS THAT SAY ""SAFE FOR SHOPPERS,"" A CERTIFICATION TO STORES THAT PROVE THEIR MINIMIZING THEIR CUSTOMERS RISK AND EXPOSURE . WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE VERY TOP OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC , PERIOD. WEAR A MASK. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU, IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, IT'S ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR COLLEAGUES. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING OTHERS SAFE. IT HELPS YOU, YES, BUT IT'S ABOUT KEEPING OTHER PEOPLE SAFE. IT'S A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENT, IT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AS AN AMERICAN . PROTECT YOUR CO-WORKERS AND NEIGHBORS, AND FINALLY WE NEED TO PROTECT THE POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK, OUR SENIORS, ARE BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS, NATIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS KNOW THAT THIS CONTINUED GROWTH AND CASE NUMBERS IS CAUSING A LOT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY. PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OLDER AMERICANS AND THOSE ARE THE LOVED ONES AND NURSING HOMES, I GET CALLS ALL THE TIME. THEY ARE SCARED. THEY ARE FRIGHTENED. THIS IS NOT JUST TAKING A TOLL ON PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL COST AS WELL. WE CAN'T EXPECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO QUARANTINE INDEFINITELY WITHOUT SUPPORT, AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY WILL BE MY RESPONSIBILITY IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT. I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE FIVE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD STEPS THEY'RE GOING TO HELP DEFEAT THE PANDEMIC. AND IF YOU SUSPECT THAT A LOT OF THESE STEPS ARE THE SAME SORTS OF THINGS I WAS TALKING ABOUT A , IN MARCH WHEN I RELEASED MY FIRST COVID-19 RESPONSE, YOU WOULD BE RIGHT. IF IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE HEARING THE EXPERTS TALK ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES FOR MONTHS, YOU'D BE RIGHT. THESE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE STEPS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO PUT IN PLACE TO MEET THE THREAT. STATEWIDE LOCKDOWNS THAT SO MANY AMERICANS LIVED UNDER FOR MONTHS WERE INTENDED TO BUY US TIME TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER. INSTEAD OF USING THAT TIME TO PREPARE OURSELVES, DONALD TRUMP SQUANDERED IT. NOW HERE WE ARE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS LATER, WE'RE HARDLY BETTER PREPARED THAN WE WERE IN MARCH. INFECTIONS ARE ON THE RISE, THE THREAT OF MASSIVE SPIKES THAT OVERWHELM THE CAPACITY OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS ON THE RISE. AMERICANS ANXIOUS AND OUT OF WORK ARE FEARFUL FOR THEIR LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS. DONALD TRUMP IS DOING NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT IT. MR. PRESIDENT, THE CRISIS IS REAL AND IT IS SURGING, MR. PRESIDENT. YOUR PROMISES AND PREDICTIONS AND WISHFUL THINKING PULLED OUT OF THIN AIR ARE NOT ONLY DOING THE COUNTRY NO GOOD MAKING THEM LOSE EVEN MORE FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. AMERICA KNOWS THIS CRISIS ISN'T BEHIND US, EVEN IF YOU DON'T . THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING, EVEN IF YOU REFUSE TO, MR. PRESIDENT. THEY KNOW WE NEED A COORDINATED NATIONAL PLAN WE NEED NOW EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T AND WON'T DO IT. YOU CALLED YOURSELF A CHEERLEADER. WE DO NOT NEED A CHEERLEADER, MR. PRESIDENT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TELL US THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH, WHO WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND OF ALWAYS BLAMING OTHERS. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS, FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD AND BE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE NATION, WEAR A MASK, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, THE SIDES , SIZE OF CROWDS. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T MAKE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS SO THEY COULD JUST WASTE, WASTE THEIR TIME AND YOU CAN WASTE ALL THE EFFORTS THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN WITH YOUR MIDNIGHT RANTINGS AND TWEETS. THEY DON'T MAKE THESE SACRIFICES SO YOU CAN IGNORE THE SCIENCE AND TURN RESPONSIBLE STEPS LIKE WEARING MASKS INTO A POLITICAL STATEMENT. AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT DO IT, MR. PRESIDENT, SO YOU COULD WASH YOUR HANDS AND WALK AWAY FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY. MAYBE THERE ARE TIMES THIS NATION NEEDS A CHEERLEADER NOW , CHEERLEADER. NOW IS NOT ONE OF THEM. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT. WHATEVER TRUMP DOES IT DOES NOT DO, WE CAN'T KNOW TODAY WITH THE STATE OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL BE NEXT JANUARY. I HOPE I TURN OUT TO BE WRONG, BUT I AM ALMOST CERTAIN IT WILL NOT BE OVER. AND IF I SHOULD HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, ON THE DAY I'M SWORN IN, I'LL GET RIGHT TO WORK IMPLEMENTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE RESPONSE THAT REMAIN UNDONE. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT MY DAY ONE OF COVID-19 AGENDA IN THE WEEKS TO COME, BUT MY RESPONSE WILL BEGIN WELL BEFORE I TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE. IT WILL START AS SOON AS THE ELECTION IS DECIDED. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESPECTS SCIENTISTS AND WON'T CENSOR THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WILL IMMEDIATELY REACH OUT TO DR. ANTHONY FAUCI TO ASK HIM TO CONTINUES INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND I'LL HAVE FROM DAY ONE READY TO GO THE BEST MEDICAL EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO ADVISE ON OUR RESPONSE MAYBE , RESPONSE. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LISTEN TO THEM AND LET THEM SPEAK FREELY, AND I'LL WORK WITH THE GOVERNORS AND MAYORS OF BOTH PARTIES FROM EVERY STATE , TERRITORY, AND TRIBE. IT'S A SIMPLE PROPOSITION. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS TOGETHER. WE WILL EMERGE FROM THIS STRONGER BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND PROTECT OUR TROOPS. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THEY GAVE ME A LIST ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE. IS ALEX AP OUT THERE? CAN'T TELL WITH THE MASK ON. WE REPORTED YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE BRIEFED AS EARLY AS MARCH 2019 THAT RUSSIA HAD ORDERED OR OFFERED BOUNTIES TO THE TALIBAN FOR THE KILLING OF U.S. SOLDIERS. YOU CALLED HIS AN ACTION ON THE ISSUE A BETRAYAL. BROADLY, WHAT QUINCES , WHAT CONSEQUENCES DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD FACE FOR BETRAYAL AND WHAT SHOULD CONGRESS DO? JOE BIDEN: CONGRESS AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES FOR BOTH PARTIES SHOULD DEMAND FACTS. THIS SEEMS TO BE A MOVING STORY. AS I WAS LEAVING, I HAD THE TELEVISION ON AND I UNDERSTAND THERE IS MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT TODAY ABOUT WHAT WAS KNOWN. ONE OF TWO THINGS. THIS PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT COGNITIVE CAPABILITY BUT HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE COGNITIVELY AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON. HE EITHER READS AND/OR IS BRIEFED ON IMPORTANT ISSUES AND FORGETS IT, OR HE DOESN'T THINK IT IS NECESSARY THAT HE NEEDS TO KNOW IT. BUT THE FACT IS THAT AT A MINIMUM, THE DISCREPANCY ALLEGEDLY BETWEEN AND WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS REPORTED SOME THOUGHT IT WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS LESS CERTAIN. THAT SHOULD BE RESOLVED. ON DAY ONE, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE SAID, I WANT YOU TO COME BEFORE ME IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND LAY OUT THE DIFFERENCES IN DISCUSSIONS, WHO IS SAYING WHAT, LET US GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, IT IS CLEAR TO ME, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE DID, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED OUR JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF AND GOT THEM ALL IN ONE ROOM AND SAID, OK, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT THIS? WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREPARE TO DEAL WITH THIS, IF THIS IS HAPPENING? ? HOW ARE WE DOING THIS? WHAT ARE WE DOING? THIRDLY, AT A MINIMUM HE SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND SAID VLADIMIR, OLD BUDDY, IF ANY OF THIS IS TRUE, IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. A BIG PROBLEM. AND MAKE IT CLEAR, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH, I DO NOT HAVE CLASS , I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ANYMORE, BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD OVER THE LAST WEEK AND THE RECENT REPORTING THAT IT WAS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEF, THE PRESIDENT , IT IS SOMETHING I READ EVERY DAY AS VICE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT READ IT EVERY DAY AND I WAS BRIEFED EVERY MORNING BEFORE HE GOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEN AGAIN. SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW HE DID NOT KNOW OR IS NOT BEING BRIEFED IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY, IF THAT IS THE CASE. AND IF HE WAS BRIEFED AND NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT, THAT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. I GUESS THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO IN THIS IS I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE JILL. I DO NOT SEE HER GET OUTRAGED OFTEN. I STARTED ASKING, JILL, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF BEAU WAS STILL IN HARM'S WAY AND THIS INFORMATION CAME OUT AND, I APOLOGIZE, BEAU WAS MY SON AND SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN. WHAT ARE THE PARENTS THINKING? WHAT ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, HUSBANDS AND WIVES? IT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IF ANY OF THIS IS EVEN REMOTELY TRUE. SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR AND YOU SHOULD GET ANSWERS QUICKLY. WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD HE PHASE IF THE ALLEGATIONS AND REPORTS ARE TRUE? JOE BIDEN: IF THEY ARE TRUE WHEN HE DID NOTHING ABOUT ANY OF THIS, IN FACT I THINK THE PUBLIC SHOULD CONCLUDE THIS MAN IS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NBC MIGHT , MIGHT , MIKE. WHEN WE SAW YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, YOU ARE LOCKED IN A DIFFICULT BATTLE BUT POLLS TODAY SHOW YOU WITH A NATIONAL LEAD IN STATES THAT ARE CRITICAL IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WHERE DO YOU THINK THE RACE STANDS AT THIS MOMENT? WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT AS YOU LOOK AHEAD AND CAN YOU MAINTAIN THE ADVANTAGE WITHOUT CAMPAIGNING IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY? ESPECIALLY IN THE FALL WHEN VOTERS BEGIN TO TUNE IN? JOE BIDEN: THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN IN MODERN HISTORY. I START OFF WITH THE PREMISE THAT I WILL FOLLOW DOCTOR'S ORDERS NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR THE COUNTRY. THAT MEANS I AM NOT GOING TO BE HOLDING RALLIES, I AM NOT GOING TO BE , FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WERE HERE BUT SCHOOLS HAVE PUT THOSE CIRCLES AROUND SO EVERYONE IS SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. SO AS SOON AS I FINISH I WILL PUT MY MASK BACK ON. SO IT HAS ALMOST ALL BEEN VIRTUAL, ALTHOUGH I HAVE GONE TO HOUSTON AND HAVE TRAVELED. BUT I GET IN MAKE MY CASE, TAKE QUESTIONS, AND LEAVE. BUT YOU KNOW ME, I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE OUT THERE WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE I GET THE GREATEST FEEL, I CAN GET A SENSE BY THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES AND THE PLAINTIFF VOICES OF WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED, THE IRONY IS WE PROBABLY REACHED MORE PEOPLE DIRECTLY ON ONE-ON-ONE. PARTICULARLY THOSE OF YOU WITH TELEVISION STATIONS, YOU ALL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON, HAVING A ONE-TO-ONE CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE OUT THERE, BECAUSE ONE PERSON ON TV LOOKING AT YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY BEFORE. THEY TELL ME 200 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED WHAT I HAVE DONE FROM HOME AND A HALF A DOZEN THINGS WE HAVE GONE OUT AND DONE. SO THE IRONY IS I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY IN DETAIL WITH MORE PEOPLE THAN WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE DOING IT IN PERSON. SO FAR, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. I DO NOT WANT TO JINX MYSELF. THE POLLING DATA IS GOOD BUT IT IS EARLY, TOO EARLY TO MAKE A JUDGMENT. WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I PLAN ON LAYING OUT IN DETAIL MY ECONOMIC PLAN ON HOW TO RECOVER FROM THIS, PLAN ON DEALING WITH WORKING OUT IN DETAIL WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS COMING. I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. HAVE YOU REQUESTED A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO AS THE NOMINEE? HAS THE ADMINISTRATION OFFERED YOU A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING? JOE BIDEN: THEY HAVE NOT. IF THIS PROCEEDS, I MIGHT DO THAT. I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN POLICY STAFF, AS YOU KNOW. DOZENS OF THEM. I HAD A LONG MEETING WITH MY FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR'S, FORMER SECRETARIES, ETC. AND WHAT THEY HAVE HEARD SO FAR. BUT IF IT DOES NOT GET CLEARED UP QUICKLY, I WILL SEEK AND ASK IF I CAN BE BRIEFED. OVER THE WEEKEND, PRINCETON DECIDED TO REMOVE WOODROW WILSON'S NAME FROM THEIR SCHOOL BECAUSE OF RACIST THINKING. PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY CALLED THE DECISION INCREDIBLE STUPIDITY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PRINCETON , PRINCETON'S DECISION ON THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AND WE ARE SEEING THE REMOVAL OF STATUES AND NAMES FROM INSTITUTIONS AND SCHOOLS. DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO COME TO TERMS WITH OUR NATIONS HISTORY AND ITS LEADERS? WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE THE REMOVAL OF THESE STATUES? JOE BIDEN: I THINK THERE WERE THREE CATEGORIES. ONE, ANY INSTITUTION THAT CHOSE A NAME AND WANTS TO JETTISON THAT NAME NOW, THEY HAVE THAT DECISION TO MAKE FOR WHATEVER REASON. I AM ASSUMING THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY MADE THE JUDGMENT ABOUT THE WOODROW WILSON SCHOOL. I DO NOT KNOW. BUT IT WAS MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTITUTION THAT CHOSE THE NAME AND I'LL NO LONGER WANTS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I THINK THE PRESIDENT , WELL, SECONDLY, I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN, AS THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS SAID, A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMINDERS AND REMEMBRANCES OF HISTORY AND RECOVERING FROM HISTORY. SO THE IDEA OF COMPARING WHETHER OR NOT GEORGE WASHINGTON OWNED SLAVES OR THOMAS JEFFERSON OWNED SLAVES AND SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN REBELLION, COMMITTING TREASON, TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A UNION TO KEEP SLAVERY, I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION. SO I THINK THE IDEA, I THINK ALL OF THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS TO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS AND GENERALS ETC. WHO STRONGLY SUPPORTED SECESSION AND MAINTAINED SLAVERY AND WENT TOWARD TO DO IT, THOUGH STATUES BELONG IN MUSEUMS, NOT PUBLIC PLACES. IN REGARD TO THE STATUES AND MONUMENTS LIKE THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL, I THINK THERE IS AN OBLIGATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROTECT THOSE MONUMENTS, BECAUSE THAT IS A REMEMBRANCE, IT IS NOT DEALING WITH REVERING SOMEONE WHO HAD THAT VIEW. THEY HAD MUCH BROADER USE THAT ARE IN THE PAST THAT ARE NOW AND THEN DISTASTEFUL, BUT THAT'S A JUDGMENT FOR THE COUNCIL. FOR EXAMPLE, TOPPLING CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STATUE OR GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE, ETC., I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT FROM HAPPENING. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THESE PUBLIC EVENTS FOR THE PAST MONTH, WHICH HAS PUT YOU IN CONTACT WITH MORE PEOPLE. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS, AND IF SO, HOW FREQUENTLY ARE YOU DOING THAT? JOE BIDEN: I HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I HAVE HAD NO SYMPTOMS, AS MY BROTHER , AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, KNOCK ON WOOD. WHEN I HAVE NOT WANTED TO TAKE ANYONE ELSE'S PLACE IN THE PROCESS. BUT THE SECRET SERVICE GETS TESTED. THEY ARE AROUND MY HOME AND ANYONE WHO COMES INTO MY HOME, INCLUDING STAFF THAT COMES IN, IS TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE THE VIRUS. I EXPECT WHAT I WILL DO SO DOES NOT LOOK LIKE I AM MOVING INTO THE FRONT OF THE LINE IS TO BE TESTED RELATIVELY SOON. MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN TESTED. SHE WAS IN FLORIDA, SHE IS A SOCIAL WORKER WICKING , WORKING WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. BEFORE SHE CAME HOME SHE WAS TESTED TWICE TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS CLEAR. BUT I HAVE NOT YET TESTED YET. I AM NOT SURE WHO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO NEXT. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I GET TO THE WILMINGTON NEWSPAPER OR I WILL BE DEAD. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. JOE BIDEN: I WILL. THE MORE I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, I YESTERDAY YOU SAID AT A FUNDRAISER REGARDING VLADIMIR PUTIN, I WILL CONFRONT VLADIMIR PUTIN, STRENGTHEN NATO, MAKE CLEAR TO VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT HE WILL HAVE A PRICE TO PAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO HIM IF THIS IS TRUE AND IF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST? JOE BIDEN: I WOULD TELL HIM, HERE IS THE DEAL. THE IDEA THAT PUTIN OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN LEADER CAN ENGAGE IN ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE IDEA THAT HE CONTINUES HIS ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE THAT HE IS DOING, AND THE IDEA THAT IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF I AM PRESIDENT AND MY ADMINISTRATION. THAT RANGES FROM EVERYTHING FROM MAKING SURE WE GO TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL ALL THE WAY TO IMPOSING SANCTIONS THAT WOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACTION THAT HE HAS TAKEN THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT I HAVE HAD SOME VERY BLUNT, STRAIGHTFORWARD CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT , I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE MORE COMPETITION. THE SUPREME COURT. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD ISSUE AN UPDATED LIST OF POTENTIAL NOMINEES TO THE COURT. YOU HAVE SAID HE WOULD PUT A BLACK WOMAN ON THE COURT IF A SPOT OPENED UP. THERE ARE CALLS FOR YOU TO RELEASE A LIST OF NAMES. ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT? I HESITATE TO DO ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT DIES BECAUSE HE USUALLY DOES IT ALL WRONG. WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A LIST OF A GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE QUALIFIED AND HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO BE IN THE COURT. I WILL NOT RELEASE IT UNTIL WE GET FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. I AM NOT RELEASING THE NAMES OF VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WOMEN OF COLOR, LATINO WOMEN OR ASIAN, ACROSS-THE-BOARD. WE HAD JUST UNDERWAY, GOING INTO THE DEEP BACKGROUND CHECKS. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. THIS IS A TWO-PARTER. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF THOSE REPORTS ARE TRUE THAT TRUMP IS GUILTY OF VIOLATING HIS OATH OF OFFICE? YOU SAID YOU WANT YOUR RUNNING MATE TO BE READY ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB. DO YOU THINK THEY COULD BE READY ON DAY ONE? IT. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO , TRY TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BACKGROUND AND EXPERTISE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE. ONE OF THE REASONS PRESIDENT OBAMA PICKED ME IS THAT I HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE GETTING THINGS DONE IN THE CONGRESS. ALTHOUGH HE HAD CLEAR VIEWS, , WHAT HIS STRATEGY WAS, HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD DAY-TO-DAY EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH THAT IS HELPFUL, IT IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE I START OFF WITH THE PLACES I HAVE EXPERTISE. SO, ALMOST ALL OF THE WOMEN I AM CONSIDERING HAVE HAD SOME EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUES, BUT NOT IS NOT A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THEY HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY, TEMPERAMENT, AS WELL AS A LEADERSHIP QUALITY THAT LENDS EVERYONE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE READY ON DAY ONE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. IN REGARDS TO WHETHER , IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HE DID AND WHAT HE KNEW, BUT AT A MINIMUM, EITHER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HIS JOB AND IS HAVING DIFFICULTY SITTING DOWN AND BEING ABLE TO READ A REPORT , BECAUSE A LOT OF REPORTS COME ACROSS THAT HE DID NOT READ IT OR SEE IT. I DO NOT KNOW HOW HE COULD NOT READ SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP ACROSS THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT IS CLEARLY A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IT IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERYONE, INCLUDING MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS AND MY REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE ARE WORRIED ABOUT AS WELL. WHERE IS THE DELAWARE STATE NEWS? THE DELAWARE NEWS JOURNAL? THAT IS MY HOMETOWN TEAM. HOW ARE YOU? LIKE OTHER STATES, DELAWARE IS SEEING AN INCREASE IN CORONAVIRUS CASES. YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR HOW THEY HAVE HANDLED THE PANDEMIC SO FAR AND HOW THEY WILL I THINK YOU ICING THE GOVERNOR MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. IT WAS ONE OF THE STATES , I GET BRIEFED EVERY DAY BY A GROUP OF DOCTORS AROUND THE COUNTRY. EVERY DAY, AND GET , I GET A PRINTOUT OF THE STATE DOING BETTER AND DOING WORSE. NOW, IT IS OPENING UP SLIGHTLY. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THEM TODAY. I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT HOW THAT OCCURRED. I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT HAS FLATTENED OUT. I HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE DETAILS WITH THE GOVERNOR, NOR HAVE I , I DO NOT SPEAK WITH HIM FREQUENTLY, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS POPPING UP. THE WAY TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE IS , HOW TO SAY THIS POLITELY. IT IS TO LOWER THE RHETORIC BASED ON DIVISION. STOP APPEALING TO THE LESS HEALTHY SIDE OF SOCIETY. INSTEAD OF WHEN A GOLF CART GOES BY YELLING WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE PRESIDENT TWEETS IT OUT , DO NOT DO THINGS LIKE THAT. BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE ARE GIVING A PORTION OF THE POPULATION, WHO HAS RESPONDED A SORT OF FREE PASS. IT GENERATES DIVISION. YOU'RE ALSO TALKING IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT MANHOOD AND EATING STRONG, YOU DO NOT NEED THE MASK. WE NEED TO START APPEALING TO THE BETTER SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE BY POINTING OUT THAT THE MASK IS NOT SO MUCH TO PROTECT ME. IT IS IF I HAVE BEEN I , UNDIAGNOSED. IT IS TO PROTECT YOU FROM ME AND PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS CALLED PATRIOTISM. IT IS CALLED RESPONSIBILITY, LOOKING OUT FOR THE OTHER PERSON. WE HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME , THE PRESIDENT PUTS EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF HIMSELF. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS I DO NOT THINK OR I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. OR I BELIEVE THAT. IT IS ABOUT US, AND I THINK CHANGING THE TONE OF AN ADMINISTRATION ACROSS-THE-BOARD, ALLOWING SCIENTISTS TO SPEAK, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE FACTS. WHEN A MISTAKE IS MADE, SAY, I MADE A MISTAKE. I WAS WRONG. ALL THOSE THINGS CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER, NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, NO MATTER HOW RESPONSIBLE OR IRRESPONSIBLE. A PRESIDENT CAN TAKE US TO WAR OR BRING PEACE. APPEALED TO THE SENIOR SIDE OF HUMANITY. IT MATTERS. IT REALLY MATTERS. I THINK IT IS ABOUT THE TONE, AND IT GOES ACROSS THE BOARD. I KNOW THAT I WAS CRITICIZED DURING THE PRIMARY BY SAYING THAT I PLAN ON UNITING THE COUNTRY, BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO DO THAT. IF WE CANNOT, WE CANNOT FUNCTION. WE HAVE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. ON THIS PIECE, IF WE STAND UP , BY THE WAY, YOU CAN CORRECT ME ON THIS, BUT I THINK SOMETHING LIKE 74 OR 75% OF AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD WEAR A MASK. SOME THINK WE SHOULD OPEN MORE SLOWLY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING AND ACTUALLY MAKING PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY FOR NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. APPEAL TO THEIR BETTER NATURE. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ALMOST IDEALISTIC, BUT IT IS NOT. REMIND PEOPLE. IF YOU DO NOT WEAR THIS MASK, YOU END UP HURTING SOMEONE OR YOU GET INFECTED. YOU COULD TAKE IT HOME TO YOUR CHILD, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR FATHER, YOUR HUSBAND OR WIFE. YOU HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION BECAUSE IT IS. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU. I REALLY DO HAVE TO GO. I APOLOGIZE. I AM GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE. GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF MONUMENTS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE FATHER'S OF THIS COUNTRY. OUR CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS WERE THE? SHOULD THEY BE TORN DOWN WITHOUT THE VOTE OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS? I THINK IT IS DIFFERENT. I THINK IT IS BETTER IF IT IS TAKEN DOWN THE SAME WAY THAT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS TAKEN OFF OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE FLAG. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ANGER AND ANGUISH THAT PEOPLE FEEL BY HAVING THEN UNDER THE STATUE OF ROBERT E LEE. IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO DO IT PEACEFULLY. THOSE MONUMENTS , I SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MOVE. PUT THEM IN MUSEUMS. GET THEM DOWN, BUT DO NOT EXPECT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, FINALLY GOING TO ANOTHER PHASE OF MAJOR RESPONDING TO THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN AMERICA. DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF SOMEONE PULLED DOWN A STATUE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS. IT IS BETTER THAT THEY DO NOT, BUT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN PULLING DOWN THE STATUE OR GOING TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL TO TRY , NOT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL. THAT IS A BAD EXAMPLE. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL. YES. THREE. I AM COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL DEBATE GROUP THAT SETS UP THESE DEBATES. IT HAS BEEN THIS WAY FOR A LONG TIME. THE FIRST ONE IS A ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE. THE OTHER ONE IS A TOWN MEETING SETTING. ANOTHER IS A NORMAL DEBATE. I COMMIT TO THOSE AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM. SOME HAVE SPECULATED THAT YOU ARE SUBJECT TO SOME DEGREE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE. I AM 65 AND I DO NOT HAVE THE WORD RECOLLECTION THAT I USED TO HAVE. YOU HAVE 12 YEARS ON ME. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED FOR SOME DEGREE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE?

HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HIS PLAN TO BOOST FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HOSTED BY THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, THIS IS ABOUT 40 MINUTES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I'M JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. AND LILY THANKS FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER AND FOR THE ENERGY AND LEADERSHIP YOU BROUGHT TO THIS INDISPENSABLE ORGANIZATION. YOU KNOW, YOU ALL HEAD UP A UNION, AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS , HOLDS THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN YOUR HANDS. AND WHAT DETERMINES TO OUR CHILDREN DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS NATION. THEY'RE OUR CHILDREN. THEY LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITION AA LOT OF. AND YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR HANDS. AND YOUR MEMBERS ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. AND I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THAT BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE AS I SAID NEITHER ONE OF YOU MEMBERS. JILL AND I ARE TRULY HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AND I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. I CAN'T WAIT TO REPLACE BETSY DEVOS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRUST , TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS TOGETHER BECAUSE I'M CONFIDENT , I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN WIN. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TEACHER ORIENTED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO COME FROM THE TOP DOWN. IT'S GOING TO COME ARE THE TEACHERS UP. I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES. BUT THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE IS THE CONTINUAL SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR. LOOK, WE SAW THIS CHALLENGE COMING. I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR THE PRESIDENT SINCE LATE JANUARY. DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON TESTING, CONTACT TRACING, CREATING RESPONSIBLE STANDARDS, EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL AND TO GET EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. AND YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS NEEDED. FRANKLY, WE'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD. BACK IN 2009 WHEN I WAS OVERSEAING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOVERY ACT IN THE FACE OF THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, WITH KNEW WE , WE KNEW WE HAD TO STAND UP FOR EDUCATORS. IT WAS ALMOST AN $84 BILLION PROGRAM THAT HAD TO GET THROUGHOUT WITHIN THE MATTER OF 16 , PROBABLY 18 MONTHS. AND HAD LESS FRAUD, LESS THAN .2 OF 1%. HERE'S WHAT IT DID. IT ALLOCATED $60 BILLION TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 400,000 EDUCATION JOBS. WE KNEW IT HAD TO BE DONE IN THE FACE OF THE CRISIS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY STATE HAS , REQUIRES TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET. LOCALITIES HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T DEAL WITH CRISIS LIKE THIS. AND THIS TIME AROUND TRUMP TRIED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FAILED , TRIED TO SUPPORT EDUCATORS. TRUMP FAILED TO DO IT. TRUMP AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE FACING HUGE SHORT FALSE. SPEAKER PELOSI, A REAL LEADER IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DID THEIR JOB. THEY GOT SOMETHING DONE CALLED THE HEROES ACT $950 BILLION FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TRUMP REFUSED TO DO THE JOB. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE. SO I'M MAKING SURE EDUCATOR'S SALARY DON'T GET CUT AND EDUCATORS DON'T GET FIRED. WE COULD HAVE KEPT EVERY EDUCATOR EMPLOYED. BUT INSTEAD WE LOST 900,000 EDUCATION JOBS DUE TO BUDGET CUTS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. WE'RE ALREADY SHORT THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WE NEED NATIONALLY BEFORE THIS CRISIS. LAST MONTH, I PUT OUT A PLAN TO REOPEN SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY INCLUDING FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I REQUIRE STEPS LIKE ONE INSURING THE SCHOOLS HAVE FUNDING FOR PHYSICAL LIKE PLEXIGLAS TO MAXIMIZE SOCIAL DISTANCING, ALL THE THINGS THAT SCIENTISTS TELL US WE NEED TO DO. AND WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CLEAR GUIDANCE. FINALLYER WE NEED TO PREVENT FURTHER EXACERBATING INEQUITIES IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. WITH BROADBAND AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN LEARNING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT WE'LL NEED TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON REMOTE LEARNING AND PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR A WHILE LONGER. AND WE SEE, AND ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE STUDENT'S ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY CAN COST KIDS UP TO A YEAR OF LEARNING WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE NOW. WE'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR A WHILE IT'S ONLY JUST A PART BECAUSE ONCE WE GET AHEAD OF THIS PANDEMIC, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR STUDENTS GET TREATED WITH DIGNITY THAT YOU DESERVE. MY EDUCATION PLAN IS TRIPLING THE FUNDING, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT JUST DISTRICTS ARE SENIOR TO DO IS INSURE HIGHER LEARNING EDUCATION MONEY. HIGHER SALARIES FOR EDUCATORS. THAT MONEY WOULD ELIMINATE THE $23 BILLION ANNUAL GAP BETWEEN MAJORITY WHITE AND NONWHITE DISTRICTS. IT'S ONE OF THE SINGLE BEST INSTRUMENTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY. IN ADDITION TO GETTING THE RAISE THAT YOU DESERVE, WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED. WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBERS WITH SOCIAL WORKERS IN SCHOOL. MENTAL HEALTH IS AN ENORMOUS ISSUE. AND THE NEED IS ONLY GETTING EXACERBATED BY THIS PANDEMIC ON BOTH EDUCATORS AS WELL AS STUDENTS. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE IN MY PLAN. WE'RE GOING TO FIX UNIVERSAL PRE-K FOR ALL 3-YEAR-OLDS. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS WHEN WE WIN THIS ELECTION, WE'RE GOING TO GET THE SUPPORT YOU NEED AND THE RESPECT YOU DESERVE. YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IF I DON'T LISTEN I'M GOING TO GET A REPORT IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM , WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY COMMITTED TO MAKE SO MUCH MORE PROGRESS. THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I WISH I COULD TALK LONGER ABOUT HOW PASSIONATE I FEEL ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY HUSH UP AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS. YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW. I WASN'T ARGUING WITH YOU. SO HERE , [LAUGHTER] HERE IS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED OUR SUPPORT IN THE PRIMARY THAT IS ALMOST OVER. AND THAT PART OF OUR PROCESS NOW IS FOR YOU TO MAKE YOUR CASE TO THE 8,000 , ALMOST 8,000 DELEGATES THAT ARE WATCHING YOU RIGHT NOW. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ASKED IS TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS WHO ASKED THEM, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WANTING THAT. I COULD IS IT HERE AND I COULD READ THEM TO YOU. BUT WE TOOK YOU UP ON THAT. WE FOUND SOME DELEGATES WHO HAD ASKED SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS THAT CAME TO US. WE SAID GO UP. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM JOE BIDEN? AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAD 88 MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THOSE QUESTIONS ONLINE. AND OF THE THOUSANDS, THESE ARE THE DELEGATES THAT WERE SELECTED. SO LET'S GO NOW TO TURQUOISE PARKER IN DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA. TURQUOISE IS A K-5 MEDIA SPECIALIST. TURQUOISE, YOU MAY NOW ASK YOUR QUESTION TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TURQUOISE. HELLO, PRESIDENT LILY AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MY NAME IS TURQUOISE LEGUME PARKER. I'M A MEDIA COORDINATOR. BUT SELF-GIVEN TITLE IS RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE TEACHER. THIS UPCOMING YEAR WILL BE MY 10TH YEAR TEACHING. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE FOLKS BRE ONA TAYLOR KILLED TO BE CHARGED YEARS AGO. BUT YOU ARE CURRICULUM AFFIRMS AND FURTHER THE AFOREMENTIONED. I CALL MY STUDENTS NOT STUDENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR STRENGTHED A THEIR BEAUTY. AND I NEED THEM TO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES BECAUSE OUR WORLD DOES NOT MAKE THEM FEEL THAT WAY. ABOLITIONIST IS TEACHING MY DUTY. IT'S MY DUTY TO STRUCTURE A CURRICULUM THAT HELP THRUSE ALL KINDS OF ISSUES SUCH AS POLICE BRUTALITY, HOW TO FIGHT IT. AND HOW THEY CAN COME TO TERMS WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACY AT ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. TEACHING IN THE RESISTANCE IS INCREDIBLY HARD WORK BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE WE NEED OUR KIDS TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY A PART OF THIS MOVEMENT TO SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY. SO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, HERE'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT FIGHTING IF THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. BUT HOW WILL YOU WORK WITH OTHERS TO CHANGE THIS SYSTEM THAT HAS BENEFITED CORRUPT SOULS FROM DAY ONE? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE CAREER THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED. THIS HAS TO BE A WAKE-UP CALL FOR THE COUNTRY. TAKE ACTION. YOU KNOW, IT'S PAST TIME TO DO THAT. AND IN OUR ECONOMIC INEQUITIES, OUR NATION CAN DO THAT WITH SO MANY PEOPLE. IT STARTS OFF AS YOU DO BECAUSE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT NEVER TAUGHT YOUNG PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING IS TO TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT, TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY. TELL THEM ABOUT KEEP HOLDING THEIR HEAD UP HIGH. NOT ONLY THEN, BUT , REMINDING THEM THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL, ANYTHING AT ALL EXCEPT FOR , I'M GOING TO FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR THE CHANGES THAT I'VE REFERENCED. BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO LISTEN. I LAID OUT THE INITIAL PROCESS SO THEY CAN LEAD TO TAKE ON REAL POLICE REFORM FOR ALL COPS TO HIGHER STANDARDS. SO MANY KNOW NOW. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HEARD AND THOSE YOUNG STUDENTS YOU MAY HAVE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, THEY FIND OUT THEY HAVE A MOM OR DAD TREATED UNFAIRLY OR MAYBE EVEN FAIRLY BUT INCARCERATED. AND WHEN THEY GET OUT OF SCHOOL, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON? WHAT HAPPENS? THEY'RE TREATED AS IF THEY'RE STILL IN PRISON. NOT LIKE IT IS PUNISHMENT. NO ONE SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE ABUSE OF DRUGS. GO REHAB YOURSELF. REHABILITATING THEM. WE NEED TO DO THAN JUST REFORM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES. AFTER TAKING CARE OF EDUCATION, OUR ECONOMY AND OUR HEALTHCARE. I'M GOING TO FIGHT THE DEADLY HEALTHCARE ISSUES INCLUDING COVID-19 BY EXPANDING THE CARE. SO THEY DON'T SEE YOUR PARENT'S FAMILY AND CAN'T GO FOR A TEST BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. WELL, I'M REALLY FEELING SUCK, BUT I'M AFRAID IF I GO IT'S GOING TO , FOR FASTEST UNIVERSAL SCARE EXPAND OBAMACARE AND A DETAILED WAY TO DO IT. I'M GOING TO DOUBLE THE FUNDING FOR HEALTH CENTERS. ON THE VITAL FRONT LINES. MAKING ALL TESTING AND TREATMENT VACCINE FOR ANYONE , AND THE FIGHT TO GIVE EVERY CHILD , I REALLY WANT TO KNOW THIS BECAUSE IN ALL THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE COME UP WITH SO MANY STARTING NEW WEBSITES. YOU'VE GOT 40% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN IS DEVELOPED BY TIME THEY'RE 3. PROVIDING UNIVERSAL PRE-K INCREASES 58% THE CHANCE OF THEM DOING WELL ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. TRIPLING TITLE ONE FUNDING TO CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR. MAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS FREE FOR EVERY FAMILY EARNING LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. I PROPOSE WE GET $75 BILLION THROUGH HBC BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF FUNDING TO COMPETE THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. WE WILL PROVIDE STIMULUS MONEY TO SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU ALL KNOW BETTER THAN I DO. BUT I KNOW PRETTY DARN WELL THAT A COMMUNITY , COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY POOR COMMUNITY, LATINO OR IN THAT COMMUNITY THEY HAVE THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, THE LOCAL DRUGSTORE, THE LOCAL SUPERMARKET. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS UNDER THIS UNFAIR RECOVERY THAT TRUMP IS RUNNING, THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY , WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO DO. PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS MONEY FOR THOSE WITH FEWER BUSINESSES. SO THEY CAN STAY OPEN. THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE LONES. THEY SHOULD BE GETTING IT. IN THIS SMALL INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY AND THAT IT GENERATES SELF-AWARENESS, GENERATES COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, AND THESE ARE BIG THINGS. BUT IF EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT'S TIME FOR BIG CHANGE NOW, WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS AT LEAST AN ACTION TO REVERSE SYSTEMIC RACISM WITH LONG OVERDUE CONCRETE CHANGE. BUT WE CAN DO IT. BECAUSE ONE THING, WE REACHED , AND THAT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE INFLECTION POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND BIG CHANGES OCCUR. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS COVID VIRUS AND SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED BY IT. SO MANY PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY DIED BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE ARE REALIZING, OH, MY GOD, WHO HAS BEEN CARRYING US ON OUR BACK? ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHO ARE THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK, LATINO. AND THEY'RE GETTING PAID $5, $6, $7 AN HOUR. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO STAY HOME. THEY'VE BEEN CARRYING US ON THEIR BACK. I THINK THE PUBLIC IS READY. IT'S LIKE THEY'VE HAD THEIR BLINDERS TAKEN OFF. BUT OH, MY GOD, THIS REALLY HAPPENED? IT'S REALLY THIS WAY? AND I THINK I'VE MET , I'VE SPENT TIME WITH THE FORD FAMILY , FLOYD FAMILY. I CAN'T BREATHE. I CAN'T BREATHE. MAMA. MAMA. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, THE WHOLE WORLD SAW IT AND THEY JUST DIDN'T HEAR IT. THEY SAW IT. THEY SAW IT. THEY SAW HIS FACE SMASHED UP AGAINST THE CURVE. THEY SAW HIM HOLDING THERE FOR A TOTAL EIGHT MINUTES AND 26 SECONDS. THEY SAW IT. AND THEY SAID OH, MY GOD. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT. WE'RE GOING CHANGE IT IN A BIG WAY. LAST THING I'LL SAY, AS A KID, I USED TO STUTTER A LOT. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING DON'T DO, DON'T EVER TALK DOWN TO THESE KIDS. AND THEY TELL ME , I'M SORRY, DON'T FINISH MY SENTENCE. THESE KIDS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO. LET'S NOT DUMB IT DOWN. THEY'RE INCREDIBLY CAPABLE. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE THESE PLACEMENT COURSE AS WELL. CHILDREN TEND TO TURN OUT TO BE WHAT YOU EXPECT OF THEM. LET'S SHOW THEM THE LOVE AND RESPECT, AND , AND THE SUPPORT. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEIR PARENTS MORE ECONOMIC POWER. A LOT MORE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. WE CAN DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOU. THANK YOU. , FOR QUOICE FOR THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION. WE GOT THAT FROM A LOT OF DELEGATES. AND THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE , THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFTING THAT UP. AND THANK YOU VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ONE OF OUR EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS IN MICHIGAN. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE TEACHERS, WE ARE SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS, WE ARE COLLEGE STAFF, AND FACULTY, AND SO THIS IS ONE OF WHAT WE CALL ESP'S, EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. YOU KNOW, SHE HAS FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH OUR VERY UNQUALIFIED SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DEVOS. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO PAULA MCCONNELL WHO IS A PARA PROFESSIONAL IN THE UTICA SCHOOL DISTRICT. PAULA, YOU NOW HAVE THE EAR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK? THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MILLY. GOOD AFTERNOON, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MY NAME IS PAULA MCCONNELL. I AM FROM MCHOME COUNTY IN THE GREAT LAKE STATE OF MICHIGAN. I'VE BEEN A PARA EDUCATOR FOR OVER 30 YEARS IN UTICA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC, WE AS EDUCATORS HAVE SOME CONCERNS. WE WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP , SEE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHING THROUGH YOU THE IMMEDIATE OPENING OF SCHOOLS AND THE HIGHLY UNQUALIFY BETSY DEVOS EITHER HAS NOTHING TO SAY OR IS GIVING SCARCE PUBLIC SCHOOL HOURS TO PRIVATE EDUCATION AND WE FACE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS TO THREATEN FUNDING WHICH PUTS EDUCATORS AT RISK. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO EDUCATORS AND PARENTS WHO ARE SO DESPERATE FOR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES BUT FIND NONE WITH THE PRESENTED A MINISTRATION. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: YOU KNOW, TO PARRA PHRASE TEDDY ROOSEVELT. HE SAID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HANDLE BAD NEWS, BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT. THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT IS NOW. AMERICANS HAVE SEEN THIS. IT'S COME TIME TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER TO BEAT THIS VIRUS. BUT HE SQUANDERED THAT SACRIFICE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM. THINK ABOUT IT. HE THINKS THE PRESIDENCY IS ABOUT HIM. IT DOESN'T HAVE A DAMN THING TO DO ABOUT HIM. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT TO TELL THE TRUTH OCCASIONALLY. WE'LL DO THE WORK. BUT WHO'S GOING TO LEAD? WE NEED A PLAN. I'VE OUTLINED THE KEY STEPS FOR REOPENING SAFELY INCLUDING BY OPENING CHILDCARE AND SCHOOLS REOPEN. PARENTS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK WHEN THAT OCCURS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS TO REOPENING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. EDUCATORS MAKE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES. THEY'VE DONE THE HARD WORK TO MAKE THE SHIFT OF ONLINE LEARNING. IT'S NOT THE EDUCATOR'S FAULT BECAUSE THEY COME FROM POOR FAMILIES AND BECAUSE MANY PLACES DON'T HAVE , BUT THE LONGER THE SCHOOL CLOSED THE CLASSES ARE REMOTE, THE MORE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR FALL BEHIND. I WOULD POSSIBLY LIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE STEP ONE, PROVIDE FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. MAKE SURE STATES AND DISTRICTS HAVE THE FUNDING TO KEEP EDUCATORS ON THE JOB IN THE MIDST OF THIS CRISIS. BOOST FEDERAL FUNDING TO COVER THE COST OF P.P.E., REDESIGN CLASSROOMSINGS ALL THE THINGS SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO TO REOPEN AND OPEN WITH NORMALITY. SCALE RESEARCH AND HOW COVID AFFECTS CHILDREN. HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THE VIRUS AFFECTS CHILDREN AND CREATE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDANCE. BUILD A SAFER SCHOOL BEST PRACTICE CLEARINGHOUSE. AND TO HELP SCHOOL AND SCHOOL BOARDS AND CHILDREN AND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO SHARE INFORMATION APPROACHES AND PAUSE FOR REOPENING. WORK WITH CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. UNION, COMMUNITY AND FAMILIES ON HOW TO REOPEN SAFELY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE ARE NOT 50 DIFFERENT NATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND TERRITORIES, BEYOND THAT TERRITORIES. WE ARE , WE ARE ONE NATION. ONE NATION. AND WE ACT AND , AND THE WAY THE PRESIDENT TRIES TO TURN THIS INTO ALL SOME KIND OF RACIAL CONTEST ABOUT, I THINK IT JUST , IT'S , IT'S IMMORAL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE BASED ON SCIENCE, BASED ON WHAT THE EXPERTS TELL US. AND BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ALLOW TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE INPUT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE FIELD, IN THE CLASSROOM, IN THE BUILDINGS DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM. LOOK, EVEN WHEN YOU GET THERE, WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TEST AND TRACE WHICH DOESN'T EXIST VERY MUCH IN THE COUNTRY, HOW ABOUT A PRESIDENT THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, STOP THE TESTING, IT'S SHOWING TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT? STOP THE TESTING? YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH. HE SAID SLOW IT DOWN. WHAT IN GOD'S , THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIM. THIS IS ABOUT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR PEOPLE. AND PARENTS INCLUDING TEACHERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK UNTIL THEY'RE SURE THEIR CHILDREN COME AND ONE SOUL WHO IS 1-3 YEARS OLD ARE ABLE TO BE TAKEN CARE SAFELY. WE CAN DO IT. THE PUBLIC IS READY TO PAY FOR IT. IT WILL INCREASE PRODUCTIVE ANY THIS COUNTRY. IT WILL INCREASE SALARY AND INCREASE THE BENEFITS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, PAULA. AND THANK YOU, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WE HAVE ONE YOU MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. OUR FINAL EDUCATOR COMES FROM ENOLA, PENNSYLVANIA JUST OUTSIDE OF HARRISBURG. WE PICKED PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOR YOU AND NOT BECAUSE OUR VICE PRESIDENT BECKY BRINGLE IS STANDING OVER HERE MAKING NOISE. YES. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. GOOD GRIEF. BECKY BRINGLE, I KNOW YOU KNOW BECKY, BUT SHE LIVED IN HARRISBURG FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. JIMBO LAMB, APPARENTLY YOUR GOOD FRIEND, I DID NOT KNOW THAT IS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER. JIMBO, YOU ARE ON WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? I'M A TEACHER IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION FOR 17 YEARS. I APPRECIATE YOU PROVIDING TIME FOR ME TO ASK THIS QUESTION AND FOR LISTENING TO EDUCATORS. TODAY, WE'RE MORE DIVIDED THAN WE HAVE BEEN AT ANY TIME IN MY LIFETIME WHETHER IT IS ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE, WEARING MASKS OR SIMPLY A PERSON'S RIGHT. AS EDUCATORS, WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS TO BE RESPECTFUL, KIND AND TO WORK WITH OTHERS. BUT OUR LEADERS FAIL TO MODEL THIS BEHAVIOR. SO HERE'S MY QUESTION, AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HEAR THE VOICES OF ALL AMERICANS NOT JUST THOSE THAT SUPPORT YOUR AGENDA? WELL, JIMBO, I , I'M A PENNSYLVANIA GUY WHO MARRIED A PHILLY GIRL. AND I WAS JUST OUT IN HARRISBURG. I WAS , ANYWAY, LOOK, WHEN I STARTED THE CAMPAIGN OVER A YEAR AGO AND I ANNOUNCED. I SAID ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS UNITE THE COUNTRY AND I GOT CLOBBERED BY EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THE DEMOCRATS. THEY SAID YOU CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF WE CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY, WE'RE IN DEEP, DEEP, DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. NOT BECAUSE I'M ON IT BECAUSE FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL RUIN THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. AND THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY IS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. LIVES AN LIVELIHOODS AS WELL. I THINK WE'RE FACING A SERIOUS THREAT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT AS ONE COUNTRY. THIS PRESIDENT GIVES US NO DIRECTION. AND PUTS US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. YOU CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS IN THE NATION. HALF ARE WEARING MASKS. HALF OF THE PLAN. HALF JUST HOPING FOR THE BEST. THIS COUNTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP AND FOR HEALING. THAT'S PART OF A PRESIDENT'S JOB TO LEAD, TO LISTEN AND TO HEAL. AND TO LISTEN TO EVERYONE. IT'S TOO PERSONAL AND TOO UGLY. IT WEAKNESS US. IT DISTRACTS US. IT DIVIDES US. IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. AND I REFUSE TO ACCEPT OUR NATION IS PERMANENTLY DIVIDED. IT IS NOT. PRINCIPALS MUST NEVER BE COMPROMISED. BUT COMPROMISE IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. IT'S HOW OUR GOVERNMENT WAS DESIGNED TO WORK. I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE. AND SO I'LL DO THIS AS PRESIDENT. BUT THERE ARE TWO REASONS, JIM, I DECIDED TO RUN THIS TIME. YOU KNOW, IF EVERY , IF THE PERFECT PRESIDENT , IF SHE OR HE REQUIRES TO HAVE 10 GREAT ATTRIBUTES, I'VE NOT MET ONE THAT HAS MORE THAN SIX. BUT ALL THE ATTRIBUTES THAT YOU HAVE MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT IN HISTORY. THERE ARE TWO THINGS I'VE DONE VERY WELL AT. ONE, NO ONE HAS DOUBTED MY WORD. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS FOR THE PAST DECADES TO DEAL WITH BIG ISSUES. THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT, JIMBO. I NEVER QUESTIONED WHETHER A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES. I QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT BUT NOT THEIR MOTIVES. WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED IN 1972, I WAS ONLY 29 YEARS OLD. SO I HAD TO WAIT. MY BIRTHDAY DIDN'T COME UNTIL 17 DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION. I WAS IN WASHINGTON. ON DECEMBER 18. NOW, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER WHO SAID, I FELT SO BADLY FOR HIM IN RETROSPECT. HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO COME HOME. THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT. WHAT HAPPENED? AND THE POOR KID JUST BLURTED OUT, YOUR WIFE IS DEAD. YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEAD AND YOUR TWO BOYS MAY NOT MAKE IT. MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER WAS 18 MONTHS OLD. MY SON ALMOST 3. THE OTHER ONE ALMOST 4. THEY WERE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. THE TREE WAS ON TOP OF THE CAR. THEY WERE BROADSIDED BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER AND THEY WERE KILLED. THE TWO BOYS MADE IT. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS I DECIDE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR. AND MY BROTHER JIMBO, , WHEN I WAS A KID WE CALLED HIM JIMBO. HIS NAME IS JAMES. WELL, JIMBO IS FIVE AND A HALF YEARS YOUNGER. RAISED ALL OUR MONEY, THE KIDDIE CAMPAIGN WE HAD. BUT THE STATE COULD ALWAYS GET ANOTHER SENATOR. MY KIDS COULDN'T GET ANOTHER DAD. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS SENATORS AND THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO RUN. YOU'VE GOT TO BE SWORN IN. AND IN RETROSPECT, THEY SAVED MY SANITY. JUST STAYED FOR SIX MONTHS. JUST STAYED FOR SIX MONTHS. I'LL NEVER FORGET, THE SENATOR SAYING, ONLY 1702 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SWORN INTO THE SENATE. YOUR WIFE WORKED SO HARD TO GET YOU ELECTED. YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FAMILY. SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO SWORN IN. I DECIDED NOT TO GO. WELL, THE NEXT DAY, I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH MY SON, AND THEY SENT UP THE SEX E SECRETARY OF THE SENATE WHO SWORE ME INTO THE , SENT UP THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE WHO SWORE ME IN THE HOSPITAL. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WAS I HAD TO MEET WITH MAJORITY LEADER AT 2:00 DEPENDING ON THE WEEK ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. AND I GET AN ASSIGNMENT FROM THE LEADER, MIKE MASS FROM MONTANA. I THOUGHT ALL SENATORS GOT ASSIGNMENTS. NO SENATORS GET ASSIGNMENTS. MATTER OF FACT I'M THE FIRST SENATOR I EVER KNEW I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE, SIX WEEKS, TO TAKE ME PULSE TO THE SEE HOW I WAS EMOTIONALLY. SO WE WALK IN. JUST BEFORE 2:00, WALKED DOWN FROM BELOW THE SENATE. WALKED OUT THERE, THERE WERE NO LEADERS AND I HAD MY MEETING. THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS IS I WALK IN THE DOOR, AND TWO FRIENDS OF MINE, ONE BECAME A GREAT FRIEND AND STILL IS BOB DOFMENTE AND THE OTHER WAS TEDDY KENNEDY. THEY INTRODUCED THE DISABILITIES ACT. AND A PARTICULAR SENATOR GOT ELECTED WHO DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A HEART I THOUGHT. WAS ON THE FLOOR JUST SAYING , THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT TAXPAYERS SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR LIVES ON THE BUSES. BUT I HAD TO GO OFF AND HAVE MY MEETING. I HAD TO IS IT ACROSS THE DESK WHAT'S THE MATTER, JOE? AND I THEN WENT OFF TO THE STORY SAYING THERE WAS NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE, NO HEART, ETC., ETC. JOE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU THAT SENATOR AND HIS WIFE WERE SITTING IN YOUR HOME IN DECEMBER 1970? THIS IS NOW MAY OF 1973. 1970. AND HE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN OUR STATEWIDE NEWSPAPER. THAT'S HIM EMBRACING ME UNDER HIS ARM WITH TWO STEEL CRUTCHES. . HE LOOKED OUT AND SAID ALL I WANT FROM CHRISTMAS IS FOR SOMEONE TO LOVE ME AND TAKE ME HOME. I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT I ADOPTED THAT YOUNG MAN? I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. HE SAID OVER MY YEARS , HE SAID IT'S ALWAYS PROPERTY THE QUESTION OF A MAN OR WOMAN. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. AND ONCE YOU QUESTION YOUR MOTIVE YOU CAN NEVER DO THAT. IF I SAY YOUR IN THE POCK OF OR THISED A THAT AND BY THE WAY LET'S HAVE AN EDUCATION BILL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH ME. SO I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. THEY DON'T QUESTION MOTIVE. THE OTHER AREAS THEIR GOING TO INHERIT A WORLD OF IN DISAWRY. MY WHOLE CAREER IT'S BEEN ON NATIONAL SECURITY. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW. AND THE REASON I'M RUNNING THAT'S WHY I THINK, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT FLYING. MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS OR COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD TELL YOU , I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN AGREE ON. WITH TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY, THAT'S SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OUT THERE. PARTICULARLY PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION. ALL THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE TOUGH NOW. THAT'S WHY I CAN GET SO MUCH DONE. LOOK , WE ALWAYS HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO PEEL BACK. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO OPEN OUR DOORS AND OUR EARS AND OUR HEARTS. I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED NOBODY OUT. THEY NEED EACH OF US TO DO THAT IN OUR COUNTRY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU THANKED SOMEBODY? WHEN IS THE LAST TIME, YOU SAID THANK YOU? DID YOU YOU GO TO HIM OR HER AND SAY THANK YOU. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID, CAN I HELP YOU? IT HAPPEN ONE PERSON AT A TIME. YOU CHALLENGE OTHERS. TRIED IT WITH MY MOM AND YOU WALK A MILE. WE CAN DISAGREE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE DISAGREEABLE. IT'S HOW TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO TREAT CONCLUDING COMMENT, MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY, JOEY, EVERYBODY , EVERYBODY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. NO , DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, JIMBO FOR THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU, PAULA AND TURQUOISE, DELEGATES. WE WANT TO THANK OUR FELLOW DELEGATES WHO WERE ABLE TO CHANNEL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT CAME IN. AND WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE. BUT WE NEEDED TO HEAR FROM YOU, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD BRING TO THIS, AND WE THANK YOU FOR SPENDING THIS TIME WITH US. BEFORE YOU GO, WE WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A FEW MINUTES. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS IF YOU ASK THESE DELEGATES FOR THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN ARGUING A LONG TIME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO MY WIFE. BY THE WAY, MY DECEASED WIFE WAS A TEACHER AS WELL. EDUCATION SHOULD BE PUT MORE IN THE HANDS OF EDUCATORS. WE SHOULD HAVE MORE INPUT ON WHAT YOU TEACH, HOW YOU TEACH IT, AND WHEN YOU TEACH IT. YOU ARE THE ONES IN THE CLASS ROOMS. YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE INPUT. AND I REALLY MEAN THIS, NOT I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO BE NICE. YOU ARE AND YOU NEED THAT MORE. SO FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS GOING TO BE A MUCH MORE TEACHER CENTRIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MONEY COMES FROM THE STATE. BUT THE PORTION OF FEDERAL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR SAY ON WHAT IT'S SPENT AND WHERE IT'S SPENT. NEXT E NEXT THING I WANT TO SAY TO Y'ALL IS THAT , I AM , ONE THING THAT REALLY ALWAYS ANGERED ME IS THE WAY EDUCATED PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING IN A RECEPTION LINE AND SOMEONE SAYS AND WHAT DO YOU DO BESIDES TEACH , I GO, OH, OK. WHAT DO YOU DO? OH, I TEACH. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU TEACH. OR I HAVE A START-UP COMPANY. OR I'M IN SALES WITH SUCH AND SUCH. YOU ARE AND I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROFESSION IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE. YOU LET THEM BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. YOU WERE GOING THAT. AND I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL NEVER FIND AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WITH WHO IS MORE TEACHER CENTRIC AND MORE SUPPORTIVE THAN ME. JOE, ANY TIME WITHOUT EDUCATORS ARE GOING TO OUTCOMPETE FUSS. IT'S TIME WE RAISED THE GAME TO MAKE YOU THE MANAGERS. THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME. AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME. I REALLY DO. THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIND. THE PACK RECOMMENDATIONS TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE DECISION WILL BE MADE BY MAIL-IN BALLOT. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO MAIL BALLOTS IN A VERY GOOD WAY. YES, IT IS. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. IT WILL COME TO THE HOME OF THESE ALMOST 8,000 DELEGATES AND WE WILL BE COUNTING THOSE AT THE , IN AUGUST. AND SO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU IN OUR HOUSE TODAY. GOD BLESS AND BE SAFE. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: WELL, IF I , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]"	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473347-1/joe-biden-national-education-association-virtual-assembly	Former Vice President and presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden addressed the virtual assembly of the National Education Association.

THE PRESIDENT, FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AVAILABLE NOW IN PAPERBACK AND E-BOOK. ORGANIZED BY THEIR RANKING, BY HISTORIANS FROM BEST TO WORST. AND A LOOK INTO THE LIVES OF OUR NATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP STYLES. C-SPAN.ORG/THE PRESIDENT. ORDER YOUR COPY TODAY. WHEREVER BOOKS AND E-BOOKS ARE SOLD. JOE BIDEN WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE HE MET WITH VOTERS OUTSIDE HIS CHILDHOOD HOME IN SCRANTON AND TOWARD A NEARBY METALWORKS FACILITY. THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND HIS PLAN FOR REOPENING THE ECONOMY. HELLO, EVERYONE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME START OFF BY SAYING HELLO TO TERESA CASEY AND THE GUY THAT HANGS OUT WITH HER OCCASIONALLY. BOBBY, THANK YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND FOR WELCOMING ME HOME. I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL. MAYOR BURKE AND MAYOR CARNEGIE, CONGRATULATIONS. MR. PRESIDENT, AS I SAID EARLIER, THE IRONWORKERS HAS BEEN WITH ME MY ENTIRE CAREER. THE FIRST OPERATION TO EVER ENDORSE ME, IN 1972. I WASN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED SENATOR, AND YOU GUYS ENDORSED ME, AND I WAS ABLE TO TURN 30 BY THE TIME I GOT SWORN IN. AS A TIME I WAS ELECTED I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH. IT IS GREAT TO BE HOME. MY DAD IS FROM DUNMORE, MR. MAYOR, AND MY MOM IS FROM SCRANTON. I WANT TO THANK BOB AND EVERYONE HERE AT MCGREGOR INDUSTRIES FOR SHOWING ME AROUND THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH I KNEW OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT FOR A LONG TIME, IT HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND A HUNDRED YEARS. THIS IS THE KIND OF SMALL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS THAT DEMONSTRATES THE RESILIENCE TO CREATIVITY AND THE STAYING POWER OF THE AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL BASE. OUR COUNTRY IS FACING THREE SIMULTANEOUS CRISES , A PANDEMIC THAT HAS AFFECTED OVER 3 MILLION AMERICANS, AND THUS FAR OVER 130,000 LIVES. THREE TIMES A WEEK I AM ON THE PHONE WITH NATIONAL FOLKS, THE DOCS WHO ARE HEADS OF THE CDC AND OTHER PLACES BEFORE. THE EXPECTATION IS IT MAY GET AS HIGH AS 200,000 BEFORE IT IS OVER. IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS LEFT ALMOST 18 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF WORK, WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST PAIN INFLICTED ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. A NATIONAL RECKONING ON THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IS ALSO , HAS LONG PLAGUED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LONG PLAGUED OUR COUNTRY, HAS COME ON TOP OF A WIDENING ECONOMIC INEQUITY AND A MOUNTING CLIMATE CRISIS. EACH OF THESE CRISES IS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THAT HAS TESTED OUR STRENGTHS, OUR PATIENTS, OUR RESILIENCE, AND OUR , OUR PATIENCE, AND A RESILIENCE, AND OUR CORE BALANCE. EACH OF THESE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE NATION, AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE NOW FOR THE FUTURE THREATS WE KNOW ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL INEQUITIES OF OUR NATION, THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE VERY WEALTHY AND EVERYONE ELSE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY AND FULLY LIVE UP TO THE WORDS AND THE VALUES ENSHRINED IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS IN THIS NATION. WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL, WE ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED EQUALLY FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. NOT JUST CREATED EQUALLY, BUT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY. ALTHOUGH THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER, THAT IS WHY IT IS NO TIME FOR THE DIVISIVE POLITICS WE ARE HEARING MORE ABOUT TODAY. DONALD TRUMP MAY BELIEVE THAT PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS WILL BENEFIT HIM. I DON'T. WE HAVE A HEALTH CRISIS, AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS, A CLIMATE CRISIS. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO SOLVE THESE CRISES, TO SOLVE THEM AS AMERICANS. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO IMAGINE AND TO BUILD A NEW AMERICAN ECONOMY FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AN ECONOMY FOR EVERY AMERICAN. EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHANCE TO GET A FAIR RETURN FOR THE WORK THEY PUT IN, AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. MY GRAND POP WHEN I LIVED WITH HIM, USED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY, JOEY, DESERVES A SHOT, JUST A SHOT. EVERYBODY. AN ECONOMY THAT IS MORE POWERFUL WE CAN BUILD PRECISELY BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE CUT IN ON THE DEAL THIS TIME. AS WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THIS TIME BRINGING EVERYONE ALONG, EVERYBODY. AN ECONOMY THAT SAYS INVESTING IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WORKING FAMILIES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NEARLY $2 TRILLION IN TAX BREAK HANDED OUT TO THE SUPER WEALTHY. DONALD TRUMP LOVES TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK. BUT AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF BIG PROMISES, WHAT DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO SHOW FOR ALL THE TALK? HE PROMISED HEALTH CARE PLAN, BUT NEVER EVEN OFFERED HIS OWN BILL AS HE CONTINUES TO TRY TO WIPE OUT OBAMACARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. INSTEAD, HE HAS FOUGHT REPEATEDLY TO TAKE HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE, AND OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE COVERED BECAUSE THEY HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW, THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN COVERAGE FOR BEFORE. HE PROMISED AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN TO DELIVER, DELIVER ON JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE RANKED 23RD IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THAT? HE PROMISED , WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF THAT? HE PROMISED TO BRING BACK JOBS AND MANUFACTURING. HE PROMISED TO , OFF SHORING DOUBLED THE JOBS IN THE FIRST 18 MONTHS. I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO DOUBLE THE TAX ON FOREIGN PROFITS SO WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LEAVE AND BUILD A BROAD. WHEN IT COMES TO COVID-19, AFTER MONTHS OF DOING NOTHING OTHER THAN PREDICTING THE VIRUS WOULD DISAPPEAR, OR MAYBE IF YOU DRANK BLEACH YOU WOULD BE OK, TRUMP HAS SIMPLY GIVEN UP. HE HAS WAIVED THE WHITE FLAG. HE HAS WALKED AWAY. HIS FAILURE HAS COME WITH A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST AND DEEP ECONOMIC TOLL. TIME AND AGAIN, WORKING FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION'S INCOMPETENCE. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT AND INCOMPETENCE. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ENDED UP WITH THE SHORT END OF THE STICK AS WELL. LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR STIMULUS THAT THE CONGRESS HAS PASSED AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR , LESS THAN A THIRD OF IT IS GONE TO MAINSTREAM BUSINESSES. BIG BUSINESSES, THE WEALTHY, TRUMP'S CRONIES AND PALS. THEY HAVE BEEN THE BIG WINNERS. SENATOR CASEY CAN TELL YOU , THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, TO MAKE SURE WHERE THAT MONEY WENT. I AM THE GUY THAT HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HANDING OUT $84 BILLION IN THE RECOVERY ACT AND THE FINANCIAL RECESSION. I MET ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, EVERYTHING WAS OPEN. WHAT ARE WE FINDING OUT NOW? THAT LARGE CHAINS AND HOTEL CHAINS AND CHAINS OF RESTAURANTS, THEY DIVIDED ALL THE RESTAURANTS UP AND TREATED THEM AS INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANTS. THEY ARE ALREADY MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE MAINSTREAM MOM AND POP BUSINESSES , THEY DIDN'T GET THE MONEY. THE TRUTH IS THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ALMOST SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON THE STOCK MARKET, THE DOW, THE NASDAQ. NOT YOU, NOT YOUR FAMILIES. IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON WORKING FAMILIES. THEY DON'T NEED ME. BUT WORKING FAMILIES DO. AND THIS MAY BE, SHOULD BE IN MY VIEW, THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE. WE MUST REWARD WORK AS MUCH AS WE REWARD WELL. BUT NOW WE JUST REWARD EXCESSIVE WEALTH. GROWING UP RICH AND LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN HOW I GREW UP UP HERE. HERE NOBODY THOUGHT AND UNDERSTOOD, NOBODY THOUGHT BUT ALSO KNEW THAT WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEO'S DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY, DIDN'T BUILD IT. YOU CAN JUST LOOK AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AT THE KITCHEN TABLE, AND SEE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I WAS AT MY GRANDFATHER FINNEGAN'S KITCHEN TABLE WHERE I LEARNED THAT MONEY DOES NOT DETERMINE YOUR WORTH. HE WOULD SAY, JOEY, NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS MORE WORTHY THAN YOU, AND EVERYONE IS EQUALLY WORTHY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, AND PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW ME, HE MEANT IT, AND I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT AS WELL AS I HAVE THE LAST 15 YEARS. HE SAID, ""JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IT IS ABOUT RESPECT, IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. IT IS BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT."" MR. PRESIDENT, OVER 56% OF THE PEOPLE THINK THEIR KIDS WILL NEVER REACH THE STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAD. FOLKS, WE KNOW WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING FOLKS LIKE YOU GREW UP WITH. YOU KNOW WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A MIDDLE-CLASS. SAYING JOEY, YOUR LABOR , I HAVE TAKEN PRIDE IN THAT. THE ONLY WAY MY DAD WOULD SAY YOU DO WITH POWER IS WITH POWER. WITH POWER. IN CORPORATE AMERICA , AND I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF THE WORLD, DELAWARE , THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER. AND LABOR UNIONS. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THAT CAPACITY TO DO IT. IF THAT IS RAIN OUTSIDE, COME ON IN, GUYS. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY OUT THERE. ARE YOU GUYS IN THE RAIN? OR IS THAT NOT RAIN? I THOUGHT THAT WAS RAIN. IT IS? YOU GUYS CAN COME ON IN. DON'T STAY OUT THERE. LOOK, DETERMINATION, RESILIENCE, AND GRIT. GET UP NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN. RESPECT FOR HARD WORK AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT. THESE ARE THE VALUES I GREW UP WITH AND ALL OF YOU HAVE GROWN UP WITH. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT I AM GOING TO TAKE WITH ME TO THE OVAL OFFICE. I WILL GIVE MORE HELP TO MAINSTREAM BUSINESS AND TRIP INDOORS , AND ENTREPRENEURS. HALF OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA ARE SMALL BUSINESS JOBS. BACK AS EARLY AS MAY, SOME ESTIMATES FOUND THAT MORE THAN 100,000 SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN. MORE HAVE CLOSED, AND IT HAS BEEN DEVASTATING. SO ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT IS TIME TO REVERSE THE PRIORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. TIME TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. HELPING FOLKS MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. LET'S HELP BILLIONS OF WOULD-BE ENTREPRENEURS TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR ASKS SO THEY CAN START BUSINESSES , UNDER THEIR DESKS SO THEY CAN START BUSINESSES. AND IT IS TIME AMERICA PAY ITS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. WE SAW IN OUR ADMINISTRATION THAT WE SHOULD LOWER THE TAXES TO 28%, AND IT WAS LOWERED TO 21%. I'M GOING TO RAISE IT BACK TO 28%, PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE DAYS OF AMAZON NOT PAYING FEDERAL INCOME TAX WILL BE OVER. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE THE POWER AND THE VOICE. IT IS WAY PAST TIME , SHAREHOLDER CAPITALISM. THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY A CORPORATION HAS IS TO SHAREHOLDERS. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IT IS A FARCE. THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR WORKERS, TO THE COMMUNITY, TO THEIR COUNTRY. THAT IS A NEWER, RADICAL NOTION. , THAT IS NOT A NEWER, RADICAL NOTION. NOW THE CHALLENGE IS TO TAKE THESE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND APPLY THEM TO THE NEW ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO BUILD IN THE YEARS AHEAD. AND, FOLKS, IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BUILD BACK. WE HAVE TO BUILD BACK BETTER. THAT IS WHAT MY PLAN IS, TO BUILD BACK BETTER. IT IS BOLD, IT IS PRACTICAL, AND IT IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE, NOT FOR THE PAST. AND THE RESPONSE TO THE FIVE TRUTHS LAID OUT IN THE MOMENT OF CRISIS. THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE AS LONG-TERM SOURCES OF MIDDLE-CLASS JOB CREATION. LET'S USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE BOLD INVESTMENTS IN INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION SO THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. ALL IN AMERICA. I DO NOT ACCEPT THE DEFEAT THAT FORECASTED AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEANS WE CANNOT KEEP WELL-PAYING JOBS HERE IN AMERICA AND CREATE MORE OF THEM. I DO NOT BUY FOR ONE SECOND THAT THE VITALITY OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING IS A THING OF THE PAST. AMERICAN MANUFACTURING WAS WITH THE FUNCTION AND ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY IN WORLD WAR II, HAS TO BE PART OF THE ENGINE OF NEW PROSPERITY IN AMERICA NOW. SO TODAY, I AM RELEASING A BLUEPRINT, HOW TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED NOW AND WE WILL NEED IN THE FUTURE. AND IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. WHEN WE SPEND TAXPAYERS MONEY, WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS TAXPAYERS MONEY, SHOULD USE IT TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS. MY PLAN WOULD TIGHTEN THE RULES TO MAKE THIS A REALITY, AND IT GOES FURTHER. DURING MY FIRST TERM ALONE, WE WILL INVEST $400 BILLION IN PURCHASING PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, REPLENISH OUR CRITICAL STOCKPILES, ENHANCE NATIONAL SECURITY. THAT IS HOW MUCH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND ON BUYING PRODUCTS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THESE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE RELIABLE, PREDICTABLE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS MADE BY AMERICAN WORKERS, AND SUPPLY CHAINS LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, FURRY AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. WE WILL PURCHASE CLEAN , FOR AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. WE WILL PURCHASE CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, STOCKPILES OF CRITICAL GOODS AND EQUIPMENT, AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, TO MODERNIZE OUR GOVERNMENT AND ENHANCE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. TO ENSURE THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, WE NEED TO WIN NOT JUST THE JOBS OF TODAY BUT WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE JOBS OF TOMORROW, WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. THE CHINESE ARE SPENDING MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO OWN THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE, WHILE WE SIT WITH HER THUMB IN OUR EAR. IT MEANS FIGHTING UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES, CURBING THE THREAT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA. AMERICA CANNOT SIT ON THE SIDELINES IN THE RACE FOR THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY I AM POSING A DRAMATIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $300 BILLION TO SHARPEN AMERICANS' COMPETITIVE EDGE IN NEW INDUSTRIES WHERE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IS UP FOR GRABS, LIKE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BIOTECHNOLOGY, CLEAN ENERGY. THAT IS THE FUTURE. AND THIS MONEY WILL BE USED PURPOSEFULLY TO ENSURE ALL OF AMERICANS ARE IN ON THE DEAL, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT OUT. BLACK, BROWN, NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS, CITIES AND TOWNS EVERYWHERE IN THE REGION AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALL TOLD, THIS WILL BE A MOBILIZATION OF R&D INVESTMENT IN A WAY NOT SEEN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR II. THE TRADITION OF BRINGING BACK TO JOBS HAS BEEN LOST THIS YEAR. MY PLAN WILL CREATE AT LEAST 5 MILLION NEW, GOOD PAYING JOBS. AS EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT IT, IN MANUFACTURING AND INNOVATION. CREATED THEM RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE SEEN, IN THE IMPORTANCE OF A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY IN THE LONG TERM, OUR PRESIDENT WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS PANDEMIC. HE IGNORED THE DETAILED BRIEFINGS AND WARNINGS THAT OUR ADMINISTRATION LEFT BEHIND. THE THREAT OF A PANDEMIC, WE TOLD HIM, WAS COMING. WE GAVE ALL THIS TO HIS ADMINISTRATION IN TRANSITION. BUT HE SHUT IT ALL DOWN. HE SHUT DOWN THE PANDEMIC OFFICE WE HAD INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. HE PRAISED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT EVEN AS THE VIRUS WAS COMING TO OUR SHORES BECAUSE HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD WALK AWAY FROM HIS TRADE DEAL THAT COST US SIGNIFICANCE ABOUT , SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AS WELL. LET'S NOT GET CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED AGAIN. LET'S MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT MEANS INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING CLEAN ENERGY AND UNION JOBS IN THE PROCESS. NEXT WEEK I WILL TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD A MODEL MODERN, SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CLEAN ECONOMY, AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER THE MOST FROM POLLUTION ARE THE FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. THIRD THING, WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS PANDEMIC THE IMMENSE BURDEN ON WORKING PARENTS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO ARE CARRYING AS IF THEY , THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE WORKING, THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO WORK. THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO ARE YOUNG. AT THE SAME TIME THEIR PARENTS ARE AGING AND SUFFERING FROM DISABILITIES. IT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD DURING THIS CRISIS. LET'S FACE IT, IT IS ALWAYS HARD. SO LET'S MAKE IT EASIER TO AFFORD CHILDCARE AND CARE FOR OUR AGING RELATIVES AND OUR MOMS AND OUR DADS. LET'S OFFER MORE PAY, MORE ECONOMIC DIGNITY TO MILLIONS OF WORKERS, TO OFFER WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE ENTRUSTED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR YOUNGEST AND OUR OLDEST AT THE SAME TIME. DONALD TRUMP HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT, BARELY GETTING BY. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO PROVIDE FOR AN AGING PARENT. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND OR EMPATHIZE WITH THE STRUGGLING OF SO MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. LIKE A LOT OF YOU , AND I WILL BET THERE IS A LOT OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE, INCLUDING THE PRESS , YOU UNDERSTAND IT PERSONALLY. I UNDERSTAND IT. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A SINGLE DAD WHO HAS TO WORK WITH TWO YOUNG SONS AT HOME. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BRING YOUR AGING PARENTS INTO YOUR HOME IN THE LAST MONTHS OF THEIR LIVES TO CARE FOR THEM AS WELL. I HAVE DONE BOTH, AND I HAD GREAT HELP. I HAVE A REALLY CLOSE FAMILY. I WAS A U.S. SENATOR MAKING $42,000 A YEAR AT THE TIME. IT IS HARD, BUT IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN THE WEEK AHEAD, I WILL LAY OUT A PLAN TO MOBILIZE AMERICAN TALENT AND HEART TO BUILD EIGHT WHEN HE FIRST CENTURY CAREGIVING AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE. THE FOURTH THING WE HAVE SEEN IS MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, BUSINESS OWNERS, PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO KEEP THE COUNTY , THEIR COUNTRY GOING. WE NEED TO TREAT THESE FOLKS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS ESSENTIAL, NOT JUST IN TIMES OF CRISIS BUT ALL TIMES. WE CALL THESE FOLKS THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I THINK THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE BULK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO STAY-AT-HOME AND STAY IN PLACE, THEY LOOK OUT AND THEY REALIZE THERE IS THAT GROCERY STORE CLERK STACKING THE SHELVES, THAT NURSES AID TRYING TO PUT ON PROTECTIVE GEAR TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE ON A VENTILATOR. THAT TRUCK DRIVER WHO HAS HAD MAIL DELIVERED, THE WORKERS THAT SEE THESE , THE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS TIME WE PAY THEM. THE IDEA THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM IS NOT WORTH AT LEAST $15 AN HOUR, OR SPEND TIME WITH FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND THEN TELL THEM THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, BECOME PART OF THE UNION, ORGANIZE FOR BETTER PAY, FOR PAID LEAVE, FOR BENEFITS, FOR WORKING CONDITIONS WHERE WE INSIST THAT THEY HAVE SAFE AND SANITARY CONDITIONS TO WORK IN. MAYBE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO IGNORE IT, BUT I CAN'T AND I WON'T. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT TO PRAISE THESE WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. LET'S FINISH THE JOB OF OBAMACARE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. LET'S PROVIDE PUBLIC AUCTIONS TO COVER THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE BY ADDING IT TO OBAMACARE. LET'S ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, REGARDLESS OF ZIP CODE. LET'S TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON TITLE I SCHOOLS. AND YOU HAVE 18 OF THEM. 18 TITLE I SCHOOLS IN SCRANTON AND DUNMORE. AND IT MEANS THEY HAVE A VERY LOW TAX BASIS, SO THEY HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING TEACHERS. I TRIPLED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON THOSE FROM $15 BILLION A YEAR TO $45 BILLION. MAKING SURE EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY CHILD AGE 3, 4, AND FIVE, IS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. ALL THE STUDIES SHOW WHETHER IT IS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA OR ANYWHERE AROUND THAT THAT INCREASES OVER 58% CHANCE THAT THAT CHILD WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND GRADUATE WITHOUT HAVING ANY TROUBLE. IMAGINE WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE IT WILL MAKE. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC , EVERYONE HAS RENEWED APPRECIATION FOR HOW HARD OUT FUTURES WORK, HOW IMPORTANT THEIR JOB IS. SO LET'S KEEP THEM WITH THE RESOURCES HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. LET'S PAY THEM. THESE ARE NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILDREN, THEY ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE CHILDREN , THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT HOLD OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT, AND OUR TEACHERS ARE CRITICAL. FINALLY WE HAVE SEEN WITH HORRIFYING CLARITY THE COST OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, THE NEED FOR CONFERENCE OF AGENDA, FOR RACIAL EQUALITY IN OUR COUNTRY. IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT POLICE REFORM, IT IS ABOUT DEALING WITH THE DEEP WOUND OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THIS NATION. SO WE NEED A DEDICATED AGENDA TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP, EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INVEST IN BROWN AND BLACK AND A API NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOR TOO LONG, THE BATTLE FOR RACIAL EQUALITY HAS DIVIDED AMERICA. IT SHOULD BE USED NOW TO UNITE US. NOW TRUMP CYNICALLY CLAIMS HE IS DEFENDING AMERICANS HERITAGE BY EMBRACING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AND PUBLIC MONUMENTS OF GENERALS WHO REBELLED AGAINST , WERE TREASONOUS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO PERMANENTLY RIP THIS NATION APART. YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS ANY IDEA THAT 360,000 PENNSYLVANIANS WHO FOUGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE UNION TO DEFEAT THE FLAG, THAT CONFEDERATE FLAG, INCLUDING MORE BLACK SOLDIERS COMING FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION? DO YOU THINK HE HAS ANY CLUE THAT 33,000 PENNSYLVANIANS DIED IN THE CIVIL WAR, FIGHTING AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT FLAG STOOD FOR? I SEE A DIFFERENT AMERICA THAN TRUMP, ONE THAT DESPITE ALL OF OUR SHORTCOMINGS AND FAILINGS IS STILL COME AFTER MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES, DEDICATED , IS STILL, AFTER TWO CENTURIES, IS DEDICATED TO QUALITY AND INTEGRITY. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER IN THIS COUNTRY TO SOLVE IT. I GOT CRITICIZED DURING THE PRIMARIES FOR SAYING I WAS RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS , RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND THREE, TO UNITE AMERICA. I WAS TOLD YOU CANNOT UNITE AMERICA, WE ARE DONE. I HAVE LONG SET AMERICA IS AT ITS BEST WHEN WE ACT AS ONE NATION, ONE AMERICA. THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF DONALD TRUMP BEING PRESIDENT TODAY. HE IS EXACTLY THE WRONG PERSON TO LEAD AT THIS MOMENT. HE IS DETERMINED TO DRIVE SUPPORT, KEEP HIS BASE IN PLACE. HE WILL NOT BE PRESENT FOR ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HIS BASE. HE BELIEVES HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ONLY BY HIS BASE. SO HE WILL NOT APPEAL TO THE BEST INSTINCTS OF THE REST OF US. HE IS DETERMINED TO STROKE AND REVIVE THE WORST MOMENTS OF OUR PAST. I HAVE NO ILLUSION HOW TOUGH THE ROAD AHEAD IS GOING TO BE FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT I AM AN OPTIMIST. FOR ONE REASON ABOVE ALL OTHERS. I KNOW THE HISTORY AND THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY. AND GIVEN A CHANCE, JUST A CHANCE, ORDINARY AMERICANS CAN AND HAVE DONE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. AND I WILL NEVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, I WILL NOT LET IT DOWN NOW. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART , AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY , NO FOREIGN COUNTRY, NOT THE WAY HE CALLS UP TO , I SHOULD NOT EVEN GET INTO THIS, BUT COTTLE'S UP TO PRUDENT AND OTHERS , CAUDAL , WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE THING WE HAVE EVER FAILED TO DO WHEN WE DECIDED TO DO IT TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. DOING IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK AND BUILD BACK BETTER . GOD BLESS YOU ALL. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOBS AND ARE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, BUT I HAVE TO START BY SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS KNOW WHEN THEY WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH WORRY, ANXIETY AND FEAR. WE ARE STILL A COUNTRY IN CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED MORE THAN 3 MILLION AMERICANS. IT HAS COST OR THAN 135,000 LIVES AND CLIMBING AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. IN JUST THE LAST FEW DAYS, 19 STATES, 19 STATES REPORTED RECORD CASES, INCLUDING FLORIDA, WHICH SAW MORE THAN 15,000 NEW CASES IN A SINGLE DAY. HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS, TWO OF THE MOST CONCERNING INDICATORS OF TRUMP'S FAILED RESPONSE, ARE ALREADY UNACCEPTABLY HIGH AND THEY ARE RISING. IT HAS GOTTEN BAD ENOUGH THAT EVEN DONALD TRUMP FINALLY DECIDED TO WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC . I'M GLAD HE MADE THE SHIFT. MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TURN THE CORNER AND GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SAFELY WITHOUT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. MR. PRESIDENT, OPEN EVERYTHING NOW ISN'T A STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS. IT IS BARELY A SLOPE. QUIT PUSHING THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR HEALTH AND PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY. ALL IT DOES IS ENDANGER OUR RECOVERY ON BOTH FRONTS. MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING THEM. DO YOUR JOB, MR. PRESIDENT, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OR DEAL WITH ALMOST 18 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE OUT OF WORK AND IN INCREDIBLE PAIN, INFLICTED ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT COULD COST US AND CAST US INTO AN EVEN DARKER AND MORE PERMANENT SHADOW THAT WOULD LOOM OVER THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, COME BACK STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH THE GRIT, TOUGHNESS, AND RESILIENCE THAT CHARACTERIZES WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. LAST WEEK, I SHARED THE OUTLINES IN MY PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER. A BOLD PLAN TO BUILD AN ECONOMY OF THE FUTURE, NOT AN ECONOMY OF THE PAST. THE FIRST PLANK OF THAT PLAN REJECTS THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEAN WE CAN'T ENSURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, WITH AMERICAN, GOOD-PAYING UNION JOBS HERE AT HOME MAKING IT IN AMERICA. WE CLEARLY CAN. TODAY, I AM HERE IN WILMINGTON TO TALK ABOUT A SECOND PLAN, HOW WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS BY BUILDING A MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THESE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE FOR THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND VITALITY OF BOTH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EVEN IF WE WEREN'T FACING A PANDEMIC AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, WE SHOULD BE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS ANYWAY. ONE IN FIVE MILES OF OUR HIGHWAYS ARE STILL IN, QUOTE, POOR CONDITION ACCORDING TO AMERICAN ENGINEERS. 10 THOUSANDS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIDGES ARE IN DISREPAIR, SOME ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE, PRESENTING A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO PEOPLE'S LIVES. TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LACK ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND. TO GET OUR PEOPLE TO WORK AND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL SAFELY, TO GET OUR KIDS TO MARKET SWIFTLY, TO POWER CLEAN ENTERGY , ENERGY REVOLUTION, WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE. DESPITE THIS OVERWHELMING NEED, THIS PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN CONGRESS HAS SIMPLY FAILED TO ACT. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF SAYING IT. TO CONTINUE TO BREAK THE PROMISES THEY HAVE MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DONALD TRUMP PROMISED A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WHEN HE RAN IN 2016. HE PROMISED IT AGAIN IN 2017. THEN, IN 2018, AND AGAIN IN 2019 . NOW, HE IS PROMISING ONE AGAIN. SEEMS LIKE EVERY FEW WEEKS, WHEN HE NEEDS A DISTRACTION FROM THE LATEST CHARGES OF CORRUPTION IN HIS STAFF OR THE CONVICTION OF HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT IS INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT? BUT HE HAS NEVER DELIVERED. HE HAS NEVER REALLY EVEN TRIED. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. IN 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN FREEFALL AND WE PREVENTED ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. WE ENACTED THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN SINCE PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. NOT ONLY CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IMPROVING THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PEOPLE ON OUR ROADS, WE MADE THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, $90 BILLION. THAT PUT US ON A PATH TOWARDS A THRIVING CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY, POWERING NEW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REDUCING ENERGY COSTS. HERE WE ARE NOW WITH AN ECONOMY IN CRISIS, AND WITH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO BUILD BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE, BUT BETTER, STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT. AND MORE PREPARED FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD. AND THERE IS NO MORE CONSEQUENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT WE MUST MEET IN THE NEXT DECADE THAN THE ONRUSHING CLIMATE CRISIS. LEFT UNCHECKED, IT IS LITERALLY THE NEXT EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET AND OUR VERY SURVIVAL. THAT IS NOT UP FOR DISPUTE, MR. PRESIDENT. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ONLY WORD HE CAN MUSTER IS HOAX. WHEN I THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE WORD I THINK OF IS JOBS. GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS THAT WILL PUT AMERICANS TO WORK MAKING THE AIR CLEANER FOR OUR KIDS TO BREATHE, RESTORING OUR CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND PORTS, MAKING IT FASTER, CHEAPER, AND CLEANER TO TRANSPORT AMERICAN MADE GOODS ACROSS THE WORLD. JOBS, JOBS TO BUILD AND INSTALL A NETWORK OF 500,000 CARDING STATIONS ALONG OUR EXISTING AND NEW HIGHWAYS WE BUILD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHICH WILL NOT ONLY HELP AMERICA AND AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY LEAD THE WORLD AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES, IT WILL SAVE AMERICANS BUSY , BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TIME AND THE COST OF GASOLINE FOR THEIR VEHICLES. JOBS THAT LAY THE LINES FOR THE SECOND GREAT RAILROAD REVOLUTION, WHICH WILL NOT ONLY SLASH POLLUTION AND COMMUTE TIMES AND , IT WILL OPEN UP AREAS CONNECTED TO METROPOLITAN CENTERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY, HE SEES WINDMILLS SOMEHOW CAUSING CANCER. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THESE WINDMILLS, ICY AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AMERICAN WORKERS RACING TO DOMINATE THE GLOBAL MARKET. I SEE THE STEEL THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR THOSE WINDMILL PLATFORM TOWERS AND BLADDERS THAT CAN BE MADE IN SMALL MANUFACTURERS LIKE MCGREGOR INDUSTRIES IN SCRANTON. I SEE THE UNION TRADE AND CERTIFIED MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL IT ALL. I SEE THE PORTS THAT WILL COME BACK TO LIFE, THE LONGSHOREMAN, THE SHIPBUILDERS, THE COMMUNITIES THEY SUPPORT. WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY BY RETROFITTING LIGHTING SYSTEMS WITH LED BULBS, REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE LED BECAUSE, QUOTE, THE LIGHT'S NO GOOD. I ALWAYS LOOK ORANGE. END OF QUOTE. THE LIGHT NO GOOD. I ALWAYS LOOK ORANGE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT ENERGY RETROFITTING FOR LIGHTING, I SEE THE INCREDIBLE PROJECTS LIKE THE ONE RIGHT HERE IN THE CHASE CENTER. I SEE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE PREFERRED ELECTRIC THAT DESIGN AND INSTALL AWARD-WINNING ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY AND SAVE BUSINESSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ENERGY COSTS PER YEAR. I SEE ELECTRICIANS AND UNION WORKERS WHO, THROUGH APPRENTICESHIPS, START OFF WITH GOOD WAGES AND QUALITY BENEFITS THAT ONLY GROW FROM THERE. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE A WIN-WIN-WIN FOR THIS COUNTRY, CREATING JOBS, CUTTING ENERGY COSTS, PROTECTING OUR CLIMATE. THAT IS WHY TODAY, I'M RELEASING MY PLAN TO MOBILIZE MILLIONS OF JOBS BY BUILDING SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AN EQUITABLE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IN MY FIRST FOUR YEARS, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THE SAME ENERGY MAKEOVER THAT YOU GET HERE AT CHASE AT THE CHASE CENTER. IT IS GOING TO CREATE AT LEAST ONE MILLION JOBS IN CONSTRUCTION , ENGINEERING, AND MANUFACTURING IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE. IT IS GOING TO MAKE PLACES, THE PLACES WHERE WE WORK, WE LIVE, WE LEARN, HEALTHIER, IMPROVING INDOOR AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY. IT IS GOING TO SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ENERGY COSTS OVER TIME. THAT IS ALL REAL. WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL SPACES. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE DIRECT SUPPORT TO HELP FAMILIES DO THE SAME THING FOR THEIR HOMES. WE ARE GOING TO OFFER CASH REBATES AND LOW-COST FINANCING TO UPGRADE ENERGY EFFICIENT , ON , ENERGY INEFFICIENT WINDOWS AT APPLIANCES TO CUT ENERGY BILLS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE WILL MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT TO BUILD 1.5 MILLION NEW ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND PUBLIC HOUSING WILL BENEFIT FROM COMMUNITIES BY ALLEVIATING THE AFFORDABLE PROCESS , CRISIS, AND REDUCING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP LINKED TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. LAST WEEK, I TALKED ABOUT USING THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REINVIGORATE THE MASTIC MANUFACTURING. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, AS WELL. THE UNITED STATES OWNED , OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. WE ARE GOING TO CONVERT THESE GOVERNMENT FLEETS TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. MADE AND SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WITH THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING THE DEMAND AND GRANTS TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO COMPETE. THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY AND ITS DEEP BANKS OF SUPPLIERS WILL STEP UP, EXPANDING CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN CLEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AS WELL. NOT ONLY BY BUILDING 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS, BUT BY OFFERING REBATES AND INCENTIVES TO SWAP OLDER FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR NEW, CLEAN, MADE IN AMERICA VEHICLES, SAVING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF BARRELS, MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS WILL MEAN ONE MILLION NEW GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO GET IT DONE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRANSFORMING THE AMERICAN ELECTRICAL SECTOR TO PRODUCE POWER WITHOUT PRODUCING CARBON POLLUTION AND ELECTRIFYING AND INCREASED SHARE OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE THE GREATEST SPURRING OF JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THAT IS WHY WE WILL ACHIEVE A CARBON FREE POLLUTION , CARBON POLLUTION-FREE ENERGY SECTOR BY 2035. WE NEED TO GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY. WE NEED SCIENTISTS AND NATIONAL LABS AND LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES, HBCUS, TO IMPROVE AND INNOVATE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO STORE, GENERATE AND TRANSMIT CLEAN ENERGY. WE NEED THE ENGINEERS TO DESIGN THEM, THE WORKERS TO MANUFACTURE THEM, WE NEED IRON WORKERS AND WELDERS TO INSTALL THEM. WE WILL BECOME THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES, CREATING EVEN MORE JOBS. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. OUR ADMINISTRATION RESCUED THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND HELP TO RETOOL , MADE SOLAR ENERGY THE SAME COST AS TRADITIONAL ENERGY, WEATHERIZED MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, BIGGER AND FASTER AND SMARTER. AS WE DO THIS WORK, WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE HISTORICAL WRONGS AND THE DAMAGE THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRIES HAVE DONE IN THE 20TH CENTURY, INFLICTING ENVIRONMENTAL HARM ON THE POOR AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES, SO OFTEN BLACK AND BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. POLLUTED AIR AND WATER, TOXINS RAINING DOWN FROM COMMUNITIES, THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH BURDENS, AND THEY SHARED NONE OF THE PROPHETS. GROWING UP, BREATHING THAT AIR EVERY DAY, IT IS POISON. THAT IS PARTLY WHY THERE ARE INCREDIBLE RATES OF CHILDHOOD ASTHMA IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. WHY BLACK AMERICANS ARE ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF ASTHMA RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE AMERICANS. IT IS CANCER ALLEY IN ST. JAMES PARISH, LOUISIANA. THERE ARE CANCER-CAUSING CLUSTERS ALONG ROUTE NINE IN DELAWARE. THAT IS WHY TODAY, I AM ALSO RELEASING A STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE POLICIES TO BUILD ON MY EXISTING PLAN. THIS IS AN AREA OF INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST HURT BY IT HISTORICALLY IN THE LAST CENTURY, BY THE STRUCTURAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. I'M SETTING A GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FRONTLINE AND FENCE LINE COMMUNITIES, WHETHER IN RURAL PLACES OR CENTER CITY'S, RECEIVE 40% OF THE BENEFITS FROM THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN HOUSING, POLLUTION REDUCTION, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION, ACROSS THE BOARD. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CREATE JOBS FOR PEOPLE BY CLEANING UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. YOU SAW THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES TWO DAYS AGO. ALL THESE PLACES THAT ARE GOING BANKRUPT, EXCEPT FOR THE BENEFITS, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING TO CEO'S. MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION JOBS FOR DOING THINGS LIKE PLUGGING ABANDONED WELLS THAT EXIST ACROSS THE COUNTRY, POSING DAILY THREATS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WILL HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE CEOS AND CORPORATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM DECADES OF SUBSIDIES AND THEN WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. LEAVING THE WELLS TO LEAK, POLLUTANTS TO CONTINUE TO SWPPEW, GREENHOUSE GASES FLOWING INTO THE AIR ON THE WATER. WE WILL NOT ONLY REPEALED THOSE SUBSIDIES, WE WILL GO AFTER THOSE GOLDEN PARACHUTES THE CEOS GAVE THEMSELVES BEFORE DECLARING BANKRUPTCY TO MAKE SURE THE WORKERS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT THEY WERE PROMISED. LET'S CREATE NEW MARKETS. FOR OUR FAMILY FARMERS AND OUR RENTERS. A , AND OUR RENTERS. A NEW CIVILIAN CLIMATE CORE TO HELP PUBLIC LANDS, TO MAKE US LESS VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. LOOK. THESE AREN'T PIE IN THE SKY DREAMS. THESE ARE ACTIONABLE POLICIES THAT WE CAN GET TO WORK ON RIGHT AWAY. WE CAN LIVE UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A WORLD AT RISK OF A CLIMATE CATASTROPHE, BUILD MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES, PUT MILLIONS OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE JOB, AND MAKE LIFE MARKEDLY BETTER AND SAFER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL AT ONCE AND BENEFIT THE WORLD IN THE PROCESS. THE ALTERNATIVE, CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE FACTS, DENY REALITY, FOCUS ONLY ON TECHNOLOGY OF THE LAST CENTURY INSTEAD OF THE ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES OF THE CENTURY. IT IS JUST PLAIN UN-AMERICAN NOT TO. THIS IS ALL DONALD TRUMP AND THE AMERICANS OFFER. BACKWARD LOOKING POLICIES THAT WILL HOLD BACK ECONOMIC PROMISE WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES RACE AHEAD. IT IS A MINDSET. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMPETE, INNOVATE, AND TO WIN. IT HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD BET TO BET AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN YOU DO, IT WILL EXACT A DEADLY COST. I KNOW BETTER. I KNOW YOU DO, AS WELL. I KNOW WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF. I KNOW WHAT AMERICAN WORKERS CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN GIVEN THE ROOM TO RUN. I KNOW THE CLIMATE CHANGE, THE CHALLENGE THAT IS GOING TO DEFINE OUR AMERICAN FUTURE. I KNOW MEETING THE CHALLENGE WILL BE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO JOLT NEW LIFE INTO OUR ECONOMY, SEND IN OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP, PROTECT OUR PLANET FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE WON'T JUST TINKER AROUND THE EDGES, WE WILL MAKE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY AND MEET THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY. WE ARE GOING TO GET TO WORK TO DELIVER THE RESULTS RIGHT AWAY ON DAY ONE. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE TRUMP'S ROLLBACK OF 100 PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RULES, THEN FORGE A PATH TO GREATER AMBITION. WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK INTO THE PARIS AGREEMENT, BACK INTO THE BUSINESS OF LEADING THE WORLD. WE ARE GOING TO LOCK IN PROGRESS AND NO FUTURE PRESIDENT CAN UNDERCUT TO TAKE US BACKWARD AGAIN. SCIENCE REQUIRES A TIMETABLE FOR MEASURING PROGRESS ON CLIMATE THAT ISN'T THREE DECADES OR EVEN TWO. SCIENCE TELLS US WE HAVE NINE YEARS BEFORE THE DAMAGE IS IRREVERSIBLE. SO MY TIMETABLE RESULTS, IN MY FIRST FOUR YEARS AS PRESIDENT, THE JOBS WE WILL CREATE, THE INVESTMENTS WE WILL MAKE, THE IRREVERSIBLE STEPS WE WILL TAKE TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUT OUR NATION ON THE ROAD TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN 2050. SO LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME. LET'S GET TO WORK NOW. NOW. THANK YOU.

CSPANJB217202079	Joe Biden	2020-07-21	Joe Biden Remarks on Economic Recovery	EVERYBODY WEAR A MASK. LIVE NOW TO NEWCASTLE DELAWARE TO HEAR REMARKS FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN AND HIS PLAN TO HELP THE U.S. ECONOMY RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. I WANT TO THANK THE COLONIAL EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAM HERE IN CALYX AND FOR HOSTING US TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, I JUST MET SARA JOHNSON WHO I THOUGHT I SAW SARA SOMEWHERE IN HERE BUT SHE HAS A THREE YEAR OLD SON KNOW WHO IS A STUDENT HERE. SHE SAID THIS PROGRAM THAT'S WONDERS HELPING NOAA LEARN HIS LETTERS AND NUMBERS AND SOCIALIZE WITH OTHER KIDS AND UNDERSTAND HIS EMOTIONS AND DEVELOP HIS PERSONALITY. I BET HE IS A BRIGHT, CUTE YOUNG MAN. BUT LIKE SO MANY PARENTS, SHE IS WORRIED. HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HER JOB AS A DENTAL ASSISTANT AND VOUCHING CHANGES, AND WHAT SHE HAS TO DO TO MAKE THINGS WORK. SHE'S NOSING CHANGES IN NOAA'S BEHAVIOR SINCE HE HASN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL SINCE MARCH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE SAID TO THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE IS MY TEACHER, CAN I STAY HERE IN PLAY, WE ARE IN HIS CLASSROOM AND SHE HAS HAD TO LEARN TO LEAN ON PARENTS, WHICH MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DO, TO HELP HER GET THROUGH IT AND IS REALLY TOUGH. PARENTS LIKE SARA AND PLACES LIKE THE CENTER AND THE CAREGIVERS AND EDUCATORS WHO WORK HERE ALSO GIVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF HOPE. YOU KNOW, REINFORCING MY ABSENCE DETERMINATION, I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR OVER TWO YEARS TO TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS IN THOSE DISTRICTS LIKE THIS ONE WHERE EVERY CHILD IN A TITLE ONE DISTRICT IS ABLE TO HAVE THE BENEFITS OF AN EDUCATION AT THREE AND FOUR YEARS OF AGE. THAT IS WHY I COULD NOT THINK OF A BETTER PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THE THIRD PLANK OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN FOR THE ECONOMY THIS IS ABOUT EASING THE SQUEEZE ON WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE RAISING THEIR KIDS AND CARING FOR AGING LOVED ONES AT THE SAME TIME, SOMETIMES, SEPARATELY BUT MANY, TIMES TOGETHER. IT IS ABOUT CREATING JOBS WITH BETTER PAY AND CAREER PATHWAYS FOR CAREGIVERS AND SHOWING THEM THAT DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEY DESERVE, BUT I KNOW IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A FUTURE WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE CRISIS AT HAND. I KNOW THAT THE CASE OF CHILDCARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION IS DIRE. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR HELP DESPERATELY, AND THEY HAVE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND LAY OFF STAFF AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO OPEN AND THE VIRUS HOTSPOTS, WHERE THEY EXIST, AND THEY EXIST ALL OVER THE NATION, THEY CANNOT REOPEN AT ALL AND WE ARE IN A CHILDCARE EMERGENCY AND DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED AND GET THEM NOW. ENOUGH. EACH DAY, THE PANDEMIC DEATH TOLL GROWS. EACH DAY, IN SOME STATES, MORE PEOPLE TEST POSITIVE THAN THE DAY BEFORE, AND EACH DAY, TOO MANY AMERICAN WORKERS ARE STILL OUT OF WORK AND LOSING HOPE. IT'S BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S STAFF THAT THE PRESIDENT IS, QUOTE, NOT REALLY WORKING ON THIS ANYMORE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED BY IT. DOESN'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED BY IT. HIS OWN STAFF ADMITS THAT DONALD TRUMP FAILS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF BEING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, THE DUTY TO CARE FOR YOU AND FOR ALL OF US. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO BEING REPORTED THAT HE'LL BLOCK ANY FUNDING FOR MORE TESTING AND TRACING IN THE NEXT COVID RELIEF BILL WHICH IS BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS JUST ESTATES REPORT RECORD CASES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS CONTINUE TO RISE. , THIS MAN SIMPLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, HE CAN'T DEAL WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHOUT SOLVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER ABOUT HIS EXPECTATION OF THE ECONOMY, HE'S NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP WORKING FAMILIES HIT THE HARDEST. YOU KNOW, HE IS QUIT ON YOU. HE HAS QUIT ON THIS COUNTRY. BUT THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIM. IT IS ABOUT US. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT WHAT WILL DO, WHAT A PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. A PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO CARE, TO LEAD, TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, TO NEVER GIVE UP. THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, I HAVE SHARED MY AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. I CALL IT BUILD BACK BETTER. BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST BUILD BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE, WE HAVE TO DO IT BETTER, AND THE FIRST PLANK IN MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN REJECTS THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEAN WE CAN , WE CAN'T ASSURE AMERICAN WORKERS LEAD TO A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN AMERICA. THE SECOND PLANK HELPS US COMPETE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE, PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK IN GOOD, UNION JOBS, MODERNIZE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE BUILDING A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, INCREASING JOBS. TODAY, I'M OUTLINING THE THIRD PLANK IN MY BUILD BACK BETTER PROGRAM. MOBILIZING FOR 24 CENTURY CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WORK FOR FORCED TO DEAL WITH A CAREGIVING CRISIS AND IT IS A CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. IF WE TRULY WANT TO REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CARE THAT FAMILIES ARE CARRYING. WE HAVE TO ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION OF THOSE PROVIDING THE CARE, THE BENEFITS AND DIGNITY OF CAREGIVING WORKERS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, MILLIONS OF WORKING FAMILIES ARE FACED WITH AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL STRAIN, TRYING TO RAISE THEIR KIDS AND CARE FOR THEIR PARENTS AND LOVED ONES WHO ARE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. THIS IS THE SO-CALLED SANDWICH GENERATION. AND INCLUDES EVERYONE FROM AN 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER CARRYING FOR A MOM WHO SUDDENLY GET SICK, THROUGH A 40-YEAR-OLD DAD RAISING HIS CHILD AND CARING FOR HIS OWN AGING PARENTS. THE JOY AND LOVER ALWAYS THERE, BUT IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD. IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD. FAMILIES ARE SQUEEZED EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. THEY NEED HELP AND TOO OFTEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, THE HOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS, CHILDCARE WORKERS ARE MORE OFTEN, WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, AND IMMIGRANTS, OFTEN ON CNN UNDERVALUED. THE PANDEMIC HITS AND SQUEEZES AND TITANS ON EVERYBODY. NURSING HOMES HAVE BEEN HIT HARD. IF YOU ARE A FRONTLINE WORKER, YOU STRUGGLE TO FIND SAFE CHILDCARE FOR YOUR KIDS. OTHERS IF YOU HAVE BECOME UNEXPECTED 24/7 CAREGIVERS, TRYING TO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN SAFE AND LEARNING WHILE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME. IF YOU HAD TO PUT YOUR CAREER ON HOLD INDEFINITELY OR SENIOR HOURS QATAR YOUR JOB, LOST THE CONFUSION, THE CONFUSION OVER SCHOOL REOPENING ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE. YOU, KNOW IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS ONLY UNDERSCORED HOW VITAL IT IS FOR FAMILIES AND OLDER AMERICANS TO HAVE MORE HOME CARE AND COMMUNITY CARE CHOICES THAT FIT THEY ARE REAL NEEDS. YOU KNOW, WE ARE TRAPPED IN A CAREGIVING CRISIS WITHIN A NIGHT ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHIN A HEALTH CARE CRISIS. YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN BUT THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT. IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO. FIRST, LET'S START BY CARING FOR AGING RELATIVES AND LOVED ONES WITH DISABILITIES, HELPING THEM LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 800,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME IN COMMUNITY CARE THROUGH MEDICAID, WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR IT, BUT THEY'RE WAITING FOR A PHONE CALL, A PHONE CALL BACK. FOR SOME, THE WAIT IS FIVE YEARS, FIVE YEARS. MY PLAN MAKES A BOLD INVESTMENT, SO STATES CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST TO MAKE SURE WE EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MORE FAMILIES GOING FORWARD. WE HAVE TO MAKE A LONG TERM FEDERAL INVESTMENT. WE WILL HAVE A MAJOR INNOVATION FUND TO ALLOW STATES TO TEST AND EXPAND SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO IMPROVE HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE AND INCREASE PREVENTION AND REDUCE THE COST OF HOSPITALIZATION. THINK OF EXPANDED VITAL SERVICES LIKE RISE TO APPOINTMENTS, MEALS, DAY PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS, MAKING THEIR HOME SAFER FOR THEM. IT BUILDS ON AN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE PROVISION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. VERY PROGRAM THE PRESIDENT SEES LOVELY IS TRYING TO GET, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A PILOT PROGRAM NOW IN 27 CITIES AND 16 STATES WHERE A NURSE, AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST, AND A HANDYMAN COME TO THE HOME THAT IS CARING FOR AN AGING FAMILY MEMBER. THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CURE MOMS ALZHEIMER'S BUT THEY CAN MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T BREAK HER HIP. SO, THEY WALK THROUGH THE HOUSE. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW, AND THEY INSTALL HANDRAILS IN THE RIGHT SPOTS IN THE HOUSE, IN THE BATHROOM, OR THEY FIX THE DOOR THAT IS STUCK SO SHE DOESN'T TRIP WHAT HE TRIES TO OPEN IT. THEY INITIALLY FOUND AN ABOUT 3000 DOLLARS IN PROGRAM COSTS YIELDS MORE THAN 20,000 DOLLARS AND SAVINGS TO THE GOVERNMENT, IN HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER REASONS. SIMPLE STEPS SAVE LIVES, SAVE MONEY, AND PROVIDE CRITICAL PEACE OF MIND. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. WHETHER YOU LIVE IN RURAL NORTH CAROLINA ARE CENTRAL PHILADELPHIA, PEOPLE OF COLOR, OUR ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES CASE PUNISHING HEALTH DISPARITIES FROM A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION. THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. HEY DON'T SEE A DOCTOR. SOMETIMES LANGUAGE IS A BARRIER AND THEY SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS, SLIP THROUGH THE GAPS SO THAT THERE ARE TREATABLE CONDITION, , SO THAT THE TREATABLE CONDITION, BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, BECOMES A CHRONIC CONDITION. THAT IS WHY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE REAL HEROES. THEY GO TO THESE COMMUNITIES, THEY MAKE SURE FOLKS ARE GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED. MY PLAN PUTS TO WORK 150,000 MORE OF THESE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE CAN DO NOW. SECONDLY, WE CAN ALSO MAKE HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. MY CHILD CARE PLAN IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. EVERY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD WILL GET ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL, LIKE STUDENTS HAVE HERE, AND LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME ON CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THE MOST HARD-PRESSED WORKING FAMILIES WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A DIME. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. THEY'RE GONNA DECIDE TO GET UP TO AN 8000 DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDCARE. FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY WITH A COUPLE OF YOUNG KIDS SPENDING 300 DOLLARS A WEEK ON CHILD CARE THAT MEANS AND ANNUAL SAVINGS OF 8000 DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET, BECAUSE IT'S A TAX CREDIT. IT MEANS EVERYTHING FOR WORKING FAMILIES LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH SENDS FUNDING TO STATES, WHICH THEN WORK WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO COVER THE COST FOR WORKING FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN OVER 7% OF THEIR INCOME WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE SPENT. SO, SAY BOTH PARENTS ARE WORKING AND NEED CHILDCARE. YOU GO TO CHILDCARE .GOV, WHICH IS CREATED UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO HELP FIND CHILDCARE THAT WORKS FOR YOU UNDER MY PLAN, IT TAKES YOU TO YOUR STATE WEBSITE, LOCAL CHILDCARE SANDERS POP-UP, OR YOU CAN CALL OR FILL IN YOUR INFORMATION. YOU APPLY TO WHICH WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO. THE STATEMENT SENDS YOU A LETTER SAYING YOUR PROVED AND LAYS OUT THE AMOUNT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY. THE STATE SENDS THAT INFORMATION TO THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND THEN THE STATE REINFORCES THE CHILD CARE CENTER ON THE BACK END. YOU JUST PAY WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY, NOT A DIME FOR SOME WORKING FAMILIES AND MORE THAN 7% FOR ANYONE ELSE. YOU CAN DO THAT. THIS WOULD SAY FAMILIES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, GIVE THEM PEACE OF MIND. THERE'S OTHER COMMON SENSE STEPS WE CAN TAKE LIKE EXPANDING TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES TO BUILD CHILDCARE FACILITIES ON SITE, SO YOU CAN GO TO WORK WITH YOUR CHILD, PUT THEM INTO CHILDCARE CENTER THAT THE COMPANY GOT MONEY FOR HIM TAX CREDIT FOR BUILDING, SUPPORTING MORE AND MORE AND GIVING PEACE OF MIND TO THE FAMILY, AND WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED WORK, TAKE THAT CHILD HOME. SUPPORTING AFTERCARE, WE KIND OF SUMMER CARE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES. THIRD, WE EXPAND ACCESS TO CAREGIVING. WE NEED TO PAY AND SUPPORT CAREGIVERS BEYOND WHAT THEY ARE NOW. THEY ARE DOING GODS WORK, HOME HEALTH WORKERS ARE PAID MUCH. THEY HAVE FEW BENEFITS. 40% ARE STILL ON SNAP OR MEDICAID SO, MY PLAN IS DIRECT. IT GIVES CAREGIVERS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS MUCH-NEEDED BREAKS. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET. UNDER MY HEALTH CARE PLAN THEY DEFENDS AND EXPANDS OBAMACARE, THERE WILL BE MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. I WILL MAKE SURE THESE WORKERS HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO UNIONIZE AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED THEIR PROTECTIVE RIGHTS AND EARN BENEFITS. THIS PLAN WILL HELP WORKERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE, UP AND GAIN NEW SKILLS AND , IN GOOD PAID INDUSTRIES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND PROVIDES NEW PATHWAYS TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS. FOR EXAMPLE, HOME HEALTH CARE WORKER CAN HAVE ACCESS TO TRAINING NEEDED TO BECOME AN EMPTY OR NURSE, OR PHYSICIANS ASSISTANT OR EVEN A DOCTOR. OR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR CAN RECEIVE COACHING KEEP DELIVERING A HIGH QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCE. WE CAN DO THAT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MOBILIZE CAREGIVING EARLY EDUCATION WORKFORCE COULD SAY FAMILIES TIME AND MONEY, GET THEIR LOVED ONES THE CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THEY NEED AND PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK, ALLOWING HUSBANDS AND WIVES TO GO BACK TO WORK, AND PROVIDE MANY PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB THAT IS A DECENT JOB CARING TO KEEP SENIORS IN THEIR HOMES, AS TRIPLE WIN, IF THEY CHOOSE THAT. WE RECOGNIZE THE REALITIES FACING MODERN FAMILIES, AND PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC SUPPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. JUST IMAGINE. WE CAN PUT 3 MILLION AMERICANS TO WORK IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND PROVIDE , THE LIFE OF MY PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH UP TO 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE WE COULD FREE UP MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE PAY LABOR FORCE, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH. MEANING AT LEAST 2 MILLION ADDITIONAL JOBS, MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE NATION. THIS IS A FRESH, BOLD WAY TO BUILD A CRITICAL PART OF THE LABOR FORCE AND HELP US RECOVER FASTER AND STRONGER. WE USUALLY TALK ABOUT JOBS PACKAGES. THERE IS A BIG PUSH ON SHOVEL READY JOBS. I'M THE GUY WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER MANAGE THE RECOVERY ACT OF 800 PLUS BILLION DOLLARS. I WAS FOCUSED ON SHOVEL READY JOBS, BUT WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY. BUT THAT IS WHAT CARE JOBS ARE. THEY ARE SHOVEL READY. THE WORKERS ARE READY NOW. THESE JOBS CAN BE FILLED NOW. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, PRIMARILY WOMEN, TO GET BACK TO WORK NOW INCREASING THE GROWTH OF THE GDP AND FAMILY INCOME. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR MOST ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT IS THE SMART THING TO DO FOR OUR ECONOMY. TODAY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN'T FULLY PURSUE THE JOBS AND CAREERS THEY DREAM OF DUE TO THE CAREGIVING SQUEEZE. THAT MEANS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS IN WAGES EACH YEAR FOR OUR WORK AND FAMILIES. IT MEANS MORE DISRUPTION FOR OUR BUSINESS, FEWER JOBS, GROWTH, AND OUR ECONOMY. THIS IS BOTH A MORAL AND AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE, AND HOWEVER WE PAY FOR IT IS BY ROLLING BACK ON PROTECTING TAX CUTS, SOME OF THE TWO TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT THE PRESIDENT PUT THROUGH, CLOSING LOOPHOLES, UNPRODUCTIVE TAX CUTS FOR HIGH INCOME REAL ESTATE INVESTORS WHILE ENSURING HIGH INCOME EARNERS PAY THEIR TAX BILLS. WE INVEST THAT, AND WE ADD UP TO 775 BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. WE INVEST THAT IN BUILDING OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE GROWING THE ECONOMY STRONGER AND TOMORROW I WILL BE DOING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH HOME CARE WORKERS, FAST FOOD, WORKERS JANITORS, HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THEM ABOUT WHY THIS MATTERS SO MUCH TO THEM BECAUSE, YOU SEE, THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER. THIS IS ABOUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT, DIGNITY AND RESPECT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE NOT BEING AFFORDED DIGNITY AND RESPECT OR ANY OTHER JOBS. THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS A DUTY TO CARE FOR ALL OF US, TO SEE PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE. AS MANY OF YOU, KNOW I WAS A SINGLE PARENT FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED WHEN IT WAS HARD IT WAS HARD. IF I DID NOT HAVE MY MOM, MY SISTER, MY BROTHER, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD IT. THEN, SIX YEARS LATER WHEN YOU AND I GOT MARRIED, I SAW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR HER TO START HER TEACHING CAREER WHILE BEING A NEW MOM WITH TWO KIDS IN SCHOOL. WE CARED, WELL, ACTUALLY THEY WANTED SCHOOL YET NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. WE CARED FOR OUR PARENTS AT THE END. MY DAD WAS MONTH IN HOSPICE IN OUR HOME, SAME WITH MY MOM, AND OUR ENTIRE FAMILY WAS THERE FOR OUR SON BEAU WHO CAME HOME FROM A YEAR IN IRAQ WITH A CANCER THERE WASN'T WHETHER HE WOULD LIVE, IT WAS JUST HOW LONG HE WOULD LIVE. WE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE. MONTHS UPON MONTHS. WE KNOW SO MANY OF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP I HAD BUT NOW EVERYTHING FEELS DIFFERENT. THERE IS JUST THAT FEELING, THAT SENSE, WHERE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IF EVERYTHING IS GOING TO TURN OUT OKAY. BUT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT CAN BE AND IT WILL BE. YOU KNOW, MY DAD WAS AN HONORABLE, DECENT MAN, IT WAS A GREAT REGRET HE NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE. MY DAD, LIKE MANY OF YOUR PARENTS, GOT KNOCKED DOWN A FEW TIMES AND HE ALWAYS GOT BACK UP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A GREAT MIDDLE CLASS LIFE FOR OUR FAMILIES BUT HE USED TO HAVE A SAYING. WE WOULD SAY, JOEY, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I SURE AS HELL EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. I UNDERSTAND MY VERY CORE, AND I ALSO KNOW THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS. THIS IS AMERICA. WE DON'T SETTLE, WE ASPIRE, AND WE SUCCEEDED SO, LET'S GET THE HELL, THE HECK UP AND GET IT DONE. LET'S GET TO WORK. I PUT A MIGRAINE POPS HOUSE UP IN, SCREENWRITER LOST HIS JOB, AND WE LIVE WITH MY GRANDPA. EVERY TIME WE WALKED OUT SHE WOULD SAY JOE, AND KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDMOTHER AS WE KNOW, JOE, WE SPREAD IT. LET'S GO SPREAD THE FAITH. WE CAN DO THIS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOUR QUESTIONS ANOTHER TIME, BUT I'M OFF TO ANOTHER EVENT. THANK YOU, PRINCIPAL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. APPRECIATE IT VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474018-1/joe-biden-remarks-economic-recovery	Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, delivered remarks in New Castle, Deleware, on his plan to help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE BACK IN A PLACE AND I WANT TO THANK WAYNE JEFFERSON HERE FOR HAVING US EVERYBODY KNEW WHO HICKS WAS HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES TALK POLITICS IN THE STATE FOR A LONG TIME AND WAS VERY MUCH ENGAGED BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS ASSASSINATED IN THE CITY WAS IN FLAMES. HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND. I USED TO WORK ON THE EAST SIDE AND I GOT TO KNOW HICKS VERY WELL BECAUSE HE DID A LOT OF WORK OVER THERE AS WELL AND FOLKS HERE AT THIS CENTER ARE DOING GOD'S WORK THIS COMMUNITY CENTER GIVES PEOPLE HOPE AND A PLACE TO BELONG I SAW HOPE AS A SENATOR WHEN I WATCH MY SON BECOME ATTORNEY GENERAL HE WOULD ATTEND MASS AT SACRED HEART JUST UP THE STREET AND THEN WALK WITH HIS NOTEBOOK IN HAND SIT AROUND FOR THE DAY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND WAYS TO HELP. AND ON THE EAST SIDE AS A TEENAGE LIFEGUARD MY CAREER AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER STARTED. AND HE IS NAMED AFTER MY BUDDY. WE WENT WAY BACK. WE JUST WALKED AROUND WILMINGTON AND EVERYBODY HAS A STORY ABOUT HICKS AND HOW HE CARED AND WAS THERE FOR YOU AND HOW TO BUILD A WONDERFUL FAMILY INCLUDING TWIN SONS WHO GAVE BACK SO MUCH TO THIS COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE TO DO. THEY SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY, NOW SERVING JOINTLY AS THE POET LAUREATES IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. AND AS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE HICKS AND HIS FAMILY AND EVERYONE ELSE AT THE CENTER EMBODIES THE DEFINING STORY OF AMERICA. FOR GENERATIONS BLACK AND BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN AND IMMIGRANTS HAVE ALL PUSHED OUT AND NOT FULLY INCLUDED FROM THE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMY AND BY PURE CURE COURAGE AND GREAT THEY NEVER GAVE UP HIS THEY PURSUED THE FULL PROMISE OF AMERICA. THAT IS THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY. THAT'S I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY ECONOMIC AGENDA. BOLD PLAN TO HELP BUILD A STRONGER AND MORE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY FOR EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY THIS TIME INCLUDED. AS A STORY OF TWO CIVIL RIGHTS ERA WE LOST LAST WEEK. ONE WHO SHOWS THE WAY FORWARD REACH THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. THE REVEREND WHO FACED DROWNINGS AND BEATINGS AND HIS COMMENT WAS YOU CANNOT TURN YOUR BACK ON THE IDEA OF JUSTICE. AND CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS WHO CROSSED THE EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE ONE LAST TIME ON SUNDAY WHO ONCE SAID FREEDOM IS NOT A STATE IT'S AN ACT I WENT ACROSS THE BRIDGE TWICE ONCE WITH HIM AND I THOUGHT I KNEW A LOT ABOUT IT BUT UNTIL YOU WALK THAT BRIDGE AND SOME OF YOU HAVE DONE IT, AND YOU GET TO THE CREST OF THE BRIDGE THE FIRST TIME YOU CAN SEE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE DON'T WANT TO HIM A COUPLE YEARS AGO I THOUGHT IN GOD'S NAME DOES IT TAKE IN TERMS OF FORTITUDE AND COURAGE TO WALK DOWN THERE TO SEE THEM WITH CLUBS AND ON HORSES WAITING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIDGE WITH NO WAY BACK. I SPOKE TO JOHN JUST BEFORE HE DAD ON HIS DEATHBED. HE WANTED TO TALK AND INSTEAD OF MY CONCERNS FOR HIM HE ASKED ABOUT ME AND US AND ASK THAT WE STAY FOCUSED FOR THE WORK LEFT UNDONE TO HEAL THIS NATION AND REMAIN UNDAUNTED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS TO TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF TO SHOW THE SYSTEMIC RACISM FOR WHAT IT IS THAT PLAGUES THIS NATION. PEOPLE HAVE SEEN NOW AND THEY ALLOWED THEM TO SHELTER IN PLACE ALL THOSE FOLKS RISKING THEIR LIVES STACKING SHELVES IN SUPERMARKETS. ALL OF THOSE FOLKS. FOR BLACK AND BROWN. ONE THING THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT CAN DO RIGHT AWAY IS PASS THE BILL TO RESTORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. JUST YESTERDAY IT WAS RENAMED IN THE CONGRESS IN MEMORY OF JOHN LEWIS. WE HEARD SINCE HE PASSED TO BACK THAT WITH ACTION AND PROTECT THAT RIGHT TO VOTE HE WAS WILLING TO DIE FOR. I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT ELECT. WE CANNOT LET THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE BE DENIED ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC AS IT RAGES ON. NEARLY 150,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19 AND COUNTING. MORE THAN 4 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE TESTED POSITIVE AND COUNTING. BLACK AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE VIRUS. MORE THAN 30 MILLION AND COUNTING ARE COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT 50 PERCENT LATINO WITH - - 14.540 PERCENT OF BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES 401 - - 450,000 HAVE REPORTED THEY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING IS WORSENED BY THE CRISIS BY THE PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. TO CHANGE THE TONE THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS. DONALD TRUMP FACES A REAL TEST BUT HE HAS FAILED AT THE THRESHOLD TO BE PRESIDENT THE DUTY TO CARE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY NOT JUST REELECTION PROSPECTS. HE SHOWS HE CANNOT BEAT THE PANDEMIC AND KEEP YOU SAFE. HE CANNOT TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND GET BACK TO WORK AND NOW NOT SURPRISINGLY STOKING THE FLAMES OF DIVISION AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE. PEACEFUL PROTESTERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO THAT. WHEN OBAMA AND I WERE POP THE OFFICE WE PROTECTED PROPERTY AND THEN TO TURN THAT INTO A PRIVATE MILITIA BUT THAT WOULD NOT HELP TRUMPS POLITICAL INTEREST. TO STOVE DIVISION IN CHAOS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CARE. THE CAMPAIGN IS FAILING AND HE'S LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL LIFELINE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAW AND ORDER BUT A STRATEGY TO REVIVE THE FEELING CAMPAIGN. TO ADD THAT FUEL TO THE FIRE IS THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED. BUT THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT GOING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE STRUGGLES. AND BUILDING A FUTURE WORTHY OF THEIR COURAGE AND AMBITION TO OVERCOME. LAST MONTH I STOPPED ADD A CHURCH AND I TALK TO A GROUP OF STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS WHO SHARE THEIR PAIN AND ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN POLITICS AND ECONOMY. IS JUST A SENSE THAT THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMON THEME IS HOW DO WE BREAK THE CYCLE? IN GOOD TIME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STILL RISE IN BAD TIMES THEY ARE HIT FIRST AND HARDEST IN RECOVERY TAKES THE LONGEST TO BOUNCE BACK. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE. I PROPOSE POLICE REFORM AGENDA AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO SEE IT THROUGH AS PRESIDENT. IT'S ALSO ABOUT JOBS, GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY BUILDING WEALTH FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR AND PASSING IT DOWN TO THEIR KIDS IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND OUTPERFORMING THE REST OF THE WORLD TO STAY AHEAD. IT'S ALSO ABOUT DIGNITY FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. MANY OF YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION THAT SAID YOUR JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN YOUR PAYCHECK. RICHARD DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY LOOKING YOUR KID IN THE EYE TO SAY WILL BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. 50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA DON'T THINK IT WILL BE OKAY THEY WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING THAT THEY HAD. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS I MADE MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN BASED ON NECESSITIES WE CAN'T JUST BUILD BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE BUT BUILD BACK BETTER. WE NEED TO MAKE BOLD PRACTICAL INVESTMENTS TO RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC MESS WE ARE IN AND REBUILD THE FUTURE OUR COUNTRY DESERVES. TODAY I AM HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN DEALS WITH SYSTEMIC RACISM AND RACIAL EQUITY IN THE ECONOMY. SO FAR THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN HAS THREE PARTS. FIRST, INVESTING IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY SO THE FUTURE IS INCLUDING ALL AMERICANS NOT JUST THE SEVEN CITIES OF THE VAST MAJORITY. WITH MY PLAN WE WILL MOBILIZE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT SINCE WORLD WAR II. CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS AND INCLUDE THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND PROCUREMENT WHICH IS GOODS AND SERVICES. UNDER MY PROPOSAL WE WOULD MAKE SURE THEY ARE AMERICAN MADE AN AMERICAN STEEL BUILDING TECHNOLOGY AND SO ON BUT FOR SO LONG FEDERAL CONTRACTING MEANT TO MANY BLACK AND BROWN ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESSES BUT MY PLAN MAKE SURE THAT CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS GET A FAIR SHOT WE WILL TRIPLE THOSE EGGS FIXED - - THE EXISTING BILLS FROM 5 PERCENT TO A MINIMUM OF 15 PERCENT BY 2025 IN CREATE JOBS AND GROW. WE CAN DO THAT. THE SECOND PLANK ADDRESSES OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE WITH JOBS. INTO MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STREET LIGHTS ARE OUT, SIDEWALKS ARE CRACKED SCHOOL BUILDINGS ARE OUTDATED AND UNSAFE. THERE IS NOWHERE YOU CAN BUY FRESH FOOD FOR MILES AWAY. AND FOLLOWING THEM TO THEIR ADULT LIFE AND ABANDONED HOME TO DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS TO GET THE ENERGY AND PRIDE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. JUST IMAGINE IF WE COULD TRULY UNLEASH THE FULL POTENTIAL MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN MAKE SURE FAMILIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO BENEFIT FROM HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE TO BE INVESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO PURCHASE THINGS. TO FILL THOSE CRACKS IN THE SIDEWALK. FOR YOU CAN DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND SHOP ADD A NEW ONE - - NEARBY GROCERY STORE. WE CANNOT REBUILD OUR ECONOMY AND ME THIS CLIMATE CRISIS UNLESS WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT JOBS AND ALSO ABOUT DIGNITY AND PRIDE. THE THIRD PLANK IS THE CAREGIVERS WHO TAKE CARE OF LOVED ONES AND KIDS WE TRULY WANT TO REWARD THE WORK IN THIS COUNTRY TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CARE. TO ELEVATE THE COMPASSION ON - - THE COMPASSION OF CAREGIVER WORKERS FAMILIES ARE SQUEEZED EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. TRYING TO RAISE THEIR KIDS MY GUESS IS SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT OF A PARENT WHO CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. OR A YOUNG CHILD FROM THE AGE OF FIVE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT I HAD A GOOD SALARY I WAS MAKING $42000 A YEAR. WITHOUT MY FAMILY I CANNOT HAVE DONE IT. THEY NEED HELP THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. AND THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE AND HOME HEALTH WORKERS WERE OFTEN WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID AND UNDERVALUED. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO EASE THE BURDEN. MY PLAN WOULD CLEAR THE WAITING LIST OF 800,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE FOR A LOVED ONE THROUGH MEDICAID WHO SIGNED UP AND ARE WAITING. 800,000. MY PLAN WOULD MAKE SURE EVERY THREE AND FOUR -YEAR-OLD CHILD HAS ACCESS TO FREE HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL MY STUDENTS HAVE AT THE CENTER. LIKE TITLE I SCHOOLS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES WON'T SPEND MORE THAN 7 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON CHILDCARE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THE MOST HARD-PRESSED WORKING FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A DIME BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FREE. WE SUPPORT THE CAREGIVERS OVERWHELMINGLY ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. THE PLAN TO HELP THOSE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES GAIN NEW SKILLS IN GOOD PAYING INDUSTRIES LIKE HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY. AND THEN TO HAVE ACCESS TO BECOME AN EMT OR NURSE OR PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT. WE WON'T JUST PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOBS BUT FOR YET MILLIONS MORE TO REJOIN THE PAID WORKFORCE. AT LEAST 2 MILLION ADDITIONAL JOBS WILL BE CREATED AND MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE NATION. AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WILL GROW. WE CAN DO THIS. TODAY I'M LAYING OUT A FOURTH PLAN OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN TO ADVANCE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. NOT JUST THE OTHER PILLAR OF BUILD BACK BETTER BUT TO START, WE CREATE A NEW SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FUND. THAT EXPANDS ON THE OBAMA BIDEN INITIATIVE GENERATING 5 BILLION IN PRIVATE EQUITY FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT OF A SMALL BUSINESS PARTICULARLY IN HARD-PRESSED AREAS. WE WILL TAKE $30 BILLION OF MAKE AMERICA INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR TO PUT IT INTO THIS FUND TO ALLOW THAT FEDERAL SUPPORT THE MOST PROGRAMS FOR FINANCING FOR MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS. AND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THANKS AND HAVE A PROVEN RECORD TO INVEST IN MINORITY AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEN TO LEVERAGE 150 BILLION OF NEW FINANCING. SO THE SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FUND SUPPORTS AN INVESTMENT AND THEN TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW TECHNOLOGY. THAT HELPS THE MANUFACTURER GET STARTED AND THEN THE PROMISE TO THAT BUSINESS THAT HELPS MANUFACTURERS SCALE AND GROW. AND SO WE MAKE SURE THOSE ARE THE BEST IDEAS ARE NOT DENIED THE VENTURE CAPITAL BECAUSE OF RACE OR ZIP CODE. HERE IS WHY IT MATTERS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO SMALL BUSINESSES OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP DOING ABOUT IT? HE IS GIVING BIG BANKS THE GREEN LIGHT TO LOAN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MAKE $1 MILLION IN FEES BY SAVING THE MOST WELL-CONNECTED CLIENTS WHILE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON SMALLER BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES ABOUT THESE CONNECTIONS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST LAID OUT WHAT I THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE DONE IN THE FIRST RECOVERY PLAN PUT FORWARD BY CONGRESS. I SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD USE THE AUTHORITY HE HAS OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FORCE BIG BANKS TO HAVE TO LEND TO SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE BAILED THEM OUT. WHAT DO THEY DO? DO YOU HAVE A CREDIT CARD WITH US HEAVY ESTABLISH CREDIT WITH US? A BANK ACCOUNT? THE LIST GOES ON. AND THEY ARE DENIED. THE RESULT? BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BENEFIT ONCE YOU HAVE LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS WITH BETTER CONNECTED PHYSICIST JUMP AHEAD OF THE LINE AND BIG BANKS ACCOMMODATED. BLACK AND BROWN AND SMALL BUSINESSES GOT SHUT OUT IN FACT JUST 12 PERCENT OF BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES SURVEYED GOT THE AID THEY ASKED FOR. HALF SAY THEY WILL HAVE TO CLOSE UP SHOP AND THEY ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA. OUR ECONOMY CANNOT AFFORD FOR THEM TO CLOSE. UNDER MY PLAN, 50 PERCENT 50 OR FEWER EMPLOYERS RIGHT NOW WERE TALKING 500. DO YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES HAVE 500 EMPLOYEES AS A SMALL BUSINESS? SO MANY SMALL TOWNS AROUND AMERICA. TO SEE THEM SHUTTERED THESE MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES WITH THE WELL-CONNECTED BUSINESSES JUMP TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE. REMOVING THE BARRIERS FOR BLACK AND BROWN ENTREPRENEURS WE HAVE TO CLOSE THAT GAP OF THE NATION. AND BLACK AND BROWN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ANOTHER. THERE ARE A NUMBER WHERE 75 PERCENT OF WHITE AMERICAN ONLY 25 PERCENT OF BLACK AND BROWN CITIZENS OWN THEIR HOMES. BUT EVEN IN THE MIDDLE THOSE THAT EXIST IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY ARE VALUED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AND TO SEE THE WEALTH ACCUMULATE MUCH MORE SLOWLY. MANY DIFFERENT FAMILIES IF THEY ACCUMULATE ANY ABILITY TO BORROW OR GENERATE WEALTH FROM THEIR HOME. THAT'S HOW WE SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL TO BORROW AGAINST THAT. WHEN THE HOUSE IS AN ASSET TO BUILD EQUITY THE HOMEOWNERSHIP DISPARITY DENIES PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES. MY HOUSING PLAN IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. [INAUDIBLE] AND THE MORE AND MORE COST TO THE ECONOMY WHEN PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN NONVIOLENT CRIMINAL RECORDS CANNOT FULLY COMPUTE TO THEIR FULL TALENTS AND CAPACITY. IT WITH AN NONVIOLENT RECORD. AND THEN TO BE SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT COURT HOUSES. AND THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND IF THE STATE CHOOSES TO DO THAT. AND THEN TO ALLOW THEM TO KNOW HOW TO ORGANIZE. AND AS A REAL EQUITY. AND THEN WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOCUS ON EQUITY. AND THE FED HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. AND THE EXISTING MANDATE PROMOTES MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND STABLE PRICES. UNDER MY PLAN I BELIEVE THE FED SHOULD ADD TO THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE PERSISTENT RACIAL GAPS IN JOBS AND WAGES OF GREATER DIVERSITY INCLUDING DIVERSE NOMINEES. AND THE REGIONAL FEDERAL BANKS. AND WHEN THE ECONOMY IS HELPING EVERYBODY RACIAL EQUITY IS NOT JUST AN ASPIRATION BUT A THEORY. ALL OF THOSE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WE MET A COUPLE IN HERE SOMEWHERE. WHERE ARE YOU SEE THAT YOUNG MAN RIGHT THERE AND HIS LOVELY WIFE. MOM AND DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE SOMEONE GAVE HIM AN OLD LAPTOP COMPUTER. HE TOOK IT APART AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND CHANGED HIS LIFE AT 17 HE WAS CERTIFIED TO BECOME AN IT SYSTEMS SPECIALIST. HE WENT TO COLLEGE STUDIED ABROAD AND CAME BACK HOME AND THEN STARTING A BUSINESS GETTING COMPUTERS TO FOLKS. WITH SEVEN EMPLOYEES AND HIS GOAL IS TO CREATE A WORKFORCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE HE HELPED WITH EIGHTH-GRADE EDUCATION NEVER USED A COMPUTER BEFORE FIVE WEEKS LATER THEY KNOW HOW. SO TO SCALE UP THE BUSINESS TO INVEST IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS HEART AND GET AND NEVER GIVES UP AND THAT'S WHO WE ARE THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. WE ARE AMERICAN. WE DON'T SETTLE. WE ASPIRE AND WE SUCCEED I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. JESSICA? MR. VICE PRESIDENT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR VP PICK NARROWING IN ON THE TIME FRAME IF YOU'LL MAKE YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT ARE YOU STILL TARGETING EARLY AUGUST? HOW MANY FINALISTS DO YOU HAVE AN CAN YOU MEET WITH THEM IN PERSON BECAUSE OF COVID? I WILL NOT COMMENT ON EVERY STATE BUT WHEN THE RATE IS MORE THAN ONE / ONE IT SHOULD BE ROLLING BACK. LOOK, FROM THE BEGINNING, IN MY VIEW THE PRESIDENT GAVE US A FALSE CHOICE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK AND DEAL WITH COVID YOU CANNOT GET THIS COUNTRY GOING AGAIN UNLESS YOU GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. HE HAS BEEN LATE IN THE GAME WE HAVE HEARD IT 100 TIMES COLUMBIA IS SHOWING ONE WEEK EARLIER 31000 MORE AND THEN 57000 BUT THE POINT IS THERE IS A FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LAY OUT CLEAR GUIDELINES LIKE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS. THERE IS A NATIONAL CDC STRICT GUIDELINES AND SO I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW WITH FREEDOM VERSUS PHYSICAL SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE VIRUS. EVEN NOW THEY ARE LOCKING DOWN COUNTIES ON TESTING. THE PRESIDENT SAID. TESTING SO WE WILL NOT KNOW. AND THEN TAKING ME INTO THE NEXT STAGE. I KNOW YOU COVER THIS A LOT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE SAID WE SHOULD BE PUTTING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW $25 BILLION TO DO IT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A DETAILED PLAN ONCE A VACCINE IS FOUND GOD WILLING SOONER THAN LATER TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL AMERICA. IT IS A DIFFICULT AND LOGISTICAL THING TO DO WE SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT TESTING AND TRACING WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SO REALLY I PRAY THE PRESIDENT TAKES ADVANTAGE AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR SO THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY THAT DEALS WITH EVERY PART OF AMERICA BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO PLANNING THAT I CAN SEE. THIS IS MY HOME AND MAKING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON OR NEW MEXICO IT WOULDN'T MATTER THE SAME COVERAGE NO MATTER WHERE IT IS. AND THEN TO COMMUNICATE AND WORK WITH STAFF IN PHILADELPHIA TO GET THIS LINED UP AND WHAT I FOUND ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT HIDING IN THE BASEMENT? OVER 340 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON TELEVISION. SO THE WAY PEOPLE ARE ABSORBING THE NEWS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE SO IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU DO IT FROM AS LONG AS WE DO IT SAFELY. IF I WERE IN WASHINGTON I WOULD COME HERE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF MY BUDDY AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND WHAT HE IS ALL ABOUT. THANK YOU SERVE TO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS PROVOKING THESE THESE, YOU SAID THE PRESIDENTS INTENTIONALLY PROVOKING THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CLASHES SPECIFICALLY BUT AND THE TELEVISION ADS THEY ARE RUNNING THEY WOULD SEE SIMILAR SCENES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU BE DOING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PEACEABLY ASSEMBLE AND THE DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY WE ARE SEEING? USING LOCAL POLICE WHEN THEY ARRIVED TO THE FEDERAL PROPERTY. WE COULD TAKE CARE OF THE USE OF LOCAL POLICE. AND THAT ARSONIST SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE HAS CAUSED ENORMOUS POLITICAL DIVISION. HE SAYS BIDEN IS STOPPING 911. WITH MY PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND OR IT COULD TAKE SEVEN DAYS. COME ON. THAT IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO COME UP WITH A BIZARRE LAW AND ORDER 2020 CAMPAIGN TO SCARE THE DEVIL OUT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS LOOK, WHEN THE PRESIDENT DECIDES HE WANTS TO WALK THROUGH A GROUP OF PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATORS TO THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO HOLD THE BIBLE UPSIDE DOWN. I'M NOT SURE HOW OFTEN HE READS READS, AND HE USE THE MILITARY TO DO THAT, DID YOU EVER THINK THE CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF APOLOGIZING TO THE NATION FOR PARTICIPATING IN THAT? DID YOU EVER THANK YOU WORDS THE FORMER CHIEFS OF STAFF ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY? THAT WASN'T ABOUT WALKING ACROSS TO OF THE BIBLE. THAT WASN'T ABOUT THE CHURCH BURNING OR BEING BURNED. IT WAS ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT ALMOST THE SAME DAY TAKES THE CONFEDERATE FLAG OFF AND HE DEFENDS A CONFEDERATE FLAG AS A MATTER OF HERITAGE AND IT STILL BEING FLOWN AT NASCAR? WHY TAKE IT DOWN? THIS IS ABOUT DIVISION AND TRYING TO SPLIT THE COUNTRY. AND SO FAR, THANK GOD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT HAVING ANY OF IT 70 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THINKING PROTESTERS TUESDAY BLACK LIVES MATTER THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DON'T CLING ONTO THE RACIAL THE VISION. AND THEN SAID THE MEXICAN RAPIST SO I DON'T THANK YOU NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE DO NEED TO HOLD THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE LAW ACCOUNTABLE HE SHOULD NEVER LET WHICH WAS DONE IN A MARCH FOR EQUAL RIGHTS OVERCOME THE REASON FOR THE MARCH. THAT'S WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE DOING. AND THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND TRIED. IF I CAN AS YOU ROLL OUT THE ECONOMIC PLAN DURING THE COURSE OF THE PRIMARIES YOU WERE CRITICAL OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS FOR SUPPORTING PLANS YOU THAT WERE TOO EXPENSIVE AND NOT REALISTIC IN TERMS OF GETTING PAST. NOW YOU ARE PROPOSING $3 TRILLION OF SPENDING WITH YOUR ECONOMIC PLAN. DESCRIBE YOUR EVOLUTION IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU VIEW AS ACHIEVABLE IF YOU'RE ELECTED AND SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEAKING NO ONE CAN BE A MILLIONAIRE IT'S A BAD THING OR THAT WE WILL PROVIDE A MEDICAL PLAN THAT COST $30 TRILLION OR $32 TRILLION AND YOU THANK YOU CAN GET IT PASSED. BEING ABLE TO PASS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, LEGISLATION THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE DEMONSTRATED IS NEEDED TO SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE IDEA THAT WE CAN CONTINUE FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS OVERSEAS TO MAKE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TAX BREAKS SO WHEN WE COME UP SHORT WITH EVERYTHING AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE KINDS OF STEEL WE NEED, IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT. SO WE ARE USING FEDERAL DOLLARS TO FOCUS ON THINGS TO INCREASE INDEPENDENCE. WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON ANYONE ELSE FOR CYBERSECURITY OR CYBERINFORMATION OR TO MAKE THE BANISTERS WITH A STEEL BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT , THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THEM AT HOME IS NOT INDUSTRIAL PLANNING ONLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO AND MY WHOLE PLAN RELATIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT COMPANIES WILL NOT COME ALONG AND SPEND $1 TRILLION ON INFRASTRUCTURE TO REBUILD HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES CAUSING PEOPLE TO DIE MAKING SURE PORTS ARE ACCESSIBLE AND UNLOAD THEIR CARGO THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT IT SHOULD BE INSISTING THAT USING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WE TAKE THE PRODUCT FROM THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURER MADE IN AMERICA TO EMPLOY AMERICAN WORKERS GETTING A DECENT WAGE. THAT'S A POLICY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES ANYWAY YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN I'M PRESIDENT I ONE HERE AT THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD OWNED BY THE TAXPAYERS WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO? I THINK WE COULD OWN THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET SO I WILL MOVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE A CARBON NEUTRAL BUYING 550,000 CHARGING STATIONS UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAYS. GENERATING THE KIND OF GROWTH AND UNION WAGES TO PROVIDE GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE. SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND TO SAY WE WILL FIND ANOTHER $30 TRILLION AND GET THAT PASSED IN CONGRESS I PREDICT YOU WILL FIND I GET SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT THAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN AND WE WILL TAKE BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AGAIN, WERE JUST SPENDING THE DOLLARS THAT ARE APPROPRIATED IN MANY CASES AND HOW WE SPEND THEM THEM. THANK YOU SERVE. IN YOUR REMARKS POLLING BEARS THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT ARE YOU RUNNING AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP OR FOR JOE BIDEN? IN OTHER WORDS YOU ALLUDED TO THIS A LOT OF VOTERS ARE SAYING THAT THE SUPPORT HINGES ON THE FACT YOU ARE NOT THE PRESIDENT. SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE VOTING FOR YOU WERE NOT JUST AGAINST THE PRESIDENT? THAT'S WHY HAVE THIS DETAILED PLAN. [LAUGHTER] LOOK. I AM RUNNING BECAUSE TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT AND I THINK OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. FOR REAL. AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE IS MANY AMERICANS THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ME AND THOSE WHO DO VIEW ME AS THE ANTITHESIS OF TRUCK. I BELIEVE THAT I AM. AND WHEN I ANNOUNCED AND SAID I WAS RUNNING TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA I MEANT IT. REMEMBER I GOT CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT NOW EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT DECENCY HONOR AND RESPECT AND THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE EVEN BACK WHEN PEOPLE TALKED HOW WELL THE ECONOMY WAS MOVING I THOUGHT THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS STILL GETTING CRUSHED AND WORKING-CLASS FOLKS WERE HURTING BADLY. I SEE ANY NUMBER SHOWING THEY WERE SO HAPPY. BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE NOT ON - - THEY WERE BEING PAID BADLY IN CORPORATE AMERICA WAS OVERREACHING IN TERMS OF WHO HAD AN OBLIGATION AND THIRD WHAT I WAS MOST CRITICIZED FOR AS THAT WE HAD TO UNITE AMERICA THEY SAID YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. WE CANNOT UNITE AMERICA WE ARE GONE. FORGET IT DEMOCRACY IS DEAD IT REQUIRES CONSENSUS. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE IT REQUIRES CONSENSUS THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE CRITICAL OF PEOPLE WHO SAY BY EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL DO THE FOLLOWING. THAT'S TRUMP HE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DO THAT BY EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THE BAD NEWS BY ALL THE POLLS DONE ON YOUR NETWORK AND EVERYBODY ELSE. PEOPLE LOVE ME WARTS AND ALL. THE REASON I AM RUNNING IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO QUALITIES AT THIS MOMENT ARE NOT THE MOST RELEVANT MEANING IN THE PRESIDENT CHANGES IN EVERY ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. ONE IS I KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY WITH NATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ME RESPECT ME AND THOSE WHO DO LIKE ME RESPECT ME. I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. IS WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE. TRUMP HAS NO NOTION OF IT. NONE. LISTEN TO HOW HE TALKS ABOUT PUTIN. MY GOD. IF HE TALKS TO HIM PRIVATELY BUT THEN RAISES THE FACT NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO I'VE BEEN RELATIVELY GOOD AT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND POLITICALLY IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER. THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IT'S A LOT HARDER. BUT DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF THE SENATE AND THE RACES IT COULD BE WITHIN REACH BECAUSE I WILL SAY IT AGAIN I NEVER QUESTION ANYBODY'S MOTIVE FOR LIED TO A POLITICAL OPPONENT AND MISLED THEM EVEN SAYING I NEED YOUR VOTE BUT IF YOU DO THIS CONSTITUENT WILL BE MAD I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY TO SAY IT'S PROFILES OF COURAGE I RECOGNIZE THEIR LIMITS AND STILL FIND A PRINCIPLED COMPROMISE THOSE ARE THINGS WE BADLY NEED NOW AND I THINK NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT I THINK I HAVE LAID OUT THE MOST DETAILED PLAN ON THE ECONOMY OF ANY PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY. IF I AM ELECTED I WILL GO DOWN ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PRESIDENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY BUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE FREE MARKET AND CAPITALISM THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS. IT TOOK A CAPITALIST TO SAVE CAPITALISM BUT I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE CAN GET DONE AND WILL GET DONE AND THAT'S WHY THE LAST THING I WILL SAY REMEMBER I WAS CRITICIZED BY SAYING TO CAMPAIGN IN THE STATES I CANNOT WIN BECAUSE WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT WHEN THE NATIONAL PARTY DOES NOT INVEST IN AREAS THERE IS A TIGHT RACE IT HURTS THE LOCAL OFFICIALS. SO WE HAVE TO BUILD A BENCH AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AS WELL. I'M HOPING THE PEOPLE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE, WHAT I'M PROPOSING, WHY IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION I'M SUGGESTING. I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE SEE RESPONSE TO. I HAVE A QUICK COVARIATE QUESTION THE FOR THE MARLINS TODAY ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE TO SUSPEND THEIR SEASON AND YOU GET BRIEFINGS ON HOW COVERT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AND SOCIETY SHOULD COMPORT ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF SPORTS LEAGUES THAT ARE STARTING TO PLAY AGAIN OR WHAT SCHOOLS ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF THIS THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD WITHHOLD FEDERAL FUNDING FROM STATES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T REOPEN. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHTS ON ALL THIS. I DO I HAVE LAID IT OUT IT WILL GET YOU A COPY OF MY SCHOOL REOPENING PLAN WHAT IS REQUIRED. THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES YOU CAN DO THAT P-LETTER HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR PROTECTIVE GEAR AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND TESTING AND ALL THOSE THINGS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND REQUIRES THE CERTAINTY THAT TEACHERS AS WELL AS STUDENTS WILL BE PROTECTED. IN A HIGH-INTENSITY AREA WITH A LOT OF COVARIATE IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. - - COVID-19 IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T GO TO TALLAHASSEE BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC? TO GO TO FLORIDA OR JACKSONVILLE? KNOW BECAUSE THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU DOING THIS. IT IS A MISTAKE. SO THERE ARE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE TO BE MADE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC BY THE CDC. THEY SHOULD LET THE SCIENTIST SPEAK. I'M HAPPY THE PRESIDENT IS BACK HOLDING HIS CONFERENCES EVERY DAY ON COVID-19. I KNOW A GOOD THAT DOES EXCEPT HE WEARS A MASK AND SAYS THE RIGHT THINGS MOSTLY BUT THIS IS ABOUT SCIENCE. AND EXPERTISE AND TRANSPARENCY. WE GOT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS POINTING OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH EVEN WHEN BUSINESS OPENED PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE. SO THERE OUGHT TO BE A SYSTEM WHEREBY IN WHICH I PROPOSE YOU CAN LAY OUT THE DETAILS OF YOUR BUSINESS TO PUT A SIGN OUT THAT SAYS IT'S SAFE. I'VE MET ALL THE STANDARDS. BUT THE IDEA THAT WE JUST SAY OPEN AND PEOPLE WILL SHOW UP, THEY WILL NOT. THEY WILL NOT. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAPPEN BASED ON WHAT THE LEAGUES THEMSELVES ARE SAYING. THE MARLINS SAY WE CAN'T DO IT. SO I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WHAT SEEMS TO WORK A LITTLE BIT , BASKETBALL WERE NOBODY IS TRAVELING THEY ARE ALL SEQUESTERED IN ONE PLACE. IT'S LIKE, LOOK. MANY OF YOU HAVE FAMILIES MOMS AND DADS TO GO FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE TO THEIR STATE YOU SHOULD BE QUARANTINING BEFORE YOU GO SEE THEM. UP TO 12 DAYS. THINK ABOUT IT. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA YOU CANNOT TRAVEL TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. DON'T COME YOU ARE A DANGER TO US. BECAUSE WE DON'T FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY WITH WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU HAVE FOOTBALL PLAYERS MAKING EIGHT OR 10 MILLION BUCKS PER YEAR SAYING IT WILL NOT TAKE THE RISK TO PLAY YOU HAVE TO LISTEN. I'M NOT GONNA SAY EVERY SPORT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IF YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN HOTEL ROOMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND IN A POSITION GOING INTO AN AREA WITH A HIGH CONCENTRATION TO SPREAD COVID , THAT ADDS UP TO A REAL PROBLEM. AND WE CANNOT OVERCOME THAT UNTIL WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND GET A VACCINE. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT, AS WE SPEAK SPEAK, SHOULD BE STARTING AND SHOULD'VE STARTED THREE MONTHS AGO TO PUT SOMEONE IN CHARGE HOW SPECIFICALLY LIKE HOW TO WAGE A WAR, HOW WILL YOU DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE WHEN IT ARRIVES? WHEN IT'S THEY ARE? AND THE QUESTION IS IT REQUIRES ENORMOUS TRANSPARENCY. TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO OTHER EXPERTS ACROSS THE NATION SO THIS IS A SAFE VACCINE. ONE PERCENTAGE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE IT WAS THEY ARE TOMORROW THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT AND IT'S NOT THE USUAL ANTI- VACCINE CROWD. IT IS BEYOND THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOSING FAITH IN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS. . . . .

JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT MESSAGES, AND TWEETS. NEXT, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SPEAKING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE GROUP IS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE BY VIDEO BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL HI TO MY GOOD FRIEND SECRETARY DAILY. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO WELL. I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING ARTURO FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY VISION FOR LATINOS IN OUR COUNTRY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. NONE MORE STARK THAN THE LAST 3.5 YEARS. DONALD TRUMP HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE PURSUED AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON LATINO COMMUNITIES, FROM THE MOMENT HE CAME DOWN THAT GOLDEN ESCALATOR SAYING HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ON THE MEXICAN RAPISTS. IT STARTED THE MOMENT HE ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENCY. FEEDING THE FLAMES OF FEARS AND RACISM AGAINST LATINOS. IT IS BAKED INTO EVERY ASPECT OF HOW HE HAS GOVERNED. THIS WEEK WAS AN ESPECIALLY POIGNANT REMINDER OF THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING THAT KIND OF HATE TO GROW UNCHECKED. I THOUGHT WE COULD DEFEAT A, BUT IT ONLY HIDES UNDER THE ROCKS. WHEN A PRESIDENT BREATHES OXYGEN IN, IT COMES ROARING OUT. ON MONDAY, WE MARKED THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC MASS SHOOTING IN EL PASO WHERE A GUNMAN EXPLICITLY SOUGHT TO TARGET LATINOS AND 23 BEAUTIFUL LIVES WERE STOLEN FROM US AND THEIR FAMILIES. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A CHILD. IT IS AWFUL. IT IS STARKLY , THE STAKES OF TRUMP'S IRRESPONSIBLE POLICIES, OF DIVISION AND HATE THAT HE PROMOTES ISRAEL. , IS REAL. THESE ARE LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS. WHETHER IT IS REPEATED ATTACKS ON DREAMERS OR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WHETHER IT IS HIS NEGLECT OF PEOPLE AFTER HURRICANE MARIA AND PUERTO RICO FOR HIS REPEATED FAILURE TO MAKE SURE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE LATINO COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO, THE QUESTION YOU ASKED, ARTURO, HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE REAL A BETTER LIFE FOR LATINOS? THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION. THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY LITERALLY DEFENDS ON HOW WE ANSWER IT. THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. HERE IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH. THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE LATINOS HAVE THE ABILITY AND TOOLS TO SUCCEED. LATINOS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ALREADY ONE QUARTER OF OUR SCHOOLCHILDREN, ONE QUARTER ARE LATINO. HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN WE HAVE A STRONG AND THRIVING REPUBLIC IF WE DON'T FULLY DEAL LATINOS INTO EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THESE KIDS ARE NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDS. THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITION. THAT IS WHY EARLIER THIS WEEK I RELEASED MY LATINO AGENDA. THINGS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ALL ALONG AND YOU KNOW ABOUT, BUT I PUT THEM ALL IN ONE PLACE. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR NOT JUST HOW WE ARE GOING TO UNDO ALL THE HARM THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS INFLICTED, BUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE LATINOS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR PLANS TO BUILD THAT MEANS INVESTING IN LATINO ECONOMIC MOBILITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE BASIS OF IT ALL, ECONOMIC MOBILITY. EVERYTHING MAKING SURE LATINO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN ACCESS CAPITAL TO MAKING IT EASIER FOR LATINO FAMILIES TO BUY A HOME, TO BUILD INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. HOW DID EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON DO IT? THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY A HOME AND BUILD EQUITY IN A HOME AND PASS IT ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. ONE OF THE FOUR PLANKS OF MY BILL BACK BETTER PLAN IS ABOUT ADDRESSING RACIAL INEQUITIES. IT IS ABOUT BREAKING THE CYCLE WE ARE IN GOOD TIMES LATINO COMMUNITIES STILL LAG BEHIND AN EVENT TIMES , IN A RECOVERY, THEY TAKE THE LONGEST TO BOUNCE BACK TO WHERE THEY WORK, WHICH WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TAKE ON INEQUITIES. IT ALSO WORKS ON ENDING RACE-BASED HEALTH DISPARITIES. TINO'S ARE AMONG THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WITH MILLIONS GETTING INSURANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOW THE INSURANCE RATE DROPPED FROM 32% TO 19%. THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT WIN FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, WITH ALMOST 160,000 DEAD, THOSE FAMILIES LOST, PART OF THEIR SOUL, PART OF THEIR HEART. NOW TRUMP IS TRYING TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN COURT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. LATINOS ARE BURYING SOME OF THE HEAVIEST BURDENS. DUE TO HIGH RATES OF INFECTION BECAUSE LATINOS DISPROPORTIONATELY SERVE IN CAREGIVING ROLES AND INCREASE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE AND SAVE OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. I AM GOING TO PROTECT OBAMA CARE AND BUILD ON IT WITH A PUBLIC OPTION SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AFFORDABLE CAL , HEALTH CARE. WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THIS PANDEMIC, WE HAVE TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. EVERYONE GETS FREE ACCESS TO TESTING AND TREATMENT. WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A VACCINE. EVERYONE GETS IT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS WITHOUT REGARD TO IMMIGRANT STATUS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BEAT THIS THING. IT IS THE ONLY HUMANE THING TO DO. WE WILL ALSO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TAKE ON THE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THAT STARTS EARLY TO MAKE SURE HIGH-QUALITY PRE-K IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY CHILD THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. STUDIES SHOW THAT IT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY THE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS FOR THE ENTIRE 12 YEARS. IT GOES THROUGH MAKING POST HIGH SCHOOL AFFORDABLE , POST HIGH SCHOOL IS AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS. PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE TUITION FREE FOR MAKING LESS THAN $10025,000 REWARD. DOUBLING PELL GRANTS, INCREASING FUNDING FOR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS. I STARTED TODAY BY SPEAKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN EL PASO ONE YEAR AGO. WE ALSO NOTE LATINOS SUFFER EVERY DAY FROM HATE CRIMES AND GOOD VIOLENCE. IT DOES NOT ALWAYS MAKE NATIONAL HEADLINES. UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL GET WEAPONS OF WAR AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL TAKE THE FIGHT DIRECTLY TO THE NRA AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE , AND HOLD GUN MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE TO LATINO FAMILIES. TRUMP FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC TRUTH OF IMMIGRANTS, THAT THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SOURCE OF OUR NATION'S STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1860'S WHEN MY ANCESTORS JUMPED ONTO THE SEA, NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE GOING, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY WOULD MAKE IT A SHORT, ALL THE WAY TODAY , WAY TO TODAY. WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE THE BEST OF EVERY CULTURE. IT TAKES COURAGE TO LEAD A COUNTRY OF EVERY KIND, OF EVERY BACKGROUND. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY AND TRUMPS ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICA , TRUMP'S ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. OUR COUNTRY IS A SAFE PLACE FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION. WE HAVE NEVER MADE ASYLUM-SEEKERS SEEK ASYLUM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE WILL STOP THE UNION MADE PRACTICE , INHUMANE PRACTICE OF SEPARATING FAMILIES FROM THEIR CHILDREN. WE WILL STOP , AND DID BEST CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP ENSURE MIGRANTS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHILE THEY ARE NAVIGATING THE ASYLUM PROCESS. IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY, BUT IT IS A HELL OF A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUILDING A WALL. WE WILL RESTORE SENSIBLE ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES AND STOP TERRORIZING LATINO COMMUNITIES. THE IDEA YOU WAIT OUTSIDE AT 10:00 MASS TO GRAB SOMEONE FROM A CHURCH, THE ANXIETY FROM CHILDREN. THE ANXIETY IS OVERWHELMING. IT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT UPON THE GENERATION. WE WILL PROTECT DREAMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND EVERY SINGLE AGREEMENT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIGNED 2 , LAW IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. IMMIGRATION FOR , REFORM WILL FOCUS ON KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. INCLUDING PROVIDING A CLEAR ROADMAP FOR 11 MILLION , FOR CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. I KNOW THAT IS A PRETTY BIG AGENDA. THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GET IT DONE. THE PANDEMIC AS LIFTED BLINDERS OFF SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ON WHO IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY. IT IS NOT WALL STREET BANKERS OR CEOS, IT IS THE MIDDLE CLASS, HARD-WORKING UNION MEMBERS COMMITTED TO THE RIGHTS OF ALL WORKERS, FOLKS AND LATINO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE BUSTING THEIR NECKS EVERY DAY TO KEEP THE COUNTRY RUNNING. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE ARE READY TO CLOSE THE RISK AT , THE RESPECT CAP, THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. SOME OF THOSE LATINO WORKERS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR SO LONG. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, WHEN HE LOST A JOB UP IN SCRANTON. MY DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE. HE IS TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, HONOR. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. DIGNITY, HONOR, TREATING PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY. WE CAN BUILD A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT RESPECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION AND THE FULL DIVERSITY OF LATINO COMMUNITIES. WHEN I MEAN FULL DIVERSITY, UNLIKE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES, BUT FROM EVER. FROM EUROPE TO SOUTH AMERICA ALL THE WAY TO OUR BORDER WITH MEXICO AND THE CARIBBEAN. AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES, BUT ALL LATINOS. WE WILL GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT WHEN WE WIN IN NOVEMBER. THE REASON WE NEED EVERYONE TO GET OUT AND ABOUT, I CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. THE VICTORY IN NOVEMBER IS CONTINGENT UPON LATINO VOTERS, PARTICULARLY IN BATTLEGROUND STATES. I AM COMMITTED TO SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY . I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STEP. WE ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE ON LATINO STATIONS, SPANISH-SPEAKING STATIONS. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE VOTER TO SIGN UP, GET ENGAGED IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO REGISTER AND HOW TO VOTE SAFELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO PROVIDE VOTERS WITH MORE OPTIONS, NOT FEWER AND TO EXPAND OPTIONS. NO EXCUSE FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS. YOU CAN GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT IF YOU NEED ONE OR WANT ONE. HAVE ENOUGH FOR WORKERS THAT CAN SANITIZE MACHINES AND MAKE SURE WE CAN SOCIALLY DISTANCE AND WEAR MASKS WHILE NOT TAKING AWAY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. OUR CAMPAIGN IS PUTTING TOGETHER THE LARGEST VOTER PROTECTION PROGRAM IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTING DURING THE PRIMARIES. WE KNOW VOTER SUPPRESSION WAS ALIVE AND WELL IN AMERICA BEFORE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THE CENSUS IS PART OF THIS TOO. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE COUNTED. FOUR FORMER CENSUS BUREAU DIRECTORS WHO HAVE WORKED UNDER NINE PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED ON THE SENATE AND ADMINISTRATION TO WORK TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE SO WE GET AN ACCURATE COUNT. YOU MENTIONED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. TO DATE, IT HAPPENS TO BE THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ENACTMENT. I WORK LIKE HELL TO EXTEND THAT ACT WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER GOING BACK TO 1975. BACK THEN, IN 2013 THE SUPREME COURT CAME ALONG AND STRIPPED THE TEETH OUT OF THE ACT. THEY SAID IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY. JUST LAST YEAR, 29 STATES INTRODUCED OR CARRIED OVER BILLS TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, PERIOD. THIS IS BLATANTLY UN-AMERICAN. OUR DEMOCRACY, ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE, THAT IS THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. AND AT THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN SENATE, MITCH MCCONNELL AND DONALD TRUMP DO NOT TAKE UP THE BILL NEWLY RENAMED IN HONOR OF MY FRIEND JOHN LOTUS TO RESTORE THE ACT TO ITS FULL POWER, I WILL DO THAT ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU AGAIN, ARTURO, AND EVERYONE AT VALEO FOR WHAT YOU WERE DOING. TO MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER. YOU MAKE US ALL BETTER. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. THE COUNTRY IS BETTER, STRONGER, OR PROSPEROUS, MORE DECENT, MORE HONORABLE IF WE IN FACT REACH OUT AND GET THE LARGEST POPULATION OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNITED STATES AND INCLUDE THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A SOURCE OF AMAZING STRENGTH FOR US. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS OPEN PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SEEING THAT NOW. AT LEAST I HOPE THAT IS THE CASE. I AM GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP TO GET ALL OF THIS DONE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474519-101/joe-biden-naleo-virtual-conference	Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, delivered remarks at the 37th annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO).

CSPANJB128202082	Joe Biden	2020-08-12	Joe Biden Introduction of Senator Kamala Harris as Running Mate	I WANT TO MENTION HOW WHEN KAMALA HARRIS WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, SHE ARRESTED A REPORTER WHO WAS INVESTIGATING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND SHE CHARGED HIM WITH 15 FELONIES. HE'S BEEN IN THE COURTS FIGHTING THIS FOR YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE GOT TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THAT THEY SOLD ABORTED BABY BODY PARTS FOR PROFIT. THEY ALSO CHANGED THE ABORTION PROCEDURE TO GIVE BETTER PARTS , HELLO, HELLO. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WISH WE WERE ABLE TO TALK TO FOLKS OUTSIDE, BUT WE ARE KEEPING OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PLAYING BY THE RULES. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. TO ME AND TO KAMALA, THIS IS AN EXCITING DAY. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN AND A GREAT GAME FOR , GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA, IN OUR VIEW. I HAVE HAD THE INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE WITH MEETING AND SPENDING TIME WITH A TALENTED GROUP OF WOMEN LEADERS, ALL OF WHOM ARE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. WITH EACH ONE, THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THEM, THE MORE I TALK TO THEM, THE MORE IMPRESSED I WAS, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THAT BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM FOR BEING PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE REBUILD THIS COUNTRY, TO GET ELECTED AND ONCE WE ARE ELECTED, GOD WILLING. I APPROACH THIS WITH A SERIOUSNESS, A PURPOSE AND A MIND, BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS MOMENT FOR OUR NATION. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE INFLECTION POINTS , YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. A LIFE-CHANGING ELECTION FOR THIS NATION. THE CHOICE , THE CHOICE WE MAKE THIS NOVEMBER IS GOING TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF AMERICA FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. AND I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I PICKED THE RIGHT PERSON TO JOIN ME AS THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND THAT'S SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. IT SEEMS THAT AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION, AT LEAST AT THE OUTSET HERE, AGREE WITH ME. YESTERDAY WE HAD OUR BEST GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN, MORE THAN DOUBLE OUR PREVIOUS RECORD, AND IN DOING SO WE SET A SINGLE DAY RECORD FOR ONLINE POLITICAL FUNDRAISING. I THINK I KNOW I. , I KNOW WHY. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US AS WELL, THOSE WHO LISTEN TODAY. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM TODAY. FIVE DOLLARS, $10, WHATEVER. KAMALA IS SMART, SHE IS TOUGH, EXPERIENCED. SHE IS A PROVEN FIGHTER FOR THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. ARE ALL THOSE STRUGGLING TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, KAMALA KNOWS HOW TO GOVERN. SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THE HARD CALLS. SHE IS READY TO DO THIS JOB ON DAY ONE. WE ARE BOTH READY TO GET TO WORK REBUILDING THIS NATION AND BUILDING IT BETTER. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE LARGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY, KAMALA TOOK ON THE BIG BANKS OVER MORTGAGE FRAUD AND WON. TOOK ON BIG OIL, WHO WANTED TO POLLUTE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. SHE IS A PIONEER IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND TACKLED THE GUN LOBBY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL WATCHED THE UNITED STATES SENATE GO TOE TO TOE WITH TRUMP OFFICIALS, TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH, ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED AND NOT , , BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SHE HAS BEEN THE SENATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST MASSIVE SECURITY CHALLENGES OUR COUNTRY FACES. WELL AWARE, WELL AWARE OF ALL THE THREATS TO THIS NATION AND READY TO RESPOND TO THEM. AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS, SHE KNOWS PERSONALLY HOW IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ENRICH OUR COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO GROW UP BLACK AND INDIAN-AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMERICA , IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HER STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND MANY PARTICULARS, BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT IN THE ESSENTIALS. SHE HAS WORKED HARD, SHE HAS NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE, AND SHE HAS EARNED EACH AND EVERY OF THE ACCOLADES AND ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SHE HAS GAINED, MANY OF THEM OFTEN IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES THAT OTHERS PUT IN HER WAY, BUT NEVER QUIT. THIS MORNING, ALL ACROSS THE NATION, LITTLE GIRLS WOKE UP, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS, WHO SO OFTEN FEEL OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, BUT TODAY , TODAY, JUST MAYBE, THEY ARE SEEING THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A NEW WAY, AS THE STUFF OF PRESIDENTS AND VICE PRESIDENTS. IN HER CAMPAIGN IN THE PRIMARY, KAMALA OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA, THE MOMS AND DADS AWAKE LATE AT NIGHT IN THEIR KITCHENS, WORRIED, SCARED, UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO SIMPLY MAKE IT. GROWING UP IN SCRANTON IN CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I SAW THAT STRUGGLE WITH MY FAMILY AS WELL AS HE KAMALA SAW IT WITH HERS AS WELL. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING THAT STRUGGLE AS WE SPEAK, ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY JOBS LOST. KAMALA AND I BOTH KNOW JUST GIVE ME A SHOT, A FAIR SHOT. A SHOT AT MAKING IT. AND IT WILL BE THE WORK OF OUR ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THEY GET A FAIR SHOT. WORKING FAMILIES NEED SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE IN THIS NATION, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE PRESIDENT NOW ON THEIR SIDE. THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN A BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. IT IS GOING TO BE GRATIFYING TO SEE THE STRONG, ENTHUSIASTIC REACTION TO SENATOR HARRIS AS OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT COMES FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT IS ALREADY OCCURRING. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ALL IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS, ALL BACKGROUNDS. EVENTS, WE ARE PREDICTABLE AND SOME OF THEM. IT COMES FROM ALL OTHER EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE AND HIS ALLIES. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. YOU COULD HAVE SET YOUR WATCH IS TO IT. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY STARTED HIS ATTACKS, CALLING KAMALA NASTY, WHINING ABOUT SHE IS MEAN TO HER APPOINTEES. IT IS NO SURPRISE, BECAUSE WHINING IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES BEST, BETTER THAN ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. IS ANYONE SURPRISED DONALD TRUMP AS A PROBLEM WITH A STRONG WOMAN OR WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD? LET'S BE CLEAR. IF YOU ARE A WORKING PERSON WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL HAVE A JOB TO GO TO, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR MORTGAGE, YOUR RENT, WORRIED ABOUT THE POISON IN THE AIR YOU BREATHE, THE WATER YOU DRINK, WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS, YOUR RIGHTS TO BASIC DIGNITY, WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK BY THIS ADMINISTRATION, KAMALA HARRIS HAS HAD YOUR BACK, AND NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE HER BACK. SHE IS GOING TO STAND WITH ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR HER. ON JANUARY 20, 2021, WE WILL WATCH SENATOR HARRIS RAISE HER RIGHT HAND AND SWEAR THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO SERVE AS THE SECOND HIGHEST OFFICE IN AMERICA, IN THIS LAND. AND THEN WE WILL GET TO WORK FIXING THE MESS THAT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE CREATED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND MODELING OF TERRORISTS AND THUGS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT ONLY WILL AMERICA DIG ITSELF OUT OF HIS HOLD A PUT US IN, WE WILL BUILD BACK. WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. KAMALA HARRIS IS IN COURT , DONALD IS IN COURT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH HEALTH CARE. I 165,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND CLIMBING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COVID-19, AND STILL MONTHS LATER, NO REAL LEADERSHIP OR PLAN FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOW TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. NO REAL HELP FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO FILL THE VACUUM OF LEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. NO REAL HELP FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FRONT-LINE WORKERS HOLDING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MAKING PROMISES THAT IN THE END WILL DEFUND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM WHILE INSISTING THAT THIS VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR. THE JOE BIDEN KAMALA HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF COVID-19 AND TURNED THE CORNER ON THIS PANDEMIC. MASKING, CLEAR SCIENCE-BASED GUIDANCE, DRAMATICALLY SCALING UP TESTING, GETTING STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES SAFELY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WILLING TO LEAD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. NOT AS THIS PRESIDENT SAYS, IT IS NOT MY FAULT. THE GOVERNORS SHOULD THANK ME MORE. AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, GIVE ME A BREAK. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS, 16 MILLION STILL OUT OF WORK. DONALD TRUMP IS ON TRACK TO BREAK ANOTHER RECORD, ON TRACK TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH THE WORST JOBS RECORD OF ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY, BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK, MEETING FACE-TO-FACE WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN A CRISIS TO GET AMERICANS THE RELIEF THEY NEED AND DESERVE, DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE GOLF COURSE. IF I TOLD YOU THIS THREE YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS BEING CRAZY. HE HAS NOT EVEN MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME, IT APPEARS. WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE. WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, ALL WE HEAR IS THE WORD HOAX. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MEET THE CLIMATE CRISIS, PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND ALONG THE WAY, WE WILL DELIVER ONE WORD, JOBS. GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP SEEKS ONLY TO INFLAME IT WITH THIS POLITICS OF RACIST RHETORIC AND APPEALS TO THE VISION. TODAY IS NOT ONLY THE DAY I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE OF THE PARTY, IT IS ALSO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SEE THOSE NEO-NAZIS AND THOSE KLANSMEN, WHITE SUPREMACISTS COMING OUT OF FIELDS CARRYING LIGHTED TORCHES, FACES CONTORTED, BULGING VEINS, POURING INTO THE STREETS OF HISTORIC AMERICAN CITIES SPEWING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BIO WE HEARD IN HITLER'S GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT TO SEE A VIOLENT CLASH ENSUE BETWEEN THOSE CELEBRATING HATE AND THOSE STANDING AGAINST IT? IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR ALL OF US AS A COUNTRY, FOR ME, A CALL TO ACTION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY AT SILENCE IS COMPLICITY, NOT ORIGINAL TO HIM, BUT HE BELIEVED IT. I KNEW I COULD NOT STAND BY AND LET DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO WENT ON TO SAY WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE HIM CONTINUE TO ATTACK EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA. I KNEW WE WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO RUN. I AM PROUD NOW TO HAVE SENATOR HARRIS AT MY SIDE IN THAT BATTLE , BECAUSE SHE SHARES THE SAME INTENSITY I DO. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE. THE QUESTION IS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO ANSWER, WHO ARE WE AS A NATION? WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE? YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE BARRIERS WE PLACE ON OUR OWN IMAGINATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING AMERICANS CANNOT ACHIEVE WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE KAMALA AS WE BOTH BELIEVE WE CAN DIVIDE AMERICA SIMPLY IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. POSSIBILITIES, THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT SETS THIS NATION APART IS THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, THE ABILITY FOR EVERYONE, AND WE MEAN EVERYONE TO GO AS FAR A DREAM AS BIG AS HARD WORK AND THEIR GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. WHEN I AGREED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RUNNING MATE, HE ASKED ME A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED KAMALA. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME, HE ASKED WHAT I WANTED, MOST IMPORTANTLY? I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM BEFORE HE MADE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT IS WHAT I ASKED KAMALA. I ASKED HER TO BE THE LAST VOICE OF THE ROOM, TO ALWAYS TELL ME THE TRUTH, AND SHE WILL. CHALLENGE MY ASSUMPTIONS IF SHE DISAGREES. ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE WAY WE MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME AT MY HOME TODAY WITH KAMALA AND DOUG, AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THANK THEM PUBLICLY FOR AGREEING TO JOIN AND TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH JILL AND ME. DOUG, YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BARRIER BREAKER YOURSELF IN THIS JOB YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE ON. AMERICA'S FIRST SECOND GENTLEMAN , AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY, I WANT TO THANK ELLEN AND COAL AS WELL. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DOUG'S MOM AND DAD, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET OUR KIDS TOGETHER TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS COMING. MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ABOUT THE AGE OF THEIR CHILDREN. I GOT TO SPEAK TO THEM. MY CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY AFFAIR, EVERY CAMPAIGN I HAVE RUN, SO I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU. YOU ARE ALL HONORARY BIDENS. HERE IS THE BEST PART. YOU HAVE BEEN AN HONORARY BIDENS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I CAME FIRST TO KNOW WHO KAMALA THROUGH OUR SON BEAU BIDEN. THEY WERE FRIENDS. THEY SERVED AS ATTORNEYS GENERAL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY TOOK ON THE SAME BIG FIGHTS TOGETHER. KAMALA IN CALIFORNIA, BO IN DELAWARE. BIG FIGHTS THAT HELP CHANGE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH BEAU RESPECTED KAMALA AND HER WORK. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME AS I MADE THIS DECISION. NOW WE NEED TO GET TO WORK PULLING THIS NATION OUT OF THESE CRISES WE FIND OURSELVES IN. ENDING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, UNITING THIS NATION, AND WINNING THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME YOUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS . THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JOE. AS I SAID WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. AFTER THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRIMARY IN HISTORY, THE COUNTRY RECEIVED A RESOUNDING MESSAGE THAT JOE WAS THE PERSON TO LEAD US FORWARD, AND I AM SO PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU, AND I DO SO MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE HEROIC AND AMBITIOUS WOMEN BEFORE ME WHOSE SACRIFICE, DETERMINATION, AND RESILIENCE MAKES MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY EVEN POSSIBLE. THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT, OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. WE ARE REALLY , REALLY , REELING FROM THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PLUNGED US INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MORAL RECKONING WITH RACISM AND SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE THAT HAS BROUGHT A NEW COALITION OF CONSCIENCE TO THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRY DEMANDING CHANGE. AMERICA IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, YET WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, A PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE, BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FAILED GOVERNMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE. IN JUST 83 DAYS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHOOSE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO, JOE, DR. BIDEN, THANK YOU FOR THE TRUST YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. JILL, I KNOW YOU WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY, AND MY HUSBAND DOUG AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL TO BECOME A PART OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. EVER SINCE I RECEIVED JO'S CALL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING, YES, ABOUT THE FIRST BIDEN I REALLY CAME TO KNOW, AND THAT OF COURSE IS JO'S BELOVED SON BEAU. IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BEAU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WORKING TOGETHER TO WIN BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS FROM THE BIG BANKS OF THE NATION THAT WERE FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEAU BIDEN, I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT BEAU WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO INSPIRED PEOPLE TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF THEMSELVES. HE REALLY WAS THE BEST OF US. WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOVE THAT THEY SHARED WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF THE LOVE BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON. AND BEAU TALKED ABOUT HOW JOE WOULD SPEND EVERY DAY WRITING THE RAILS FROM WILMINGTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SO HE COULD MAKE BREAKFAST FOR HIS KIDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME TO TUCK THEM IN BED EACH NIGHT. ALL OF THIS SO TWO LITTLE BOYS: I JUST LOST THEIR MOM AND SISTER IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT WOULD KNOW THAT THE WORLD WAS STILL TURNING, AND THAT IS HOW I CAME TO KNOW JOE. HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH IS NEVER TO THINK ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HE IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER ASKED, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME, AND INSTEAD ASKS, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU? IS EMPATHY, HIS COMPUTER , HIS EMPATHY, AND HIS COMPASSION, AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR OTHERS IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON THIS TICKET. JOE AND I, YES, WE ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR AMERICA TO GET TO KNOW MY HUSBAND DOUG AND OUR AMAZING KIDS, BECAUSE WHETHER I AM CHEERING IN THE BLEACHERS AT A SWIM MEET WERE SETTING UP A COLLEGE ROOM DOOR OR HELPING MY GODDAUGHTER PREPARE FOR MY SCHOOL , FOR HER SCHOOL DEBATE OR BUILDING LEGOS WITH MY GODSON OR HUGGING MY TWO BABY NIECES OR COOKING DINNER, SUNDAY DINNER, MY FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TITLES OVER MY CAREER, AND CERTAINLY VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE GREAT, BUT MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE THAT MEANS THE MOST. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY CAME FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WORLD TO ARRIVE IN AMERICA. ONE FROM INDIA, AND THE OTHER FROM JAMAICA IN SEARCH OF A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, BUT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S, AND THAT IS HOW THEY MET, AS STUDENTS IN THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TODAY. I WAS PART OF IT. MY PARENTS WOULD BRING ME TO PROTESTS STRAPPED TIGHTLY IN MY STROLLER, AND MY MOTHER RAISED MY SISTER MAIA AND ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS UP TO US AND EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO KEEP ON MARCHING. SHE WOULD TELL US, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS, DO SOMETHING. SO I DID SOMETHING. I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MAKING REAL THE WORDS CARVED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. ADD 30 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREATHED DEEP AND UTTERED THE PHRASE THAT WOULD TRULY GUIDE MY CAREER AND THE REST OF MY CAREER, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, THAT IS WHO I HAVE REPRESENTED AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS WHO NEEDED HELP, THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO I VOTE FOR IS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN I TOOK ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAFFIC AND GUNS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO LIFT HAVE FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHERE I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE ARE WHO JOE AND I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PRESENTED MY FAIR SHARE OF ARGUMENTS IN COURT, THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE IS OPEN AND SHUT. JUST LOOK AT THEY HAVE GOTTEN US. MORE THAN 16 MILLION OUT OF WORK , MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL, A CRISIS OF PROPERTY, HOMELESSNESS INFLICTING BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE MOST. A CRISIS OF HUNGER INFLICTING ONE IN A FIVE MOTHERS WHO HAVE CHILDREN'S WHO ARE HUNGRY, AND TRAGICALLY, MORE THAN A 165,000 LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT. MANY WITH LOVED ONES WHO NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT HEALTH CRISIS. IT WAS CALLED EBOLA, AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEN? BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN DID THEIR JOBS. ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIE, TWO. THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. COMPARE THAT TO THE MOMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, TRUMP PUSHED MIRACLE CURES TO SELL ON FOX NEWS. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE FLATTENING THE CURVES, HE SAID THE VIRUS WOULD JUST, PROOF , POOF, GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN BACK OF HER BUSINESS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN. THIS VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A REASON IT HAS HIT AMERICA WORSE THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS , TRUMP'S FAILURE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE START. HIS REFUSAL TO GET TESTING UP AND RUNNING, AND FLIP-FLOPPING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. IT IS DELUSIONAL BELIEF THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE EXPERTS. ALL OF THAT IS REASON, THE RECENT THAT AN AMERICAN DIES OF COVID-19 EVERY 80 SECONDS. IT IS WHY COUNTLESS BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IT IS WHY THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS OVER WHEN AND HOW TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS ARE CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN AND ANGRY ABOUT CHILDCARE AND TO SAFETY OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL, WHETHER THEY WILL BE IN DANGER IF THEY GO OR FALL BEHIND IF THEY DO NOT. TRUMP IS ALSO THE REASON IT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED. HE INHERITED THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN HISTORY FROM BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN, AND THEN, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF TRUMPS FAILURES , TRUMP'S FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OUT OF ALL OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT HAS TRIPLED AS OF TODAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ELECT THE GUY WHO JUST IS NOT UP FOR THE JOB. OUR COUNTRY ENDS UP IN TATTERS, AND SO DOES OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP OR MIKE PENCE, IT IS ABOUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY BACK BETTER. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION, BRING BRACK , BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO EVERYONE HAS THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINALLY OFFERED CAREGIVERS THE DIGNITY, THE RESPECT, AND THE PAY THEY DESERVE. WE WILL PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY, WROTE OUT SYSTEMIC , ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PASS A JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO JOE. IT IS LIKE YOU GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, WHY HE HELPED REAUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RESTORE UNEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWS. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN THE ONGOING STORY OF AMERICA'S MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS THE ONLY, AS THE ONLY WAY SERVED ALONGSIDE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND HAS CHOSEN THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. BUT AS JOE ALWAYS POINTS OUT, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. I WILL ADMIT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I HAVE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WHENEVER I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR DOUBT, WHENEVER I HAVE HAD MY OWN DOUBTS, I THINK OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING YOUR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS, THE TRUCK DRIVERS AND WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, IN FACTORIES, FARMS WORKING THERE, PUTTING YOUR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE TO UP US GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, THE WOMEN AND STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS , THE DREAMERS AND IMMIGRANTS WHO KNOW THAT FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER, THE LGBTQ AMERICANS WHO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS LOVE, PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE AND COLOR AND GREAT YOU FINALLY DECLARING IN ONE VOICE, BLACK LIVES MATTER . ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY , THIS COUNTRY, A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS HEARING UP , GROWING UP HEARING THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE AND CHANTS OF HOPE ON WHICH I WAS RAISED, SOME STRAPPED INTO STROLLERS OF THEIR OWN. IT IS A SONG YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. TO EVERYONE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GREAT. YOU ARE THE HEROES OF OUR TIME, AND YOU ARE THE REASON. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY CLOSER TO REALIZING IT'S GREAT PROMISE. TO DO IT, WE WILL NEED TO WORK, ORGANIZE AND VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED MORE THAN A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. WE NEED A MANDATE THAT PROVES THE PAST FOUR YEARS ARE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. JOE LIKES TO SAY THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT, AND IT IS TRUE. WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, Q KNEW WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. TOGETHER WITH YOUR HELP, IT IS A BATTLE WE WILL WIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER JOE ASKED ME TO DO. NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SAME. VISIT JOB, JOEBIDEN.COM. ELECTING JOE BIDEN IS JUST THE START OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE BUT DECIDED RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU, THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WORLD WAR II, FOR THEM ROOSEVELT TOLD THE COUNTRY THE NEWS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT IS TO TELL IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER, TELL THE TRUTH. TO BE CANDID, TO FACE FACTS, TO LEAD, NOT TO INCITE. THAT IS WHY I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IS INCAPABLE OF TELLING US THE TRUTH, INCAPABLE OF FACING THE FACTS AND INCAPABLE OF HEALING. HE DOES NOT WANT TO SHED LIGHT, HE WANTS TO GENERATE HEAT. HE IS STOKING VIOLENCE IN OUR CITIES. THIS IS A TRAGIC FACT OF THE MATTER ABOUT HIS PERILOUS OUR. , ABOUT THIS PERILOUS HOUR. WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNWARRANTED POLICE SHOOTING, EXCESSIVE FORCE. SEVEN BULLETS TO THE BACK OF JACOB BLAKE. VIOLENCE OF EXTREMISTS AND OPPORTUNISTS, RIGHT-WING MILITIAS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, VIGILANTES, WHO INFILTRATE PROTEST. HOPING TO WREAK HAVOC AND TO DERAIL ANY HOPE OF PROGRESS. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ALL THIS. WRITING IS NOT PROTESTING , RIOTING IS NOT PROTESTING, SETTING FIRES IS NOT PROTESTING. NONE OF THIS IS PROTESTING. IT IS LAWLESSNESS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THOSE WHO DO IT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. VIOLENCE WILL NOT BRING CHANGE. IT WILL ONLY BRING DESTRUCTION. IT IS WRONG IN EVERY WAY. IT DIVIDES INSTEAD OF UNITES. THIS ONLY HURTS THE WORKING FAMILIES THAT SERVE THE COMMUNITY. IT MAKES THINGS WORSE ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT BETTER. IT IS NOT WHAT DR. KING OR JOHN LEWIS TAUGHT. IT MUST END. FIRES ARE BURNING AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO FANS THE FLAMES RATHER THAN FIGHTING THE FLAMES. WE MUST NOT BURN, WE HAVE TO BUILD. THIS PRESIDENT LONG AGO FORFEITED ANY MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE CANNOT STOP THE VIOLENCE BECAUSE FOR YEARS HE HAS FOMENTED IT. HE MAY BELIEVE THAT MOUTHING THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER MAKES HIM STRONG. BUT HIS FAILURE TO CALL ON HIS OWN SUPPORTERS TO STOP ACTING AS AN ARMED MILITIA IN THIS COUNTRY SHOWS HOW WEAK HE IS. DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE LESS VIOLENCE IN AMERICA IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED? WE NEED JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE NEED SAFETY IN AMERICA. WE ARE FACING CRISES THAT KEPT MULTIPLYING. COVID, ECONOMIC DEMONSTRATION, UNWARRANTED POLICE VIOLENCE. IN BOLDING , EMBOLDENING WHITE NATIONALISTS. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T JUST DO SO MUCH MORE THAT WE ARE DOING , THEN WE ARE DOING. THE COMMON THREAD IS THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO MAKES THINGS WORSE, NOT BETTER. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO SOWS CHAOS RATHER THAN PROVIDING ORDER. AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO FAILS IN THE BASIC DUTY OF THE JOB. THAT IS TO ADVANCE THE TRUTH THAT ALL OF US KNOW. WE ARE ALL BORN WITH THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS RIGHT, ALL OF US. THE MOMS AND DADS IN SCRANTON WHERE I GREW UP WHO HAVE WORKED AND SCRIPT FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN LIFE. THE AUTOWORKER IN MICHIGAN WHO MAKES , WHO STOMACHS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THE SINGLE MOM IN OHIO MAKING , A SINGLE MOM IN OHIO WORKING THREE JOBS TO STAY AFLOAT WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HER CHILD, RETIRED VETERAN IN FLORIDA WHO GAVE EVERYTHING HE HAD TO THIS COUNTRY AND NOW JUST WANTS US TO HONOR THE PROMISES MADE TO HIM. THE LORD & TAYLOR SALESPERSON WHO JUST LOST THEIR JOB, A STORE CLOSING AFTER 194 YEARS. NURSES AND DOCTORS IN WISCONSIN WHO HAVE SEEN SO MUCH SICKNESS AND DEATH, AND THEY WONDER HOW MUCH MORE CAN THEY TAKE, BUT STILL THEY MUSTER UP THE COURAGE TO TAKE THEIR OF THOSE IN THIS , TAKE CARE OF THOSE PATIENTS IN THIS PANDEMIC WHILE RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES. RESEARCHERS IN MINNESOTA WHO WOKE UP THIS MORNING DETERMINED TO FIND A BREAKTHROUGH IN TREATING CANCER. THEY WILL DO THE SAME THING TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER AND THE DAY AFTER BECAUSE SHE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WHITE, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICANS, EVERYBODY. I AM IN THIS CAMPAIGN FOR YOU, NO MATTER YOUR COLOR, ZIP CODE, POLITICS. WHEN I THINK OF THE PRESIDENCY, I DON'T THINK ABOUT MYSELF, IT IS NOT ABOUT MY BRAND, IT IS ABOUT YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE CAN DO BETTER, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL DO BETTER. THE ROAD BACK BEGINS NOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW MY HEART. YOU KNOW MY STORY, MY FAMILY STORY. ASK YOURSELF IF I LOOK LIKE A RADICAL SOCIALIST WITH A SOFT SPOT FOR RIOTERS? REALLY? I WANT TO SAVE AMERICA, SAY FROM COVID, SAFE FROM CRIME AND LOOTING. SAFE FROM RACIALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, SAFE FROM BAD COPS. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. SAFE FROM FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. I LOOK AT THIS VIOLENCE AND I SEE LIVES AND COMMUNITIES AND THE DREAMS OF SMALL BUSINESSES BEING DESTROYED. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REAL PROGRESS IN THE ISSUES OF RACE AND POLICE REFORM, JUSTICE BEING PUT TO THE TEST. DONALD TRUMP LOOKS AT THIS VIOLENCE AND SEES A POLITICAL LIFELINE. HAVING FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION FROM THE VIRUS, IT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 180,000 AMERICANS SO FAR. TRUMP POSTED IN ALL CAPS , AN ALL CAPS TWEET TO SAVE HIS CAMPAIGN. SHE COMES OUT AS HAS A, THE MORE CHAOS, VIOLENCE, THE BETTER IT IS FOR TRUMP'S REELECTION. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY BUT INSTEAD, HE IS ROOTING FOR CHAOS AND VIOLENCE. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICA. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE RECORD, WE WILL SEE MORE AMERICAN DEATH TO A VIRUS, THIS VIRUS THAN THE NATION HAS SUFFERED IN EVERY WAR SINCE KOREA COMBINED. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THEIR ECONOMY, THAT HAS SEEN MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE SIMPLE PROPOSITION OF SENDING OUR CHILDREN SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOL. SINCE THEY HAVE NO AGENDA OR VISION FOR A SECOND TERM. TRUMP AND PENTZ ARE RUNNING ON THIS, I FIND IT FASCINATING. IT WON'T BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. WHAT IS THERE PROOF? THE VIOLENCE WE ARE SEEING IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. THESE ARE NOT IMAGES OF SOME IMAGINED JOE BIDEN AMERICA OF THE FUTURE, THESE ARE IMAGES OF DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA TODAY. HE KEEPS SAYING IF HE WAS PRESIDENT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN, YOU WOULD FEEL SAFE. WILL HE IS PRESIDENT WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT. IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS GETTING WORSE. YOU KNOW WHY. DONALD TRUMP ADDS FUEL TO EVERY FIRE. HE REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RACIAL JUSTICE PROBLEM IN AMERICA. HE WON'T STAND UP TO ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE. HE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH RIGHT WING MILITIAS. OFTEN BETTER ARMED THAN THE POLICE, OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF VIOLENCE. AND BECAUSE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DON'T TRUST THIS PRESIDENT TO RESPECT THEIR RIGHTS, TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS OR TO PROTECT THEM. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE HAD TO DEFEND FEDERAL PROPERTY. WE DID IT, WE DID NOT SEE IT , YOU DID NOT CS WHIPPING UP FEARS AROUND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SECRET FEDERAL TRUCE. , TROOPS. WE JUST DID OUR JOB. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN OFFICE, WE DID NOT LOOK AT CITIES AS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN RUN, THESE ARE AMERICAN CITIES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEE HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. FRANKLY, I BELIEVE IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, THE COUNTRY WOULD BE SAFER AND WE WOULD BE SEEING A LOT LESS VIOLENCE. HERE IS WHY. I SAID WE MUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. I PERSONALLY SPOKE TO GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY AND JACOB BLAKE'S FAMILY. I KNOW THEIR PAIN AND SO DO YOU. I KNOW THE JUSTICE THEY SEEK AND SO DO YOU. THEY TOLD US NONE OF THIS VIOLENCE RESPECTS OR HONORS GEORGE OR JACOB. I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR RACIAL INJUSTICE TO THE TABLE. I WORKED WITH POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS. I KNOW THAT MOST COPS ARE GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE. I KNOW HOW THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY TIME THEY PUT THAT SHIELD ON AND LOCK THE DOOR. I AM CONFIDENT THAT I CAN BRING THE POLICE TO THE TABLE AS WELL. I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MAYOR AND GOVERNOR HAD THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING TO USE THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, MY LANGUAGE WOULD BE LESS DIVISIVE. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT RAISE IT. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO UNITE THE NATION. BUT LOOK, IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO ASK THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL KEEP YOU SAFE OR AS PRESIDENT? BUT AFTER THAT QUESTION. FIRST, SOME SIMPLE FACTS. WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, FILED , VIOLENT CRIME FELL 15% IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS , WE DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS AND WITHOUT DISORDER ORDER. AND YES, WE DID IT WITH DEMOCRATIC MAYORS AND MOST OF THE CDS , MAJOR CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE MURDER RATE IS UP UNDER DONALD TRUMP. YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER DONALD TRUMP? COVID HAS TAKEN THIS YEAR , IT HAS TAKEN MORE THAN , MORE LIES THIS YEAR THAN ANY OTHER YEAR FOR THE LAST 100 YEARS. MORE THAN 180,000 LIES IN JUST SIX MONTHS. AN AVERAGE OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING PER WEEK IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FEAR, DINO IT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF IN AMERICA? THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET COVID. THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET SICK AND DIE. THAT IS IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF YOU. WE ARE NOW ON TRACK FOR MORE THAN 200,000 DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF COVID. MORE THAN 100,000 SENIORS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE VIRUS. MORE COPS HAVE DIED FROM COVID THIS YEAR THAN HAVE BEEN KILLED ON PATROL. NEARLY ONE IN SIX SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY. DO YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP? WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DESTROY THE FEDERAL CARE ACT? PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT IMPACTS MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS. DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER? HOW ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEFUND SOCIAL SECURITY? SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CHIEF ACTUARY JUST RELIEF , RELEASED A REPORT SAYING IF TRUMP'S PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT, THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FORM WOULD BE ""PERMANENTLY DEPLETED BY THE MIDDLE OF CALENDAR YEAR 2023, WITH NO ABILITY TO PAY BENEFITS THEREAFTER."" TO PUT IT PLAINLY, TRUMPS PLAN WOULD WIPE OUT SOCIAL SECURITY, PERIOD. DO YOU FEEL SAFER AND MORE SECURE NOW? THE FEAR THAT REIGNS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT STOP AT OUR SHORES. THE KREMLIN HAS PUT BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. INSTEAD OF TELLING VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT THERE WILL BE NO PUTTING UP WITH THIS, THAT THERE WILL BE A HEAVY PRICE TO PLAY IF HE TOUCHES AN AMERICAN SOLDIER, THIS PRESIDENT DOES I EVEN BRING UP THE SUBJECT IN HIS MOBILE PHONE CALL WITH PUTIN. A REPORT THAT THE RUSSIAN FORCES JUST ATTACKED AMERICAN FORCES IN SYRIA, INJURING OUR SERVICEMEMBERS. DID YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY A SINGLE WORD? DID HE LIFT ONE FINGER NEVER BEFORE HAS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT PAID SUCH A SUBSERVIENT ROLE TO RUSSIAN LEADERS. IT'S NOT ONLY DANGEROUS, IT'S HUMILIATING AND EMBARRASSING FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SEE IT WEAKENS US. NOT EVEN AMERICAN TROOPS CAN FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE AS A BYSTANDER IN HIS OWN PRESIDENCY EXTENDS THE ECONOMIC PLAN AND PAIN. THE PLANNING DOESN'T HAVE IN THE PAIN BEING FELT BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. HE SAID THIS WEEK, ""YOU BETTER VOTE FOR ME OR YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST DEPRESSION YOU HAVE EVER SEEN."" DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND AND SEE THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR SO FAR? THAT PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE NEXT MONTH'S RENT PAYMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO LOST WAGES OVER COST OF GROCERIES GOING UP DRAMATICALLY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I STOPPED THE DEPRESSION IN 2009. WE TOOK A BAD ECONOMY THAT WAS FALLING AND TURNED IT AROUND. TRUMP TOOK A GOOD ECONOMY AND DROVE IT BACK INTO THE DITCH. THROUGH HIS FAILURE TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL, HIS FAILURE TO PULL TOGETHER THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS, HIS FAILURE TO DELIVER REAL RELIEF TO WORKING PEOPLE HAS MADE OUR COUNTRY ECONOMIC SITUATION SO MUCH WORSE, SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT HAD TO BE. WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND SECURITY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE SIX SECURITY AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK. DON'T WORRY, WE WILL NOT LOSE OUR HOME. WE WILL PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT'S GOING TO BE OK. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. I'VE LAID OUT AN AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WILL RESTORE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE WON'T JUST BUILDINGS BACK THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE, WE WILL BUILD THEM BACK THAT HER. WITH GOOD PAYING DROPS , JOBS. WITH INVESTMENTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE AND CHILD CARE WORKERS SO THEY GET THE PAY IN DIGNITY THEY DESERVE. WHILE USING A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. WITH THE CLEAN ENERGY STRATEGY THAT HAS A PLACE FOR THE ENERGY WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. I AM NOT BANNING FRACTION , FRACKING. I AM NOT BANNING FRACKING NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES DONALD TRUMP WISE ABOUT ME , LIES ABOUT ME. THE FUTURE IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE HEAR DONALD TRUMP SELF-CENTERED RANT AND RISKS. THE VOICE OF AMERICANS SHOULD BE HEARD. THE ONE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIS JULIA JACKSON, THE MOTHER OF JACOB BLAKE. THE VOICE OF COURAGE, CHARACTER AND WISDOM. LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN HER CITY, SHE SAID ""THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION DOES NOT REFLECT THE SUN OR MY FAMILY. THESE OTHER WORDS OF A MOM, A MOTHER WHOSE SON HAD JUST BEEN SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN. BADLY WOMEN PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. EVEN , BADLY WOUNDED, PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. SHE IS PLEADING FOR THIS NATION TO HEAL. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR HER SON. THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING TO ME THAT SURPRISED ME. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR ALL POLICE OFFICERS. SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYING , PRAYING FOR AMERICA EVEN BEFORE HER SON WAS SHOT. SHE HAS PUBLICLY ASKED ALL OF US TO EXAMINE OUR HEARTS. CITIZENS, ELECTED OFFICIALS, POLICE, ALL OF US. THEN SHE SAID THIS, ""WE NEED HEALING."" MORE THAN ANYTHING. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A NATION. WE NEED TO HEAL. THE CURRENT PRESIDENT WANTS YOU TO LIVE IN FEAR. HE ADVERTISES HIMSELF AS A FIGURE OF ORDER. HE ISN'T. HE HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE SOLUTION THUS FAR. HE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM THAT I WILL BE YOU MY ALL RESOLVED TO STOP. I WILL DEAL WITH THE VIRUS. I WILL DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. ITHE PROBLEM THAT I WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE. WE'VE ARRIVED AT A MOMENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHERE WE ALL KNOW, EVEN THE PRESS WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND IN FRONT OF ME, KNEW WE WOULD GET TO. THE MOMENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE SO DESPERATE HE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HOLD ONTO POWER. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A TOXIC PRESENCE IN OUR NATION FOR FOUR YEARS. POISONING HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. POISONING HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER. POISONING THE VALUES THIS NATION HAS ALWAYS HELD DEAR. POISONING OUR VERY DEMOCRACY. NOW, IN JUST A LITTLE OVER 60 DAYS, WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. WILL WE RID OURSELVES OF THIS TOXIN? OR WILL WE MAKE A PERMANENT PART , MAKE IT A PERMANENT PART OF OUR NATION'S CHARACTER? AS AMERICANS, I AM CONFIDENT WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY AND DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR, AND DEMONIZING NO ONE. WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEEM TO BELIEVE IN ANY OF THAT. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT SPEAKS TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. IN THE DIRT , AND THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED EQUALLY. TRUMP HAS SOUGHT TO REMAKE THIS NATION IN HIS IMAGE, SELFISH, ANGRY, DARK AND DIVISIVE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AT OUR BEST, AMERICA'S ALWAYS BEEN, AND IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, IT WILL BE AGAIN GENEROUS, AND OPTIMISTIC NATION FULL OF HOPE AND RESOLVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO INSTILL FEAR IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHAT HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN TO. FEAR. I BELIEVE AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN THAT. I BELIEVE WE WILL BE GUIDED BY THE WORDS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II. WORDS DRAWN FROM SCRIPTURE. BE NOT AFRAID. BE NOT AFRAID. FEAR NEVER BUILDS THE FUTURE, BUT HOPE DOES. AND BUILDING THE FUTURE IS WHAT AMERICA DOES, WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. IT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE BEST AND CONTINUE TO DO BEST. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY WHEN WE DECIDE TO DO IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S GET TOGETHER. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475311-1/joe-biden-delivers-remarks-public-safety-law-enforcement	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks on public safety and law enforcement during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

CSPANJB29202084	Joe Biden	2020-09-02	Joe Biden Remarks on Reopening Schools During COVID-19	"EARLIER TODAY, JOE BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS AMID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. HE WAS JOINED BY HIS WIFE, JILL, A FORMER TEACHER. THIS TOOK PLACE IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, AND RUNS 40 MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. WELCOME TO THE QUEEN THEATER. I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A CRISIS. A CRISIS BEING FELT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND JILL AND I HAVE JUST BEEN BRIEFED, AS YOU KNOW, IN THIS ROOM BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. BACK-TO-SCHOOL HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SPECIAL TIME. IT IS IN YOUR FAMILY AND MINE, BUT PARTICULARLY IN MINE, ALL THE YEARS JILL AND I WERE MARRIED, SHE WAS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, TOO, AS A TEACHER. SHE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THIS SHOULD BE A SEASON OF PROMISE FOR OUR COUNTRY. TIMES WHEN CLASSROOMS ARE CRACKLING WITH THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE NEW YEAR, STUDENTS' HOPES, ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE. BUT THIS YEAR, WE ARE FACING THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF HEART AND GRIT FROM OUR EDUCATORS, OUR STUDENTS, TO TRY TO RISE TO THE OCCASION. BUT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT COME UP TO THAT BAR. HASN'T SHOWN MUCH GRIT OR DETERMINATION. TO BE CLEAR, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD DONE THEIR JOBS EARLY ON WITH THIS CRISIS, AMERICAN SCHOOLS WOULD BE OPEN AND OPEN SAFELY. INSTEAD, AMERICAN FAMILIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS FAILURES AND HIS ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES. LIKE MANY OF YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE REPORTERS, YOU HAVE FRIENDS, CHILDREN, YOU'RE PROBABLY HEARING THE SAME THING I HAVE BEEN HEARING. THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THEY ARE WORRIED. THEY ARE WORRIED LIKE THE DEVIL. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR MY KIDS? IS THIS SETTING MY CHILD'S EDUCATION BACK BEYOND JUST A SEMESTER? WHAT IMPACT WILL IT HAVE? HOW IS MY CHILD GOING TO CATCH UP? WHAT IF I AM NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP MY CHILD SUCCEED? ALL THOSE QUESTIONS, THE SELF-DOUBT HAS BEEN ENGAGED. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY NOT THINK THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. BUT I THINK GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AND THE IMPACTS ON FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY, IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT IT IS. PROTECTING OUR STUDENTS, OUR EDUCATORS, COMMUNITIES, GETTING OUR SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY, THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE ANY REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS SAFELY. NO REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO HELP PARENTS FEEL SECURE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. HE IS OFFERING NOTHING BUT FAILURE AND DELUSIONS, START TO FINISH, AMERICAN FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS FAILURES. FAILURE TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY EARLY ON IN JANUARY, FEBRUARY, AS IT SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE. FAILURE TO TAKE STEPS WE NEEDED IN MARCH AND APRIL TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL, TO INSTITUTE WIDESPREAD TESTING AND TRACING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD. FAILURE TO PROVIDE CLEAR, NATIONAL, SCIENCE-BASED GUIDELINES TO STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AND FAILURE TO MODEL EVEN BASIC RESPONSIBILITY LIKE SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND WEARING A MASK. AND FAILURE TO MAKE SURE EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE THE EQUIPMENT, RESOURCES, AND TRAINING NEEDED TO OPEN SAFELY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND NOW. DONALD TRUMP AND BETSY DEVOS HAVE NOT STEPPED UP. WE ARE ALL CASEEING THE RESULTS. MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ARE STARTING A NEW SCHOOL YEAR IN THE SAME WAY THEY FINISHED THE LAST ONE, AT HOME. AT HOME. PARENTS ARE DOING THEIR BEST, BUT MORE AND MORE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES AT WIT'S END, STRUGGLING TO BALANCE WORK, CHILDCARE, AND EDUCATION DUTIES. OR WORRYING ABOUT THEIR LOSS PAYCHECK AND HOW THEY WILL MAKE ENDS MEET WHILE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR KIDS ON TRACK WITH REMOTE LEARNING. EDUCATORS ARE TAKING ON COUNTLESS HOURS OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO LEARN HOW TO USE REMOTE LEARNING TOOLS SO THEY CAN STILL BE THERE FOR THEIR STUDENTS, BUT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE KIDS WHO USED TO COUNT ON OUR SCHOOLS. ALL THOSE CHILDREN WHO NEEDED SO BADLY, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO NEED MORE THAN EDUCATION. THEY PROVIDE MEALS AND SAFE PLACES TO SPEND THE DAY. YOU NOW, WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE COVID-19 DOESN'T FURTHER EXACERBATE DISPARITIES, THE DISPARITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE EXISTED IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. FOR SO MANY POOR CHILDREN, SO MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND IT CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS. WE ALL WANT OUR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. WITH A PLAN THAT PRIORITIZES HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS AND STAFF. I LAID OUT MY PLANS BACK IN JUNE AND JULY, A ROADMAP FOR HOW TO REOPEN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. YOU CAN READ THEM BY GOING TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED STRAIGHTFORWARD, COMMON-SENSE SOLUTIONS. BUT TRUMP REFUSES TO ACT, STARVING SCHOOLS OF THE NEEDED FUNDING, FUNDING THEY NEED NOW. NOW! THEY NEEDED IT BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER. NOW TRUMP'S FEMA DIRECTOR IS CUTTING SCHOOLS LOOSE. JUST YESTERDAY FENA ANNOUNCED, AFTER HELPING THREE DISTRICTS , I THINK IT WAS THREE , THEY WILL NOT HELP PAY FOR CLOTH MASKS, PPE FOR SCHOOL SETTINGS, CLEANING. THOSE BASIC HEALTH NEEDS. SANITIZING EVERYTHING FROM LABORATORIES TO CLASSROOMS. AND SAFETY COSTS FOR SCHOOL THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. AND DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FEMA SHOULD TREAT IT AS ONE. IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, I WOULD DIRECT FEMA TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS K-12 GET FULL ACCESS TO DISASTER RELIEF AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE UNDER THE STAFFORD ACT. I WOULD MAKE SURE PPE AND SANITATION SUPPLIES QUALIFY AS EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES, WHICH IS A PHRASE THEY USE, TO FULLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. ON TOP OF THAT, I WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS NOW, TODAY, TO PASS EMERGENCY PACKAGES FOR SCHOOLS SO THEY WOULD HAVE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OPEN SAFELY. MONEY FOR VENTILATION. I HEARD THAT A LOT WHEN I HAVE THOSE HEALTH-CARE EXPERTS UP ON THE ZOOM. MONEY FOR VENTILATION AND OTHER HEALTH MEASURES, BUT ALSO MORE MONEY TO HIRE MORE TEACHERS. EVERY RECOMMENDATION WE GOT WAS THEY SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO PODS, SMALLER CLASSES. SMALLER CLASSES MEAN MORE EDUCATORS ARE NEEDED. KEEPING CLASSES SOCIALLY DISTANCED, SMALL. MONEY FOR MORE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELORS. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION A LONG TIME AGO CALLING FOR , I PROPOSED LEGISLATION A LONG TIME AGO , WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST EVERY 1507 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL. AND THE HEALTH CARE, THE MENTAL HEALTH OUR CHILDREN NEED NOW. THE ANXIETY THEY ARE FEELING AT HOME, GOING TO SCHOOL, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. THE NATION'S SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS HAVE ESTIMATED THEY NEED AT LEAST $200 BILLION TO SUPPORT K-12 SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FOR SAFE REOPENING. WE NEED THE MONEY TO HIRE EDUCATORS AS WELL FOR OUR FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, HBCU'S, MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ARE READY TO GET THIS DONE. THEY HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED LEGISLATION. MR. PRESIDENT, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING ON THIS? WE NEED EMERGENCY SUPPORT SUPPORT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND WE NEED IT NOW. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT IS YOUR JOB. THAT IS YOUR JOB. THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON NOW. GETTING OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY, KEEPING SCHOOLS SAFELY ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN ONCE THEY OPEN. NOT WHIPPING UP FEAR AND DIVISION, NOT INCITING VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS. GET OFF TWITTER, AND START TALKING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES. INVITE THEM TO THE OVAL OFFICE. THE OVAL OFFICE. AND STOP YOUR BOAST ABOUT BEING NOT , THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE. NEGOTIATE A DEAL. A DEAL FOR SOMEBODY OTHER THAN YOURSELF. NOW I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I GUESS STAFF IS GOING TO CALL ON WHOEVER, FIRE AWAY. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. TWO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU IF I MAY. AHEAD OF YOUR TRIP TO KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID THE OFFICER WHO SHOT JACOB BLAKE BASED ON WHAT HE HAS SEEN SHOULD BE CHARGED AND DO YOU BELIEVE AND YOU FEEL THAT THE SAME SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF BREONNA TAYLOR? I THINK THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SHOULD WORK ITS WAY. AND THE OFFICERS SHOULD BE CHARGED AS WELL AS IN BREONNA TAYLOR. I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN PORTLAND WHERE ONE OF THE TRUMP GUYS RIDING ALONG IN VANS AND SHOOTING RUBBER BULLETS OR PAINT BALLS AND SOMEONE WAS SHOT BY SOMEONE IN THE CROWD WITH A BULLET, KILLED. I THINK THAT PERSON SHOULD MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THROUGH WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. LET'S MAKE SURE JUSTICE IS DONE. QUICKLY ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC THERE IS A NEW BOOK BY ""NEW YORK TIMES"" THAT SAID WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A VISIT TO WALTER REED, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS TOLD TO BE ON STAND BY IN CASE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO RECEIVE ANESTHESIA AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. AS VICE PRESIDENT WERE YOU TOLD TO BE ON STAND BY OR ANY KIND OF SPECIAL ALERT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GOING IN FOR A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT AND ANY CONCERNS THAT IT DIDN'T FOLLOW PRIOR PROTOCOL? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. NOTHING THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES IS NORMAL. I'M NOT BEING FASEACHOUS. WHO IN GOD'S NAME KNOWS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW KNOW. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. I WILL LET THE EXPERTS DO THAT. AND SO THE ONLY TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN ON NOTICE IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND I'M IN THE COUNTRY, NOT THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT I IMMEDIATELY HUB AWARE OF ANYTHING, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE CALLED FOR. IT WASN'T CALLED FOR. ON YOUR VISIT TO KENOSHA TOMORROW, LOCAL OFFICIALS DISCOURAGED PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM VISITING AND YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL N ARCH A CRMP P SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE EITHER CANDIDATE VISIT. WHY IS NOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO KENOSHA AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH TOMORROW? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING CALL WITH THE GOVERNOR AND DEALT WITH STAFF BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING REQUESTS THAT I DO COME BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE HAVE TO HEAL AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. MY PURPOSE IN GOING TO BE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON WHAT'S GOING ON, TALK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS A MECHANISM TO BRING THE FOLKS TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO HEAL. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. AND SO, I HAVE GOTTEN ADVICE FROM SITTING MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS AND SENATE AS WELL TO GO AND THAT I SHOULD GO AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEET , MEETING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AS WELL AS BUSINESS PEOPLE AND OTHER FOLKS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO SEE , START TO TALK WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL KENOSHA WHAT HAS TO BE DONE BUT WE DO TOGETHER. THE IDEA WE ARE SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS RETREAT TO THEIR CORNERS AND KEEP THIS MOVING IS JUST A MISTAKE. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE INCLUDING THIS CITY, BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND BRINGING PEOPLE AND POLICE OFFICERS TOGETHER AND BUSINESS LEADERS AND CIVIC LEADERS AND THAT'S MY PURPOSE IN GOING. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRAVELING TO WISCONSIN AT ALL, THIS IS ONLY THE THIRD TIME IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE. YOU HAVE TALKT ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTORS IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGNING SAFELY BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T YOU OUT THERE MORE. THE PRESIDENT WAS CALLING YOUR CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE TODAY? HOW ARE YOU WILLING TO PUSH IT AND SPEAK TO THE VOTERS DIRECTLY? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: MY MESSAGE IS GETTING OUT BASED ON THE POLLING DATA SHOWS AND WHAT I HAVE SAID AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I HAVE SAID IT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT MORE. BUT A PRESIDENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SET THE RIGHT EXAMPLE HOW TO GO OUT AND NOT WEAR A MASK AND NOT HAVE LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE NOT WEARING MASKS OR AR CALL DRON FOR SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAKS OF COVID. AND SO WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE MET WITH THE , VIA , WHAT I DID THIS MORNING WITH THE MEDICAL EXPERTS. AND SO, WE HAVE WORKED OUT A PROTOCOL HOW I GET IN THE PLANE, WHAT KIND OF A PLANE, HOW IT IS SANITIZED AND HOW I ENGAGE PEOPLE LIKE I ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU. IT IS ALWAYS AT A SAFE DISTANCE AND EVERYONE IS WEARING MASKS AND VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I'M MEETING WITH HAVE COME INTO MY HOME AND ALL TESTED AS WELL. I'M JUST TRYING TO SET THE EXAMPLE AND WEARING THE PROTECTIVE GEAR, A MASK, WHICH I HAVE WITH ME. I'M ABLE AT THIS DISTANCE TO TAKE IT OFF, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, MAKE SURE WE PROCEED IN WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING. THEY ANNOUNCED THE MODERATEORS AND KRISTEN WELKER. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD DISSUADE YOU AND HOW HAVE YOU BEGUN TO PREPARE? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'M GOING OVER WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID AND MULTIPLE LIES HE HAS TOLD. WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IS A FACT CHECKER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IF WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING. THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT, GREAT DEBATE IF BOTH OF US SAID WAS INSTANTLY FACT CHECKED BY AN AGREED-TO GROUP OF PEOPLE. BUT THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET FAR IN THE DEBATE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING THE PRESIDENT AND I'M GOING TO LAY OUT AS CLEARLY AS I CAN WHAT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK AND BRING IT BACK BETTER AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATE. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE HEARD A LOT FROM VOTERS IS THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE WORRIED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONGOING VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE SITUATION IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN. I'M CURIOUS, YOU ARE NOT PRESIDENT NOW BUT DONALD TRUMP IS, BUT IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE KEPT SAFE? FIRST OF ALL, I WOULDN'T IN CITE VIOLENCE AND CONDEMN IT WHEN IT OCCURS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS ARE GOOD, HONEST, DECENT MEN AND WOMEN. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO HOME THAT NIGHT SAFELY, THE VAST MAJORITY. BUT JUST THOSE WHO ARE NOT GOOD COPS, ALL THE POLICE I HAVE DEALT WITH MY WHOLE LIFE AND I HAVE BEEN , I HAVE GOTTEN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CAREER. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE BAD COPS BECAUSE IT REFLECTS BAD ON THEM. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ANY VIOLENCE, ANY VIOLENCE, PROTESTING IS A RIGHT AND FREE SPEECH IS A RIGHT. BUT TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE, BURNING, LOOTING AND THE REST IN THE NAME OF PROTESTING IS WRONG. AND THE PERSON PES SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND SO WHAT I WOULD BE DOING I WOULD BE BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND HAVING THAT POLICE COMMISSION SET UP AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE THE COMMUNITY AT THE TABLE AND HAVE PEOPLE AND SAYING, HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THIS? BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT WANT TOLL STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT, NOT INFLAME THINGS. BUT THIS PRESIDENT KEEPS THROWING GASOLINE ON THE FIRE EVERY PLACE HE GOES. I NOTICED , I DIDN'T WATCH MUCH OF IT BUT I WATCHED ALL THE REPORTS FROM ALL OF YOU, FROM THE PRESS, AND YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH REGARD TO A YOUNG MAN SHOT IN THE BACK SEVEN TIMES TIMES IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. AND WENT ON DOWN THE LINE. I WISH HE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AS MUCH AS HE WOULD LIKE TO BE RUNNING AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE, HE IS RUNNING AGAINST ME, JOE BIDEN AND THE FACT HE IS NOT ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE OUTLINED YOUR PLAN TO REOPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INTERIM. RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF PARENTS ARE FACING THIS VERY IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF TRYING TO WORK FULL-TIME AND HELP THEIR CHILDREN FULL-TIME TO LEARN VIRTUALLY. WHAT ARE YOUR MESSAGE TO THESE PARENTS AND WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP THEM? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I HAVE LAID OUT A PLAN FOR CHILD CARE, A PLAN FOR EARLY EDUCATION AS WELL SO THREE, FOUR, FIVE-YEAR-OLDS ARE IN SCHOOL. BUT I'M NOT PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS PROVIDING FOR MORE HELP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FACT TRYING TO JUGGLE THE CHOICE BETWEEN DO I STAY HOME WITH MY THREE, FOUR, FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND TAKE CARE OF THEM IN THIS COVID PROBLEM OR DO I GO TO WORK OR EARN A SALARY. WHAT DO I DO? I HAVE A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO DEAL WITH CHILD CARE AND ELDER CARE SO PEOPLE CAN BE PAID TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE ELDERLY, HUSBAND OR WIFE MAY BE TAKING CARE OF AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THOSE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK. AND FOCUSING ON DAY CARE CENTERS AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY NOW ARE AS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS DEALING WITH SCHOOLS. AND WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING ALL OF THE P.P.E. AND ALL OF THE SAFETY THAT IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THEM TO OPEN. HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN OPENED BECAUSE SOME STATES HAVE GONE IN AND DONE THAT. THERE SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL GUIDANCE COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND SHOULD BE BASIC STANDARDS TO HOW, IN FACT AND WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU CAN OPEN A SAFELY A DAY CARE OR CHILD CARE CENTER. THE IDEA THAT THIS HAS BROUGHT HOME A NUMBER OF DEMRARING PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN AMERICA, THIS WHOLE PANDEMIC AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF JOBS. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE SO MANY PARENTS WHO HAVE TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT CHOICE AS A SINGLE PARENT OR BOTH WORKING PARENTS TO DECIDE ONE GIVES UP THEIR SALARY AND STAY HOME WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE OR SIX AND/OR LEAVES THEM WITH SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY QUALIFIED AND GOES TO WORK SO THEY CAN EARN A LIVING IS A CHOICE WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING. WE ARE THE MOST STRILIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A MAJOR OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PROGRAM. IN THE MEANTIME, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE DONE IS HAVE C.D.C. ISSUE STRAIGHTFORWARD GUIDELINES UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN UP YOUR DAY CARE CENTER OR CHILD CARE CENTER NOW. AND THERE SHOULD BE CLEAR STANDARDS AND STATES SHOULD HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO GO OUT AND INSPECT THOSE FACILITIES NOW. BUT ONE THING I HAVEN'T MENTIONED AND WARRANTS MENTIONING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID, REMEMBER WHEN WE INHERITED THE GREAT RECESSION AND WE WERE GOING INTO THE TANK HEADING OFF THE CLIFF HEADING INTO A DEPRESSION, I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THREE REPUBLICANS' VOTE AND ENDED UP WITH THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH SPENT $800 BILLION. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MAKING SURE THAT STATES WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. EVERYONE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEIR SCHOOL TEACHERS, THEIR DOCTORS, NURSES, PUBLIC HOSPITALS. NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING? THIS REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT SUPPORT THAT AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WILL NOT SUPPORT IT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? WE DON'T HAVE THAT HELP. IT'S NOT OUT HERE AND STATES ARE IN REAL TROUBLE AND TO QUOTE MITCH MCCONNELL, HE SAID LET THE STATES GO BANKRUPT. STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS UNDER THE LAW. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO RUN A DEFICIT, TO COMPENSATE IN TIMES OF REAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING? NOTHING. NOTHING. AND GUESS WHAT? WE CAME OUT OF THAT RECESSION WITH THE LONGEST SPURT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ANY ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT THESE GUYS , I COULD GO ON. BUSINESSES, LOOK AT THE MONEY THAT WAS PASSED UNDER THE CARES ACT FOR BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. WHY? BECAUSE THE MONEY DIDN'T GET TO SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY ARE NOT OPEN. WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN BURNT OUT AND DAMAGED. WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING FEDERAL HELP FOR THOSE BUSINESSES TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO THINK IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY LIKE ANGEL DUST IS GOING TO BE SPREAD AROUND. I JUST DON'T GET IT. THEY HAVE TO KNOW BETTER. THEY HAVE TO KNOW BETTER. AND WE HAD AN EXAMPLE IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION HOW MUCH GOOD YOU CAN DO AND HOW MUCH GROWTH CAN YOU GENERAL RATE. I DON'T GET THESE GUYS. NOT A JOKE. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME BUT NEVER SEEN A PRESIDENT LACK IN LEADERSHIP AND UNWILLING TO MAKE A DEAL AND I'M TOLD THE REASON THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE IN THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS 20 MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYING UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THEY RAISE THE DEFICIT AT ALL. THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND WE ARE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES, DOING ONE HELL OF A LOT BETTER AND UP TO 186,000 PEOPLE DEAD, 6 MILLION 300,000 THAT HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. IT'S JUST IRRESPONSIBLE. TALK ABOUT A NO-NOTHING CONGRESS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. NO-NOTHING PRESIDENT. I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T GET IT. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE COME JANUARY, GOD WILLING. I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN BECAUSE SOME TEACHERS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE IF THEY WERE TO CONTRACT COVID-19 THAT THEY WOULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. IT IS UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY ARE DOING IT. BUT THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PROTECTIVE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US IS MADE AVAILABLE AND THEN MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LET THE DISTRICTS MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY OPEN FULLY AND ROTATE AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO TEACH FROM HOME AND REMOTE LEARNING. BUT IT'S REALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS COVID CRISIS SO FAR. 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED WHO ARE ABOVE THE AGE OF 65. 100 AND SOME OUT OF THE 180,000. THE ESTIMATES RANGE UP TO SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSITIES, ONE IS GOING TO BE AS MANY AS 239 AND OTHER ONE SAID 312. I DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT IT'S GOING TO GO HIGHER. SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S A POLITICAL PROBLEM. WHAT IS THE POLITICS ABOUT NOT BEING WILLING TO GO IN AND HELP PROVIDE THE PROTECTIVE CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND GO TO SCHOOL. I CAN'T FATHOM IT. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. YOU TALKED TODAY ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID LAST WEEK, THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY AGAIN. YOU WERE ASKED IF YOU WERE GOING TO SHUT IT DOWN IF YOUR HEALTH EXPERTS PROPOSED AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT AT A FEDERAL LEVEL AND HOW YOU WOULD BALANCE THAT CALL TO SHUTDOWN IF YOUR ECONOMIC ADVISERS SAYING, IF YOU DO IT AGAIN, YOU COULD PLUNGE THE COUNTRY INTO A DEEPER ECONOMIC CRISIS. WELL, LOOK, I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE LAST JANUARY. THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GET THE ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK WITHOUT GETTING COVID UNDER CONTROL IS COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE, IT'S NOT THERE AND CAN'T HAVE IT. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE DISEASE AND DRASTICALLY ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE TO EITHER GO TO WORK OR WALK INTO A BUSINESS OR DO BUSINESS, THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER A LOT. THERE IS GOING TO BE NO NEED IN MY VIEW TO SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE ECONOMY. IF I WAS ASKED TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN, I TOOK THAT AS A GENERIC QUESTION IF I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. I AM GOING TO INSIST AND INSIST NOW WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY THAT EVERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE OUT IN PUBLIC OR NOT THE COHORT THEY HAVE LIVED WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SPREADING TO THEIR WIFE OR HUSBAND, THAT THEY WEAR A MASK AND WEAR A MASK. YOU CAN TAKE THE MASK OFF WHEN YOU ARE 12, 15 FEET AWAY. I WOULD FOLLOW, I WOULD REALLY MAKE THE CASE , AND BY THE WAY, WHEN I FIND THESE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT MY FREEDOM, I TALK ABOUT PATRIOTISM. WHY DO YOU WEAR A MASK? TO PROTECT YOUR NEIGHBOR, TO KEEP SOMEONE ELSE FROM GETTING SICK AND MAYBE DYING. I CALL THAT PATRIOTIC. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EVERY GENERATION HAS MADE SACRIFICES TO HELP OTHERS IN MOMENTS OF CRIES SEES. YOU SUGGEST THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF FEDERAL MANDATE ABOUT MASKS? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: NO. NO. WHAT I SUGGESTED WAS, I WOULD ASK EVERY PERSON IN AUTHORITY, THERE'S A QUESTION WHETHER THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION COULD MANDATE THAT EVERYONE COULD WEAR A MASK. DURING THE PRIMARY PEOPLE WERE TELLING ME , I'M A CONSTITUTIONALIST. YOU CAN'T DO THINGS THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO. I WILL PUT PRESSURE ON EVERY GOVERNOR, EVERY MAYOR, COUNTY EXECUTIVE AND LOCAL OFFICIAL AND EVERYONE IN BUSINESS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO SAY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS IRRESPONSIBLE. MAKE SURE YOU WEAR A MASK AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT. YOU RAISED A MONTHLY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND IT? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: YOU WANT TO GO TO DINNER? [LAUGHTER] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: WHAT I'M HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF IT ON IS COUNTER THE LIES THAT ARE BEING TOLD BY MY TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND A NEW P.A.C. BUT I'M TRYING TO SPEND MOST OF THAT , I THINK THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION WAS LIKE 40 BUCKS. WE HAVE OVER 1 MILLION 600,000 PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTED, BETWEEN 5, 10, $15 DOLLARS. THERE IS ENTHUSIASM ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO WHAT I WILL SPEND MOST OF IT DOING IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW I WANT TO UNITE THE COUNTY AND WHAT I WANT TO DO TO MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER AND WHY I'M SO CONFIDENT WE CAN DO IT AND BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND BE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN BEFORE THIS CRISIS OCCURRED, BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MANY FISSURES EXPOSED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED, AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF HELP. SO WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. AND ONCE AGAIN, LEAD THE WORLD. YOU HEARD ME SAY IT 100 TIMES NOT JUST BY EXAMPLE OF POWER BUT POWER OF EXAMPLE. THANK YOU. [INDISCERNIBLE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: MARVELOUS JOB, DOING A GREAT JOB. WHEN IT GOT UP TO MARCH, I KEPT SAYING, LOOK , YOU REMEMBER I WAS THE FIRST, PERSON CALLING ABOUT THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT. WE DON'T HAVE , IT'S AMAZING, WE USE A PHRASE LIKE P.P.E., BUT PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND GEAR AND VENTILATORS. USE THAT AUTHORITY NOW AND DON'T WAIT AND DON'T WAIT TO TALK ABOUT US THE NEED TO HAVE MASKS. THAT'S WHAT I TALKED ABOUT AND I BEGUN TO LAY UP , WE ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION. MAYBE IT WAS MARCH, APRIL, IN THAT RANGE AND HE SAID BIDEN WANTS TO HELP. SO I TALKED TO HIM AND LAID OUT WHAT I THOUGHT SHOULD BE DONE TO REOPEN SAFELY AND HE WAS VERY POLITE AND LISTENED AND SAID HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT. SO WHAT I WOULD BEGIN TO BECOME REALLY CLEAR IS THAT AS THE SCIENCE BEGAN TO SHOW THAT THIS WAS ABLE TO SPREAD MUCH MORE EASILY THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. WAS THE PANDEMIC COMING AND WHAT'S THE MOST WAY THAT DID THE MOST DAMAGE. AS THAT BECAME CLEARER AND CLEARER. WE CONCLUDED WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE LARGE RALLIES. HERE WE ARE, REST OF THE WORLD PLACES HAVE GONE EXTREMELY WELL IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THIS COVID CRISIS AROUND THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE A POPULATION LARGER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YET, IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST, LOSING 1,000 LIVES A DAY AND LOSING 57 A DAY, ALL OF THEM, COMBINED. COMBINED. AS WE LEARN MORE AND DID LEARN MORE AND WHY BY MARCH AND APRIL, WE KNEW A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT MORE, WHY WEREN'T WE DOING WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE? WHY ARE WE BEING TOLD WE HAVE PLENTY OF PROTECTIVE GEAR. AND ONE BIG THING THAT I DID PUSH A LOT ON WAS ON THE NEED FOR TESTING AND TRACING AND MOVING RAPIDLY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD THE CAPACITY TO TEST AND TRACE BEFORE IT GOT SO OUT OF CONTROL. WE NEED TO DO THAT NOW. BUT HERE'S THE THING AND I END WITH THIS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR KEEPING YOU , [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THE THING THAT I JUST DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IS WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE RELATING TO THIS CRISIS. AND WHEN ENORMOUS PRESSURE IS PUT ON PROFESSIONALS IN THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE C.D.C. TO N.I.H. ACROSS THE BOARD, WHY DO WE THINK GOD WILLING WHEN WE GET A VACCINE THAT IS GOOD, WORKS, WHY DO WE THINK THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO LINE UP TO BE ABLE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THE INJECTION? HE HAS LOST SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN WHAT'S SAID BECAUSE THEY ARE FINDING OUT AGAIN TODAY, PLASMA, WELL, IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. HELL OF A LOT OF PRESSURE PUT ON THAT PERSON WHO SOLD IT. THIS PRESIDENT HAS SOLD SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE UNTRUE, THAT ARE JUST WRONG. IN ORDER TO DO ANYTHING, HE LOOKS AT IT IN ONE WAY, IF THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGH AND IT'S MOVING AND WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REAL TROUBLE ECONOMICALLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY, THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE. THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE SO WE CAN BEGIN TO GET BACK TO NORMAL AND REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY AND BRINGING BACK ECONOMIC GROWTH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

CSPANJB39202085	Joe Biden	2020-09-03	Joe Biden Delivers Remarks in Kenosha, Wisconsin	"IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE RISK OF SERIOUS ILLNESS AND DEATH FROM COVID-19 VARIES CONSIDERABLY BASED ON YOUR AGE. YOUNGER PEOPLE IN GENERAL HAVE A VERY, VERY LOW RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS FROM COVID-19. SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN, 1-15 IN AGE, ONLY ABOUT 40 HAVE DIED IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. 57 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT AGE BRACKET, AND ONLY 36-40 HAVE DIED, THAT IS ABOUT ONE IN A MILLION. SO THAT IS A PRETTY LOW RATIO. WHEN YOU THING ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT KIDS DIE FROM, DROWNING, CAR ACCIDENTS, THEY HAPPEN AT A HIGHER FREQUENCY THAN ABOUT 39 OR 40. WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: HI. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I TO WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THIS EVENT HAS BEEN SET UP TO ADHERE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES.

AND, WE KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT UNITY, NOT DIVISION. IT'S ABOUT HEALING. SO, WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT IN KENOSHA AND IN OUR COUNTRY. WE ALSO KNOW , LET'S BE CLEAR, BLACK AMERICANS FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. MUCH LIKE MANY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. FAR TOO LONG. WE KNOW, WITH YOUR VISION AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR SENSE OF URGENCY TO DISMANTLE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN HEALTH CARE, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE KNOW YOUR VISION WILL HEAL THIS COUNTRY.

IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY. IT IS A REAL PRIVILEGE TO HAVE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HERE TODAY TO LISTEN AND TO SEEK HEALING AND JUSTICE FOR US IN KENOSHA. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE RISE AS I OFFER A PRAYER. LET US PRAY. OH, HEALING GOD, WE CONTINUE TO LIFT UP JACOB BLAKE. LORD, CONTINUE TO BRING HEALING TO HIS GRIEVOUS WOUNDS. LORD MIRACULOUSLY ENABLE HIM TO WALK AGAIN. LIFT UP HIS FAMILY. BRING THEM COMFORT DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS, CHALLENGING TIME. OH, GOD OF JUSTICE, WE ASK FOR JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE. WE ASK FOR JUSTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN KENOSHA. OH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU DO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. NOT FAR FROM HERE, WE HAVE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION. WE KNOW YOUR CHURCH HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT RECOVERY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND MANY BLESSINGS. HERE WE ARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HERE TO HAVE A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. A FEW GROUND RULES.

AFTER THEY ARE FINISHED, WE WILL CALL UP FOLKS. WE ASK THAT YOU PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE MICROPHONES WILL BE HERE. TAKE YOUR TIME. WE WILL GIVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PER PERSON. I HAVE BEEN TOLD I HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT THE MASK OVER YOUR MOUTH AND SHUT IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT TAKE YOUR TIME. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS HERE TO LISTEN, LEARN AND HELP US HEAL. FAIR ENOUGH? FIRST, TIM, RESIDNENT AND FORMER MARINE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S OCCURRING IN WISCONSIN IS SOMETHING THAT IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE, AND THAT IS ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY IN AMERICA, WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE CONVERSATION OF PROGRAMS. WE NEED TO START PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE PROGRAMS AND PUTTING THINGS INTO ACTION. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BEN CARSON , SORRY, BEN GORDON WITH THE NAACP SAID, WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. WE NEED TO START PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE SOLUTIONS. WE KNOW WITH THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WIN OVER THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. BUT WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT WISCONSIN, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, 34% OF AFGHAN AMERICANS LIVE IN POVERTY. 24% OF HISPANICS. 28% OF NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS. AND 18% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ASIAN DESCENT. SO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT RACE INEQUALITY, IT ALSO MEANS ABOUT INCLUSION AND TAKING THOSE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EMPLOYMENT. WE HAVE ALL OF THESE JOBS AROUND HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MEDIUM INCOME AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHITE FAMILIES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN IS 50%. WE ARE EARNING 50% OF THE WHAT THOSE FAMILY INCOMES ARE. IF WE ARE NOT PAYING PEOPLE LIVING WAGES , THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY THAT WAS HERE, THE WHITE AMERICAN BRASS , WE'RE A COMMUNITY THAT BUILT THINGS. WE HAVE A LOT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE, A LOT OF SKILLS THAT ARE STILL HERE. IT IS JUST TAPPING INTO THOSE RESOURCES AND CREATING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN EMPLOYMENT. WHEN I WAS THE HR DIRECTOR IN A MUNICIPALITY, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS BANND THE BOX. WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK FOR NEW EMPLOYEES. WE ARE PUSHING THEM OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM EACH AND EVERY DAY. WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS COME BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES, WE NEED TO START PROVIDING SECOND CHANCES FOR THEM. WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE GAPS WITHIN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS NOT EQUITABLE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH PROGRAM AND EVERY SCHOOL IS THE SAME. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BLACK SPORTS PROGRAMS AND WHITE SPORTS PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THE SAME. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SCIENCE PROGRAMS AND ART PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THE SAME. NOT THAT THEY JUST EXIST, BUT THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME QUALITY AND THEY ARE THE SAME QUILT. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BUILD PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC ABILITY TO PUSH THOSE FORWARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE BIGGEST THING I SEE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY, WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOUSING. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON DURING THIS COVID. WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING THAT ECONOMICS, NOT BEING AT WORK AT THIS TIME. THEY ARE LOSING HOUSING. IF YOU LOOK OVER, IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, IN THE MIDDLE OF JUST HAVING A HURRICANE COME THROUGH THIS AREA, AND NOW THEY ARE BEING PLACED ON THE STREETS WITH THEIR BELONGINGS. WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT IS STILL OUT THERE IS WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS. WE NEED TO CREATE LIVING WAGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN BE APART OF THAT AMERICAN DREAM. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON HERE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WE HAVE TO REALIZE WE HAVE TO STOP PUSHING PEOPLE INTO JAIL. WE HAVE TO START GETTING SOLUTIONS SUCH AS REHABILITATION. WHEN THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HIT AMERICA, IT WAS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AMERICA SOLUTION WAS JAIL, JAIL, JAIL. NOW THAT WE HAVE OPIOIDS IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY, THE SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS WITH NARCAN, SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE REHABILITATION SERVICES. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE DON'T HAVE THE DRUG ADDICTION AND OTHER SERVICES NEEDED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING CAUGHT UP IN A CYCLE THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THAT AMERICAN DREAM AND TAKES AWAY FROM THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR EQUITY. THANK YOU. VICE PRES. BIDEN: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. THANKS FOR LISTENING. OUR MEMBERS ARE TIRED AFTER THIS PAST WEEK. SOME OF THEM ARE BEAT UP PRETTY GOOD, BUT THEIR SPIRTSITS ARE HIGH. THE REASON WHY THEIR SPIRITS ARE HIGH IS BECAUSE OF THEIR APPRECIATION AND LOVE OUR COMMUNITY HAS SHOWN US AFTER THE FIRES. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DROPPED OFF AT THE FIREHOUSES TO PEOPLE STOPPING US ON THE STREETS TELLING US THANKS. IT MAY BE THINK ABOUT APPRECIATION. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS NEED TO START SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY MATTERS. I KNOW I FEEL GOOD WHEN I FEEL APPRECIATED. I THINK IT'S A BASIC HUMAN THING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES, TOO. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SO MANY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES BEFORE THERE IS A PROGRAM, BEFORE THERE IS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, BEFORE THIS IS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN IT FOR 30 YEARS. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS GETTING BETTER EVERY DAY, BUT IT'S NOT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, IS THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE ATA A TIME WHEN IT IS , WHEN IT HAS THE CHANCE TO BE PREVENTATIVE, TO BE HEALING. SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE ARE A RESULT OF CHRONIC ABILITY NOT TO GET THAT HEALTH CARE. THOSE SMALL THINGS TURN INTO CHRONIC THINGS. THE MOST CHRONIC THINGS TURN INTO EMERGENCIES. THAT'S WHEN WE GET CALLED. AS A RESULT OF THAT, OUR SYSTEMS ARE BEING TAXED. IN MANY CASES , WE HAVE EVEN ASKED PEOPLE WHY DID YOU NOT SEEK HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR? I DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR. WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE THIS HEART MEDICATION? I CAN'T AFFORD IT. NOW, WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE YOU ARE TAKING A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AT TIMES, WE ARE THE ONLY HEALTH CARE THAT SOME FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO. WE NEVER FAILED TO SHOW UP. WE SHOW UP DAMN FAST. AND SOMETIMES EVEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO, THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS THAT WE SEE WITH REGARD TO A PROBLEM IN THE COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS ATTENTION. IF THERE WERE CLINICS OR THERE WERE AVAILABILITY FOR LOW-LEVEL HEALTH CARE ACCESS, WE WOULDN'T SEE QUITE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH FROM AN EMERGENT STANDPOINT. AGAIN, PRIDE, DEDICATION AND COURAGE , THAT'S WHAT WE ALL SIGNED UP FOR. OUR THUMBS ARE UP AND WE'RE FORGING FORWARD AND WE WOULD LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THE SAME APPRECIATION WE DO. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. APPRECIATE IT. CAN I TOUCH THIS? THANK YOU, JOE, FOR BEING HERE. IT IS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO BE INVITED HERE. MY NAME IS BARB. MY SISTER AND I HAVE A FRAMING AND ART GALLERY TWO BLOCKS DOWN THE ROAD. OUR GREAT GRANDFATHER STARTED OUR BUSINESS AND OUR BUSINESS HAS SUCCEEDED THROUGH RECHERCHE RECESSIONS, DEPRESSIONS AND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT HAPPEN, BUT WE HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING AS DEVASTATING AS WHAT HAS GONE ON IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T START OUR BUILDING ON FIRE, LIKE SO MANY OF THEM IN THE UPTOWN AREA HAVE BEEN BURNT TO THE GROUND. THEY DID BREAK OUR WINDOWS, GET INTO OUR STORE. THEY LOOTED AND THEY TRIED TO START A FIRE, BUT A GOOD SAMARITAN CAME BY AND TOOK THIS RACK OF OUR BEAUTIFUL SCARVES OUT INTO THE SIDEWALK AND PUT IT OUT. OTHERWISE, OUR STORE WOULD HAVE BEEN UP IN FLAMES. I LOOK AT THE BUILDINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE GONE AND I JUST , I DON'T THINK I'VE REALLY GRIEVED AS MUCH AS I FEEL I SHOULD BECAUSE, BEING A BUSINESS OWNER, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING. I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING. THE DAY AFTER THIS HAPPENED AT OUR STORE , SUNDAY, THEY WENT DOWNTOWN AND DID THEIR DEVASTATION. THEN ON MONDAY NIGHT, THEY CAME IN OUR AREA. TUESDAY MORNING, WE HAD A GROUP OF FELLAS COME UP AND BOARD UP OUR BUILDING AND WE WERE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. WE'VE BEEN CONTINUING TO BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS EVEN THOUGH IT IS BOARDED UP. THE LOVE AND COMPASSION IN THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING NOT ONLY TO US, BUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER AND SHOWING RESPECT AND LOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER. IT MAKES ME SO VERY PROUD TO BE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE DIFFICULTY. WE SUPPORT AND HELP AND LOVE. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME HERE AND GIVE YOU A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LUCKY WE ARE STILL STANDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, BARBARA. YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY LOVES YOUR STORY VERY MUCH. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP REBUILD YOU, WE WILL. SIR, YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM ONE OF THE SHARPEST, YOUNGEST LEGAL LINES IN KENOSHA, ANGELA CUNNINGHAM. PLEASE COME UP. VICE PRES. BIDEN: YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW THE REASON KENOSHA IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT RIGHT OUT IS BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING OF JACOB BLAKE. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I WAS WATCHING A LIVE VIDEO OF SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THE SCENE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS READING THE COMMENTS AND I SAW PEOPLE COMMENTING ABOUT THE FACT JACOB BLAKE HAD BEEN SHOT BY OFFICERS. THEN, I SAW THE VIDEO OF THE ACTUAL INCIDENT. I DON'T EVEN THINK I HAVE THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW I FELT WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO. I DO REMEMBER TEXTING MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND SAYING THIS IS REALLY BAD. THIS IS REALLY BAD. THERE'S GOING TO BE PROTESTS, THERE'S GOING TO BE WRITING. I KNEW THAT RIGHT AWAY AFTER WATCHING THAT VIDEO. MY MOM CALLED ME. I HAVE A 20-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN FOR A SON. MY MOM CALLED ME SHORTLY AFTER THE NEWS GOT OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WE LIVE IN KENOSHA AND HER FIRST THOUGHT WAS IS SEAN OK? IS HE ALL RIGHT? I KNEW HE WAS OK BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS AT WORK. MR. VICE PRESIDENT , I'M SPEAKING INTO THE MR. PRESIDENT PART , MR. VICE PRESIDENT, AS AN ATTORNEY I KNOW LEGALLY WHY A LOT OF OFFICERS WHO KILL BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE, CRIMINALLY LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, BECAUSE THE LAW PROTECTS THEM. I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. I DON'T AGREE WITH IT BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. I HOPE THAT IF AND WHEN YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT THAT IS SOMETHING YOUR ADMINISTRATION CHOOSES TO TRY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE LAW PROTECTS A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS. I KNOW A LOT OF THOSE LAWS ARE AT THE STATE LEVEL, BUT IF AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO INCENTIVIZE STATES TO NOT GIVE SO MUCH LEGAL PROTECTION TO POLICE OFFICERS WHO KILL BLACK MEN AND WOMEN. I ALSO WANT TO TALK , AS AN ATTORNEY, I HAVE MY OWN LAW FIRM. PART OF MY PRACTICE IS DOING CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK. I'M ALSO A FORMER PROSECUTOR OUT OF MILWAUKEE. I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS IS UN FAIFAIR TREATMENT BETWEEN WHITE DEFENDANTS VERSUS BLACK AND BROWN DEFENDANTS. THERE'S OVER POLICING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU HAVE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO ARE PICKED UP FOR A LOT OF TIMES WHAT COULD BE MINOR THINGS. THEN, THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. THEN, THAT CRIMINAL RECORD MEANS THEY HAVE A STAMP ON THEIR BACK THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET JOBS AND, MORE LIKELY, TO STAY INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THEN YOU GET A RESUME THAT GETS BUILT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE LEGISLATION PUT IN PLACE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OVER POLICING IN COMMUNITIES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE SOME TRANSPARENCY IN POLICING AND PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING. BECAUSE I SIT IN COURTS, WELL, I USED TO BEFORE COVID, BUT SIT COURTS ALL DAY AND LISTEN TO CASES AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, I'M ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN CHARGING AND OFFERS THAT ARE GIVEN BY THE PROSECUTION AND IN SENTENCING THAT IS GIVEN BY JUDGES. ANYBODY WHO'S NOT IN COURT EVERY DAY WON'T SEE THAT. AND, THAT DATA IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A NATIONWIDE EFFORT PUT IN PLACE THAT REQUIRES POLICE DEPARTMENTS, DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES, AND ALSO COURTS TO COLLECT THE DATA ABOUT ARRESTS, ABOUT CHARGES, ABOUT SENTENCING, ABOUT OFFERS THAT ARE GIVEN SO THAT THE LIGHT CAN BE SHOWN FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T SIT IN COURT ALL DAY TO SEE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING, THERE REALLY IS A DISCREPANCY. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THEN, ONCE WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE, START PUTTING SOME LEGISLATION IN PLACE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE DISCREPANCIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LISTENING TODAY. THANK YOU TO OUR FOUR SPEAKERS. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO RESPOND AND CHAT WITH THE COMMUNITY? VICE PRES. BIDEN: FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. I HOPE , I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE AFTER I SAY A FEW WORDS, WE WILL HEAR FROM MORE OF YOU AS WELL. LET ME RESPOND TO THE LITTLE BIT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR. FIRST OF ALL, I CAN MAKE A GENERIC POINT. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. NO MATTER GOOD, BAD OR INDIFFERENT, THEY MATTER. NO MATTER HOW COMPETENT OR INCOMPETENT A PRESIDENT IS, THEY CAN SEND A NATION TO WAR, THEY CAN MAKE PEACE, THEY CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE AND FALL. THEY CAN DO THINGS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE JUST BY WHAT THEY SAY. YOU KNOW, I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AND I MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE. I HAD A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LAW SCHOOL IN DELAWARE. I WENT TO SYRACUSE LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS MY LAST SEMESTER , THE ONLY TWO POLITICAL HEROES I HAD BOTH WERE ASSASSINATED. DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY. KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED THE DAY I GRADUATED. I CAME HOME AND MY CITY WAS THE ONLY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY SINCE RECONSTRUCTION FOR 10 MONTHS. EVERY SINGLE CORNER, AND MILITARY PERSON WAS STANDING FOR 10 MONTHS. I HAD A JOB WITH A GOOD LAW FIRM. ONE OF THE OLDEST LAW FIRMS IN THE STATE. AFTER A WHILE, I CONCLUDED THAT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE. THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT I QUICKLY BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER. I USE TOD TO HAVE INTERVIEW MY CLIENTS AND WHAT THEY CALL THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR, WHERE AMTRAK RUNS FROM WASHINGTON NEW YORK. THAT AREA GOES THROUGH MY CITY. AND, I USED TO INTERVIEW CLIENTS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT OF THAT TRAIN STATION BEFORE THEY WERE ARRAIGNED. AND HER I WARE I WAS , WE HAD THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN THE NATION. WE WORK TO OUR GREAT SHAME A SLAVE STATE, ALTHOUGH WE WERE ONE OF THOSE BORDER STATES THAT FOUGHT ON THE STATE SIDE OF THE NORTH, THANK GOD. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WHAT HAPPENED WAS I THOUGHT BLACKS AND WHITES WOULD BE, IN MY CITY, WITH EACH OTHER AGAIN. HERE I AM 40 YEARS LATER ON JANUARY 17 STANDING ON A PLATFORM AND THAT VERY SAME TRAIN STATION AND LOOKING OUT OVER THE EAST SIDE WHICH HAD BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND LITERALLY. IT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. ACROSS THE RIVER, THE THIRD STREET BRIDGE, 100% AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I WAS STANDING ON THE PLATFORM ON JANUARY 17 WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 26 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME ON A TRAIN RIDE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. 10,000 PEOPLE STANDING DOWN BELOW CHEERING. AND MY SON, BEAU, WAS ALIVE THEN. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AT THE TIME. MY DAUGHTER, WHO'S A SOCIAL WORKER. AND MY MIDDLE SON, WHO WAS RUNNING THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, THE LARGEST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD. I CALLED THEM UP. IT ALL OF A SUDDEN HIT ME. HERE I WAS IN THAT WHOLE AREA HAD BEEN REBUILT. AND THE THIRD STREET BRIDGE IS STILL IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE BUT THINGS HAVE MOVED. I SAID, DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN CHANGE. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STORY. I GUESS I'M VIOLATING SOCIAL DISTANCING HERE. SOSRRY. AND I SAID DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN CHANGE. I TOLD A STORY AND REMINDED THEM WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ATTORNEY. I MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT SOMETHING. I THOUGHT YOU COULD DEFEAT HATE. HATE ONLY HIDES. IT ONLY HIDES. AND, WHEN SOMEONE OF AUTHORITY BREATHES OXYGEN UNDER THAT ROCK, IT LEGITIMIZES THOSE FOLKS TO COME OUT. COME OUTSIDE OF THE ROCK. I HAD NOT PLANNED ON RUNNING FOR ANYTHING AGAIN AFTER MY SON HAD DIED. AND, I WAS A PROFESSOR IN COLLEGE AND RUNNING ANOTHER PROGRAM AT ANOTHER COLLEGE. UNTIL I SAW THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING TORCHES, LITERALLY TORCHES. I SAW THEM ON TELEVISION. THEIR VEINS BULGING. THEIR HATE FILLED SPEECH. TENTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED ON THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. ON TOP OF THAT, ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS, KU KLUX KLAN. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED PROTESTING THOSE FOLKS. THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WAS ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE SAID, SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID , ""THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES."" NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THE POINT I AM MAKING IS IT'S NOT ALL HIS FAULT, BUT IT LEGITIMIZES THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE. WHAT IT DID THOUGH, IT ALSO EXPOSED WHAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID ENOUGH ATTENTION TO. THE UNDERLYING RACISM THAT HAS INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES, IT STILL EXISTS. IT HAS EXISTED FOR 400 YEARS. SO, WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE END UP IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE YOU HAD HERE IN KENOSHA AND HAVE HERE IN KENOSHA. BUT, I AM , I HAD A SERIOUS OPERATION YEARS AGO. A NEUROSURGEON GAVE ME A VERY SMALL CHANCE. I SAID I WILL BE FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, SENATOR? YOU ARE A CONGENITAL OPTIMIST. I THINK WE HAVE REACHED AN INFLECTION POINT IN OUR HISTORY. I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. NOW THAT THE CURTAIN HAS BEEN PULLED BACK. TO DO A LOT OF REALLY AMAZING THINGS. PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE BECAUSE OF COVID WHO THE PEOPLE ARE BREAKING THEIR NEXT AND CKS AND RISKING THEIR LIVES. THE DEFINITION OF A FIREFIGHTER , GOD MADE MAN AND THEN MADE A COUPLE OF FIREFIGHTERS. I GREW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU EITHER BECAME A FIREFIGHTER OR A PRIEST. I WAS NOT QUALIFIED FOR EITHER. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK OF WHAT HAPPENED. WHO ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE? YOU HAVE OVER 6000 YOUNG ""DREAMERS,"" THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES DEALING WITH COVID. YOU HAVE ALL THOSE FOLKS WORKING IN A SUPERMARKET STOCKING THE SHELVES, MAKING FIVE DOLLARS, SIX DOLLARS, SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THEY ARE MOSTLY MINORITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS. PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE FIRST POINT I WANT TO MAKE YOU IS I AM NOT PESSIMISTIC. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY IF WE SEIZE IT. I WILL RESPOND TO WHAT EACH OF YOU HAD TO SAY. TIM, YOU TALKED ABOUT A LOT MORE ABOUT PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE SOLUTIONS. THE COUNTRY IS READY TO PUT THE MONEY WE HAD SOLUTIONS NOW. HERE'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING. 30% POVERTY RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU HAVE LIVING WAGES THAT DON'T EXIST. WE ARE GOING TO NATIONALIZED $15 AN HOUR. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS JUST TO MAKE IT. THAT IS NOT RIGHT IN AMERICA. TWO JOBS JUST TO BE ABOVE THE POVERTY RATE, ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL? PRISON REFORM, A LOT OF REFORMS IT TAKES, BUT MY VIEW IS WE SHOULD TAKE PRISON REFORM , I HAVE BEEN PREACHING THIS , FROM PRISON PUNISHMENT TO REFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, ANYONE WHO SERVES TIME IN PRISON AND THEY GET OUT, THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM THAT EXIST. WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM GETTING THE PELL GRANT AND GOING TO SCHOOL? WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM GOING TO SCHOOL AND GETTING PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIES? WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM QUALIFYING FOR WHAT USED TO BE CALLED FOOD STAMPS? RIGHT NOW, YEARS AGO, A SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA, WE WROTE THE SECOND CHANCE ACT. NOW WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU GET OUT OF PRISON , YOU GET A BUS TICKET AND $25. BY THE WAY, 93% OF EVERYBODY , 93 OUT OF 100 PRISONERS IN PRISON ARE BEHIND A CITY JAIL, A COUNTY JAIL, A STATE JAIL, NOT A FEDERAL PRISON. BARACK AND I WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BY 38,000 FOLKS. ANYONE WHO GETS CONVICTED OF A DRUG CRIME, NOT ONE THAT IS MASSIVE SELLING, BUT CONSUMPTION, THEY SHOULDN'T GO TO PRISON. THEY SHOULD GO TO MANDATORY REHABILITATION. INSTEAD OF BUILDING MORE PRISONS, I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING FOR SOME TIME WE BUILD REHABILITATION CENTERS. MANDATORY. THEY'VE GOT TO GO TO MANDATORY REHAB. BUT, IS NOT PART OF THE RECORD WHEN THEY GET OUT IF THEY FINISH IT. THE POINT YOU MADE, YOU GET A RECORD AND IT STAYS WITH YOU. SORRY, YOU CAN'T GET THE JOB BECAUSE YOU HAD BEEN THE FOLLOWING. EVEN IF IT IS A MISDEMEANOR. WE SHOULD NOT BE PUTTING ANYBODY IN JAIL FOR THAT. WE SHOULD FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE HOUSING RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF HOUSING FUNDING WE HAD BACK IN OUR ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THAT, EVEN THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HOUSING, INCLUDING PEOPLE ON THE STREET. THAT'S WHY I PROPOSE A $400 BILLION TO MATCH THE INCREASE OF AVAILABLE HOUSING IN AMERICA. BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY. EVEN THE FOLKS ON WALL STREET POINT OUT THAT WILL INCREASE THE GDP. MAKE IT GROW. PEOPLE WILL DO BETTER, PEOPLE WILL DO BETTER. HEART AS THE DEVIL FOR AN EVER YOUR CLIENTS WHO ARE BLACK TO GET AN ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS LOAN. ALL THE STUDIES SHOW THEY ARE JUST AS QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AS ANYBODY ELSE. BARACK AND I PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM, $1.5 BILLION THAT BROUGHT $30 BILLION OFF THE SIDELINES. WE PROVIDE THAT PROGRAM FOR THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION SO YOU CAN GO APPLY. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU GET A LOAN AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR SAYS, HEY, HE'S GOT THE GOVERNMENT BACKING HIM, WE WILL JOIN HIM OR HER. WE WILL MOVE THAT TO $150 BILLION TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHERE WE GOT. I'M GIVING YOU TOO MUCH. I CAN SEE YOU ARE ABOUT TO STAND UP. [LAUGHTER] MENTAL HEALTH IS A BADLY WE INSISTED IT BE TREATED EQUALLY. NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM AND A PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEM. THEY ARE BOTH RELATED TO YOUR HEALTH. THEY SHOULD BE BOTH COVERED. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF FEDERAL SUPPORT. WE NEED COMMUNITY CLINICS. YOU GUYS ARE EXPECTED TO DO EVERYTHING. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT , PROTESTING IS PROTESTING. AS MY BUDDY JOHN LEWIS USED TO SAY. NONE OF IT JUSTIFIES LOOTING OR BURNING OR ANYTHING ELSE. THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF , ONE OF THE THINGS I PROPOSED, TO MAKE SURE PROSECUTORS ARE ABLE TO , IF YOU ARE A WHITE GUY WHO CAN AFFORD A LAWYER AND YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME, YOU ARE NOT CHARGED WITH NINE CRIMES AND GIVEN NINE ALTERNATIVES. WE WILL PUT YOU ON PROBATION. AND YOU HAVE NO LAWYER. OR YOU HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER GETTING PAID HALF. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO GET PAID THE SAME AMOUNT AS PROSECUTORS ARE GOING TO GET PAID. ONCE YOU GET THAT ON YOUR RECORD, YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. TWO PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR A JOB AND YOU HAVE THAT THING YOU PLED TO, RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF GOING TO JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PLED. THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS NOT MUCH OF A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RIGHT NOW, GO IN AND LOOK AT THE METHODS USED BY PROSECUTORS, HOW THEY DEAL WITH SENTENCING. THERE IS A LOT MORE TO SAY. I HAVE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH. THERE IS A LOT WE ARE ABLE TO DO . THE PUBLIC IS READY TO DO THESE THINGS, I PROMISE YOU. I PROMISE YOU. LAST PIECE, EDUCATION. THE IDEA IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOUR EDUCATION IS DETERMINED BY YOUR ZIP CODE. TITLE I SCHOOLS , THE GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THEM AND OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE MOVE THAT TO $45 BILLION A YEAR. I CAN PUT EVERY THREE-YEAR-OLDS, FOUR-YEAR-OLDS AND FIVE-YEAR-OLD IN SCHOOL. EVERY MAJOR UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY HAS POINTED OUT THAT INCREASES BY 58%, THE CHANCES OF THAT CHILD WILL GET THROUGH ALL 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL. WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS IN AMERICA. WE KNOW NOW THAT ABOUT 60% OF THE CHILD'S BRAID IS DEVELOPED BY THE TIME , BRAIN IS DEVELOPED BY THE TIME THEY REACH THAT AGE. THINGS THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED EARLY CAN BE DEALT WITH. ANXIETY. THEY DO NOT DO IT NOW BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PICK IT UP. WHEN YOU DO THAT, WE KNOW THE MOST AT RISK GENERATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS THE Z-GENERATION. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED, AND I WILL END WITH THIS , YOU ARE GETTING ANTSY. IT IS IMPORTANT. HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT DRUG ABUSE DOES NOT CAUSE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE DRUG ABUSE. IF YOU DO NOT DETECT IT EARLY AND TREATED, YOU INCREASE THE PROSPECT THEY ARE GOING TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE IS SO MUCH WE CAN DO. SO MUCH WE CAN DO. AND WE CAN DO IT JUST BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. IT HAS DONE NOTHING TO HELP ANYBODY. 19 CORPORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS APIECE DO NOT PLAY , DO NOT PAY A SINGLE PENNY IN TAXES. HERE'S THE DEAL. I CAN PAY FOR EVERY SINGLE THING I AM PROPOSING WITHOUT RAISING YOUR TAXES. IT IS NOT THAT WE CANNOT DO IT. WE HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO THIS I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME, BOSS. WHAT YOU HEARD HERE WAS STRENGTH, EXPERIENCE, AND EMPATHY. WHAT WE DO KNOW, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE THE LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTH TO RESTORE FAITH AND HEALING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL CONTINUE THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS. I AM SURE YOU HAVE MORE TO FEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND LEAD US IN THE NEXT ROUND OF CONVERSATIONS? THANK YOU. MY NAME IS PORTIA BENNETT. I WAS TOLD TO GO OFF THIS PAPER, BUT I CANNOT. WE NEED THE TRUTH. PART OF THE TRUTH, I WAS BORN HERE, RAISED HERE. I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE TRUTH OF THE PEOPLE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE HEAVILY ANGRY. NOT ANGRY AS TO WHERE PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE PROTESTING. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROTESTER AND A RIDER , RIOT ER. PROTESTERS SHOW NOT JUST LACKS , BLACKS ARE TIRED OF WHAT IS GOING ON. WE CAME TOGETHER TO HELP GET THIS COMMUNITY TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE AND WE WANT IT TO STAY THE WAY WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD IT. THE CHANGES WE WANT HAVE TO BE MORE IN EFFECT. WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, WE WILL GIVE YOU THIS AND WE WILL GIVE YOU THAT. WE HAVE YET TO SEE ACTION. YOU WILL BE LET DOWN EVERY SINGLE TIME. IF I WERE THAT OFFICER, I WOULD BE IN THE KENOSHA COUNTY JAIL RIGHT NOW. ALL OF THESE OFFICERS WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES, IF A MEDICAL EXAMINER DOES THEIR JOB AND SAYS , RULES IT'S A HOMICIDE, THAT IS MURDER. , RULES IT A HOMICIDE, THAT IS MURDER. WHY ARE THERE MORE POLICE OFFICERS IN THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS? WHY ARE WE MORE TARGETED THAN ANYBODY ELSE? WE WALK SOMEWHERE, AND AUTOMATICALLY, YOU FIT THE DESCRIPTION. I AM ONLY 31. I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH WITHIN THESE LAST TWO YEARS TO SAY, I'M TIRED. I AM A MOTHER. MY OLDEST IS 13 AND MY TWINS ARE NINE. I DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT THEIR FUTURE TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW. MY PRESENT IS NOT GOOD. I WANT THE TRUTH HEARD AND I SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE HERE WITH THESE PEOPLE. I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. IT IS NOT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS FOR US. WE WANT THE SAME EXACT RIGHTS AS OTHERS. WE WANT TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. A LOT OF US GET DENIED JOBS BECAUSE WE MARK THAT BOX AS BLACK OR AFRICAN-AMERICAN. PEOPLE TEAR DOWN OUR HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS INSTEAD OF FIXING THEM UP AND MAKING A BETTER. WE ARE PUSHED TO ONE SIDE OF TOWN. GENTRIFICATION HAS TO STOP AS WELL. WE CANNOT GET THERE IF SOMEBODY WITH A VOICE CANNOT PUT THAT INTO EFFECT. THAT IS ALL WE ARE ASKING. WE WANT THE SAME TREATMENT. WE ARE NOT ASKING, PUT US ABOVE ANYBODY. FOR SO MANY DECADES, WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN WE DON'T MATTER. WE WANT SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW AND PUT THEIR ACTION IN PAIRED THERE A LOT OF STUFF WE WANT DONE. , ACTION IN. THERE ARE A LOT OF STUFF WE WANT DONE. I SEE IT, I LIVE IT. OTHERS WHO DON'T SEE IT AND LIVE IT CANNOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH. THEY CANNOT GIVE YOU THE THINGS WE ARE GOING THROUGH AS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. SO I AM TELLING YOU. IT IS WAY MORE THAT WE WANT DONE, AND IT DID NOT JUST START WITH JACOB. WE WANT CHANGE. WE WANT CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND HEARING ME. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, FOR BEING HERE, LISTENING. THE SPOTLIGHT HAS BEEN ON OUR TOWN. WE TALKED ABOUT SUNDAY, WHAT HAPPENED SUNDAY. I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS YEARS AGO. WHEN I AM WALKING OUT THERE AND TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND I AM TALKING TO MY NEIGHBORS AND I'M TALKING TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, I HEAR THEIR PAIN. THE 10TH DISTRICT, THE CITY OF KENOSHA, DID NOT SUFFER THE SAME DESTRUCTION THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY EXPERIENCED. LIKE I SPOKE TO SENATOR BALDWIN, DOES IT HURT IN MY SECTION OF TOWN? THERE IS A PAIN IN MY SECTION OF TOWN. MR. BLAKE WAS SHOT TWO BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE. WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW WE FEEL, THE DESPAIR, THE ANGER, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE HUMANITY COMING OUT OF THESE THINGS. WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE CAME HERE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. SOMEONE CAME HERE TO SHOW DIVISION. SOMEONE CAME HERE NOT TO HELP US BUT THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE FAMILY DECIDED WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW THAT PICTURE TO THE WORLD. YOU SAW A BLOCK PARTY HAPPEN RIGHT THERE WHERE MR. BLAKE WAS SHOT. YOU SAW PEOPLE CELEBRATING LIFE. YOU SAW KIDS PLAYING IN BOUNCE HOUSES. USE ALL SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY , YOU SAW SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS WAS PUT TOGETHER IN 24-HOUR PERIOD. IT HAPPENED ORGANICALLY. THE SPIRIT, THAT IS THE SPIRIT OF KENOSHA, AND THAT IS THE THING THAT GIVES ME HOPE. WHAT GIVES ME HOPE ABOUT YOUR PRESIDENCY, WE CAN STOP TALKING CYNICISM. WHEN WE GO OUT THERE IN THAT MARKETPLACE OF VOTING, WE WILL HAVE A REAL IDEA. WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE , I DO NOT WANT TO USE THE OTHER GUYS PHRASE. WE WILL GIVE THEM HOPE. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. I AM GOING TO NEED IN MY DISTRICT, IT IS GOING TO BE MORE OF THOSE SOFT SKILLS. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THE THINGS THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SPOKE ON, THAT WILL HELP IMMENSELY. BUT TO RESTORE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM, THAT WILL BE VERY HARD, VERY DIFFICULT, TO RESTORE FAITH IN THE PROCESS, THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT. WHEN WE KNOW THE MAN AT THE TOP IS SPEAKING TRUTH, HONEST TRUTH, YOU WILL MAKE OUR WORK IN KENOSHA A LOT BETTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY. THANK YOU. I WILL JUST STAY SEATED, MAKE IT INFORMAL. PORTIA, YOU KNOW, THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT HERE THAT WE HAVE TO DO DID NOT START , GOING BACK TO ERIC GARNER, I CAN'T BREATHE. I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING THESE THINGS FOR A LONG TIME. LITERALLY FOR YEARS. THE ONE THING I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE, MY MOM USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, YOU WANT TO KNOW ME, COME WALK IN MY SHOES AND MY HOME. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT SINCE I HAVE BEEN A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WALK OUT THE DOOR OR SEND MY SON OUT THE DOOR OR DAUGHTER AND WORRY ABOUT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK, THEY MAY NOT COME BACK. I CANNOT REALLY , I CAN INTELLECTUALLY UNDERSTAND IT. BUT I CANNOT FEEL IT. I JUST SPENT AN HOUR OR MORE WITH THE FAMILY AS I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH JACOB ON THE PHONE. HE IS OUT OF ICU. WE SPOKE FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. HIS BROTHER AND TWO SISTERS, HIS DAD AND HIS MOM ON THE TELEPHONE. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW NOTHING WAS GOING TO DEFEAT HIM. HOW WHETHER HE WALKED AGAIN OR NOT, HE WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. WE TALKED ABOUT , MAY HE RAISE YOU UP ON EAGLES WINGS AND HOLD YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN. I THINK , THEY UNDERSTAND THAT FEAR DOES NOT SOLVE PROBLEMS. ONLY HOPE DOES. YOU GIVE UP HOPE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL SURRENDER. THERE IS NO REAL OPTION. AS WE TALKED, I LISTENED TO HIS MOM. SHE WAS ON THE PHONE. SHE WAS NOT WITH JACOB. SHE WAS IN THE SAME LOCATION. HIS DAD, HIS SON, HIS BROTHER, TWO SISTERS, AND A FAMILY LAWYER . WHAT I CAME AWAY WITH WAS THE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF RESILIENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT THEY HAD ABOUT THE KIND OF RESPONSE THEY ARE GETTING. HIS MOM , MY WIFE ASKED TO SAY A PRAYER AND HIS MOM SAID A PRAYER AND SHE SAID, I AM PRAYING FOR JACOB AND I'M PRAYING FOR THE PLACEMENT AS WELL , THE POLICEMAN AS WELL. I AM PRAYING THAT THINGS CHANGE. IF YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WAKE-UP CALL THAT HAS GOTTEN THE REST OF THE NATION TO REALIZE THAT IT IS A CONFLUENCE OF THREE THINGS. THE COVID CRISIS, WE DID NOT HAVE TO HAVE OVER 6 MILLION PEOPLE CONTRACT COVID. IF WE HAD JUST ACTED. IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA LAW FIRM , LAW SCHOOL, TWO WEEKS EARLIER, 51,000 PEOPLE WOULD BE ALIVE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU ARE A LEADER, PRESIDENT. INSTEAD OF SAYING I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK THE COUNTRY IS MUCH MORE PRIME TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW SEEN WHAT YOU SEE. THEY ARE NOT A BRIGHT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN WITH TWO , THREE CHILDREN THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT , LOOK, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS REALLY NOT ABOUT ME. IF WE HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE EXACT SAME THING, ONLY IT WILL IMPACT US FOR A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS. THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT NOW. I THINK THEY ARE SO READY TO DO SO MANY THINGS. IT NEVER REGISTERED WITH THEM BEFORE OR THEY JUST HAVE SEEN THINGS THEY HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE. YOU KNOW, WHEN DR. KING, WHEN HE SAID, , TOOK THOSE FIREHOUSES , FIRE HOSES AND DOGS TO BLACK WOMEN HEADING TO CHURCH. HE THOUGHT HE WAS PUTTING A STICK IN THE HEART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HEARD ABOUT THIS AND THEY TURNED ON THE TV AND THEY SAW IT. DR. KING SAID IT WAS THE SECOND EMANCIPATION. THAT YOUNG MAN STOOD THERE FOR EIGHT MINUTES AND 43 SECONDS WATCHING FLOYD DIE, HAVING HIS FACE PRESSED UP AGAINST THAT CURB, PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD SAID, OH MY GOD, IT REALLY HAPPENS. YOU HAVE A MAN OF HIS SIZE AND PHYSICALITY CALLING FOR HIS MOM, IT STRUCK A NERVE THAT HAD NOT BEEN STRUCK BEFORE. IT IS AWFUL IT HAS TO HAPPEN. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY, IF WE DON'T LET UP, IF WE DON'T LET UP. THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION ONLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY AND ABOUT LAW AND ORDER. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED FROM COVID. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALMOST A MILLION PEOPLE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND DON'T HAVE JOBS. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES CLOSING, MAYBE FOR GOOD. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR STATES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB, TEACHERS ON THE JOB, FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT IS THEIR OBLIGATION. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU THERE WILL BE A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON POLICING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE I WILL BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE, INCLUDING POLICE CHIEFS, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, NAACP, THE LATINO COMMUNITY. WE WILL SIT DOWN THERE AND WORK IT OUT. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POLICE ARE DECENT PEOPLE. BUT NO ONE, THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD FOLKS IN EVERY ORGANIZATION. THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WILLING TO SPEAK UP NO MATTER WHAT OUTFIT YOU WORK WITH. WE HAVE TO GIVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE THINGS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY REASON IN THE WORLD WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION THAT EVERYBODY , I ASKED MY WIFE JILL , WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE WE CANNOT LET UP. WE CANNOT LET UP. VIOLENCE OF ANY FORM IS WRONG. THE IDEA THAT THIS PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO TRY TO DIVIDE US, TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE IS REALLY GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, TALKS IN WAYS THAT ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY , NOT ONLY INCORRECT BUT IMMORAL. SIMPLY WRONG. SIMPLY WRONG. THE ONE CONCERN, AND I UNDERSTAND IT, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SO FRUSTRATED AND SAY IT IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL, I AM NOT GOING TO VOTE. A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, I TALKED TO HIM BEFORE HE DIED, JOHN LEWIS. AS JOHN SAID, THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO VOTE. IT IS THE ONLY ANSWER. OTHERWISE, NOTHING ELSE WORKS IN DEMOCRACY. THE NOT SO GOOD GUYS WIN. I UNDERSTAND, I REALLY DO HAVE A SENSE OF THE FRUSTRATION. WHERE I AM, I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE , WHEN THE UNITED STATES, WHEN AMERICA SETS ITS MIND TO SOMETHING, IT HAS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER FAILED. AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. NEVER. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH WARS AND PESTILENCE, PLAGUE, WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT. WE ARE FINALLY NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE WILL BE ADDRESSING ORIGINAL SIN IN THIS COUNTRY. 400 YEARS OLD, IT IS THE ORIGINAL SENT, SLAVERY. , ORIGINAL SIN, SLAVERY, AND ALL OF THE VESTIGES OF IT. I AM NOT SAYING IN FOUR YEARS , I CANNOT GUARANTEE EVERYTHING GET SOLVED IN FOUR YEARS AND I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING, IT WILL BE A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT BETTER. WE WILL MOVE A LOT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. PEOPLE FEAR THAT WHICH IS DIFFERENT. WHY IN GOD'S NAME DON'T WE TEACH HISTORY AND HISTORY CLASSES? , IN HISTORY CLASSES? A BLACK GUY INVENTED THE LIGHT BULB, NOT A WHITE GUY NAMED THOMAS EDISON. BLACK WALL STREET IN OKLAHOMA WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. WE DON'T TEACH THEM. WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE FACTS. TEACH THEM WHAT IS OUT THERE. THE IDEA , I JUST SPENT TIME WITH A NUMBER OF NFL PLAYERS , EXCUSE ME, BASKETBALL PLAYERS, INCLUDING STEPH CURRY. THESE FOLKS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. IT IS NOT ABOUT FAME OR GLORY. THEY HAVE BROTHERS, FATHERS WHO HAVE BEEN BEAT UP, WHO HAVE BEEN BRUTALIZED JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY ARE SAYING, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE FOR A REAL AWAKENING HERE. THE POINT IS, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE. BUT TO FIGHT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE BUT TO FIGHT BACK. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH. THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH HIS LAW AND ORDER STRIDES. BOY, AFTER HIS CONVENTION, WE REALLY MADEHE HAS NOT. NOT AT ALL. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY AIN'T BUYING IT. ALL OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT, THEY ARE NOT BUYING IT. BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE THAN THEM NOT BY IT. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THEM AND SAY YOU HAVE GOT TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE GOT TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE. A LOT MORE. AND WE , THAN YOU HAVE DONE BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE WE HAVE HAD IN A GENERATION IN MY VIEW TO DEAL AND CUT AND OTHER SLICE OFF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM TOWARD GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE IT CHANGES. THE MAIN REASON WHY I AM OPTIMISTIC, BECAUSE YOUR GENERATION, BLACK, WHITE, ASIAN AMERICAN, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD TURN ON A TV , YOU ARE MUCH LET , MUCH YOUNGER THAN I AM, BUT DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD TURN ON A TV AND ONE TO THREE ADS WOULD BE BIRACIAL COUPLES SELLING A PRODUCT? THAT NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED IN THE 1950'S, 1960'S. THIS GENERATION IS A DIFFERENT GENERATION. THEY ARE THE LEAST PREJUDICED, THE MOST OPTIMISTIC, THE BEST EDUCATED, THE MOST DESIRABLE OF CHANGE OF ANY GENERATION. WE CANNOT LET THEM DOWN. THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LOT OLDER, WE HAVE GOT TO JOIN THEM AND DO IT NOW. AGAIN, I THANK YOU. AS I SAID, I REALLY AM OPTIMISTIC. I PROMISE YOU, WIN OR LOSE, I'M GOING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING. I'M GOING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING FOR RACIAL EQUALITY, EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. THAT MAY BE BUT YOUR BIRTHRIGHT , BE WHAT YOUR BIRTHRIGHT WAS, BUT IT IS DIFFERENT ACTUALLY BEING TREATY EQUALLY. BEING TREATED THE SAME. EVERYTHING FROM BLACK MORTALITY RATES IN PREGNANCY STRAIGHT THROUGH TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. BUT THE COUNTRY IS READY. IF THEY ARE NOT, IT IS NOT READY BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS I AM NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WORTH LOSING OVER. THIS IS SOMETHING WORTH LOSING OVER. WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THOSE WERE TRULY UNIFYING WORDS IN A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS HEALING, UNIFICATION. WE WILL GO DOWN FIGHTING WITH YOU. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT GOING DOWN. LET ME SAY ONE THING IF I COULD. THE GENTLEMAN IN ME WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT WELCOME THE DR. JILL BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME DR. JILL BIDEN. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO KENOSHA. PATRICK, PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. BIDEN FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU, PASTOR BARKER FOR HOLDING THIS GREAT COMMUNITY EVENT, THIS TOWN HALL MEETING. THANK YOU TO ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT CAME FORWARD. I WANT TO THANK YOU, MR. BIDEN, FOR REMINDING US HOW IMPORTANT OPTIMISM IS. WE DEAL WITH SO MUCH NEGATIVITY. WE DEAL WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BEING POSITIVE AND DEALING WITH A SOLUTION. LIKE I SAID, SO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID. I AM THANKFUL , GRATEFUL TO EVEN BE INVITED TO THIS. LET'S STAND AS WE GET READY TO DISMISS AND PRAY, FATHER, WE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY. YOUR GOODNESS AND YOUR KINDNESS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO COME TOGETHER IN THE SPIRIT OF ONENESS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING MR. BIDEN TO TAKE TIME OUT OF HIS BUSY SCHEDULE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BRING SOME ISSUES TO THE TABLE. FATHER, I PRAY RIGHT NOW THAT YOU TAKE OUR HATRED, THAT YOU MOVE OUR HATRED FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND REPLACE IT WITH LOVE. I PRAY SINCERELY AND SERIOUSLY, DEAR GOD, THAT YOU REMIND US EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT WE CAN BE RESILIENT AND HAVE TENACITY AND MOVE FORWARD AWAY FROM THIS DESTRUCTION. I PRAY THAT YOU ALLOW THIS COMMUNITY TO HEAL, KENOSHA. I PRAY THAT YOU BLESS AND OSHA, THAT YOU BRING US BACK TOGETHER, THAT YOU TEAR DOWN THE WALLS THAT SEPARATE US BECAUSE OF RACE AND OTHER ISSUES. I PRAY THAT YOU OPEN UP THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THAT MUCH MORE BETWEEN YOUR PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST STARTED RECENTLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE. WE PRAY THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN CONTINUE TO PROTECT KENOSHA. CONTINUE TO PROTECT WISCONSIN. CONTINUE TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THIS WORLD. WE LIFT UP THE BLAKE FAMILY TODAY. WE PRAY THAT TOUCHED HIM MIRACULOUSLY. WE PRAY DEAR GOD FOR HIS FAMILY AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS HEALING PROCESS, AS THEY DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THE MEDIA AND THE SITUATIONS WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I WILL NOT STOP THERE. I WILL PRAY AND ASK THAT YOU TOUCH THE KENOSHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS COMMUNITY. I PRAY THAT YOU TOUCH THE HEARTS OF THOSE THAT THEY ALLOW RACISM AND BIGOTRY AND HATRED TO COME IN. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF IT IS LEARNED BEHAVIOR. IT IS UNFORTUNATE. WE PRAY THAT YOU ALLOW THIS COMMUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER AS SO MANY HAVE SAID, WE NEED TO REBUILD. WE NEED TO RECONSTRUCT. I PRAY THAT WE RELY ON YOU AS OUR ULTIMATE SORTURCE OF STRENGTH. AS WE GET READY TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, ONLY DISMISSALS FROM THIS PLACE, BUT NEVER IN YOUR PRESENCE. RESIDE IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS TODAY AND FOREVER MORE. WE GIVE YOU ALL THE PRAISE, THE OWNER AND THE GLORY THAT YOU SO RIGHTFULLY DESERVE AND MUCH MORE. I PRAY AS NONE OTHER THAN A SERVANT WHO STANDS BEHIND THE CROSS AND I PRAY, DEAR GOD, I NEED THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, MY LORD AND MY SAVIOR. AND LET EVERYONE SAY AMEN. THANK YOU. THIS CONCLUDES THE PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT EVERYONE, PLEASE STAY WHERE YOU ARE. STAGE STAFF WILL TAKE OVER. WE WILL TAKE A PHOTO AND THEY WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC.

They gathered with community officials and activists at the Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha, where Mr. Biden listened to a variety of people from the community talk about their concerns regarding systemic racism, policing policy, and concerns of residents and business owners in the wake of more than a week of protests that followed the shooting of Mr. Blake. The Bidens' visit to Wisconsin included a private meeting with Mr. Blake&rsquo;s family, which was held before the community event at the Kenosha church.	475401-1	Speech		
CSPANJB49202086	Joe Biden	2020-09-04	Joe Biden Remarks on the August 2020 Jobs Report	"YOU CAN APPLY FOR YOUR ABSENTEE BALLOT ONLINE, YOU HAVE TO REQUEST BY OCTOBER 27 AT 5:00 P.M.. YOUR EARLY VOTING DATES ARE OCTOBER 15 TO OCTOBER 31 AND YOUR MAIL-IN BALLOTS MUST BE POSTMARKED BY NOVEMBER 3. GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. SORRY I AM A LITTLE LATE. I WAS MESMERIZED. I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE OFFICE LISTENING TO AN INTERVIEW OF FORMER GENERAL MCCAFFREY AND BILL COHEN, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. THE REVELATIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DISREGARD FOR OUR MILITARY AND OUR VETERANS. QUITE FRANKLY, IF WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE ATLANTIC IS TRUE, IT IS DISGUSTING. IT AFFIRMS WHAT MOST OF US BELIEVE TO BE TRUE, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT FIT TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY SAID, AND I EMPHASIZE, THAT THOSE WHO SIGNED UP TO SERVE INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING MORE LUCRATIVE ARE SUCKERS. LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR. WHEN MY SON WAS AN U.S. ATTORNEY AND HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO WHILE THE WAR WAS GOING ON AS A CIVILIAN, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. WHEN MY SON VOLUNTEERED AND JOINED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WENT TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR AND WON ANOTHER BROWN STORE ACCOMMODATION, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HE SERVED WITH, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO DID NOT COME HOME, WERE NOT LOSERS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT TRUE. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO EVERY GOLDSTAR MOTHER AND FATHER AND EVERY BLUE STAR FAMILY THAT HE HAS DENIGRATED AND INSULTED. WHO THE HECK DOES HE THINK HE IS? IS IT TRUE? WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIS OWN MOUTH HIS CHARACTERIZATIONS OF JOHN MCCAIN AS A LOSER IN 2015. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WAS NOT A WAR HERO, I LIKE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT CAPTURED. WELL, GOOD FOR HIM. AND HIS DISMISSAL FOR THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SUFFERED BY TROOPS SERVING IN IRAQ AS MERE HEADACHES NOT LONG AGO, HE STOOD BY FAILING TO TAKE ACTION OR EVEN RAISE THE ISSUE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN WHILE THE KREMLIN PUTS BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN. IT IS A SACRED DUTY AND YOU ARE TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THIS, I WILL GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING IT, BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. WE HAVE MANY OBLIGATIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE ONLY ONE TRULY SACRED OBLIGATION. TO SUPPORT THOSE WE SEND INTO HARM'S WAY, CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WHILE THEY ARE GONE AND CARE FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE HOME. THAT IS THE ONLY TRULY SACRED OBLIGATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS. DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. THESE ARE VALUES THAT DRIVE OUR SERVICE MEMBERS. IT IS AN ALL VOLUNTARY OUTFIT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DEMONSTRATED HE HAS NO SENSE OF SERVICE, NO LOYALTY TO ANY CAUSE OTHER THAN HIMSELF. IF I AM HONORED OF BEING THE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL ENSURE THAT OUR AMERICAN HEROES KNOW I WILL HAVE THEIR BACKS, HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE, AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED WOULD BE IN MILITARY PARADES. I AM ALWAYS CAUTIONED NOT TO LOSE MY TEMPER. THIS MAY BE AS CLOSE AS I CAN COME. JUST A MARKER OF HOW DEEPLY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I DISAGREE ABOUT THE ROLE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU KNOW, THE JOBS REPORT CAME UP THIS MORNING. I AM GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE WHO FOUND WORK AGAIN, FOUND A GLIMMER OF HOPE. BUT THERE IS REAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN, AS WELL. THE PACE OF THE JOB GAINS IN AUGUST WAS SLOWER THAN JULY AND MAY AND JUNE. MORE AND MORE TEMPORARY LAYOFFS ARE TURNING INTO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. 28 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. AFTER SIX MONTHS IN A PANDEMIC, WE ARE THAN HALFWAY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, WITH 11.5 MILLION AMERICANS NOT GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK. WE ARE STILL DOWN 720,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP MAY BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE. I SPOKE TO A LOT OF REAL WORKING PEOPLE, ASKED THEM IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND, HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY COMING BACK. YOU WILL FIND, THEY DON'T FEEL IT. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY, TO THANK PAUL C. AND HIS TEAM FOR HOSTING US HERE IN WILMINGTON. PAUL, YOUR CONTINUED TRADITION OF DOING GOD'S WORK IN THIS COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT. HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR , IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN 130 YEARS. THROUGH PANDEMICS, WARS, DEPRESSIONS. WEST END HAS BEEN HERE FOR GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE JUST LOOKING FOR A CHANCE, NOT A HANDOUT. JUST A FAIR SHOT AT A GOOD JOB, A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE, AND A BETTER LIFE TO PASS DOWN TO THEIR KIDS. THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE , THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR THE BIDEN FAMILY. MY DAUGHTER WAS A CASEWORKER HERE, HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE. WHEN I WAS SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT, PLENTY OF ECONOMISTS AROUND ME, I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT , THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE DOORS HERE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? ARE THEY OK? IF THEY WEREN'T OK, WE WERE NOT DOING WELL. THAT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS LATEST JOBS REPORT. THIS REINFORCES THE WORST YEARS OF PAINFUL TRUCE. THE ECONOMIC INEQUITY THAT BEGAN BEFORE THE DOWNTURN HAVE ONLY WORSENED DURING THIS PRESIDENCY. NO ONE THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOSE A JOB FOR GOOD OR SEE SMALL BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN. BUT THAT KIND OF RECOVERY REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP WE DID NOT HAVE AND STILL DO NOT HAVE. AS A RESULT, ECONOMISTS ARE STARTING TO CALL THIS RECESSION A K-SHAPED RECESSION, WHICH IS A FANCY PHRASE FOR WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE K MEANS THOSE AT THE TOP DON'T SEE THINGS GO UP. THOSE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE LOWER AND SEE THINGS GO DOWN AND GETTING WORSE. , END SEE THINGS GO DOWN AND GETTING WORSE. DONALD TRUMP HAS MISMANAGED THE GLOBAL CRISIS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A K-SHAPED PANDEMIC. FIRST, THE PRESIDENT'S CHAOTIC MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC IS STILL HOLDING US BACK, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE EUROPE AND ASIA. ARE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL MORE THAN DOUBLE OTHER NATIONS. WHY? BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BOTCHED THE COVID RESPONSE. BOTCHED IT BADLY. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS UNTIL YOU BEAT THE PANDEMIC. YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC COMEBACK WHEN ALMOST 1000 AMERICANS DIE EACH DAY FROM COVID. WHEN THE DEATH TOLL REACHED 200,000. MORE THAN 6 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. WHEN MILLIONS MORE WORRY ABOUT GETTING SICK AND DYING, IN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TRYING TO REOPEN. , AS SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TRY TO REOPEN. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD TO BEGIN WITH IF THE PRESIDENT JUST DID HIS JOB. IF HE JUST AT THE VIRUS SERIOUSLY EARLY ON AS IT SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE, IF HE JUST TOOK THE STEPS WHEN NEEDED BACK IN MARCH AND APRIL TO DO WIDESPREAD TESTING AND TESTING TO CONTROL THE VIRUS , AND TRACING TO CONTROL THE VIRUS, IF HE JUST SET A GOOD EXAMPLE, LIKE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING A MASK, IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE DOESN'T CARE, IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM FOR HIS CLASS OF FRIENDS. ANYONE WITH A BIG ENOUGH CHECK BOOK CAN GET RAPID TESTS ON DEMAND. IF YOU DON'T, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE FOR HOURS AND WAIT FOR WEEKS TO GET YOUR RESULT, IF YOU GET THE METAL. , THEM AT ALL. IF YOU HAVE THE KIND OF JOB OR YOU CAN WORK FROM A LAPTOP AT HOME REMOTELY, RISKING GETTING COVID IS VERY SMALL WORK. THIS JOB REPORTS SHOWS THAT 37 MILLION PEOPLE REPORTED TELEWORKING. IF YOU WORK AT AN ASSEMBLY LINE OR CHECKOUT COUNTER, MEET WRECKING PLANT, YOU DRIVE A TRUCK , MEATPACKING PLANT, YOU DRIVE A TRUCK, THERE ARE MUCH BIGGER RISKS. THE JOBS REPORT SHOWS MORE THAN 27 MILLION WORKERS REPORTED TODAY COULD NOT WORK OR LOST HOURS BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYER HAD TO CLOSE OR LOSS BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC. YOU CAN HIRE A PRIVATE TUTOR OR HAVE A LIVE IN CHILDCARE. YOU CAN BALANCE BEING A PARENT AND REMOTE SCHOOLING. IF YOU CAN'T, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB AND BE A TEACHER ALL AT ONCE. WE HELD A MEETING ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT PARENTS CALL US WITH, AS WELL . WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HER CHILDREN? WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT SO HARD FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE WHEN IT IS DEVASTATING TO KEEP THEM ISOLATED FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND SUPPORT SYSTEM? I ALSO SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK, TO THE SHOCK OF MANY, WE LOST MORE COPS THIS YEAR TO COVID THAN ON PATROL. JUST A REMINDER HOW AN ALREADY DANGEROUS JOB, LAW ENFORCEMENT, HAS GOTTEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S MISMANAGEMENT. WHAT MAY BE JUST AS SHOCKING AS MANY OTHER JOBS ALSO BECOME DANGEROUS DUE TO COVID. BEING A HEALTH CARE WORKER IS NOW MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER. WE HAVE LOST HUNDREDS OF THEM THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PROTECTED FROM COVERT ON-THE-JOB. BEING AMY ACKER IS MORE DANGEROUS , THEY WERE NOT PROTECTED FROM COVID ON THE JOB. BEING A MEATPACKER IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS OR WHAT HE CLAIMS, YOU ARE NOT SAFER IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. YOU ARE NOT SAFE IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA, WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING AT A RATE LAST SEEN WHEN AMERICANS WERE FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR II. DONALD TRUMP SMACK PRACTICE HAS MADE BEING AN AMERICAN , MALPRACTICE HAS MADE BEING AN AMERICAN LIFE OR DEATH WORK. OPIOD DEATHS WERE UP DURING THE PANDEMIC. ANOTHER CRISIS THAT TRUMP CONTINUES TO ALL BUT IGNORE. IN THE MEANTIME, TRUMP AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE STRONG VIEWS ABOUT WHAT THE REST OF AMERICA SHOULD DO. ""CUT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS."" ""DEFUND SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE LIMITED OBAMACARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC."" ""REOPEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHOUT RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE."" ""REOPEN MAIN STREET BUSINESSES FOR , ""REOPEN MAIN STREET BUSINESSES WITHOUT PROTECTIONS FOR WORK."" THIS IS THE PLAN. THE ECONOMIC PAIN REMAINS UNRELENTING TO MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE. MEANWHILE, THEY ARE DOING JUST FINE. SOME BETTER THAN EVER. THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS, WE JUST HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO JUST DOES NOT SEE IT. HE DOES NOT FEEL IT. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. HE THINKS THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS UP AND EVERYTHING IS FINE. AND HIS WEALTHY FRIENDS AND DONORS ARE DOING WELL AND EVERYTHING IS DOING WELL. IF CORPORATIONS EITHER VALUATIONS RISING, THEN THEY MUST BE HIRING , SEE THEIR VALUATIONS RISING, THEN THEY MUST BE HIRING. A MEASURE OF OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS IS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IF YOUR STOCK SOARS AND THERE ARE FAMILIES ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE PRESIDENT CALLED THAT SUCCESS, WHEN YOU SEE THE WORLD AS SUCH A NARROW PRISM, IT'S NO WONDER HE DOESN'T SEE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ON UNEMPLOYMENT, ONE OUT OF SIX SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED RIGHT NOW. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WALKING BY THEIR BOARDED-UP SHOPS. EDUCATORS AFRAID OF DOING THEIR JOB, TO JOB THEY LOVE , THAT THE JOB THEY LEVEL BRING THE VIRUS TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME THAT THEY LOVE. IT'S NO WONDER HE DOESN'T SEE THE SINGLE MOM FORCED TO WAIT IN A THREE-HOUR FOOD LINE. SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, SHE CAN FEED HER FAMILY BECAUSE SHE IS NOT PART OF THE ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE WE ARE DOING BETTER. HE WANTS US TO NOT NOTICE THAT THIS REMAINS THE WORST ECONOMIC SITUATION IS THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND OUR COUNTRY FACES HISTORIC DIVERSIONS IN OUR WAY OF LIFE. WHICH GETS ME TO MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT, WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND. ALL PAIN AND SUFFERING STEMS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILURE TO LEAD. HIS SHEER IN ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. HE LIKES TO SENATE THICKET OF ORDERS , HE LIKES TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS FOR PHOTO OPS, HE SAYS PROTECTING RENTERS FROM EVICTION, THAT'S WHAT IS DOING, BUT HE IS NOT GIVING THEM ANY SUPPORT TO PAY THE RENT WHEN IT COMES TO. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE LEFT WITH A TERRIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN EVICTION AND LIVING IN THE STREETS OR PAYING BACK RENT THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. ONE THERE WAS AN ANSWER OFFERED AND REJECTED. , WHEN THERE WAS AN ANSWER OFFERED AND REJECTED. HE SHOULD BE DOING HIS JOB OF CALLING CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY TO GET A DEAL AND DELIVER REAL RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS I HAVE NEVER SEEN HAS CALLED CONGRESS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. GET IT DONE LIKE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS. RENTALS, FOOD, UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE, STUDENT LOAN RELEASE, SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT, EIGHT SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS GOING BANKRUPT. , AID SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS GOING BANKRUPT. AS LONG AS A PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE PERSISTS, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THEIR WATER AND LIGHT CUT OFF BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PAY THE BILL. BOTTOM LINE, MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOUR JOB. GET OFF , GET THE LEADERS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. MAKE A DEAL THAT THE LEVERS FOR WORKING AMERICANS. THAT EASES THEIR ANXIETY AND PAIN. INJ, OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS, I WILL BE LAYING OUT IN SHARP CONTRAST MY PLAN. I WILL BE ASKING AMERICAN PEOPLE THREE BASIC QUESTIONS , WHO CAN HANDLE THE PANDEMIC? WHO CAN KEEP THEIR PROMISES? AND WHO CARES ABOUT AND WILL FIGHT FOR WORKING FAMILIES? LIKE THE PEOPLE HERE IN WEST END, THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC, THEY FOUND A WAY TO KEEP THE CENTER OPEN SAFELY AND PROVIDE THE CRITICAL SERVICES. NO ONE HERE HAS BEEN LAID OFF. THEY ADJUSTED THEIR SPACES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THEY STARTED HELPING LOCAL BUSINESSES, HAIR SALONS, OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY CONTINUED THEIR CHILDCARE SERVICES, CRITICAL FOR SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES. BY PURE COURAGE, HEART, AND GRIT, THEY NEVER GIVE UP AND HE NEVER GIVEN , AND THEY NEVER GIVE IN. THAT IS THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. GIVE ORDINARY AMERICANS JUST HALF THE CHANCE, AND THEY NEVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, THEY WILL DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THEY WILL NEVER LET US DOWN, UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. AND UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, I WON'T LET YOU DOWN, EITHER. THIS IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. HELPING PEOPLE UNITE. GET TOGETHER. MOVE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE CAN BE. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. . NOTHING. IF WE JUST DO IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL. I WILL NOW TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. I GUESS, ARE YOU CALLING ON PEOPLE? I DON'T HAVE A LIST. THANK YOU, SIR. THIS MORNING, AND REFERENCE TO THE ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC , IN REFERENCE TO THE ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC, THE COMMENTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A TESTAMENT TO SELFISHNESS AND THAT HIS SOUL IS THAT OF A COWARD. YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF HOW YOU SEE THE JOB AS A PRESENT PRESIDENT, , AS A PRESIDENT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SOUL AND LIFE HE LEADS? JOE BIDEN: I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE MEASURED IN MY RESPONSE. IF IT IS TRUE, I BELIEVE THE ARTICLE IS TRUE, I WOULD ASK YOU ALL A RHETORICAL QUESTION. HOW DO YOU FEEL? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU HAD A KID IN AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU LOST A SON OR DAUGHTER OR HUSBAND OR WIFE? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL? THE REAL? I KNOW THAT IT UP TO EXPRESS THIS, BUT YOU KNOW , I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO EXPRESS THIS, BUT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IN YOUR GUT IT IS DEPLORABLE. IT'S DEPLORABLE. AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES AND I WILL SAY AGAIN, THESE FOLKS ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THEY ARE THE HEART, THE SOUL, THE GRIT. THAT IS WHAT PATRIOTISM IS ABOUT. I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN AS DISAPPOINTED IN MY WHOLE CAREER WITH A LEADER I HAVE WORKED WITH, PRESIDENT OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE IF THE ARTICLE IS TRUE AND IT APPEARS TO BE BASED ON WHAT HE SAID, IT IS ABSOLUTELY DAMNABLE. IT IS A DISGRACE. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE Q1 , QANON, THAT THERE IS SEX TRAFFICKING, CONSPIRACIES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR NOT REJECTING THE CONSPIRACY AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN IT? JOE BIDEN: I'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE IT STILL EXISTS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT'S BIZARRE. TOTALLY BIZARRE. AND NOW, HAVE YOU GUYS FOUND THAT PLANELOAD OF PEOPLE IN UNIFORMS FLYING AROUND? HAVE YOU FOUND THEM YET? BY THE WAY, I RESPECT CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL POINT OF VIEW WHEN THE PRESS. ANYBODY FOUND THAT PLANE? WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? LOOK AT HOW IT MAKES US LOOK AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS MORTIFYING. IT IS EMBARRASSING. AND IT IS DANGEROUS. IT IS DANGEROUS. IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW BETTER, WHICH HE HAS TO KNOW BETTER, AND MY LORD, WE ARE IN MORE TROUBLE THAN I EVER FELT WE WERE, IT'S BIZARRE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A CASE WHERE I HAVE BEEN PLEASED, BUT SURPRISED WITH BOTH SIDES' ARGUMENTS. THIS CAN'T GO ON. THIS CANNOT GO ON. IT'S A DECONSTRUCTION OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY KNOW IT. SO, I JUST , I WILL CONCLUDE WITH WHAT YOU HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES BEFORE, THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. EVEN A LOUSY PRESIDENT. IT GIVES SUCCOR, IT GIVES ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTING IRRATIONAL VIEWS THAT NO ONE HAS EVEN CLOSE TO EVER PRESUMING OR SHOWING EVER EXISTING. , EVER EXISTED. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, HE'S UNDERSTOOD THE ONLY WAY HE CAN WIN THE FIRST TIME AND THIS TIME IS IF HE FUNDAMENTALLY DIVIDES THE NATION. PUTS THE NATION SO THAT WE ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. LAST MET, PRESIDENT TRUMP , LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS A SIGN YOU HAVE ""B IG ISSUES"" DESPITE THE CDC SAYING WEAR A MASK SAVE LIVES. , JOE BIDEN: I WEAR THIS BECAUSE I AM A SMART FELLOW. I LISTEN TO SCIENCE. THIS IS NOT A GAME. LIFE AND DEATH, LIFE AND DEATH. THE REPORTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE, AS MANY AS 100,000 DEAD MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR , THERE ARE REPORTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AS MANY AS 100,000 DEAD MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S HARD TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING SO IDIOTIC. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED NOW FOR COVID-19? JOE BIDEN: YES, I HAVE. I HAVE BEEN TESTED ONCE WITH A DEEP TEST AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS , I WILL CONTINUE TO BE TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. WILLIAM BARR SAID ON CNN THIS WEEK THAT HIS ASSESSMENT RIGHT NOW IS THAT CHINA POSES THE MOST AGGRESSIVE THREAT TO U.S. ELECTIONS, EVEN MORE THAN IRAN OR RUSSIA. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT? IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS YOU HAVE RECEIVED? JOE BIDEN: IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS I HAVE RECEIVED. HE IS A REALLY BAD INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. IT'S NOT CONSISTENT, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE , ? JOE BIDEN: BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD. AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD I THINK WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE OUR ELECTIONS DESTABILIZE, BUT THE ONE WHO WAS WORKING THE HARDEST, MOST CONSISTENTLY, AND NEVER HAS LED UP HIS RUSSIAN , LET UP HIS RUSSIAN , LET UP IS RUSSIA. ASK YOURSELF THE RHETORICAL QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO AFRAID OF VLADIMIR PUTIN? I MEAN, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? I MEAN, NOTHING, NOTHING. IT'S ALMOST OBSEQUIOUS. I MEAN, ANYWAY , I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, I BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY THAT ENGAGES IN ANY ACTIVITY TO DELEGITIMIZE OR IMPACT AN AMERICAN ELECTION IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY. IF I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THERE WILL BE A RESPONSE. SIR, IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE YOU ANNOUNCED SENATOR HARRIS AS YOUR RUNNING MATE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER OUT VERY MUCH, INCLUDING YESTERDAY IN KENOSHA. WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE HER PLAYING IN THE FINAL? JOE BIDEN: SHE'S BEEN ON THE ROAD. SHE'S ON HERSELF. THE ROLE IS THAT JUST LIKE WHEN BARACK AND I CAMPAIGNED, WE TRY TO COVER AS MUCH TERRITORY AS WE COULD. AND BOTH OF US ARE OUT CAMPAIGNING. SHE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPETENT CANDIDATE. SHE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER, BUT THERE'S A LOAD OF , THERE'S A LOT OF TERRITORY TO COVER. I SPEAK WITH HER EVERY DAY, WE WORK TOGETHER, AND I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HER. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT NOT CAMPAIGNING TOGETHER, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COVER MORE TERRITORY. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER COVID TEST? DO YOU HAVE ANY PLAN? JOE BIDEN: THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS, BECAUSE EVERYONE ON MY SERVICE DETAIL, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THE HOUSE WITH ME, THEY ARE ALL TESTED. I'M JUST, YES, SIR, SHOW UP, AND PUT MY HEAD BACK WHEN THEY TELL ME. THANK YOU, SIR. THE PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN SUGGESTED LAST NIGHT TO HIS SUPPORTERS THAT THEY SHOULD CONSIDER VOTING TWICE IF THEY ARE IN ONE OF THOSE STATES THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE BALLOT, FILL THAT OUT, THEN GO TRY VOTING AGAIN IN PERSON. STATE OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT IS A FELONY, IN SOME CASES. JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. . , JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. JOE BIDEN: IT IS A FELONY HERE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES HAS THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THINGS? HE IS A FRAUD. NOT AN OPINION. HE WANTED , MAYBE WE SHOULD DELAY THE ELECTION, MAYBE WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW, BALLOTS ARE FRAUDULENT, NOT A SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE. AND TO THINK IT IS ALL DESIGNED TO CREATE SO MUCH CHAOS THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION IS, THAT IT IS THROWN UP IN THE AIR. THAT MUST BE HIS REASON, BECAUSE HE SAYS AND DOES THINGS THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT THAT I AM AWARE OF IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER DONE. WE ALL GO, WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER RIDICULOUS, AND APPROPRIATE THING HE SAID SO MANY OF THEM, IT DOESN'T MATTER. , INAPPROPRIATE THING, BUT HE SAID SO MANY OF THEM, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT JUST UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND ITS DANGEROUS. YOU SAID TODAY IS THE ANGRIEST YOU HAVE BEEN AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. BUT YOU SAID YOU ARE TRYING TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF. YOU ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLINED TO NOT VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD SAY, WHY ISN'T JOE BIDEN ANGRIER ABOUT ALL OF THIS? JOE BIDEN: BECAUSE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE PRESIDENTIAL, AND SHOULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE, AS WELL AS MAKE CLEAR EXACTLY WHERE THEY STAND. GETTING DOWN IN THE GUTTER LIKE THE PRESIDENT DOES, SAYING THINGS THAT I WOULD BE INCLINED IF WE WERE BEHIND SOMEWHERE, WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING. BUT THAT'S NOT THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO SET AN EXAMPLE. MY ANGER IS REAL, BECAUSE I MUST TELL YOU, I CARRY AND I DELIBERATELY DIDN'T BRING WITH ME TODAY , THE NATIONAL GUARD HAD A PIN MADE UP THAT IS A GOLD STAR WHO WAS MADE FOR MY SON BEAU WHO DID NOT DIE IN THE FIELD. I ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH ME. AND I DIDN'T CARRY IT TODAY, BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED THAT IF I FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON IT, THAT I WOULD ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT HAS USED. BUT I JUST THINK IT IS SICK, IT IS DEPLORABLE, IT IS SO UN- AMERICAN, IT IS STILL UNPATRIOTIC, THAN WATCHING HIM THIS MORNING , THEN WATCHING HIM THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT HOW HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, HE HONORED JOHN MCCAIN HE IS THE REASON WHY FLAGS ARE FLOWN AT HALF MAST. HE IS THE SAME GUY THAT WHEN THE SHIP WENT INTO HARBOR, HE MADE SURE THE USS MCCAIN WAS COVERED. YOU COULDN'T SEE IT. HE IS THE SAME GUY THAT DENIGRATED JOHN. HE IS THE SAME GUY WHO DID THE SAME THING WHEN THE H BUSH WAS SHUT DOWN IN THE PACIFIC. BUT HE JUST STANDS THERE. , SHOT DOWN IN THE PACIFIC. HE JUST STANDS THERE. IT IS PATHOLOGICAL. ""NO ONE HAS BEEN BETTER TO THE MILITARY."" I JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT HAS TO BE DONE, NOT WHAT HE DID, WHAT I DO FROM HERE, WOULD GET SOME FROM HERE. IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION ABOUT VOTING. WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ATTACKING MAIL-IN VOTING. HE'S EVEN KNOWS ADJUSTING HIS SUPPORTERS VOTE TWICE. WILL SUNIL RUSSIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO SOW DOUBT ABOUT THE SYSTEM. ARE YOU CONCERNED THIS MES , THIS MESSAGING MAY BE WORK ING? , ARE YOU CONCERNED THIS MESSAGING MAY BE WORKING? JOE BIDEN: THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT , THERE'S TWO THINGS HE WANTS US TO TALK ABOUT. THE ELECTION BEING LEGITIMATE, AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS UP IN FLAMES. EVERYTHING IS BURNING. LAW AND ORDER. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE JOB HE HAS NOT DONE. AND SO, IT IS A CONUNDRUM. THERE'S A LOT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS THAT RUSSIA IS DOING AND NOT DOING, BUT WHEN YOU DO, ALL IT DOES IS UNDERMINE WHAT PEOPLE THINK , WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE REACHING THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WORTH VOTING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KEEP TRYING TO SAY TO PEOPLE IS, GO TO IWILLV OTE.COM. I WILL VOTE DOR COM. , DOT COM. FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE, WHEN YOU CAN VOTE, ETC. PLAN NOW. THE MORE CHAOS THAT IS SOWN HERE, IT WILL PREVENT PEOPLE FROM SHOWING UP. EVERY TIME I MENTION IT, I FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING AT HIS GAME. DOES IT MAKE SENSE WHAT I AM SAYING? I THINK THAT IS ALL PART OF THE DEAL. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. GOING BACK TO THE JOBLESS REPORT FROM THIS MORNING, YOU HAD ACKNOWLEDGED LESS THAN HALF OF THE 22 MILLION JOBS THAT WERE LOST THIS SPRING BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 1.4 MILLION ADDED BACK IN AUGUST SAYS ABOUT JUST THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE ECONOMY? JOE BIDEN: I ANY JOB AT IT BACK AS POSITIVE. , I THINK ANY JOB ADDED BACK AS POSITIVE. IT MATTERS TO THE PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB BACK. MAYBE YOU WILL WERE RAISED IN HOUSEHOLDS LIKE I WAS, WHERE A MOM OR DAD WAS LOSING A JOB BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY, WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR COMMUNITY, YOU COULD FEEL THE TENSION, THE EMMYS IN THE HOUSEHOLD , UNEASE IN THE HOUSEHOLD, WONDERING IF YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY. ALONG THE WAY, ALSO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE , YOU'VE GOT CLOSE TO A COUPLE MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE PART-TIME WORKERS WHO STILL CANNOT MAKE IT, BUT ARE LISTED AS EMPLOYEES. A LOT OF THEM ALSO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT , I MEAN, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LINED UP IN FOOD LINES. MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDED BY THEIR EMPLOYER. THE SAME PEOPLE OUT THERE WORRYING, IF THIS PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ALL THE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET INSURANCE EVEN IF WE HAD THE MONEY. IT'S JUST THE ANXIETY IS ENORMOUS. IS A NORM IS. , IS ENORMOUS. AGAIN, I'M NOT BEING SOLICITOUS. AMONG THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE HAVE DEALT WITH IN MY CAREER HAVE BEEN THE PRESS. NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE ALL EXTREMELY EDUCATED, YOU ARE WELL READ, YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUNDS. AND THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE TRIED TO REPORT THE NEWS, NOT JUST OPINIONS. BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME , NOT DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICAN, OK? YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME ANXIETY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SISTER, MOTHER, FATHER, CENTER DOT ARE , SON OR DAUGHTER , WE HAVE JOBS. IT IS A REAL CONCERN. IF I MAY ASK, [INDISCERNIBLE] SERBIA DEAL, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED AN ECONOMIC NORMALIZATION DEAL BETWEEN SERBIA AND PORTUGAL. PORTUGAL AND ISRAEL HAVING DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION IS PART OF THE DEAL. YOU HAVE STATED YOU SUPPORT THE TWO STATE SOLUTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WOULD YOU SUPPORT MORE OF THE MAJORITY COUNTRIES NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY MEAN THE PALESTINIANS WILL LOSE LEVERAGE IN THEIR FIGHT FOR THE TWO STATE SOLUTION? JOE BIDEN: FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS YOU ARE REFERRING TO. WHAT I HAVE ARGUED, RELATIVE TO SERBIA AND KOSOVO, IS THAT KOSOVO SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. NOT A PART OF SERBIA. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD REINFORCE THAT INDEPENDENCE, BUT I DON'T KNOW BASED ON WHAT IS BEING SAID. I THINK NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AMONG COUNTRIES IS A, BY AND LARGE, A GOOD THING. TO HAVE A MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRY NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL SEEMS POSITIVE TO ME, BUT I HAVE TO NOTE THE DETAIL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHAT IS GOING ON. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT , YOU MAY BE RIGHT , THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE THE PALESTINIANS TO LOSE LEVERAGE ANY DECISION ON A TWO STATE SOLUTION. WOULD YOU SUPPORT MORE COUNTRIES RECOGNIZING ISRAEL? JOE BIDEN: I DO. ABSOLUTELY. I DO. I THINK THAT IS THE THING, RECOGNIZING ISRAEL AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE, I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO, I BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL HAS TO BE PREPARED TO WORK TOWARD A GENUINE TWO STATE SOLUTION. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER ON THE WRONG SET"	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475440-1/joe-biden-remarks-august-2020-jobs-report	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on the August jobs report released by the Labor Department. The former vice president began his remarks by addressing an article in <i>The Atlantic</i> Magazine alleging that President Trump made disparaging comments about fallen service members. &ldquo;It is absolutely damnable. It is a disgrace,&rdquo; he said, adding that he had never been more disappointed in a leader and was trying to control his temper. Mr. Biden also took several questions from reporters.	475440-1	Speech		
CSPANJB99202088	Joe Biden	2020-09-09	Joe Biden Remarks in Michigan on Manufacturing Plans	"THERE IS A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS WITHIN MR. BIDEN'S COMMENTS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FALSE. FIRST, HE LOOK AT THE CITIES THAT ARE OVERCOME WITH THE ANARCHY AND CHAOS RIGHT NOW, HE LOOKED UP PORTLAND, SEATTLE, CHICAGO. YOU EVEN LOOK AT CITIES LIKE AUSTIN THAT ARE TAKING MEASURES TO DEFUND THE POLICE, AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE CITIES RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THAT IS A , YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE FACT OF THEIR PARTISAN MAKEUP. THE REALITY IS, YOU HAVE DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED CITIES AND STATES THAT ARE ALLOWING THE ANARCHY, ALLOWING THE CHAOS, THE LAWLESSNESS TO GO SO FAR PAST A PEACEFUL PROTEST THAT IT IS LAUGHABLE. IT REALLY SHOWS JUST THE HYPOCRISY OF THE MOMENT. YOU HAVE ON ONE HAND, GOVERNORS SAYING, LET'S KEEP THESE STATES LOCKED DOWN, LET'S NOT ALLOW CHILDREN TO RETURN TO SCHOOLS. THE AMOUNT THE FLIP SCREEN , THEN ON THE FLIP SCREEN YOU HAVE VIOLENT PROTESTS AND RIOTS AND LOOTING GOING ON NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND YOU SEE THE HYPOCRISY PLAY OUT. FOR BIDEN TO BLAME THAT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP I THINK IS A MISTAKE. HE REALLY SHOULD BE TURNING TO HIS DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO STEP IN TO ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB AND FIGHT BACK AND QUELL THIS VIOLENCE. ON THE CORONAVIRUS COMMENTS MR. BIDEN IS MAKING, I THINK IT IS INTERESTING, THE DIFFERENT TONES THAT THE FIGHT FOR OUR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SECURITY AROUND COVID-19 HAS TAKEN, REALLY SENSE , THE UAW TAKES OUR PROTOCOLS AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR MEMBERS. SERIOUSLY. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE UAW HAS LED THE WAY IN THE MANUFACTURING AND DEALING WITH THE VERY CRITICAL ISSUES AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. WE ARE PRAYING FOR PRESIDENT CAMPBELL AND HIS FAMILY MEMBERS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE OUR HOST TODAY. REGION ONE DIRECTOR, FRANKS DOING , FRANK STAULIN. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JAMES HARRIS AND OUR REGION ONE MEMBERS. WE WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME OUR MEMBERS AT THE UAW INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE BOARD. VICE PRESIDENT CINDY ESTRADA. VICE PRESIDENT GERALD CARRINE. DIRECTOR STEVE DOBBS. AND LAURA DICKERSON, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF REGION ONE A. WE ARE ALSO HONORED TO HOST HERE TODAY OUR MICHIGAN GOVERNOR, GRETCHEN WHITMER. OUR UNITED STATES SENATOR SEVEN. AND AFL-CIO PRESIDENT RON BIEBER. AND ALSO THE MEMBERS AND STAFF OF REGION ONE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE SO PROUD TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY, IS THE VICE PRESIDENT. THE UAW WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BACK YOU YOU RAN FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND YOU HAVE BEEN A LOAN FRIEND. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A SHORT STORY ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND HIS COMMIT AND TO AUTOWORKERS. YOU SEE, THERE IS A PLANT HERE IN FLINT, MICHIGAN THAT TO THIS DAY FLOURISHES BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK ON THE AUTO RECOVERY. YOU WERE TASKED TO RUN THAT PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS A PROVISION REQUIRING THAT GM COULD NOT LEAVE U.S. AUTOWORKERS UNEMPLOYED WHILE OUTSOURCED VEHICLES TO OTHER COUNTRIES DID SIMILAR WORK. BECAUSE OF YOU, IN FLINT, 1000 U.S. JOBS CAME BACK FROM MEXICO TO BUILD TRUCKS. JOBS THAT ARE THERE THIS DAY WITH A THIRD SHIFT WAS ADDED TO THAT PLANT. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN NOT ONLY WALKED THE WALK, BUT HE TALKED THE TALK. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. THOSE FLINT WORKERS IN SO MANY OTHERS WHOSE JOBS HE SAVED. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO WELCOME YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE AT THIS TIME, OUR VERY OWN PRESIDENT OF UAW LOCAL 5960 FOUR PURPOSES OF INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS LUIS ROCHE. WE ARE PROUD TO REPRESENT OUR MEMBERS HERE TODAY AS WE INTRODUCE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THESE ARE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE AS AN INDUSTRY HAVE FACED UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES AND WORKED TOGETHER DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE MAKING OUR PRODUCTS AND KEEP AMERICA AND THE ECONOMY MOVING. WE UNDERSTAND ADVERSITY AND WE KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN DOES TOO. HE UNDERSTOOD DURING OUR INDUSTRY'S DARKEST DAYS THAT THE DIGNITY OF WORK IS WHAT SUSTAINS AMERICA. AND THAT OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IS KEY TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. HE RAN THE OTTAWA CALVARY , HE RAN THE AUTO RECOVERY. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN TIMES OF CRISIS LIKE WE HAVE NOW, STEADY INVESTMENT IN THE MANUFACTURING AND JOBS WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY MOVING AND GROWING AS WE FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED THAT THE FUTURE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THOSE JOBS BEING HERE, ARE IMPORTANT. HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT MANY OF THE PRODUCTS OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS MAKE IN THE REGION WILL CHANGE AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THOSE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. THAT IS WHY WE WELCOME JOE BIDEN TODAY. HE WILL FIGHT TO KEEP OUR JOBS HERE, ON OUR SOIL. AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR FUTURE JOBS TO BE RIGHT HERE AS WELL. IT IS AN HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. A FRIEND TO AUTOWORKERS AND HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. A LEADER WHO IS ON OF US. THANK YOU. , A LEADER WHO IS ONE OF US. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. SINCE I AM SOCIALLY DISTANCE, I AM ALLOWED TO TAKE MY MASK OFF, THEY TELL ME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD AFTERNOON. SECRETARY KERRY AND MR. PRESIDENT, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT, WHERE IS MY PRESIDENT? THERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU, PAL. THANKS FOR THE WELCOME. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE IN MICHIGAN AND WITH THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS. AS THEY SAY IN PARTS OF MY ESTATE, I GOT BRUNG UP ON GENERAL MOTORS. MY FATHER RAN THE GENERAL MOTORS AGENCY , HE DIDN'T OWN IT, BUT HE RAN IT. CARS ARE CARS ARE CARS. BY THE WAY, I STILL HAVE MY 1967 CORVETTE. IT WAS NEW. I STILL KEEP THAT. I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU, THE ELECTRIC ONE THAT GOES 110 MILES PER HOUR, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. EARLIER THIS WEEK AND THE REASON WE ARE A LITTLE BIT LATE HERE , WE FOUND OUT, THE PRESS ASKED ME A LEGITIMATE QUESTION I DID NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON, BECAUSE IT OCCURRED ON THE PLANE. EARLIER THIS WEEK WE CELEBRATED LABOR DAY, AND HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY WE NEVER FORGET EVERYTHING WE OWE THE UNIONS. UNIONS THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE ECONOMY, THE ECONOMIC ENGINE HAS DRIVEN AMERICA, MANUFACTURING DYNAMISM. AND LITERALLY, LITERALLY IN THE CASE OF THE AUTOWORKERS, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO DID IT. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN, UAW REGION ONE, FOR HOSTING ME TODAY. IT IS GREAT TO SEE SENATOR STABENOW. GET A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE GOVERNOR. SENATOR STABENOW AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON A LOT A LOT OF MATTERS OVER THE YEARS. SHE WAS A GREAT PARTNER TO ME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. WE WORKED TO GET THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN BACK ON THEIR FEET. WE WERE JOINED BY THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST GOVERNORS AROUND, GOVERNOR RUSSIAN WITMER. IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE IN THE COVID-19, JUST LOOK AT THIS EXECUTIVE RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB STEERING THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN THROUGH A TURBULENT TIME. MUCH OF IT IS BROUGHT ON BY DONALD TRUMP'S LACK OF LEADERSHIP. HAVE BEEN ROCK SOLID. YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE EXPERTS AND YOU HAVE LED WITH SCIENCE. HE PUT THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING FIRST, HELPING THEM GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS. MEANWHILE, ON THE DAY WE HIT 190,000 DEAD IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF COVID-19, WE JUST LEARNED FROM THE WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST BOB WOODWARD THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ADMITTED ON TAPE IN FEBRUARY, HE KNEW ABOUT COVID-19 , THAT IT PASSED THROUGH THE AIR. HE KNEW HOW DEADLY WAS. HE KNEW AND PURPOSELY PLAYED DOWN. WORSE, HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNOWINGLY AND WILLINGLY LIED ABOUT THE THREAT IT POSED TO THE COUNTRY FOR MONTHS. HE HAD THE INFORMATION. HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. WHILE THIS DEADLY DISEASE RIPPED THROUGH OUR NATION, HE FAILED TO DO HIS JOB ON PURPOSE. IT WAS A LIFE AND DEATH BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EXPERTS SAY THAT IF HE HAD ASKED JUST ONE WEEK SOONER, 36,000 PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE. IF HE ACTED HE W WEEKS SOONER BACK IN MARCH, 54,000 LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED IN MARCH AND APRIL ALONE. HIS FAILURE IS NOT , HAS NOT ONLY COST LIVES, IT HAS SENT OUR ECONOMY IN A TAILSPIN. COST MILLIONS MORE IN AMERICAN LIVELIHOODS. THIS IS A RECESSION CREATED BY DONALD TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE AND HE IS UNFIT FOR THIS JOB. HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN RIGHT NOW? HOW MANY KIDS ARE STARTING A NEW SCHOOL YEAR THE SAME WAY THEY ENDED LAST ONE? AT HOME? HOW MANY PARENTS FEEL ABANDONED AND OVERWHELMED? HOW MANY FRONTLINE WORKERS HAVE EXHAUSTED AND PUSHED TO THEIR LIMITS? AND HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE MISSING LOVED ONES AT THEIR DINNER TABLES TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURES? IT IS BEYOND DESPICABLE. IT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IT IS A DISGRACE. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS, I'M SURE, NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FROM THE NEWS MEDIA AND FROM A LOT OF OTHERS. BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE SUBQUESTION JACK , SIMPLE QUESTION , WHAT IS THE WORTH OF A WOMAN OR MAN'S WORD? OF A PRESIDENTS WORD, IF IT IS NOT MATCHED BY ACTION? IN 2016 TRUMP CAME HERE TO WARN, JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, HE SAID, IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL NOT LOSE ONE PLANT. YOU WILL HAVE PLANS COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE JOBS AGAIN. HE WON'T LOSE ONE PLANT, I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. DONALD TRUMP MAKES A LOT OF PROMISES. HE PROMISED THAT HE ALONE COULD STOP THE OFF SHORING IN JOBS. HE PROMISED HE WOULD BRING BACK JOBS, STOP COMPANIES FROM LEAVING. HE CAN DO WHAT ""NOBODY ELSE COULD DO IT"" BUT HIM. HE PROMISED THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD FORCE EVERY LAST BUYING AMERICAN PROVISION ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT MAKES HIS CLAIMS IN HOPES, NOW HOPES WE DO NOT NOTICE WHAT HE SAID OR WON'T REMEMBER. AND WHEN HE DOES FOLLOW THROUGH OR DOESN'T DO WITH FOLLOW-THROUGH THE EXACT OPPOSITE. HE'S HOPING WE JUST HAVE POOR MEMORIES. HE DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH CREDIT. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SMART, HONEST, DECENT, AND THEY ARE HARD-WORKING. WE EXPECT OUR PRESIDENT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH US. TO DO WHAT HE OR SHE SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO DO. LET'S LOOK AT THE REALITY OF DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMY. WHAT EXACTLY HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WORKERS ARE WORTH. HE IS ON TRACK TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT SENT HERBERT HOOVER AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO SEE THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY GO DOWN, NOT UP, WHILE BEING PRESIDENT. OUR ECONOMY IS DOWN 4.7 MILLION JOBS SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILED RESPONSE TO COVID-19 CRASHED OUR ECONOMY, IS RECKLESS AND CHAOTIC TRADE POLICIES HAD THROWN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING INTO RECESSION. IT WAS ALREADY CONTRACTING IN 2019. EVEN WHEN COVID-19 HIT , BEFORE IT HAD, TRUMP WAS CREATING AN AVERAGE OF 500,000 JOBS FEWER PER YEAR IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN OFFICE. AND WHEN THE GM TRANSITION PLANT IN WARREN CLOSED LAST YEAR, I BET THE WORKERS AROUND NOT ALL THAT COMFORTED BY TRUMP'S ANTI-PROMISES. UNDER DONALD TRUMP, MICHIGAN LOST AUTO JOBS EVEN BEFORE COVID HIT. AND WHAT ABOUT OFF SHORING? AS TRUMP DELIVERED ON STOPPING COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS, AMERICAN JOBS? YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER, OF COURSE NOT. THE RATE OF OFF SHORING BY FEDERAL CONTRACTORS , THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GET FEDERAL DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THINGS. THE OFF SHORING. BIG COMPANIES BEING PAID BY U.S. TAXPAYERS HAS DOUBLED UNDER TRUMP. THOSE CONTRACTS, FEDERAL CONTRACTS WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS. THEY HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER THAT HAVE BEEN OFFSHORE. HE INVITED COMPANIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MAKE WHAT HE CALLED A PLEDGE TO AMERICAN WORKERS. HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP THOSE FIRMS FROM OUTSOURCING. MANY WERE GIVEN LUCRATIVE FEDERAL CONTRACTS, BUT THEN SOME OF THEM TURNED AROUND AND SHIPPED 7000 JOBS OVERSEAS. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HAS GROWN. IT HAS HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WHEN ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IS THAT AN ALL-TIME HIGH UNDER TRUMP OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ANSWER IS THE SAME AS HIS ANSWER TO EVERYTHING , CORPORATE TAX GIVEAWAYS. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. GIVEAWAYS THAT REWARD OFF SHORING. IF YOU OFFSHORE, YOU GET MORE TAX BREAK. HIS 2017 TAX BILL SLASHED TAXES ON COMPANIES SEND PRODUCTION AND JOBS OVERSEAS. THOSE CORPORATIONS THEN MAKE HUGE PROFITS BY SHIPPING THESE FOREIGN-MADE PRODUCTS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES TO SELL TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS. AND NO INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN GREATER ADVANTAGE OF TRUMP'S OFFERING TAX LOOPHOLES THAN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. BIG PHARMA LOBBIED TRUMP FOR A HANDOUT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY GOT FROM HIM. PHARMA , U.S. PHARMA IS BUILDING FACTORIES OVERSEAS INSTEAD OF THE UNITED STATES, SKIPPING OUT ON HAVING TO PAY U.S. TAXES. AND THEN SENDING THOSE SAME FOREIGN-MADE DRUGS ACT TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS. ALL WHILE RAISING THEIR PRICES ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT UNION FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE HAVE TO RELY ON. IN THE PROCESS, TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH ALL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE ARE SEEING NOT ONLY THE INEQUITY OF THIS POLICY, BUT THE ENORMOUS VULNERABILITY THIS CREATES FOR OUR OWN HEALTH SECURITY. OUR SECURITY REQUIRES US TO HAVE SUPPLY CHAINS OF THE NECESSARY DRUGS BASED HERE, NOT OVERSEAS, NOT OVERSEAS, IN TIMES OF CRISIS. WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S COMMITMENT TO BUY AMERICA? LIKE THE REST OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROMISES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. IT IS A BUNCH OF HOT AIR. IN FACT, CONTRACTS AWARDED BY U.S. GOVERNMENTS TO FOREIGN COMPANIES USING AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS WENT UP 30% SINCE HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. ONE, TRUMP HAS NOT STOPPED COMPANIES FROM CLOSING PLANTS AND SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS. TWO, HE REPORTED COMPANIES THAT CUT JOBS AND FAILED TO INVEST HERE AT HOME WITH BILLIONS OF TAX BREAKS. THREE, HE IS AWARDING MORE AND MORE FEDERAL CONTRACTS TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROKEN ABOUT EVERY PROMISE HE HAS EVERY EVER MADE TO THE AMERICAN WORKER AND HE HAS FAILED OUR ECONOMY AND OUR PEOPLE. WOULD YOU REALLY EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM THIS GUY? FROM SOMEBODY WHO CALLED THOSE OF YOU AND THOSE SERVING IN UNIFORM, WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO THE COUNTRY ""LOSERS"" AND ""SUCKERS? "" MY SON IS A U.S. ATTORNEY AND VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO TO HELP THEM SET UP A GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR. I AM BEING PROUD, BUT HE IS THE ONLY FOREIGNER THAT HAS A MONUMENT THAT THEY RAISED AND BUILT IN SERVICE TO HIM, THANKING HIM FOR WHAT HE DID. MY SON ALSO IS ATTORNEY GENERAL VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR ONE YEAR. HE WAS NOT A LOSER OR A SUCKER. NO ONE WHO SERVED THIS NATION HAS BEEN A LOSER OR A SUCKER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. WOULD YOU EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM SOMEBODY WHO COULD STAND NEXT TO THE FATHER OF A FALLEN SOLDIER AND SAY, I DO NOT GET IT? WHAT WAS IN IT FOR THEM? WHAT WAS IN IT FOR THEM? DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO SERVE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. HE LIVES BY A DIFFERENT CODE. LIES, SELFISHNESS, GREED, YES, DONALD TRUMP AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING OUR WORD. MIND MEANS SOMETHING , MINE MEANS SOMETHING. WHEN I SELL THE AMERICAN TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING, I MEAN IT. IN 2009 OBAMA AND I INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN FREEFALL AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING SO MANY IN MICHIGAN, LOST THEIR JOBS, HOMES, AND SAVINGS. WITH DEBBIE BREAKING HER NECK PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED HARD. HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MICHIGAN AND DETROIT WORKING WITH YOU THINKING EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT THE FOLKS ON THE FACTORY LINE BUSTING THEIR LEGS TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. A LOT OF FOLKS WERE ALREADY READY TO COUNT DETROIT OUT, THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, BUT I KNEW IT DEBBIE KNEW. I HAVE KNOWN ALWAYS THAT NEVER IT IS A GOOD BET TO BET AGAINST THE AMERICAN WORKER. WE PROMISED TO STAND WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY. WE DELIVERED. WE DID NOT DO IT TO HELP WITH THE INVESTORS OR PAD BONUS CHECKS. WE DID IT TO SAVE AN ICONIC AMERICAN INDUSTRY. A TESTAMENT TO THE SKILLS AND INGENUITY OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND THE JOBS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS, THE LIFEBLOOD OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND USED TO BE, IN MY STATE OF DELAWARE. WHEN DETROIT DECLARED BANKRUPTCY I WAS WORKING ALONGSIDE CITY LEADERS TO GET THE LIGHTS TURNED BACK ON. TO REVITALIZE THE FUTURE OF DETROIT. WHILE NEARLY 20,000 AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST UNDER TRUMP NEARLY 80,000 WERE CREATED DURING THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE GOT A LONG HISTORY OF NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, BUT DELIVERING RESULTS FOR MICHIGANDERS. WE NEED TO DO IT AGAIN. WE NEED TO DO THE HARD WORK NOT ONLY TO RECOVER, BUT BUILD THE ECONOMY BACK FOR THE FUTURE ONCE MORE. THAT IS WHY MY BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA IS ALL ABOUT. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE WITH YOU AND THE UNION HALLS ACROSS AMERICA. BACK IN JULY I MADE THE FIRST PLANK OF MY AGENDA TO MODERNIZE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. BY ALL OF YOU AND TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING ADDITIONAL STEPS TO MAKE THIS PLANK STRONGER. FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO OPPOSE A TAX PENALTY ON COMPANIES , I MPOSE A TAX PENALTY ON COMPANIES THAT SEND THEM OFFSHORE JUST TO SELL THEM BACK TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE A BIG CORPORATE STRATEGY, BOOSTING SHAREHOLDER PROFITS, YOUR CEO'S BONUSES BY MOVING JOBS OUT, WELL, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU NOT ONLY PAY FULL U.S. TAXES ON THOSE PROFITS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO GUARANTEE. WE ADD A 10% OFF SHORING PENALTY TAX TO YOUR BILL. NO MORE DEDUCTIONS FOR WRITING OFF EXPENSES FOR THE COST OF SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS WHICH IS A BIG DEAL. THAT COULD BE DONE HERE AT HOME BY QUALIFIED AMERICAN WORKERS. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH AMERICAN BUSINESS, BUT THERE IS A BETTER WAY. MAKE IT IN MICHIGAN. MAKE IT IN AMERICA. INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE WORKERS IN PLACES LIKE WARREN. [APPLAUSE] UAW WORKERS, STEEL WORKERS, YOU'RE THE BEST CRAFTSMAN AND WOMEN IN THE WORLD AND YOU'RE RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE READY TO MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND JUST LIKE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR OFF SHORING THERE WILL BE REWARDS AND INCENTIVES FOR CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS AT HOME. TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING MY NEW AMERICAN MADE IN AMERICA TAX CREDIT. A 10% ADVANCED FULLTEXT CREDIT FOR COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN THE UNITED STATES AND AMERICAN WORKERS TO ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY. IF YOUR COMPANY REVITALIZES CLOSING A FACILITY, LIKE THE TRANSMISSION PLANT THAT CLOSED LAST YEAR, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF 10% OF THE INVESTMENT THAT COMPANY MAKES TO REOPEN. IF YOU RETOOL A MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE BY SHIFTING TO HELP BUILD A NEW FLEET OF CLEAN AMERICAN VEHICLES MADE BY UAW MEMBERS, WE WILL MAKE SURE IT IS MORE THAN AFFORDABLE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A TAX CREDIT. IF YOU REINSTATE JOBS THAT WERE SENT OVERSEAS, INCREASE WAGES FOR MANUFACTURING JOBS, WE WILL MAKE IT EVEN SMARTER FOR YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A TAX CREDIT. YOU KNOW, THESE TWO STEPS ON TOP OF MY PLANS TO CLOSE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE TRUMP LOOPHOLES HE CREATED WITH HIS TAX CUT, TO REWARD COMPANIES, BIG TAX BREAKS FOR OFF SHORING WILL END. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO BUILD THINGS IN THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, IT IS GOING TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE TO BUY AMERICAN. IT HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR A MUSTY CENTURY, BUT WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. THE IDEA IS SIMPLE. TODAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDS ABOUT $600 BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY ON FEDERAL CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TO SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONLY EVER TREATED IT LIKE IT WAS A WEAK SUGGESTION. AGENCIES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN REQUIRE, CAN WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT, AND TRUMP DOES NOT BOTHER TO KICK BACK ON THAT. I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. IN MY FIRST WEEK I WILL SIGN A SERIES OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE ENFORCE BUY AMERICA AND DIRECT THE FULL PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIFFICULT ITS PROMISE STARTING BY CLOSING THOSE LOOPHOLES IMMEDIATELY. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU I WILL USE THE FULL POWER OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO ENFORCE BUY AMERICAN AND TITAN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. RHODES, BRIDGES, CANALS, AIRPORTS. [APPLAUSE] I AM GOING TO CRACKDOWN ON COMPANIES THAT LABEL PRODUCTS AS ""MADE IN AMERICA"" EVEN IF THEY ARE COMING FROM CHINA OR ELSEWHERE. WE FOUND OUT ON TRUMP'S WATCH A COMPANY SELLING DEPLOYMENT BAGS TO ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS BEING DEPLOYED FALSELY CLAIMED THE PRODUCT WAS MADE IN AMERICA WHEN IN FACT IT WAS MADE MOSTLY IN CHINA. TRUMP DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO RESPOND. I AM NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN OFFICE AT THE WHITE HOUSE DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS PLAYING BY THE SAME MADE IN AMERICA RULES. ONE MORE THING. WHEN I SAY WE ARE GOING TO USE THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REINVIGORATE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING, I MEAN IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT WITH THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AS WELL. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. WE ARE GOING TO CONVERT THOSE GOVERNMENT VEHICLES INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES, MADE IN AMERICA, SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED DEMAND TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE SUGGESTING THEIR STRUGGLING TO COMPETE. THE UNITED STATES AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY WILL SET UP EXPANDING CAPACITY TO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, TO LEAD THE WORLD IN CLEAN ENERGY VEHICLES. I CANNOT WAIT TO GET UPSET BEHIND THAT. ALL ELECTRIC CORVETTE THAT GOES 210 MILES PER HOUR. YOU THINK I AM GETTING. I MEANAM KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] DO NOT TELL ME WE DO NOT MAKE THE BEST CARS RIGHT HERE IN THE NIGHT STATES. UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON ALL THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NETWORK OF 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA, PROVIDING AN PREVAILING WITH JOBS FOR OTHER CRAFTSMAN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BY OFFERING REBATES AND INCENTIVES TO SWAP OLDER, FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR CLEAN AMERICAN-MADE MODELS, SITTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN , LISTEN TO ME NOW , ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN REVITALIZE OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE AS THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. THINK ABOUT THE WORKERS IN WARREN, WHEN THE TRANSMISSION PLANT CLOSED, AND I'M QUOTING HIM, ""GETTING A GM JOB WAS LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY."" I WAS TRY TO START A FAMILY, I WAS ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE, I WENT TO DISNEY WORLD."" THINK ABOUT THAT. A JOB FELT LIKE WINNING A LOTTERY BECAUSE IT OPENED THE DOOR TO A LIFE THAT HE WANTED FOR YOURSELF BECAUSE IT GIVE YOU DIGNITY, ALLOWED YOU TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY. GETTING A GOOD JOB IN 2020, RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, SHOULD NOT BE A LOTTERY. IT SHOULD BE AN EXPECTATION FOR EVERYONE. I DO NOT ACCEPT THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT THE FORCES OF AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEANS WE CANNOT KEEP GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS AND CREATE MORE. I DO NOT BUY FOR ONE SECOND THE VITALITY OF A MAN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING IS A THING OF THE PAST. WE HAVE THE MOST QUALIFIED WORKERS IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AS YOU HEARD YOUR GRANDFATHER SAY, WAS ARTIFICIAL DEMOCRACY IN WORLD WAR II. GUESS WHAT? IT WILL BE PART OF THE ENGINE OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY NOW AND 2021. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WITH AMERICAN GRIT, AMERICAN DETERMINATION, AND AMERICAN UNION WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] LOOK FOLKS, THAT IS MY PROMISE TO YOU. KEEP IN MIND, YOU KNOW WHEN, BACK IN THE 1930'S, THEY SET UP LAW RELATING TO UNIONS THAT SAID , THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENCOURAGE UNIONS TO INCREASE , [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE TO HAVE THE MOST FRIENDLY UNION PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHEN I AM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOU DO. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. WE CAN COME BACK, COME BACK STRONGER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. I CARRY WITH ME , I GAVE IT TO MY STAFF , BUT I CARRY WITH ME, IN MY POCKET , DO I HAVE THAT AROUND? WHERE IS MY STAFF? I GAVE IT AWAY. ANYWAY, I CARRY A SCHEDULE IN MY POCKET. A LIST EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE NUMBER OF TROOPS LOST IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. THIS IS MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE IS ALWAYS A BLACK BOX. YOU CANNOT REALLY SEE IT. IT SAYS, DAILY U.S. UPDATES. TROOPS DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , 6922. 6922, EVERYONE OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN LEFT BEHIND. AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE RELIED ON. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED , 53,188. U.S. COVID INFECTED IN AMERICA , 763,000. U.S. COVID DEATHS - 176,000. U.S. MILITARY INFECTIONS , 117,000 MILITARY DEATHS , 6114. EVERYONE OF THESE LIVES MATTERS. EVERY ONE OF THESE LIVES LEFT SOMEBODY BEHIND, GRIEVING. YOU CANNOT EVER FORGET THEM. EVER, EVER FORGET THEM. I THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) BIDEN'S RECORD IS A SHAMEFUL ROLL CALL OF THE CATASTROPHIC BETRAYALS AND BLUNDERS IN OUR LIFETIME. [APPLAUSE] HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER ON THE WRONG OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS FAILED IN HIS MOST BASIC DUTY TO THE NATION. HE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT US. HE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICA AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE. THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN IS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29 AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN.

HE SPOKE TODAY AT THE DELAWARE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN WILMINGTON FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. AS A NATION, WE FACE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY IN MY VIEW. FOUR HISTORIC CRISES ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THE WORST PANDEMIC IN 100 YEARS, THAT'S ALREADY KILLED NEARLY 200,000 PEOPLE AND COUNTING. THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION THAT'S COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICAN JOBS AND COUNTING. EMBOLDENED WHITE SUPREMACY UNSEEN SINCE THE 1960'S AND A RECKONING ON RACE THAT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND UNDENIABLE ACCELERATION OF THE PUNISHING REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR PLANET AND OUR PEOPLE, ON THE LIVES AN LIVELIHOODS WHICH I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT NOW. JILL AND I CONTINUE, AS I SUSPECT ALL OF YOU DO, TO PRAY FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON AS THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES RAGE ON JUST AS WE HOLD THEM IN OUR HEARTS, THOSE WHO HAVE FACED THE HURRICANES, TROPICAL STORMS, OFF OUR COAST OF FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, OR LIKE PARTS OF NEW ORLEANS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN ISSUED AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION ORDERED FOR HURRICANE SALLY. FLOODS AN DROUGHTS ACROSS THE MIDWEST, THE FURY OF CLIMATE CHANGE EVERYWHERE, ALL THIS YEAR AND RIGHT NOW. WE STAND WITH OUR FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING TO FIREFIGHTERS, THE FIRST RESPONDERS, RISKING EVERYTHING TO SAVE OTHERS. AND THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CAUTION BETWEEN RELOCATING DURING A PANDEMIC OR STAYING PUT AS ASHES AND SMOKE POLLUTE THE AIR THEY BREATHE. THINK ABOUT THAT THESE ARE NOT JUST WORRIED ABOUT RAGING FIRES. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE AIR THEY BREATHE, ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO THEIR LUNGS. PARENTS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT COVID-19 FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE INDOORS AND NOW THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT ASTHMA ATTACKS IF THEIR KIDS ARE OUTSIDE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE TOTAL DAMAGE FROM WILDFIRES HAS REACHED NEARLY $50 BILLION IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. $50 BILLION. THIS YEAR ALONE, NEARLY FIVE MILLION ACRES HAVE BURN AID CROSS 10 STATES. MORE ACREAGE THAN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. IT'S ONLY SEPTEMBER. CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE SEASON TYPICALLY RUNS THROUGH OCTOBER. FIRES ARE BLAZING SO BRIGHTLY, SMOKE REACHING SO FAR, NASA SATELLITES CAN SEE THEM ONE MILLION MILES AWAY IN SPACE. THE COST OF THIS YEAR'S DAMAGE WILL AGAIN BE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH. BUT THINK OF IT FROM THE VIEW ON THE GROUND. IN THE SMOLDERING ASHES. LOVED ONES LOST ALONG WITH THE PHOTO, THE KEEPSAKE, THE MEMORIES. SPOUSES AND KIDS PRAYING EACH NIGHT FOR THEIR FIREFIGHTER HUSBAND, FATHER, WIFE, MOTHER. WILL THEY COME HOME? ENTIRE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED. WE HAVE TO ACT AS A NATION. IT SHOULDN'T BE SO BAD. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF AN ORANGE SKY AND ARE LEFT ASKING, IS DOOMSDAY HERE? I KNOW , I KNOW THIS FEELING OF DREAD AND ANXIETY EXTENDS WELL BEYOND THE FIRES. WE'RE SEEING RECORD HURRICANE SEASONS. COSTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WELL. LAST MONTH, HURRICANE LAURA INTENSIFIED AT A NEAR RECORD RATE. JUST BEFORE ITS LANDFALL ALONG THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST. IT'S A TROUBLING MARKER. NOT FOR JUST THE INCREASED FREQUENT STHOIF HURRICANE, BUT MORE POWERFUL AND DESTRUCKIVE STORM. THEY'RE CAUSING RECORD DAMAGE AFTER RECORD DAMAGE TO PEOPLE'S HOMES, LIVES, AND LIVELIHOODS. BEFORE IT INTENSIFIES , INTENSIFIED AND HIT THE GULF COAST, LAURA RAVEPBLED PUERTO RICO WHERE THREE YEARS AGO HURRICANE MARIA, OUR FELLLOW AMERICANS THERE ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM ITS DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION. THINK ABOUT THAT REALITY. OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE STILL PUTTING THINGS BACK TOGETHER FROM THE LAST BIG STORM AS THEY FACE THE NEXT ONE. WE'VE SEEN HISTORIC FLOODING IN THE MIDWEST, OFTEN COMPOUNDING THE DAMAGE DELIVERED BY LAST YEAR'S FLOODS THAT COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE. MANY OF YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE MIDWEST WITH ME ON THAT BUS TOUR AND YOU SAW IT. THIS PAST SPRING IN MIDLAND, MICHIGAN, EXPERIENCED A FLOOD SO DEVASTATING, WITH DEADLY FLASH FLOODING, OVERRUNNING DAMS AN ROADWAYS, THAT IT DISPLACED 10,000 RESIDENTS. IT WAS CONSIDERED ONCE IN A 500-YEAR WEATHER EVENT. BUT THOSE ONCE IN MANY GENERATION EVENTS, THEY'RE NOW HAPPENING EVERY YEAR. THE PAST 10 YEARS WERE THE HOTTEST DECADE EVER RECORDED. THE ARCTIC IS LITERALLY MELTING. PARTS ARE ACTUALLY ON FIRE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN AMERICA IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS CONNECTED TO ALL OF. THIS WITH EVERY BOUT OF NATURE'S FURY CREATED BY OUR OWN INACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, MORE AMERICANS SEE AND FEEL THE DEVASTATION. WHETHER IN A BIG CITY, SMALL TOWNS, ON COASTLINES OR FARMLANDS. IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE. IT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND IT AFFECTS US ALL. NEARLY 200 CITIES, NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC CITIES, 200 CITIES ARE EXPERIENCING THE LONGEST STRETCHES OF DEADLY HEAT WAVES IN 50 YEARS. IT REQUIRES THEM TO HELP THEIR POOR AND ELDERLY RESIDENTS ADAPT TO THE EXTREME HEAT TO SIMPLY STAY ALIVE. ESPECIALLY IN THE HOMES WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONINGING, WHICH MANY DON'T HAVE. OUR FAMILY FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST ARE FACING HISTORIC DROUGHT. THOSE FOLLOW RECORD FLOODS AND HURRICANES. SPED BY WINDSTORMS. ALL THIS YEAR. THE SPEED OF THOSE WIND STORMS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE, WHEN YOU SAW IT ON TELEVISION OR SAW IT IN PERSON. IT'S RAVAGED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF CORN, SOYBEAN AND OTHER CROPS. THEY'RE VERY LIVELIHOODS THAT SUSTAIN THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR ECONOMY FOR GENERATIONS IS NOW IN JEOPARDY. HOW THEY PAY THEIR BILLS THIS YEAR? WHAT WILL BE LEFT TO PASS ON TO THEIR KIDS? AND NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING IN A VACUUM. A RECENT STUDY SHOWED AIR POLLUTION IS LINKED WITH INCREASED RISK OF DEATH FROM COVID-19. OUR ECONOMY CAN'T RECOVER IF IT CAN'T BUILD BACK. WITH MORE RESILIENCY, MORE ABILITY TO WITH STAND EXTREME WEATHER. EXTREME WEATHER THAT WILL ONLY COME WITH GREATER FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY. THE UNRELENTING IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ONE OF US. BUT TOO OFTEN THE BRUNT FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, EXACERBATING THE NEED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. SORRY, THAT WAS A BUG. SPEAKING OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INTERLOCKING CRISES OF OUR TIME REQUIRES ACTION, NOT DENIAL. REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. NOT SCAPEGOATING. IT REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO MEET THE THRESHOLD DUTY OF THE OFFICE TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. TO DEFEND US FROM EVERY ATTACK, SEEN AND UNSEEN. ALWAYS AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. HURRICANES DON'T SWERVE TO AVOID RED STATES OR BLUE STATES. WILDFIRES DON'T SKIP TOWNS THAT VOTED A CERTAIN WAY. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE DON'T PICK AND CHOOSE. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARTISAN PHENOMENON. IT'S SCIENCE. AND OUR RESPONSE SHOULD BE THE SAME, GROUNDED IN SCIENCE. ACTING TOGETHER, ALL OF US. BUT LIKE WITH OUR FEDERAL RESPONSE TO COVID-19, THE LACK OF A NATIONAL STRATEGY ON CLIMATE, ON CLIMATE CHANGE OVERALL, LEAVES US WITH A PATCHWORK OF SOLUTIONS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE CHANGES THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. I'M SPEAKING FROM DELAWARE. WE'RE THE LOWEST LYING STATE IN THE NATION REL TOIVE SEA LEVEL. WE'RE JUST , RELATIVE TO SEA LEVEL. WHERE JUST LAST WEEK DELAWARE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUED 31, 31 BIG FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES. ALLEGING THAT THEY KNOWINGLY WREAKED HAVOC AND DAMAGE ON CLIMATE. OUR CLIMATE. DAMAGE THAT IS PLAIN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE BUT THE PRESIDENT. AS HE FLIES TO CALIFORNIA TODAY , WE KNOW HE HAS NO INTEREST IN MEETING THIS MOMENT. WE KNOW HE WON'T LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS OR TREAT THIS DISASTER WITH THE URGENCY IT DEMANDS. AS ANY PRESIDENT SHOULD DO DURING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. HE'S ALREADY SAID HE WANTED TO WITHHOLD AID TO CALIFORNIA, TO PUNISH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. THIS IS ANOTHER CRISIS, ANOTHER CRISIS HE WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR. THE WEST IS LITERALLY ON FIRE AND HE BLAMES THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES ARE BURNING. HE SAYS, QUOTE, YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FLOORS, YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FORESTS. THIS IS THE SAME PRESIDENT WHO THREW PAPER TOWELS ON THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO INSTEAD OF TRULY HELPING THEM RECOVER AND REBUILD. WE KNOW HIS DI DISDAIN FOR OUR OWN MILITARY LEADERS AND OUR VETERANS. JUST LAST YEAR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A DIRECT THREAT TO MORE THAN 2/3 OF THE MILITARY'S OPERATIONALLY CRITICAL INSTALLATIONS. THAT'S WHAT THE MILITARY WARNED HIM. AND THIS COULD WELL BE , THIS WELL COULD BE A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. DONALD TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIAL MAY NOT HAVE CAUSED THESE FIRES AND RECORD FLOODS AND RECORD HURRICANES, BUT IF HE GETS A SECOND TERM, THESE HELLISH EVENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE COMMON, MORE DEVASTATING AND MORE DEADLY. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP WARNS THAT INTEGRATION IS THREATENING OUR SUBURBS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY THREATENING OUR SUBURBS? WILDFIRES ARE BURNING THE SUBURBS OF THE WEST. FLOODS ARE WIPING OUT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE MIDWEST. HURRICANES ARE IMPERILING SUBURBAN LIFE ALONG OUR COAST. IF WE HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS OF TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIAL, HOW MANY SUBURBS WILL BE BURNED AND WILDFIRES , IN WILDFIRES? HOW MANY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS WILL HAVE BEEN FLOODED OUT? HOW MANY SUBURBS WILL HAVE BEEN BLOWN AWAY IN SUPERSTORMS? IF YOU GIVE A CLIMATE ARSONIST FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE BE SURPRISED IF WE HAVE MORE AMERICA ABLAZE? IF YOU GIVE A CLIMATE DENIER FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE BE SURPRISED WHEN MORE OF AMERICA IS UNDERWATER? WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RESPECTS SCIENCE. WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE DAMAGE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE. UNLESS WE TAKE URGENT ACTION, WE'LL SEE , IT WILL SOON BE MORE CATASTROPHIC. A PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES, UNDERSTANDS AND CARES THAT AMERICANS ARE DYING, WHICH MAKES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIALISM, HIS DISDAIN FOR SCIENCE AND FACTS, ALL THE MORE UNCONSCIONABLE. ONCE AGAIN, HE FAILS THE MOST BASIC DUTY TO A NATION. HE FAILS TO PROTECT US FROM THE PANDEMIC, FROM AN ECONOMIC FREEFALL, FROM RACIAL UNREST, FROM THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT SAFE IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. HE'S IN CHARGE. WHAT HE DOESN'T GET IS THAT EVEN IN A CRISIS, THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE STAND UP AND ACT TOGETHER. AND WHILE SO MANY OF YOU ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, WE CAN AND WE WILL MEET THIS MOMENT WITH URGENCY AND PURPOSE. WE CAN AND WE WILL SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND WE'LL BUILD BACK BETTER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. YOU KNOW, WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, HE THINKS HOAX. WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT, I THINK JOBS. GOOD PAYING UNIONS THAT PUT AMERICANS TO WORK, BUILDING A STRONGER, MORE CLIMATE-RESILIENT NATION. A NATION MODERNIZED, WE HAVE MODERNIZED WATER AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. AN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITH STAND THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME WEATHER AND CHANGING CLIMATE. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY, HE SEES WIND MILLS SOMEHOW AS CAUSING CANCER . I SEE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AMERICAN WORKERS RACING TO LEAD THE GLOBAL MARKET. I SEE FARMERS MAKING AGRICULTURE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS. AND IN THE PROCESS, GAINING NEW SOURCES OF INCOME. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT L.E.D. LIGHT BULBS, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE THEM BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE NO GOOD. THEY ALWAYS MAKE HIM LOOK ORANGE. I SEE SMALL BUSINESSES AND MASTER ELECTRICIANS DESIGNING AND INSTALLING AWARD-WINNING ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES, REBUILDING BUILDINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS GOING TO REDUCE ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION AND SAVE BUSINESSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN ENERGY COSTS. WHILE HE TURNS AGAINST OUR ALLIES, I'LL BRING US BACK INTO THE PARIS AGREEMENT. I'LL PUT US BACK INTO THE BUSINESS OF LEADING THE WORLD ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I'LL CHALLENGE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY TO UP THE ANTE ON CLIMATE COMMITMENTS. WHERE HE REVERSES THE OBAMA-BIDEN FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, HE PICKS BIG OIL. HE PICKS BIG OIL COMPANIES OVER AMERICAN WORKERS. EVEN WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AGREED. AND NOT ONLY BRINGS , I'LL NOT ONLY BRING THE STANDARDS BACK, I'LL SET NEW AMBITIOUS ONES THAT OUR WORKERS ARE READY TO MEET. I'LL ALSO SEE AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AND INSTALLING 500,000 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ALONG OUR NEWLY ENGAGED INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS AND HIGHWAYS. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I SEE AMERICAN CONSUMERS SWITCHING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THROUGH REBATES AND INITIATIVES. NOT ONLY THAT, THE UNITED STATES OWNS ONE OF THE , AND MAINTAINS ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. AND WE'RE GOING TO HARNESS THE PURCHASING POWER OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BUYING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE MADE AND SOURCED BY UNION WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN MORE THAN A MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL DO ANOTHER BIG THING. IT WILL PUT US ON A PATH TO ACHIEVING A CARBON POLLUTION-FREE ELECTRIC SECTOR, ELECTRICITY SECTOR, BY 2035. THAT NO FUTURE PRESIDENT CAN COME ALONG AND TURN BACK. TRANSFORMING THE ELECTRICAL SECTOR POWER TO PRODUCE POWER WITHOUT CARBON POLLUTION. IT WILL BE THE GREATEST SPUR TO JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY. NOT TO MENTION THE POSITIVE BENEFITS TO OUR HEALTH AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED TO GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY. WE'LL NEED SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL LABS AND LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES TO START BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, TO IMPROVE AND INNOVATE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO GENERATE , STORE AND TRANSMIT THIS CLEAN ELECTRIC. WE NEED ENGINEERS TO DESIGN AND WORKERS TO MANUFACTURE THESE NEW PRODUCTS. WE'LL NEED IRON WORKERS AND WELDERS TO INSTALL THEM. WE'LL NEED TO BECOME THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES, CREATING EVEN MORE JOBS, SOURCED IN AMERICA. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RESCUED THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND HELPED THEM RETOOL. WE MADE SO LEA , SOLAR ENERGY COST-COMPETITIVE WITH TRADITIONAL ENERGY. AND WEATHERIZED MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES, WHICH IS JUST THE BEGINNING IF WE GET RE-ELECTED. AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN. BIGGER AND FASTER AND BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE'LL ALSO BUILD 1.5 MILLION NEW ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES THREE TIMES OVER, BEELIMINATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, BY INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND BY REDUCING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP LINKED TO HOME OWNERSHIP. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS WELLS THAT OIL COMPANIES AND GAS COMPANIES HAVE ABANDONED. MANY OF WHICH ARE LEAKING TOXINS. WE CREATE 250,000 JOBS NOW BY JUST PLUGGING THOSE WELLS RIGHT AWAY. GOOD UNION JOBS FOR ENERGY WORKERS. THIS WILL HELP SUSTAIN COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT THEM FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AS WELL. WE'LL ALSO CREATE NEW MARKETS FOR OUR FAMILY FARMERS AND RANCHERS. WE'LL LAUNCH A NEW MODERN CIVILIAN CLIMATE CORPS TO HEAL OUR PUBLIC LANDS AND MAKE USE OF US LESS VULNERABLE, MAKE US MUCH LESS VUBBLENERBLE TO WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. I BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND DRINK CLEAN WATER. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T FULFILLED THAT RIGHT YET. THAT'S TRUE OF THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH THE SMOKE CREATED DEVASTATION OF THE WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW. BUT IT ALSO HAS BEEN TRUE FOR A GENERATION OR MORE IN PLACES LIKE CANCER ALLEY IN LOUISIANA, OR RIGHT HERE IN DELAWARE ALONG THE ROUTE 9 CORRIDOR. RIGHT HERE IN DELAWARE. FULFILLING THIS BASIC OBLIGATION TO ALL AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME, WHITE, BLACK, BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHO TOO OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE CLEAN AIR AND THE CLEAN WATER. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT IT'S NECESSARY. I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING IT DONE. THESE AREN'T PIE IN THE SKY DREAMS. THESE ARE CONCRETE ACTIONABLE PROBLEMS THAT CREATE AMERICAN JOBS, MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUT OUR NATION ON THE ROAD TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY NO LITTER THAN 2050 , LATER THAN 2050. YOU KNOW, SOME SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX THIS. BUT HERE'S THE THING. LOOK AROUND AT THE CRUSHING CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN PAYING FOR IT. SO HAVE A CHONS. WE CAN INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE US STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF AMERICANS AND CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TACKLING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. OR WE CAN CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH DONALD TRUMP HAS US ON, A PATH OF INDIFFERENCE, COSTING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REBUILD, WHEN THE HUMAN COST, THE LIVES AND THE LIVELIHOODS AND THE HOMES AND THE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED ARE IMMEASURABLE. WE HAVE A CHOICE. WE CAN COMMIT TO DOING THIS TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE OUR FUTURE AND A , , AS A COUNTRY FOR OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OUR GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN, OR WE CAN DO IT DONALD TRUMP'S WAY. IGNORE THE FACTS, DENY REALITY, WHICH AMOUNTS TO A FULL SURRENDER AND A FAILURE TO LEAD . IT'S BACKWARD LOOKING POLITICS. THAT'S GOING TO HARM THE ENVIRONMENT, MAKE COMMUNITIES LESS HEALTHY, AND HOLD BACK ECONOMIC PROGRESS WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES RACE AHEAD. IT'S A MINDSET THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMPETE, TO INNOVATE AND TO WIN. LIKE THE PANDEMIC, DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL CRISIS. THAT REQUIRES AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. IT REQUIRES A PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. SO AS THE FIRES RAGE OUT WEST ON THIS DAY, OUR PRAYERS REMAIN WITH EVERYONE UNDER THE ASH. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE THE SUNRISE BELIEVING TODAY WILL BE A BETTER DAY THAN YESTERDAY. AMERICANS FACE THIS HISTORIC INFLEXION POINT. IN A TIME OF REAL PERIL, BUT ALSO A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY POSSIBILITIES. I'M CONFIDENT, I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. WE WILL DO THIS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE'VE SEEN THE LIGHT THROUGH THE DARK SMOKE. WE NEVER GAVE UP. ALWAYS WITHOUT EXCEPTION EVERY TIME WE SUCCEED WHEN WE TRY. MAY GOD BLESS OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND KEEP THEM SAFE AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH , TROOPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MR.

MR. BIDEN TALKS ABOUT PARTS OF HIS PLATFORM WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE POOR AND HIS OWN EXPERIENCES WITH POVERTY AS A CHILD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. I UNDERSTAND YOU SPOKE, I COULD NOT HEAR YOU. BISHOP, THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. REVEREND HARRIS, REVEREND JACKSON, I AM HUMBLED TO BE WITH YOU. MY DAUGHTER, WHO IS A FULL-TIME SOCIAL WORKER, IS PART OF YOUR EFFORT. SHE IS VISITING A REAL SICK FRIEND WHO HAD A KIDNEY REPLACEMENT. HER NAME IS ASHLEY AND, REVERENT, SHE IS ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU. TOGETHER, WE CAN CARRY ON DR. KING'S POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN, BASED ON A SIMPLE TRUTH THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY A JOBS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS OK. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE WALK MY FATHER HAD TO MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS. HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON, SYLVANIA, YEARS AGO. HE SAID, YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH YOUR GRANDPA. I WILL COME BACK EVERY WEEKEND. IT IS 157 MILES. I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS GOING DOWN AND ASKING MY GRANDFATHER, CAN WE ALL STAY THERE? INCLUDING MY MOM. WHAT A DIFFICULT THING THAT MUST HAVE BEEN. WE GOT OUT OF IT. WE LIVED IN WHAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF NOW SECTION EIGHT HOUSING FOR A WHILE. IT TOOK FIVE YEARS, MY DAD FINALLY GOT US THROUGH. THE POINT IS, ANYONE WHO HAS FELT A TASTE OF THIS LACK OF RESPECT, LACK OF OPPORTUNITY, BEING POOR UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WE HAVE DISCUSSED HOW THAT MORAL TRUTH AND ABATES THE FOUNTAIN , MORAL TRUTH ANIMATES THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS. THE FOUNDING COVENANTS IS YOUR PHRASE. WE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE WORK LEFT UNDONE TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF HOW OFTEN OUR POLITICS DOES NOT SPEAK ENOUGH TO THE 140 MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN POVERTY, STRUGGLING PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH, SCARED TO DEATH. I CAN NOVEMBER MY DAD SAYING, WHAT , I CAN REMEMBER MY DAD SAYING, WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET SICK? LAST YEAR, AND DURING HOLY WEEK THIS PAST APRIL, I PROMISED WE WOULD NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ALL OF YOU REMIND ME HOW SCRIPTURE DESCRIBES CALLING TO SERVE, NOT TO BE SERVED. CALLING TOWARD JUSTICE, HEALING, HOPE. NOT HATE. TO SPEAK THE GOOD NEWS AND FOLLOW BY SOME GOOD DEEDS. NOT JUST ENOUGH TO SPEAK THE GOOD NEWS. HERE WE ARE WITH A NATION IN THE WILDERNESS. A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT HAS KILLED NEARLY 200,000 OF OUR LOVED ONES, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, INNOCENT SOULS, MOSTLY IN THE POOR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE NO PLACE TO HIDE. THAT NUMBER IS GROWING. AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT PUTS TENS OF MILLIONS OF YOU OUT OF WORK. FACING EVICTION. LIVING ON THE EDGE. MAKING SURE YOU ARE HAVING A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. RIPPING THE BLINDERS OFF SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND SO MANY OF YOU THE ABILITY TO REACH GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THEY EXISTED LONG BEFORE THINGS GOT MUCH WORSE. THOSE AT THE TOP SEE THINGS GOING UP, BUT THOSE IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW SEE THINGS GETTING WORSE. WE HAVE LEADERS WHO BEAR FALSE WITNESS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF THE STOCK COULD SOURCE, IF FAMILY , THE STOCK MARKET SOARS? IF FAMILIES TEETER ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. LINING UP JUST TO GET SOME BREAD, MILK, FOOD. THOSE IN POWER SAY, CUT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SO THOSE THAT CANNOT FIND WORK, EVEN PROPOSING TO CUT THE SNAP PROGRAM. TO FUND SOCIAL SECURITY. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO DO IT SAFELY. IS ESTIMATED TO COST $20 MILLION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SANITARY CONDITIONS, SMALLER CLASSES, MORE TEACHERS, PEOPLE WITH MASKS. THOSE IN POWER WANT TO SOW DIVISION AMONG US. THEY SAY WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT, WE DON'T WANT THE SAME THINGS. BUT WE DO. MY DAD USED TO SAY, I AM LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS BUT I EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT. JOBS, HEALTH, GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR KIDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS OUT THERE WANT TO SEPARATE US BY RACE, BY NEIGHBORHOOD, BY FAITH, TO FORGET HOW STRONG WE ARE WHEN WE TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN'T DO. IF I AM PRESIDENT, THAT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE BENEFIT WHEN WE HELP ONE ANOTHER. ENDING POVERTY WILL NOT JUST BE AN ASPIRATION, IT WILL BE A CHANGE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS EVERYONE. WE CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. WE PROTECT THE PLANET, WHICH IS THE VICTIM OF GLOBAL WARMING SO WE CAN LIVE ON. WE BUILD A COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T JUST SURVIVE BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO THRIVE AND GROW. IT STARTS BY CONTAINING THE VIRUS, PROVIDING ALL THE PPE, SAFETY MEASURES, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING AND TRACING, PREPARING FOR A VACCINE THAT IS FREE AND ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID ARE PAID FOR FREE. DELIVERING REAL ECONOMIC RELIEF TO THOSE WHO NEEDED MOST. RENTALS, FOOD, UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE. THOSE IN THE GIG ECONOMY WANTED TO DO UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE. HAVING THIS HORRENDOUS DEBT OF STUDENT LOANS. SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT IDEAS IF THEY HAVE A CHANCE. PAID THE SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS SO FIRST RESPONDERS CAN STAY ON THE JOB. BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT EASES THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF YOUR FAMILY THAT FEELS THE SQUEEZE OF RAISING KIDS AND CARING FOR AN AGING LOVED ONE. I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOOK AT YOUR KID AND KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GET THEM THE RIGHT MY DAD WOULD SAY, IN A MONTH, WE WOULD HAVE PAYDAY. THEN CARDBOARD IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE. IT IS ABOUT PRIDE IN DIGNITY. A MINIMUM $15 MINIMUM WAGE. PAID SICK LEAVE FOR EVERYBODY. HEALTH CARE IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING LESS SICK, IS TO HELP YOU STAY HEALTHY. EDUCATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN INCOME, DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A TAX BASE, MAKE SURE WE TRIPLE THE TITLE I FUNDING. IT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, SCHOOL NURSES, SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS TO HELP THESE KIDS. PROVIDING PRESCHOOL FREE. 3, 4, AND FIVE-YEAR-OLDS GOING TO SCHOOL. EVERY STUDY SHOWS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND, NO MATTER THE ZIP CODE, IF A KID GETS TO GO TO SCHOOL AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 58% BETTER CHANCE THAN MAKING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NOT SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME FOR CHILD CARE UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD AND MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, MY TWO SONS ALMOST DIED IN THAT ACCIDENT. THEY WERE THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. I HAD A GREAT JOB, I WAS A SENATOR. GUESS WHAT? I COULDN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE BUT FOR MY SISTER, MY BROTHER, AND MY MOTHER. WHERE THERE IS FREE TUITION, YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THOSE EARLY YEARS. FREE TUITION AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, CREDENTIALED PROGRAMS SO THAT THE DEBT NEVER AGAIN BLOCKS A PATH TO PURSUE A CHOSEN CAREER FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE SO YOU CAN RENT IT, SO NO ONE HAS TO PAY MORE THAN 30% OF YOUR INCOME. AND THERE IS NO HOMELESSNESS. YOU GET HOUSING PERIOD. IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE. SHOULD GIVE FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME. THAT IS HOW MOST MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES MADE IT IN THEIR OWN. GIVE FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS A TAX CREDIT. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND GUN VIOLENCE. END THE SCOURGE OF REDLINING AND HOMELESSNESS. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FAIL TO DO IT. HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT LIFT UP ALL COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE CAN FILL THE POTHOLES IN YOUR STREET, CRITICS YOUR SIDEWALKS, FIX THE STREETLIGHTS, INSTALL BROADBAND. DEMOLISH THE BLIGHTED PROPERTIES AND CREATE SAFE SPACES TO LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY SAFELY. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SO WE CAN TURN THE FAUCET ON AND DRINK THE WATER, BREATHE CLEAN AIR. WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE. FINALLY, IT IS PROTECTING OUR SACRED RIGHT TO VOTE. THE GREAT EQUALIZER IN ORDER AMONG US. THE REASON WHY YOU ALL ARE TOGETHER TONIGHT. HER LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS , OUR LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS, AND HE WAS A FRIEND, SAID FREEDOM IS AN ACT. HE ALWAYS CHANNELED THIS GOSPEL HYMN. I DON'T FEEL NO WAY TIRED. I'VE COME TOO FAR FROM WHERE I STARTED FROM. NOBODY TOLD ME THE ROAD WOULD BE EASY. I DON'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT ME THIS FAR TO LEAVE. ALL OF YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM AND POWER TO ACT, TO VOTE. JUST KEEP THE FAITH, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU I WILL RESTORE THE DIGNITY FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THE POOR. EVERY TIME I WALKED OUT OF MY GRANDPOP'S HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE WOULD SAY JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH. MY GRANDMA WOULD SAY, NO, SPREAD IT. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE SOME DIGNITY. GOD BLESS YOU AND ALL YOU DO, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475783-1/joe-biden-remarks-poor-peoples-campaign	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks to the &ldquo;Moral Monday Mass Assembly&rdquo; virtual event held by the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign.

TUESDAY EVENING, JOE BIDEN SPOKE AT AN HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH EVENT IN KISSIMMEE, FLORIDA, AN AREA AFFECTED BY THE DROP IN LEISURE TRAVEL CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS. ALSO SPEAKING AT THE EVENT, ACTOR EVA LONGORIA AND SINGER RICKY MARTIN. MR. BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA AS IT RELATES TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND HIS ECONOMIC AID PLAN FOR PUERTO RICO. THIS IS 35 MINUTES. (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO. I AM CHAIRWOMAN OF THE OSCEOLA BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, AND I AM SO EXCITED TO WELCOME YOU HERE IN OSCEOLA COUNTY. AS WE PREPARE TO WELCOME THE VICE PRESIDENT TO OSCEOLA COUNTY, I COULDN'T PICK A BETTER AND MORE PERFECT DAY. WE ARE IN THE KICKOFF, AND IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. WE HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY HISPANIC POPULATION WITH 55% OF OUR POPULATION BEING OF HISPANIC ORIGIN WITH THE GREAT MAJORITY BEING PUERTO RICAN. WE ARE A WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE RELOCATING FROM PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY NOW, WE ARE STUCK WITH AN INADEQUATE, INAPT RESPONSE TO HURRICANE MARIA AND OUR COVID-19 PANDEMIC. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY HAS A PLAN FOR PUERTO RICANS, FOR HISPANICS, BUT WILL ALSO BRING THAT LEVEL OF RESPECT AND CARING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WE NEED. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WITH THAT SAID, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE AS THE FIRST HISPANIC WOMAN TO SERVE ON THE OC OLA , OSCEOLA BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THE ONLY PUERTO RICAN WOMAN TO SERVE IN THE HISTORY OF OSCEOLA COUNTY TO INTRODUCE YOU THE FIRST HONORABLE CONGRESSMAN DARREN SOTO. CONGRESSMAN SOTO: GRACIAS. BUENAS NOCHES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WELCOME TO OUR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH CELEBRATION WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. WHAT AN AMAZING WAY TO KICK OFF THIS CELEBRATION OF OUR HERITAGE IN CENTRAL FLORIDA WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THE HISPANIC VOTE IS CRITICAL. WE MUST ELECT JOE BIDEN TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SOLVE THE PANDEMIC, TO RESTORE OUR ECONOMY, AND TO BUILD BACK BETTER. [SPEAKING SPANISH] VOTE FOR BIDEN TO SAVE AMERICA. GRACIAS A TODO. SPANISH] IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW I WISH WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER CELEBRATING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH, BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY. FOR EIGHT MONTHS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS REFUSED TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO AN END, A PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 194,000 FELLOW AMERICANS, INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF LATINOS AND LATINO BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HIS INCOMPETENCE AND CRUELTY COMES AS A SURPRISE FOR AMERICANS, BUT NOT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WE KNEW WHO HE WAS ALL ALONG. AFTER HURRICANE MARIA, WE SAW HOW HE TOSSED PAPER TOWELS FOR A PHOTO OP WHILE ASKING THE CABINET IF HE COULD SELL PUERTO RICO. WE WITNESSED HIS CRUELTY WHEN HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN ICON IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. AS PRESIDENT, HE DEPLOYED ICE TO IMPLEMENT BARBARIC POLICIES. WE ALSO WITNESSED HIS SHAMELESSNESS WHEN ASKING ABOUT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING IN FLORIDA. INSTEAD OF COMFORTING VICTIMS, HE TWEETED , APPRECIATE THE CONGRATS. I'M NOT KIDDING. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. APPRECIATE THE CONGRATS. BUT WE HAVE GOOD NEWS. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL REBUILD AMERICA, A PRESIDENT WE WILL BE PROUD TO CALL OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THAT IS BECAUSE JOE BIDEN IS A MAN OF CHARACTER. HE BELIEVES, HIS FAMILY AND MINE, ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT. HE BELIEVES EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE BORN, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, OR WHO YOU LOVE. JOE BIDEN IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO PROTECT ALL PUERTO RICANS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN FLORIDA. HE IS READY TO WORK FOR US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A PLAN TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM DEBT HOLDING OUR ECONOMY BACK, WHO WILL LISTEN TO US AS WE PROTEST DEMANDING ACTION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHO JOE BIDEN IS. WITH HIM AS A PRESIDENT, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CHAIR AT THE TABLE, BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE WINS. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, ALMOST BEG YOU TO PLEASE GO TO I WILLVOTE.COM AND REGISTER NOW. WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW I LIKE TO HAVE FUN, BUT THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS. THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS WE'VE SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AND PUERTO RICANS HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE IT. WE WILL USE THAT POWER IN NOVEMBER. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT JOE BIDEN GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I BEG YOU, PLEASE. GO TO VOYAVOTAR.COM. MAKE A PLAN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO THE POLLS? WE HAVE TO DO THIS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU. HELLO, FLORIDA. TODAY KICKS OFF THE FIRST DAY OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH, WHICH IS A WAY TO CELEBRATE LATINO CULTURE AND TO RECOGNIZE OUR HERITAGE THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM, OUR CULTURE AND HERITAGE IS ENGRAVED IN AMERICA, YET OUR COMMUNITY IS REMINDED THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT, WHETHER IT IS THE ACCENT ON OUR LAST NAME OR THE ACCENT IN OUR VOICE, WHETHER IT IS THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN , THERE ARE MANY WHO BELIEVE WE DON'T BELONG, AND AS RICKY SAID, THE PRESIDENT'S ON LATINO DIGNITY STARTED ON DAY ONE. WHEN HE CALLED US DRUG DEALERS AND RAPISTS. HE HAS SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS DOUBLING DOWN ON DEMONIZING LATINOS. AT THE BORDER, HE HAS RIPPED KIDS FROM THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS AND HAS LOCKED THEM IN CAGES. I WANT MOTHERS EVERYWHERE TO HEAR THAT. IMAGINE YOUR CHILD BEING SEPARATED FROM YOU AND BEING PUT IN A CAGE THREE FEET AWAY FROM YOU WHERE YOU CANNOT HOLD OR CONSOLE HIM. HE HAS TRIED TO DEPORT DREAMERS, EVEN THE ONES WHO SERVED IN UNIFORM TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR SOLDIERS ARE BEING DEPORTED. HE ABANDONED PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA AND LEFT THE ISLAND IN COMPLETE DEVASTATION. HE EVEN THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD SWAP PUERTO RICO FOR GREENLAND BECAUSE IN HIS WORDS, PUERTO RICO WAS DIRTY, AND THE PEOPLE WERE POOR. HE HAS COMPLETELY FAILED TO RESPOND TO COVID-19, A VIRUS THAT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT LATINOS. LATINOS ARE ONLY 18% OF THE POPULATION, BUT WE MAKE UP OVER 34% OF ESSENTIAL FRONT-LINE WORKERS. 34%. THOSE ARE YOUR HEALTH WORKERS, YOUR DRIVERS, YOUR DELIVERY PEOPLE, YOUR FARMWORKERS WHO ARE PUTTING FOOD ON YOUR TABLE. IT FARMWORKERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE ESSENTIAL. WE DIDN'T NEED A PANDEMIC TO TELL US THAT. TRUMPS STRATEGY IS TO CAST OUT LATINOS AS BEING LESS THAN FULLY AMERICAN. LET ME TELL YOU HOW AMERICAN WE ARE. THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, HISPANICS WILL BE THE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP OF POTENTIAL VOTERS IN THE UNITED STATES. LATINO VOTERS WILL DECIDE THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT IS A SIMPLE FACT. IN FLORIDA, HISPANICS ARE IN EVEN BIGGER PART OF THE POPULATION, 25% COMPARED TO 18% NATIONALLY, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR. INCREASING HISPANIC PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS DOES NOT HELP DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS. IT HELPS AMERICA. THE MEDIA NARRATIVES TRY TO REDUCE HISPANICS TO SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS, IMMIGRATION, BUT GUESS WHAT? OUR COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT A WHOLE LOT MORE. BIDEN OFFERS A VERY STRONG PLATFORM AND RECORD ON THE ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION. UNDER THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, LATINO ON UP LIMIT RATES DECLINED MORE THAN 7% MORE THAN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO GREATER ECONOMIC ENGINE IN THE WORLD THAN THE HARD WORK AND INGENUITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO GET UP EVERY DAY TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN THIS COUNTRY, AND JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LATINOS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENDORSES ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT REWARD WEALTH OVERWORK, CORPORATIONS OVERWORKING FAMILIES. , CORPORATIONS OVER WORKING FAMILIES. BIDEN HAS A PLAN TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE ARE BATTLING FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. MEXICO IS NOT SENDING DRUG DEALERS AND RAPISTS. THEY JUST SENT FIREFIGHTERS TO HELP US FIGHT THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS. PUERTO RICO IS NOT A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. WE SHOULD BE LIFTING THEM UP. IT IS MORE THAN JUST COMING AROUND EVERY FOUR YEARS KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS AND SAYING, YOUR VOTE MATTERS. IT IS ABOUT SHOWING US THAT OUR LIVES MATTER. OUR LIVELIHOODS MATTER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT AFTER ALL THE ATTACKS AND INSULTS, I DON'T JUST WANT DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE, BUT I WANT THE LATINO COMMUNITY TO BE THE DECISIVE GROUP THAT VOTES HIM OUT OF OFFICE. I WANT TO SHOW OUR PRIDE AND OUR STRENGTH AND OUR POWER AS A COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. HE'S A FAMILY MAN, A MAN OF FAITH. THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, HE HAS STOOD WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND HAS SHOWN HE VALUES US FOR THE DIVERSE AND COUNTLESS WAYS WE MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT ALREADY. WE NEED JOE BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE NEEDS OUR HELP TO GET THERE. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT LATINO VOTERS CAN DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, AND THAT STARTS HERE IN FLORIDA. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS. IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THOSE NUMBERS ADD UP TO HIS VICTORY THIS NOVEMBER. HELLO, EVERYONE. WHETHER YOU ARE HERE IN KISSIMMEE OR WATCHING THE LIVESTREAM, I AM SO GRATEFUL YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO SPEND TIME WITH US. I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION FOR THE TWO PLACES THAT MADE ME THE MAN I AM TODAY, MY BEAUTIFUL PUERTO RICO AND FLORIDA. I WAS BORN IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, WHICH IS WHERE I FELL IN LOVE WITH MUSIC, BUT DURING MY EARLY TEENAGE YEARS, MY FAMILY AND I MOVED TO ORLANDO, FLORIDA. I GRADUATED NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE. IN SO MANY WAYS, MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN STORY. WHEN I ARRIVED IN FLORIDA, I COULD BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH. BY THE TIME I LEFT, I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY DREAM PROVES THAT IN THIS COUNTRY, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. DESPITE EVERYTHING WE ARE FACING, I STILL HAVE HOPE. I WOULD BE LYING IF I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PERIODS IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND I AM NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT. I AM TALKING ABOUT UNITY. I AM TALKING ABOUT INCLUSION. I AM TALKING ABOUT ACCEPTANCE. ALL OF THE VALUES WE USE TO CHERISH MOST ARE BEING ABANDONED BY THOSE IN POWER. DURING THIS PERIOD OF SO MUCH HARDSHIP, I'VE SEEN THE BEST OF THIS COUNTRY, EVEN WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO DIVIDE US. ""DESPACITO"" PROVED TO ME THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE WILL NEVER BE DEFINED BY OUR DIFFERENCES, AND NO MATTER WHO IS PRESIDENT, LATINOS AND LATINAS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE HERE. BUT HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD IT BE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CELEBRATES OUR COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING IT? THAT IS JOE BIDEN. HE HAS SPENT HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH RECOGNIZING ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS LATINOS AND LATINAS HAVE MADE TO OUR NATION. HE KNOWS WE ARE NOT A MONOLITH. WE ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS, MILITARY LEADERS, LAWYERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, ESSENTIAL WORKERS, AND GROUND BREAKERS WHO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. JOE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT WHETHER YOU ARE FIRST-GENERATION OR YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE FOUR GENERATIONS, YOU BELONG IN THE UNITED STATES AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE. AS RICKY SAID, JOE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR PUERTO RICO. HE WILL NEVER ABANDON US IN OUR TIME OF NEED, AND WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH OUR LEADERS, HE WILL INVEST IN BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR THE PLACE I WILL ALWAYS CALL HOME. A FUTURE THAT WILL MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR PUERTO RI QUENOS. WHILE I'M CONFIDENT JOE WILL HAVE OUR BACK, HE NEEDS US. THAT MEANS MAKING OUR VOICES HEARD AT THE BALLOT BOX. IF YOU WEREN'T CONVINCED BY EVA AND RICKY, MAYBE YOU WILL BE CONVINCED BY ME. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM. VOYAVOTAR.COM. MAKE A PLAN FOR WHEN AND WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT. NOTHING LESS THAN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER, AND WE CANNOT LEFT OUR FAMILIES DOWN. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I AM HONORED TO PRESENT VICE PRESIDENT AND THE FUTURE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I JUST HAVE ONE THING TO SAY. HANG ON HERE. [PLAYING ""DESPACITO"" ON HIS SMARTPHONE] I TELL YOU WHAT. IF I HAD THE TALENT OF ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE, I WOULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT BY ACCLAMATION. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO, AND HAPPY HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA AND TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE WHAT IS BEST IN OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR DIVERSITY, OUR CULTURE THAT IS SHAPED BY PEOPLE FROM EVERY PART OF THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE RICH HISPANIC HERITAGE THAT IS ALIVE SO MUCH IN OUR NATIONAL STORY. WE HEAR IT IN THE RHYTHMS THAT POUR INTO OUR HEARTS AND MOVE OUR FEET WITH ARTISTS LIKE LUIS AND RICKY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE, MORE THAN BEING HERE, BUT FOR JUMPING IN AND TRYING TO HELP ME WIN THIS ELECTION. IT IS, WHERE I COME FROM, WE CALL THAT A BIG DEAL. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU. WE SEE IT REPRESENTED IN OUR TELEVISION AND MOVIE SCREENS WITH ACTRESSES LIKE EVA LONGORIA . THANK YOU, EVA, FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK YOU DID IN HOSTING THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. YOU HAVE CHANGED POLITICAL CONVENTIONS FOREVER. YOU DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB. YOU'VE BECOME A GREAT FRIEND, AND THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH ME. WE RECOGNIZE IN THE HALLS OF POWER AND CONGRESS, LIKE MY FRIEND REPRESENTATIVE DARREN SOTO WHO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING WITH A FEW MINUTES AGO. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS DISTRICT. WE SEE IT IN THE SCIENTISTS WORKING IN LABS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON VACCINES TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS, TO THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ON THE FRONT LINES WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. IT'S IN THE DIPLOMATS WHO PROUDLY REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND OUR VALUES IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IN OUR MILITARY MEMBERS AND FAMILIES WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH, THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING FOR IT. IT'S IN THE ENGINEERS WHO ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH WILL HELP US GRASP OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, AND THE SKILLED UNION CRAFTSMEN WHO ARE GOING TO BUILD IT. HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH IS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF HOW MUCH STRENGTH WE DRAW AS A NATION FROM OUR IMMIGRANT ROOTS. UNLESS YOU ARE A NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE ENSLAVED AND BROUGHT HERE 400 YEARS AGO, WE HAVE ALL COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. FOR MOST OF US, THAT JOURNEY BEGAN WITH A CHOICE TO TRY FOR SOMETHING BETTER HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER IT'S MY ANCESTORS WHO BOARDED COFFIN SHIPS IN THE IRISH SEA OR FAMILIES WHO FLED OPPRESSIVE REGIMES AND NATURAL DISASTERS IN LATIN AMERICA, THE CARIBBEAN, OR ANY OF THE WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS SEEKING FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY WHO HAVE CONTINUALLY RENEWED OUR STRENGTH AND HAVE GIVEN US THE IMPORTANT CAPACITY TO SPEAK WITH GRIT AND DETERMINATION AND SIMPLY SAY, I CAN DO IT. ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS, YOURS AND MINE, CAME EQUIPPED WITH ONLY ONE THING. THE ONLY THING THEY HAD IN THEIR POCKET WAS HOPE, AND IN SO MANY WAYS, THAT IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US AMERICANS. FOR PEOPLE OF HISPANIC ANCESTRIES, THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS DATE BACK BEFORE OUR FOUNDING. THERE IS NO SEPARATING OUT HISPANIC HERITAGE FROM AMERICAN HERITAGE. THESE STORIES ARE ONE IN THE SAME, GROWING MORE VIBRANTLY ENTWINED EVERY SINGLE DAY. TODAY, IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS COUNTRY DEPENDS ON HISPANICS HAVING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED TO. MY TEAM HERE AND KNOWS THAT 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 KIDS IN SCHOOL TODAY SPEAK SPANISH. THE IDEA WE ARE NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE AND BUILD AND INVEST IN IT, IT'S MIND BLOWING LAY STUPID. IN THE MIDST OF THIS GOD-AWFUL PANDEMIC, WE'VE SEEN IT MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER HOW MUCH WE RELY ON PEOPLE WITH HISPANIC ROOTS TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY RUNNING, AND THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. SO MANY OF OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS ARE HISPANIC. PEOPLE DRIVING DELIVERY TRUCK'S, WORKING IN MEATPACKING PLANTS, STAFFING OUR NURSING HOMES, HOSPITALS, THESE INCLUDE 200,000 DREAMERS WORKING IN THOSE KEY ROLES, MANY OF WHOM ARE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE, AND WE DEPEND ON THEM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS WHAT THEY TRULY ARE, ESSENTIAL. WE DON'T JUST NEED TO THANK THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM AND TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOEY, A JOB IS A ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN JUST A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND BE ABLE TO SAY, HON HE, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES. HOW CAN WE HAVE A STRONG AND THRIVING REPUBLIC IF WE AREN'T DOING MORE TO FULLY DEAL IN HISPANIC UNITIES? THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND OF EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO. THAT IS WHY I HAVE LAID OUT PLANS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TAKE ON THE INEQUITIES THAT HURT HISPANIC COMMUNITIES BY NUMBER ONE, INVESTING IN ECONOMIC MOBILITY, IMPROVING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, RULING OUT RACE-BASED DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE, AND BUILDING ON OBAMA CARE, TAKING ON GUN VIOLENCE THAT PLAGUES OUR COMMUNITIES, AND FINALLY BUILDING AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT TREATS PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND IS TRUE TO AMERICAN VALUES. TODAY, I HAVE RELEASED MY AGENDA FOR PUERTO RICO. EVEN AFTER BEING PRESIDENT FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS, DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T SEEM TO GRASP THAT THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS ALREADY. [APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT IT. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE LEADERSHIP IN GOVERNMENT THAT UNDERSTANDS IN AMERICA, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THE IDEA OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. PERIOD. WE ARE ALL DESERVING. I AM RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF ALL AMERICA, INCLUDING 3 MILLION CITIZENS LIVING IN PUERTO RICO. I AM NOT GOING TO STEAL THE MONEY DESPERATELY NEEDED TO RECONSTRUCT THE ISLAND IN ORDER TO BUILD A WALL ALONG THE BORDER THAT DOES NOTHING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. I AM NOT GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE SELL OR TRADE PUERTO RICO. I AM NOT GOING TO THROW PAPER TOWELS AT PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAD JUST BEEN DEVASTATED BY A HURRICANE. THE WORLD SAW THAT. IT WAS MORTIFYING. I AM NOT GOING TO DENY THE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT TELLS US HURRICANES ARE DEVASTATING WEATHER EVENTS THAT WILL ONLY GROW MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION, AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THE PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY SAID TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHEN HE ALLEGEDLY SAID, I GOT IT. THE WAY TO KEEP THESE HURRICANES FROM COMING ON BOARD IS TO NUKE THEM. WOAH. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO LEAD. I'M GOING TO RESPECT AND SUPPORT THE ISLAND'S FULL RECOVERY, INCLUDING INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND SUPPORT FOR FAMILY, PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THE UNSUSTAINABLE DEBT ON THE ISLAND, AND EXPAND ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. I AM GOING TO WORK WITH REPRESENTATIVES WHO SUPPORT EACH OF THE STATUS OPTIONS FOR PUERTO RICO TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN STATUS. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE STATEHOOD TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ENSURE PUERTO RICANS HAVE PEOPLE REPRESENTATION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, BUT THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO MUST DECIDE. THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST DECIDE AND ACT ON THAT DECISION. THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE BACK OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WHEN THEY GET KNOCKED DOWN. I HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE, TOO. MY DAD WOULD SAY, EVERY TIME YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, GET UP, JOEY. WE ARE GOING TO HONOR THE INCREDIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND SERVICE OF PUERTO RICANS, PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE HISPANIC DIASPORA, TO THIS COUNTRY, NOT ONLY THE NAMES WE KNOW AND LIKE, LIKE LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA WHO WAS HELPING ME OUT, BUT REMEMBER THE STORIES THAT DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE HEADLINES, LIKE PUERTO RICO'S 65TH INFANTRY REGIMENT WHO GENERAL MACARTHUR DESCRIBED AS ""WRITING A BRILLIANT RECORD OF HERE IS HIM IN BATTLE"" DURING THE KOREAN WAR. WE WILL WORK TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ITS PROTECTIONS SO MORE HISPANIC PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, 4 MILLION HISPANIC AMERICANS GAINED COVERAGE, THE LARGEST GAIN OF ANY GROUP. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL TRYING TO RIP OBAMACARE AWAY FROM PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A CENTURY. THAT IS ON TOP OF THE TOTAL FAILURE TO MANAGE COVID-19, WHICH HAS NOW STOLEN THE LIVES OF ALMOST 200,000 PEOPLE IN AMERICA WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE SHARE OF THOSE DEATHS IN HISPANIC COMMUNITIES, OVER 25,000 DEATHS. THIS ON TOP OF THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS, WHICH HAVE FALLEN MORE HEAVILY ON HISPANIC POCKETBOOKS. MORE THAN 25% OF HISPANICS IN FLORIDA HAVE REPORTED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE. A STUDY FOUND THAT ONE IN THREE HISPANIC SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE TAKEN A HIT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WITH MANY MORE LIKELY TO CLOSE AND CLOSE PERMANENTLY. THAT IS ON TOP OF HIS FAILURE AND IN FACT COMPLETE DISINTEREST IN ADDRESSING THE RACIAL INJUSTICE CRISIS IN AMERICA. HE DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. HE FANS THE FLAMES OF HATRED AND DIVISION IN OUR COUNTRY FOR HIS OWN GAIN. THAT IS ON TOP OF HIS FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IN CALIFORNIA, HE SAID SITTING WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS, I DON'T THINK SCIENCE KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID, AT A TIME WHEN WILDFIRES ARE RACING ACROSS THE WEST AND DESTROYING HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND ANOTHER HURRICANE THREATENS OUR COAST. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS. SCIENCE KNOWS. THEY DO KNOW. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND THAT IS NOT A SECRET. WHETHER IT WAS IN HIS HEINOUS ACT OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES AT THE BORDER OR HIS REPEATED ATTACKS ON DREAMERS OR HIS NEGLECT OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA OR HIS REPEATED FAILURE TO MAKE SURE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSULT THE DIGNITY OF HISPANIC FAMILIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT'S WRONG. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK BETTER FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A SHOT. MY DAD WOULD SAY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, WOULD NEVER, NEVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. I TRULY BELIEVE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS THAT ON HEALTH CARE, WAGES, HOUSING, EDUCATION, AND SO MUCH MORE, WE CAN REACH FOR MORE AS A NATION. WE CAN REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FINALLY BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. WE CAN BUILD A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION, INCLUDING HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA, HISPANIC VOTES CAN HELP PUT OUR NATION ON A PATH MOVING FORWARD. THERE ARE NOW 49 DAYS LEFT UNTIL ELECTION DAY. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. I'M GOING TO WORK VERY HARD EVERY DAY TO GET IT. AND I FIRST RAN AS A KID, I WOULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAY, MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. LOOK ME OVER. IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT I SAY, VOTE FOR ME. HERE IN FLORIDA, I AM SAYING, LOOK ME OVER AGAIN. I HOPE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU GETS INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION. IT SOUNDS LIKE HYPERBOLE, EXAGGERATION, BUT OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON EVERY VOICE BEING HEARD AND EVERY VOTE BEING COUNTED. PLEASE, THIS ELECTION, MAKE YOUR VOTE HEARD. THROUGH YOUR VOTE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. IT MAKE A PLAN TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY VOTE. I GREW UP IN A HEAVILY IRISH CATHOLIC UNITY IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA AND A HEAVILY POLISH COMMUNITY IN DELAWARE. THESE ARE COMMUNITIES BUILT ON TWO THINGS, FAITH AND FAMILY. THEY HAVE BEEN THE CORE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. THAT IS WHAT I COME BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN WHETHER IT WAS LOSING MY WIFE AND SON IN AN ACCIDENT OR MY SON FROM A DEADLY ILLNESS. MY COMFORT IN TIMES OF GRIEF, FAITH AND FAMILY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS THE STEAM , THE SAME STRENGTH THAT HAS ALWAYS ANIMATED THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, FAITH AND FAMILY. THAT IS THE HERITAGE WE ARE CELEBRATING, AND IT IS PROFOUNDLY AMERICAN, AS WELL. IT IS NOT ONLY OUR PAST. IT IS OUR FUTURE, AS WELL. MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME, THE HISPANIC UNITY HOLDS IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND THE DESTINY OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR IT, BUT IT'S TRUE. YOU CAN DECIDE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES WHEN I DECIDED TO RUN, ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM RUNNING IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IT'S A BASIC PROPOSITION. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE ARE ACTING NOW. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT US LIKE, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICA? AMERICA HAS ALWAYS LED NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OFF OUR POWER, BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT , ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. OF COURSE, WE'VE NEVER MET THAT TEST, BUT WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT BEFORE. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP BENDING THAT ARC. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GETTING MORE INCLUSIVE, BECAUSE THEREIN LIES THE POWER AND MAJESTY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, PARTICULARLY THANK THE PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE AND INTRODUCED ME TODAY, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THANK YOU.

I JUST FINISHED SPEAKING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC, THE STEPS WE NEED TO CURB THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, AND THE CHALLENGES OF DISTRIBUTING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE ONCE ONE IS IDENTIFIED. BEFORE I TURN TO THOSE ISSUES, LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS LAST NIGHT. EVEN BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGING TO BOB WOODWARD ON TAPE THAT HE WAS FULLY INFORMED ON THE GRAVITY OF THE DANGER RELATED TO COVID-19, HE REFUSED TO WARN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AGAIN, LAST NIGHT, IN A TELEVISION TOWN HALL, THE PRESIDENT REVEALED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE CONTINUES TO TAKE THIS PANDEMIC. NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THIS CRISIS, ON THE DOOR STEP OF 200,000 AMERICAN DEATHS, TRUMP REFUSED ONCE AGAIN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR TO TAKE ACTION. BY HIS OWN ADMISSION, HE CONTINUED TO LIE ABOUT COVID-19. HE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE CATASTROPHIC MISTAKES THAT HE'S MADE. AND PERHAPS WORST OF ALL, HE MADE CLEAR THAT HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN TO BRING US OUT OF THIS CRISIS. HE EVEN SAID, AND I QUOTE, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MASKS ARE NOT GOOD. UNDERCUTTING THE EASIEST, MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS WE HAVE FOR REDUCING THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. THIS VIRUS IS STILL TAKING NEARLY 1,000 LIVES A DAY. THE FORECASTS SHOW THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CLIMB THIS WINTER. BUT INCREDIBLY, DONALD TRUMP INSISTS THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. NOT ONE THING. LAST FRIDAY WE LEARNED THAT ANOTHER ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS DIED DUE TO THIS VIRUS AND IT CONTINUES TO RISE. THE VERY SAME DAY THAT WE REPORTED 1,000 DEATHS ON FRIDAY, THE VERY SAME DAY, CANADA REPORTED THAT NOT ONE PERSON DIED OF COVID-19 IN CANADA. TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? IF YOU'RE A PARENT IN AMERICA, PREPARING FOR ANOTHER DAY THAT YOUR CHILD CAN'T ATTEND SCHOOL, IF YOU'RE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A FATHER, SON, MOTHER, DAUGHTER, HUSBAND OR WIFE, IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO IS ON THE BRINK OF TOTAL BANKRUPTCY, WHO CAN'T OPEN OR CAN'T GO BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THE VIRUS STILL IS SPREADING IN YOUR COMMUNITY, HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? AND IF HE GETS FOUR MORE YEARS, WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT ANYTHING TO CHANGE? ALL THE PRESIDENT HAD TO OFFER LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WAS THE SAME WEAK AND EFFECTLESS INACTION, THE SAME LIES AND EMPTY PROMISES THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. HE STILL WON'T ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY. HE STILL WON'T OFFER A PLAN. AND LAST NIGHT HE REPEATED WHAT HE SAID SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. THAT EVEN IF HE CONTINUES TO OFFER ONLY FAILING INDIFFERENCE, SOMEDAY THE VIRUS IS GOING TO GO AWAY BY A MIRACLE. EVEN IF HE DOES NOTHING. IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY BY A MIRACLE. IT WON'T GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. IN FACT, EVEN IF WE GET A VACCINE, IT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR MOST POPULATIONS WELL INTO THE 2021. YOU KNOW, SO WE'RE HEADING INTO A VERY DANGEROUS AUTUMN. THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL, WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE PREVIOUSLY TOUTED, PROJECTS THAT CASES AND DEATHS ARE GOING TO SPIKE THIS NOVEMBER AND , BY AN ADDITIONAL 215,000 AMERICANS THEY SAY ARE GOING TO DIE, BEGINNING THE SPIKE IN NOVEMBER, BUT BY THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, 215,000 WILL BE DEAD, ADDITIONAL. THAT'S MORE THAN HAVE ALREADY DIED. WE NEED LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THE SAME UNIVERSITY THE MODEL SHOWS, THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL, SHOWS THAT IF THERE'S UNIVERSAL MASKING, THESE DEATHS COULD BE CUT IN HALF. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR WE CAN SAVE 100,000 LIVES. LET'S ASSUME THEY'RE OFF BY HALF IN ALL OF THIS. 50,000 LIVES. 150,000 DEAD. DONALD TRUMP'S OWN DIRECTOR OF C.D.C. TOLD US THAT WEARING A MASK IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STEP WE CAN TAKE TO CURB THIS VIRUS. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID, I MIGHT GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THIS FACE MASK, AND HE HELD UP A FACE MASK, NOT THIS ONE, IS MORE GUARANTEED TO PROTECT ME AGAINST COVID THAN WHEN I TAKE A COVID VACCINE, END OF QUOTE. I SPOKE , I SPOKE WITH THE EXPERTS TODAY ABOUT ADDITIONAL STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO PREVENT NEEDLESS DEATH AND SUFFERING BETWEEN NOW AND A VACCINE BEING MADE AVAILABLE. UNIFORM NATIONAL GUIDELINES, THEY SAID. AND STANDARDS ON SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO , IN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATES AND COMMUNITIES BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ON TESTING AND TRACING. IF WE DO THESE THINGS BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, WE CAN SAVE EVEN MORE LIVES. LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP INDICATED HE HAS NO INTEREST IN DOING THESE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE WON'T. THAT'S UTTERLY DISQUALIFYING. I ALSO SPOKE TO THE EXPERTS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF PREPARING NOW FOR SWIFT, ORGANIZED AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE COVID-19 VACCINE WHEN IT ARRIVES. AND I'M PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR THE SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE BECOMES A REALITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THESE SCIENTISTS CARRY THE HOPES OF OUR NATION, OUR ENTIRE NATION , AND THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN THE WORK COMES TO FRUITION, AND IT WILL, THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT IT WILL SAVE LIVES. BUT SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS DON'T CARE ABOUT CALENDARS. ANY MORE THAN THE VIRUS DOES. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T ADHERE TO ELECTION CYCLES. AND THEIR TIMING, APPROVAL AND DISTRIBUTION SHOULD NEVER EVER BE DISTORTED BY POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY SCIENCE AND SAFETY ALONE. A VACCINE WOULD OFFER A WAY BACK TO NORMALCY AND A PATH TOWARD BETTER DAYS FOR ALL OF US. NOT ONLY HERE BUT AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. ONCE WE HAVE IT, IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS TO DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION. I'M MORE HOPEFUL THAN EVER IN THE POWER OF SCIENCE TO GET US THERE. BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN. WE CAN'T ALLOW POLITICS TO INTERFERE WITH A VACCINE IN ANY WAY. AMERICANS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE AND DISHONESTY WHEN IT COMES TO TESTING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REPEAT THOSE FIASCOS. WHEN IT COMES TO A VACCINE, WHEN IT OCCURS. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED TOO MUCH. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. I TRUST VACCINES, I TRUST SCIENTISTS, BUT I DON'T TRUST DONALD TRUMP. AT THIS MOMENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T EITHER. LAST WEEK SENATOR HARRIS AND I LAID OUT THREE QUESTIONS THIS ADMINISTRATION'S GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT POLITICS WILL NOT PLAY A ROLE WHATSOEVER IN THE VACCINE PROCESS. IF DONALD TRUMP CAN'T GIVE ANSWERS AND HIS ADMINISTRATION CAN'T GIVE ANSWERS TO THESE THREE QUESTIONS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE. IF THEY CAN, THEY SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE TRANSPARENCY THEY NEED TO TRUST THE VACCINE AND ADOPT IT IN NUMBERS THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. FIRST QUESTION, WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO ENSURE THAT A VACCINE MEETS THE SCIENTIFIC STANDARD OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVE SNNS WHAT'S THE CRITERIA? , EFFECTIVENESS? WHAT'S THE CRITERIA? SECOND, IF THE ADMINISTRATION GREEN LIGHTS A VACCINE, WHO WILL VALIDATE THAT THE DECISION WAS DRIVEN BY SCIENCE RATHER THAN POLITICS? WHAT GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WILL THAT BE? THIRDLY, HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE WILL TAKE PLACE SAFELY, COST-FREE, AND WITHOUT A HINT OF FAVORITISM? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE IS ONLY PART OF THE BATTLE. DISTRIBUTING THE VACCINE TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION IS AS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING AS ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE MILITARY OPERATIONS. I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR AN EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION PLAN TO BE LAID OUT FOR MONTHS. IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I'LL BEGIN BY IMPLEMENTING AN EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION PLAN FROM THE MINUTE I TAKE OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT I DISCUSSED WITH THE EXPERTS IN THE THEY LAID OUT A CLEAR PLAN, THEY INCLUDE A DETAILED TIME CHANGE FROM WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THE VACCINE. CLEAR DELINEATION OF PIRATE POSITION TO GET THE VACCINE, SPECIFIC NEEDS , MEANS AND MECHANISMS FOR SHIPPING AND STORING VACCINES AT APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURES, TWO OF THOSE VACCINES THAT HAVE COME FORWARD HAVE NEEDED TO BE SHIPPED AT 70 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. THE DESERT , DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS TO BE CLEAR AND I WILL PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN. I WILL LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WILL SUPPORT RATHER THAN TERRY BROWN , TEAR DOWN THE EXPERTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN. I WILL SIMPLY FOLLOW THE SILENCE , SCIENCE. IS THESE THREE QUESTIONS THAT SENATOR HARRIS AND I HAVE LAYERED , LAID OUT SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES, IT IS ABOUT GETTING BACK TO OUR LOVED ONES AND FRIENDS MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE. IT IS ABOUT GETTING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON ITS FEET, GETTING BACK TO THE MOVIE THEATERS AND RESTAURANTS AND BALLPARKS. IT IS ABOUT GETTING BACK TO OUR LIVES. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN AND WILL BE UNITED IN THAT PURSUIT. NO MATTER WHEN THAT BIG , BREAKTHROUGH EMERGES, THAT IS WHAT AMERICA DOES BEST, WE UNITE, WE DO IT TOGETHER. I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO, I WANT TO THANK YOU, GOD BLESS OUR SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS AND OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS NOW IF THAT IS OK. EVERYBODY IS SITTING. OK. ABC, MARY. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU JUST SAID THAT WHEN IT COMES TO A VACCINE YOU DO NOT TRUST ALLAH TRUMP, IS THERE A RISK THAT THAT MESSAGE, QUESTIONING THE PRESIDENT ON A VACCINE COULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TRUSTING THE SCIENCE? FROM TRUSTING A VACCINE WHEN THERE FINALLY IS ONE? NO BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR SCIENCE, YOU SAW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES AND SCIENTISTS DON'T KNOW, IT IS NECESSARY SO PEOPLE CAN TRUST IN THE VACCINE. THAT IS WHY SAID YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOARD OF SCIENTISTS THAT SAY THIS IS WHY WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD VACCINE, WHY IT IS APPROVED AND THERE HAS TO BE TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. SCIENTISTS OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT KNOW WHAT IS BEING APPROVED, THE CONTEXT TO WHICH IT IS BEING APPROVED AND WHY IT IS BEING APPROVED. FOR VACCINES TO WORK, YOU DO NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE POPULATION TO BE WILLING TO TAKE IT, YOU ARE SAYING TO NOT TRUST THE PRESIDENT, TRUST ME IF I KNOW I AM NOT, I AM SAYING TRUST THE SCIENTISTS. TRUST THE SCIENTISTS, IT IS ONE THING FOR DONALD TRUMP SAY THE VACCINE IS SAFE. OK, THEN GIVE IT TO THE BOARD OF SCIENTISTS. HAVE TOTAL TRANSPARENCY SO INDEPENDENT OPERATORS CAN COME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WHAT DID YOU BASE THE DECISION ON? WHAT DID YOU DO? DID YOU PRESSURE THE HEAD OF THE FDA? I'M NOT SAYING HE WOULD OR WILL, BUT THAT IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. YOU ALL KNOW THE POLLS BETTER THAN I DO, A LOT OF THE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW DO NOT TRUST WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYS ABOUT THINGS RELATED TO SCIENCE. CBS, THANK YOU VERSE , THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT. YOU SAY YOU DO NOT TRUST THE PRESIDENT, DOES THAT MEAN YOU ALSO DO NOT TRUST THE CDC AND THE FDA NO. I DO NOT TRUST SOME OF THE PEOPLE LIKE THE FELLOW WHO JUST TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE CDC. HE DID NOT RUN IT, BUT HE WAS A SPOKESPERSON. WHEN I MET WITH THE SEVEN SCIENTISTS TODAY ON SCREEN IN THIS ROOM, THEY TOLD ME THE PEOPLE THEY HAD WORKED WITH IN THE CDC AND THE FDA , THERE WERE SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE RANKS. EVERYDAY FOLKS , NOT EVERY DAY, THEIR SCIENTISTS, THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY HAVE BEEN PRESSURED, THE HEADS OF THE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN IN FACT REMOVED , MOVED, MOVED TO SAY YES OR SAY THIS WILL WORK OR THAT WILL WORK. IT IS A SIMPLE PROPOSITION, IF A VACCINE IS READY TO GO, IT SHOULD BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT THE BASIS UPON WHICH THAT DECISION WAS MADE, WHAT SCIENTISTS LOOK AT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SAID THIS IS A USEFUL, SAFE VACCINE TO TAKE. THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING, THAT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY, OUR SPECS , I SUGGEST A MATTER WHAT I SAID IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE ALL THE POLLING DATA SHOWS NOW ONLY 34% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY TRUMP IS THE SAME GUY THAT SAID TO INJECT WHICH , BLEACH. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT SO CERTAIN. QUICK QUESTION ON THE ECONOMY, THE FED ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR PROJECTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYED MEN ARE GOING TO BE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. IN POLLING WE SEE TIME AND AGAIN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS AN EDGE OVER YOU ON THE ECONOMY. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? I HAVE BEEN OUT OF OFFICE FOR FOUR YEARS, THAT IS A LONG TIME. WE ACTUALLY CREATED MORE JOBS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF OUR MINISTRATION THEN HE DID IN THE FIRST FOUR OF HIS. THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE AT RISK, I THINK IT IS A MATTER OF MY BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE, MY POSITION ON JOBS AND TRADE AND WHAT I WOULD DO. FOR EXAMPLE, THE WTO JUST RULED THAT HIS TRADE POLICIES WERE ILLEGAL. GUESS WHAT, WE WENT IN 14-16 TIMES AND WON EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHY SHOULD EVERY AMERICAN REMEMBER THAT? PART OF IT IS REMINDING PEOPLE AND LAYING OUT FOR THEM A WHAT MY PLANS FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS. IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM THE PANDEMIC NOW, YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ACTED EARLIER. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT QUESTION HOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT EVEN IF YOU ACTED EARLIER. THE CERT , SOCIAL DISTANCING AND CLOSING , YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE RATES OF INFECTION, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A DAY DIE DID , DIE. WE NEED A NATIONAL GUIDANCE. YOU MAY VERY WELL THE ABLE TO OPEN UP IN A RURAL AREA, NOT AN AREA THAT IS SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM OR VICE VERSA. WE HAVE NOT LAID OUT , THIS ADMINISTERS AND HAS NOT LAID OUT THE CRITERIA. THERE IS NO NATIONAL CRITERIA. WHAT IS THE NATIONAL CRITERIA FOR OPENING SCHOOLS? THEY STILL DON'T HAVE ONE, WE NEED THAT. YOU NEED TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN OPEN SAFELY, SECURELY. YOU CAN HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCING, YOU CAN HAVE THE WEARING OF MASKS, SMALLER CLASSES, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. YET WHY WON'T HE LAY OUT THE GUIDANCE? EVEN THE CDC INITIALLY HAD GUIDANCE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE , POLITICAL MEDICATION. THE PRESIDENT SAID TESTING CAUSES MORE CASES, IT IS ABOUT BEING HONEST. HE LOVES TO QUOTE CHURCHILL, HE LOVES TO QUOTE ROOSEVELT. ROOSEVELT SAID IN A CRISIS IT IS GOING TO WORK AND WORSE AND WORSE UNTIL HE GETS BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STRONG, GIVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT, THEY CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO. CNN, JESSICA. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU MENTIONED THE CDC DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE VACCINE , ABOUT MASKS AND HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE. YOU PREVIOUSLY CALLED FOR A NATIONAL MASK MENDED, IF YOU ARE ELECTED, WHAT STEPS WOULD YOU TAKE TO PREVENT , PUT THAT IN PLACE AND HOW WOULD THAT WORK? I FOUND IT FASCINATING THE PRESIDENT SAID AND BIDEN DID NOT PUT IN A MASK MENDED , MANDATE. I AM NOT THE PRESIDENT, HE IS THE PRESIDENT. BIDEN'S PROBLEMS AND THE CITIES ARE IN FLAMES, I'M NOT THE PRESIDENT. I WOULD CALL THE GOVERNORS TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY , THERE IS A QUESTION THAT I THINK THEY COULD BE ANSWERED IN THE POSITIVE, A QUESTION WHETHER I CAN MANDATE OVER STATE LINES OF EVERY SINGLE STATE. OUR LEGAL TEAM THINKS I CAN DO THAT BASED UPON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERE IS A CRISIS IN THOSE STATES AND HOW BAD THINGS ARE FOR THE COUNTRY AND IF WE DON'T DO IT WHAT HAPPENS? I WOULD MAKE THE CASE, I WOULD MAKE THE CASE WHY IT IS NECESSARY. I WOULD HAVE THE SCIENTISTS ARRAY AND LAY OUT IN DETAIL WHY, I WOULD GO TO EVERY GOVERNOR AND I WOULD GO TO GOVERNORS AND I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS NATIONAL MANDATE. WE MUST DO IT. THE MINIMUM WHAT I WOULD DO, I WOULD NOT WALK AROUND SAYING MASK DON'T MATTER LIKE HE SAID IN THE TOWN HALL. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MASKS, MATTER OF FACT THEY COULD BE WORSE, DON'T WILL BE ON THIS BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE IT, STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED WHAT , WHY? AND HE SAID BECAUSE WAITERS DO NOT LIKE IT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR PUSHED BACK ON YOU ON THIS? HOW DO YOU GET A BITE WHEN IT HAS BECOME SO POLITICIZED, WOULD YOU SIGN AN EXECUTIVE THE QUESTION IS IF I HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO SIGN AN ORDER, I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT. IF I DID, I WOULD. NUMBER FIVE, AFTER: MY HOMETOWN NEW EXTERNAL. IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VIRUS, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, WOULD THEY GET ACCESS TO THE VIRUS FIRST? HOW WOULD THAT WORK IN THE DESCRIPTION OF AMERICANS AVAILABLE TO GET THE VIRUS. BASED ON THE PROPOSAL LAID OUT AND THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION'S COORDINATING WITH THE CDC AND OTHER AGENCIES, THEY INDICATE THAT THE FIRST GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULD GET A VACCINE IF AND WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE ARE PEOPLE AT THE GREATEST RISK. THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM NURSING HOMES TO PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE HAPPENED TO BE BLACK AND BROWN. SO, IT WOULD BE BASED UPON THE DEGREE OF EXPOSURE. IT WOULD GO FIRST THOUGH, I WOULD ARGUE, AS LAID UP FOR ME TODAY TO FIRST RESPONDERS, DOCTORS, AND NURSES. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST , MOST NEEDED TO HAVE AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST AND IT WOULD MOVE TO THE LEAST , ONE THING THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, BUT I THING I AM WELL-INFORMED ON THIS ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO TESTS YET ON CHILDREN, SO CHILDREN, IRONICALLY, MAY BE THE LAST PEOPLE TO GET THE VACCINE BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE TIME. THEY INDICATED TO ME 2021 TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF TESTING ON CHILDREN. CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THEIR TEACHERS AND THE ELDERLY GRANDPARENTS WOULD BE EXPOSED. SO, FIRST WE GO TO THE PEOPLE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE. CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS, BUT THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE. TODAY THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED A PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD , A LOOSE PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD DISTRIBUTION , DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE. WOULD YOU GO WITH A COURT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT IN PLACE? THEY HAVE NOT PUT ONE OFFICIAL IN PLACE, WHAT I WOULD DO IS MAKE SURE FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS TO MAKE SURE WHAT IS THE MOST RATIONAL MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF VACCINES BEING WORKED ON NOW, ONE IS AN RNA MODEL THAT ARE DONE BY TWO OF THE OPERATIONS I THINK MODERNITY AND , MERGENER , MODERNA AND THE OTHER CHANGES THE CELL STRUCTURE. ONE DEALS WITH THE MRNA, THAT REQUIRES TWO INJECTIONS AND REQUIRES TO BE STORED AT 70 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THIS, THERE ARE MECHANICAL ISSUES AS TO HOW AND WHERE THE VACCINE IS , LET'S SAY THE MATERNAL ONE IS PICKS, ASSUMING THAT THE VACCINE IS APPROVED, IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE THAT VACCINE. YOU HAVE TO SHIP IT IN BULK IF IT IS THE MRNA VERSION. THAT MEANS THOUSANDS AT A TIME KIND OF THING, IT WILL GO TO HOSPITALS AND MAJOR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. IT IS NOT GOING TO GO TO YOUR DOCTOR. MY , IT WILL NOT BE LIKE YOUR FLU SHOT, I GOT MY FLU SHOT AT WALGREENS, YOU COULD NOT DO THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT IN SMALL LOTS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO SHOTS. MY GENERIC POINT IS THERE ARE A LOT OF NOT ONLY WHAT IS SAFE TO DO, BUT DISTRIBUTION ISSUES THAT ARE CONSEQUENTIAL AND MATTER A LOT. IT IS NOT LIKE IF I TOLD YOU TOMORROW, IF I WERE PRESIDENT AND SAID WE HAVE APPROVED THE FOLLOWING TWO VACCINES OR ONE VACCINE. THE VACCINES LIKELY TO BE APPROVED SO FAR STARTED OFF WITH A GROUP OF 10,000 DOSES ALL THE WAY TO 60,000 DOSES. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IT TAKES TIME IS WHAT I AM SAYING. IT HAS TO BE DONE FAIRLY AND WELL. IT CANNOT BE BASED ON YOUR TAX RETURNS FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, IT HAS GOT TO BE BASED ON WHO IS MOST VULNERABLE. THANK YOU ALSO VERY VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. THOSE COMMENTS FROM JOE BIDEN TOOK PLACE THIS AFTERNOON, AFTER THAT EVENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HE RESPONDED TO JOE BIDEN AND IT SAID A COVID-19 VACCINE WILL BE READY BY MID-OCTOBER.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475890-1/joe-biden-remarks-covid-19-vaccine-development	Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, while speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, said health experts were warning of a coronavirus spike in November.

THE FIRST DAY OF MAIL-IN BALLOT IS FOR MINNESOTANS IN THE 2020 ELECTION. HE WAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR TINA SMITH AND AMY KLOBUCHAR. THIS IS 40 MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I AM GLAD TO BE WITH YOU ALL. I THANK THE COMFORTERS TO WELCOME US TO THIS AMAZING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE. WE ARE ALL HERE BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY, TO ORGANIZE FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS, BETTER WAGES, SAFER PLACES TO WORK THEY DO BETTER AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BETTER AND EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY DOES BETTER. WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ALL OVER MINNESOTA IS THAT WHAT THEY WANT IS THE FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE LIVES THAT THEY WANT AND THEY KNOW THAT GOOD JOBS AND THEIR LABOR UNION HELP THEM DO THAT. SO I THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THIS AMAZING A , APPRENTICESHIP FACILITY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS HAD A CHANCE TO TOUR THE DISTANT GREAT WORK IS CREATING PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE GOOD JOBS AND GOOD CAREERS WITH PENSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR MAKING THIS COUNTRY WORK AND MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES WORK. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE AT THE TOP. INVOLVES MAKING SURE WAGES ARE GOOD. WE NEED A $15 HOUR MINIMUM WAGE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WORK HARD AND THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR PENSIONS BEING THERE WHEN THEY RETIRE. THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN DULUTH WHO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. WORKED ON WEEKENDS, WORK ON HOLIDAYS, PAID INTO THEIR PENSION, AND ARE NOW BEING TOLD THE PENSIONS MIGHT NOT BE THERE. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. A WOMAN SAID TO ME ""I DON'T HAVE A PLAN B, I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER THING TO DO HERE."" ONE THING I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON, AND SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE PENSIONS THEY EARNED. IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT WHO IS STANDING WITH WORKING PEOPLE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. THAT'S WHERE I STAND. A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID I THINK THE CAMPAIGN WHETHER YOU ARE FROM SCRANTON OR PARK AVENUE. IS THIS ABOUT SCRANTON OR PARK AVENUE? I KNOW WHAT SIDE I COME DOWN. I COME DOWN ON SCRANTON AND ON THE SIDE OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE CELEBRATION OF THE HARD WORK AND WHAT THAT HARDWARE CAN DELIVER FOR FAMILIES IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD THE LIVES THEY WANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] HELLO EVERYONE, IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THANK YOU TO THE CARPENTERS FOR HOSTING US. TO MY FRIEND TINA SMITH, WHO'S DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB. I'M SO PROUD TO HAVE HER AS A COLLEAGUE AND A REAL FRIEND. PEOPLE SAY FRIEND IN WASHINGTON ALL THE TIME BUT FOR US IT IS TRUE. AND ALSO TO BE HERE AND WELCOME BACK VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO NORTHERN MINNESOTA. HE HAS BEEN HERE WITH ME. HE HAS BEEN UP HERE WITH OUR STEELWORKERS. HE IS BEEN UP HERE BECAUSE YOU , HE HAS BEEN UP HERE BECAUSE HE DID DID SUCH GREAT WORK ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CAME TO DULUTH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND NOW HE IS HERE WITH THE CARPENTERS. I WAS JUST TALKING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT BACKSTAGE AND RECOUNTING MY BACKGROUND HERE. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW MY DAD GREW UP IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA, MY GRANDPA WAS A MINER. HE WORKED 1500 FEET UNDERGROUND HIS ENTIRE LIFE. HE NEVER GOT TO GRADUATE FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAD NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IT WAS UNIONS THAT MADE MY GRANDPA'S LIFE SAFER. MY DAD STILL REMEMBERS THOSE BODIES IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT SAINT ANTHONY'S BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SAFE. EVEN WHEN MY DEBT WAS GOING UP , EVEN WHEN MY DAD WAS GROWING UP, THAT WAS HAPPENING. THE UNIONS PUSHED FOR SAFER RULES AND BETTER WAGES. IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY REASONS AND STANDING UP HERE TODAY. SO WE KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE WE NEED SOMEONE TO HAVE OUR BACK. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT HE IS SOMEHOW MAKING US MORE SAFE. WE ARE NOT SAFE WHEN WE HAVE A PANDEMIC RAGING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WHERE I GO VISIT MY DAD, WHO IS 92 AT ASSISTED LIVING, AND HE HAS COVID AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM THROUGH A GLASS DOOR LIKE I WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN. THAT IS NOT SAFE. AND IT'S NOT SAFE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SCARED ECONOMICALLY AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEIR JOB BACK. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND MY FRIEND, KAMALA HARRIS, IS THEY ARE LOOKING AT NOT JUST HOW WE GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO TRAIN OUR WORKERS. WHAT JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE NOW AND WHAT JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THOSE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS SELLING AMERICAN WORKERS OUT WHEN WE NEED TO BUY AMERICAN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE AND WORKERS OF NORTHERN MINNESOTA AND NOT GO DOWN TO THE MAR-A-LAGO AND TELL ALL OF HIS RICH FRIENDS AFTER HE PASSES THE TAX BILL THAT YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER. I DON'T THINK ONE PERSON FROM NORTHERN MINNESOTA WAS IN THAT ROOM IN FLORIDA WHEN HE SAID THAT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WE DO NOT HAVE A SHORTAGE OF CEOS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PLUMBERS. A SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT BUILD THINGS. THAT REALLY BUILD THINGS. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA. I WAS SO PROUD TO ENDORSE HIM AFTER STARTING MY CAMPAIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD IN MINNESOTA. I GOT TO END IT BY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN. I CANNOT THINK OF A MORE JOYFUL WAY TO END A CAMPAIGN. ONE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY. IT WAS THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT CAME UP HERE IN THE FACE OF DENNIS MCDONOUGH, THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND MADE SURE WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT CHINESE STEEL DUMPING. THEY WENT TO WORK, ENFORCED THE LAWS, WE PASSED NEW LAWS, AND THE NUMBER OF OUR IRON ORE MINES REOPENED. IT WAS THERE ADMINISTRATION THAT GOT RESULTS. SO IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR JOB, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR CHILDCARE, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT JUST KEEPS ADDING MORE FUEL TO THE FLAMES, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. BECAUSE HE WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND THANKS HOW CAN I LEAD THIS COUNTRY AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER? LUCKILY, JUST LIKE THE CARPENTERS, WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. I HAVE THIS VOTE MASK BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF EARLY VOTING AND MINNESOTA. SO LET'S GO OUT THERE, LET'S VOTE, LET'S ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, AND GET TO WORK AND ELECT JOE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (music) THANK YOU, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO THE CARPENTER TRAINING INSTITUTE. OUR MISSION IS TO PREPARE OUR REGISTERED APPRENTICES , 2500 REGISTERED APPRENTICES FOR SUCCESSFUL CAREER AS A PROFESSOR OF PROFESSIONAL IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. WE ALSO PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. OUR PARTNER CONTRACTORS RELY ON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR MEMBERS IN ORDER TO THRIVE. ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL STATE REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS, THE CARPENTERS TRAINING INSTITUTE AND OUR MEMBERSHIP, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THE UBC MEMBERS IN OUR REGION DO AND ALSO HEAR WHAT ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO US. WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HELLO, MINNESOTA. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. AS AMY WAS SAYING, I HAVE BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES UP IN THE IRON RANGE AND IS IN A MAGNIFICENT PART OF THE WORLD. A MAGNIFICENT PART OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH, AMY AND SENATOR. YOU HAVE BEEN A GREAT FRIEND AND A GREAT, GREAT SENATOR AND SENATOR SMITH, YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT. THANK YOU FOR THE JOB YOU'RE DOING AND I'M COUNTING ON IT TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS. I KNOW YOU ARE BOTH FIGHTING AROUND-THE CLOCK TO TAKE CARE OF MINNESOTANS WHO ARE HURTING IN THESE MULTIPLE CRISES WE FACE TODAY. WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM COVID TO UNEMPLOYMENT TO A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED ALONG OR IS BEING DIVIDED ALONG RACIST LINES AND WE HAVE INSTITUTIONAL RACISM WE ARE DEALING WITH, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TWO OF THE BEST SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY ON THEIR SIDE. MATT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR SHOWING ME AROUND TODAY. THIS INCREDIBLE APPRENTICE PROGRAM AT THE CARPENTERS TRAINING CENTER. WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH LABOR IS THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY TRAINING THE BEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD AND I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS, THAT IS A FACT. BUT THEY GET PAID WHILE THEY ARE DOING IT. THEY ARE GETTING PAID , NOT FOR FULL WAGES, BUT THEY'RE GETTING PAID WHILE THEY ARE DOING IT AND THAT IS WHY THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE SO SO SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY STAY THIS WAY. IT MATTERS. PEOPLE CAN STILL MAKE IT WHILE THEY ARE LEARNING A TRADE. A TRADE THAT WILL PUT THEM IN GOOD STEAD FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE SOME OF THE PRACTICAL HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE THAT APPRENTICES AND JOURNEYMEN AND WOMEN HERE RECEIVE. AS I SAID, WHILE EARNING A WAGE AS A BENEFIT. IT IS A BIT QUIETER HERE THAN USUAL BECAUSE OF COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS, BUT THE PRIDE OF THESE WORKERS WHO ARE LEARNING THE SKILLS THAT WILL CARRY THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS IS STILL UNMISTAKABLE. MY FATHER , I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESS WHO FOLLOWED ME FOR REPEATING THIS, BUT IT WARRANTS SAYING EVERY TIME, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOEY IN JOBS BY A LOT MORE THAN PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT YOUR RESPECT. YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. LOOKING A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT WAS THAT IS THE LESSON I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. IT IS THE WAY I GREW UP SURROUNDED BY HARD-WORKING FAMILIES IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA AND A LOT OF STEELWORKERS IN DELAWARE AND ALL THOSE JOBS ARE GONE NOW. A LOT OF THOSE JOBS ARE GONE NOW, THOUGH STILL WORKING JOBS. AND THAT IS WHAT I SAW HERE THIS TRAINING CENTER. DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN INVESTING IN THEIR DIGNITY. IN THEIR DIGNITY. HERE IN THE IRON RANGE, WE CAN SEE THE RESILIENCE IN THE GRIP OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BUILT AMERICA, THE METAL THAT IT IS MADE OF, AND FORTIFIED BY THE STRENGTH OF UNION POWER, WORKER POWER. I THINK I WAS SAYING TO YOU, MATT, THAT MY DAD HAS ANOTHER EXPRESSION. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER AND THE ONLY WERE REAL POWER FOR WORKERS IN AMERICA IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THAT KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DECENT LIVING. FOLKS, HERE LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE, TIMES ARE HARD. UNEMPLOYMENT IS WAY UP DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, FEW WORKERS CAN BE ON THE JOB AT ONE TIME IN ORDER TO ABIDE BY SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES, AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR INCLUDING FOR THE BUILDING TRADES IS MORE UNCERTAIN THAN IT NEED BE. HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE HURTING. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THE RENT PAYMENTS IN CHECK. THEY SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP DOING VERY WELL. AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER. BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAVE MADE ANOTHER $300 BILLION. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID? IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YOU ARE LEFT TO WONDER AS THE CONSEQUENCE, WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR THE ORDINARY FOLKS? THAT IS BEEN THE ENTIRE STORY OF DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. NOW IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED NATIONAL CRISIS DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN UP ON EVEN PRETENDING TO DO HIS JOB. ALMOST 200,000 LIVES LOST IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND EXPERTS TELL US NOW THE SAME STUDIES THAT WE RELIED ON, THE ADMINISTRATION RELIED ON TO PREDICT WHAT'S COMING NEXT, THAT WE WILL LOSE ANOTHER 215,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 1. THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST , HAS ANOTHER 36,000 NEW COVID CASES PER DAY. PER DAY. ANOTHER AVERAGE 1000 DEATHS A DAY. JUST ACROSS THE BORDER, AND FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, A STONE'S THROW INDICATED THAT, ONE DAY EARLIER THIS MONTH THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED STATES HAD A , HAD 1000 DEATHS OF COVID, AND CANADA HAD ZERO. JUST THREE DAYS AGO, I BELIEVE IT WAS, AMERICA HAD 1200 DEATHS, CANADA HAD NINE. NINE. SO MANY LIVES LOST UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET AND HIS REELECTION. HE REFUSED TO DO WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT HERE IN THIS PROGRAM. SOCIAL DISTANCE, WEAR MASKS, SANITIZE. YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR APPRENTICES. HE IS NOT PROTECTING AMERICA. IT IS ESTIMATED BY THE SCIENTISTS THAT IF WE JUST WORE MASKS NATIONALLY, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 1. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. IF WE JUST WORE MASKS NATIONALLY, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY ACCORDING TO THE SAME STUDY. IT WAS ESTIMATED BY GREAT MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE COLUMBIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, THAT IF THE PRESIDENT HAD JUST STARTED ONE WEEK EARLIER IN MARCH THEN HE DID, WE WOULD HAVE 36,000 MORE PEOPLE SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE TONIGHT. OR BEING ABLE TO PUT YOUR ARM AROUND GRAMPA OR GRANDMA TONIGHT. AGAIN, IN HIS OWN WORDS, RECORDED BY BOB WOODWARD, THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN FEBRUARY THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE IRON RANGE, HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS AROUND THOSE DINNER TABLES, BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE AND SELFISHNESS? HOW MANY LIES SAID AND LIVES LOST? IMAGINE IF HE HAD JUST, AT THE STATE OF THE UNION THAT YEAR SPOKE UP AND SAID WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE CAN HANDLE IT AND HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I CANNOT THINK OF ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS EVER ACTED, IN MY VIEW, SO SELFISHLY ABOUT HIS OWN REELECTION INSTEAD OF HIS SWORN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT IN MY HOMETOWN, I VIEW THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BETWEEN , AS BETWEEN SCRANTON AND PARK AVENUE. ALL TRUMP SEES FROM PARK AVENUE IS WALL STREET. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY METRIC OF THE AMERICAN PRESS FOR HIM IS THE VALUE OF THE DOW JONES. LIKE A LOT OF US BUT A LOT OF MY LIFE WITH GUYS LIKE DONALD TRUMP LOOKING DOWN ON ME. LOOKING DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LIVING WITH OUR HANDS, PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS. PEOPLE WHO CLEAN OUR STREETS. MAYBE WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST IS THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT, IS REPORTED TO TALK ABOUT, AND CONFIRMED BY MANY OUTLETS. WHERE HE IS TALKED ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO JOIN THE MILITARY AND GAVE FULL MEASURE TO THEIR COUNTRY AS SUCKERS AND LOSERS. UNLESS YOU THINK IT IS MADE UP, REMEMBER HOW HE TALKED ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN. A POLITICAL OPPONENT, BUT A CLOSE FRIEND AND I GAVE HIS EULOGY. JOHN MCCAIN WAS NO SUCKER OR LOSER. HE WAS A HERO. MY SON WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SPEND A YEAR IN IRAQ AND WON THE BRONZE STAR. HE WASN'T A LOSER OR SUCKER. HE WAS A PROUD PATRIOT. THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER THAN ME, BETTER THAN US BECAUSE THEY HAD A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT AND STILL MANAGE TO SQUANDER IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, WHICH I GUESS IS COMING OUT AND IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO TRUMP. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT THESE GUYS. RECENTLY , I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT LAST NIGHT BUT I DID , RECENTLY, I READ SOME STORIES I WAS ASKED QUESTIONS BY LEADING COLUMNIST. IT WENT LIKE THIS. IF YOU GET ELECTED, YOU WILL BE THE FIRST GUY IN A LONG TIME ELECTED PRESIDENT WITHOUT AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE. LIKE SOMEHOW, A KID WHO WENT TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY CAN QUALIFY TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I KNOW HOW TO DO THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR. NO MATTER HOW WEALTHY DONALD TRUMP IS OR HOW MUCH HE DOCTORS, IF HE DOES, HIS TAX RETURNS. HE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BE PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE LESSONS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, NOT A JOKE, A LONG TIME AGO, TAUGHT ME AND MY SIBLINGS AND ONE THAT YOU WERE PROBABLY TAUGHT TO O , TOO OUT HERE IN MINNESOTA. SHE SAID JOEY, REMEMBER NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. WE DON'T MEASURE PEOPLE BY THE SIZE OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. I DON'T RESPECT PEOPLE BASED ON HOW BIG THEIR HOUSE THEY LIVE IN IS. I DON'T LOOK DOWN MY NOSE AT PEOPLE WHO ARE BUSTING THEIR NECKS JUST MAKING A LIVING. TRUMP SAYS, BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY'S IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THAT'S WHY HE CARES ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? PEOPLE WHO I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON AND CLAYMONT DIDN'T HAVE MONEY IN STOCKS. EVERY PENNY WE MADE WAS TO PAY THE BILLS AND TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILIES. PUT CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AND ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IN THE MARKET? THAT IS WHY I HAVE A DIFFERENT MEASURE BY WHICH I JUDGE THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. MY MEASURE IS SCRANTON, DULUTH, HERMANTOWN, PLACES WHERE I GREW UP AND SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW GREW UP. I SEE HARD-WORKING WOMEN AND MEN JUST TRYING TO EARN AN HONEST DECENT LIVING AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. THEY JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE, A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE TO JUST SEE AROUND THE CORNER. THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE LITERALLY FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. MOST DO. BUT HOPE FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE. NOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SEEING THESE WOMEN AND MEN, THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WORKERS WHO STOCK THE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS AND DRIVERS WHO DROVE THE TRUCKS AND DELIVER THE FOOD. FARMWORKERS, NURSES WHO RISK THEIR LIVES AND IN MANY CASES GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND WHEN THEY WALK DOWN THE STREETS AND PEOPLE CAME OUT AND CLAP HANDS AND POTS TOGETHER TO TELL THEM HOW MUCH THEY ARE APPRECIATED, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. JUST ASKING FOR A SHOT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. SO IT'S ABOUT TIME WE START TO PAY ESSENTIAL WORKERS FOR THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK THEY ARE READY. THEY ARE READY TO INSIST THAT MINIMUM WAGE BE $15 AN HOUR. THEY ARE READY TO INSIST THAT PEOPLE HAVE CHILD CARE AND ACCESS TO IT. THERE READY TO ADMIT AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE , THAT AVERAGE AMERICANS HAVE. THAT IS WHY MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, IN FACT MY ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, IS BUILT AROUND A SIMPLE COMPLEX. IT IS TIME TO REWARD HARD-WORKING AMERICA, NOT WEALTH. REWARD WORK, NOT WEALTH. WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE WEALTH. IT IS NOT THE OPPOSITE NOW. RIGHT NOW, IT IS REWARD WEALTH AND NOT WORK. WE NEED TO REBUILD AN ECONOMY IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 AND AS WE DO WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LONG-OVERDUE INVESTMENTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WEALTHY, THE VERY WEALTHY AND THE BIG CORPORATIONS FINALLY BEGAN TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYBODY. JUST PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. IT IS TIME WE GIVE HARD-WORKING FAMILIES WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY WITH THEIR SKILLS AND THEIR SWEAT AND THEIR BLOOD LIKE THE UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF CARPENTERS AND JOINERS, A LEG UP FOR ONCE. I HAVE A BIG, AMBITIOUS PLAN THAT BETS ON THE AMERICAN WORKER. MY PLAN IS GOING TO GREAT MILLIONS OF GOOD PLAYING JOBS. BUILDING THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS TAXPAYERS' MONEY WE SHOULD SPEND THAT MONEY TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS, MADE BY AMERICAN WORKERS IN AN AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAIN TO GENERATE AMERICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY. MY PLAN WOULD TIGHTEN THE RULES TO MAKE BUY AMERICAN REALITY. DURING MY FIRST TERM ALONE, WE ARE GOING TO INVEST $400 BILLION OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT I HAVE CONTROL OVER IS THE PRESIDENT , AS THE PRESIDENT DURING ADMINISTRATION TO INVEST IN PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS OUR COUNTRY NEED TO MONITOR AND , NEEDS TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO REPLENISH CRITICAL STOCKPILES. TO ENHANCE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WAS JUST GOING THROUGH THE APPRENTICE PROGRAM WITH ONE OF YOUR CARPENTERS. HE WAS SHOWING ME HOW TO READ BLUEPRINTS AND I'M A FRUSTRATED ARCHITECT. I JUST LOVE , MY KIDS YEARS AGO BOUGHT ME A LIGHT BOARD. I HAVE NO PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. BUT I LIKE AND I CARRY AROUND GRAPH PAPER. I'M ALWAYS MAKING UP AND DESIGNING HOMES AND LANDSCAPES. THAT IS MY WAY OUT. SOME PEOPLE CAN PAINT, I CANNOT. HE WAS SHOWING ME THE BLUEPRINTS ON HOW THEY CAN CHANGE SEVERAL WALLS IN A PARTICULAR BUILDING TO CONSERVE AND SAVE ENERGY. AND HE POINTED OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BE ABLE TO READ A BLUEPRINT. I POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT MY BUY AMERICAN PLAN , HE SAID, BY THE WAY, NOT ME, THIS CARPENTER SAID THIS. HE SAID BY THE WAY WE CAN KILL TWO BIRDS OF ONE STONE. WE CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE. HE SAID WE CAN IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT BY USING LESS ENERGY TO OPERATE THIS BUILDING AND CREATE MORE JOBS. I SAID I'M GOING TO SEND YOU A COPY OF MY PLAN. MY SENATE COLLEAGUES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. MY BUY AMERICAN, BUILD AMERICAN PLAN CALLS FOR LITERALLY WHAT WE STARTED IN MY ADMINISTRATION AND COULD NOT FINISH, RETROFITTING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS IN AMERICA THAT ARE LEAKING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF ENERGY NOW. IN THE PROCESS, CREATING THE 4 MILLION JOBS FOR SKILLED LABOR. REPLACING WINDOWS, INSULATION THAT WORKS. MAKING SURE THAT THE UNIT IS TIGHT, INCLUDING RETROFITTING 2 MILLION HOMES. ALL OF IT, DONE AT A PREVAILING WAGE WITH UNION LABOR. CREATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNION CERTIFIED JOBS. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, THAT IS A FACT. THAT IS HOW IT WILL HAPPEN. AND SAVING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF OIL IN THE PROCESS. IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS WHY THE IBEW AND A LOT OF OTHER UNIONS SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE WILL PUT IN 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ALONG OUR HIGHWAYS. WHY? SO WE CAN OWN, OWN, OWN, THE ELECTRIC CAR MARKET. ESTIMATED CREATING 1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN MICHIGAN AND DETROIT AND THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. LOOK, WE COULD OUTCOMPETE ANYBODY IF WE SET OUR MIND TO IT. YOU KNOW, MY INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IS GOING TO REVITALIZE AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HE'S GOING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, RIGHT? HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE SAID WHEN YOU ARE THERE HE HAS A PLAN. HE HAD ONE IN 2017, THAT IS COMING. THEN HE HAD ONE IN 2018, AND ANOTHER ONE IN 2019, AND NOW HE HAS ONE FOR 2020. JUST LIKE HIS NONEXISTENT HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT IS COMING NEXT WEEK. HE HAS NO PLAN. WHEN I GOT STARTED, THIS WAS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. DEALING WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. REPUBLICANS WANTED TO BUILD SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE US FIRST IN THE WORLD AND NOW WE RANK 28TH. JUST LIKE DEMOCRATS DID. IT WAS TOTALLY NONPARTISAN. AND CREATING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST OVER TIME $2 TRILLION TO BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES, PORTS, RIGHT HERE ALONG THIS , THESE GREAT, GREAT LAKES. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND FOR EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD. MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AS WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN FROM HOME BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLAN ON HOW , HE HAS NO PLAN ON HOW TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS. $100 BILLION TO REBUILD CRUMBLING SCHOOLS. HOW MANY SCHOOLS IN AMERICA DO YOU THINK THERE ARE WHERE YOU CANNOT SAFELY DRINK THE WATER FROM THE WATER FOUNTAIN? WERE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ENOUGH VENTILATION IN THE SCHOOL? WHETHER THERE IS LEAKING ENERGY OR STILL HAS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN THE WALLS? IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE SHOULD BE SPENDING THE MONEY TO IMPROVE THOSE SCHOOLS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR TEACHERS. AS I SAID, RETROFITTING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WITH TAX CREDITS THAT WE GIVE THEM AGAIN. ALL DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR. LOOK, I'LL FIGHT FOR WORKERS AND UNIONS AT EVERY STEP WORKING ALL FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT TO ONE PAY PREVAILING WAGE TO . TWO, PRIORITIZE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS IN PLACE BEFORE THE PROJECT STARTS. EMPLOYEE WORKERS FROM REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS. I WILL NOT WATER THEM DOWN LIKE TRUMP TRIED TO DO. PAST THE PRO-ACT TO BLOCK , STOP EMPLOYERS WHO TRY TO BLOCK OR BREAK UNIONS. I WILL DO IT WITHOUT RAISING ANYONE'S TAXES. IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN 400,000 YEAR. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU'RE GOING TO START PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE. NOBODY WHO MAKES LESS THAN $40,000 WILL PAY A SINGLE PENNY MORE IN TAXES UNDER ADMINISTRATION. IN FACT, TENS OF MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WILL GET TAX CUTS WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. WHILE YOU'RE RAISING YOUR CHILDREN AND TRYING TO GET AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE OR BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME OR SAVING FOR RETIREMENT. ALMOST DIRECTLY AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PASSED HIS TAX BILL IN 2017, ALMOST $2 TRILLION INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT. HE WENT DOWN TO MAR-A-LAGO AND HE SAID TO HIS GUESTS THERE THIS IS A QUOTE ON RECORD, ""YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER."" HE'S RIGHT. YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER. WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON MAKING , HOW MUCH DID YOU GET? HOW MUCH RICHER DID YOU GET? MAYBE THE ONLY TIME HE IS TOLD THE PLAIN TRUTH IN HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY. IN 2018, THE YEAR AFTER THAT TAX CUT PASSED 91 CORPORATIONS IN THE FORTUNE 500 PAID NO INCOME TAX. ZERO TAX, ZERO. MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, PAID ZERO TAX. I GUESS YOU GUYS GOT ALL OF YOUR TAXES ELIMINATED TOO, RIGHT? HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE THE LOWEST, GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. GUESS WHAT. INSTEAD, BIG PHARMA CUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS, SENT THEIR MANUFACTURE THOSE DRUGS OVERSEAS AND THEN UNCONSCIONABLY RAISED THE PRICE TO ORDINARY AMERICANS. HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE KNEW YOUR MOTHERS, FATHERS, UNCLES, AUNTS, FRIENDS WHO HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING A PRESCRIPTION, NOT A JOKE, AND PUTTING DINNER ON THE TABLE. NOW HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO CUT DRUG PRICES. LIKE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A HEALTHCARE PLAN. ALL HE HAS DONE, THIS BIG THING ABOUT HE IS CALLING THE DRUG PRICES CUT. ALL HE IS DONE, HE SENT TO THE HHS, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, HE SAID STUDY THE ISSUE. I HAVE A CLEAR PLAN. I GUARANTEE I'LL LOWER PRICES IN AMERICA FOR DRUGS BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICES WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD DO. THE HOUSE AND SENATE WERE READY TO DO IT AND HE SAID HE WOULD VETO IT IF HE GOT IT. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH MEDICARE FOR THE PRICE OF THAT DRUG. TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PRICES. AND FOR ANY NEW SPECIALTY DRUGS THAT DON'T HAVE COMPETITION THAT ARE LAUNCHED, I'M SETTING UP A REVIEW BOARD TO RECOMMEND A REASONABLE PRICE BASED ON THE BOARD'S EVALUATION. AND THAT PRICE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE INCREASED BEYOND THE COST OF MEDICAL INFLATION UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY'VE GONE AND DONE SOME MORE RESEARCH AND CHANGED THE NATURE OF THE DRUG. AND NOW ASTONISHINGLY, AND WITH , WHEN MY STAFF TOLD ME THIS, I KNOW BOTH THE SENATORS DO THIS, BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THIS I SAID HE CANNOT BE PROPOSING THIS. HE NOW IS PROPOSING, IN THIS BUDGET, ANOTHER MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CUT TAX FOR THE VERY WEALTHY MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. HERE'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. HE WANTS TO LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX DOWN TO 15%. TO 15%. EVERYONE OF YOU, INCLUDING THE REPORTERS IN THIS ROOM, UNLESS YOU ARE MAKING A LOT MORE THAN I THINK YOU WERE, EVERYONE OF YOU IS GOING TO BE PAYING AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING $1 BILLION OFF THEIR INVESTMENT. YOU'RE GOING TO PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE. BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY BY INVESTING, NOT BY THE SWEAT OF THEIR BROW. ANOTHER TAX CUT WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND WHO, WHOSE HIDE DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? THE DEFICIT IS ALREADY BONKERS. WHERE DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF? IT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF YOU AND THE PROGRAMS AND THE THINGS THAT HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . LIKE I SAID, IT'S ABOUT TIME WE START REWARDING WORK AND NOT WEALTH. I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. BUT, DAMMIT, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATE AMERICA START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. THAT IS ALL. JUST PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. SO HARD-WORKING FAMILIES CAN CERTAINLY BREAK ON ELDERLY CARE, CHILD CARE, BUYING THE FIRST HOME, THE COST OF EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, BEING ABLE TO GET STARTED IN LIFE. BY THE WAY, WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO RIP AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE. THIS WHOLE THING, SAYING HE HAS A NEW HEALTHCARE PROGRAM AND PROTECT CONDITIONS. HE IS IN THE SUPREME COURT SAYING GET RID OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF YOU GETTING INSURANCE BECAUSE IT HELPS INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND AS A GIMMICK, HE HAS A NEW ONE. HE IS GOING TO END THE PAYROLL TAX THAT YOU PAY ON SOCIAL SECURITY. YET THE ACTUARY AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MAY GET A FEW MORE BUCKS ON YOUR PAYCHECK AND THEN GO HOME AND TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD SOCIAL SECURITY IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END. THEY NEVER LIKED SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TO BEGIN WITH. SO LOOK, WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. LET SOCIAL SECURITY RUN DRY BY 2023. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER EVER BEEN UNABLE TO DO SOMETHING WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER. SO IT IS TIME TO STAND UP, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I SAID ITS LAST NIGHT AND THE CALLINGS I KNOW, SOME DEMOCRATS GET MAD THIS. I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. BUT I'M GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOT PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'VE'VE GOT TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR IT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO TAKE HIM ON BECAUSE HE'S SO VINDICTIVE, THEY ARE READY TO WORK. IT IS TIME TO TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK, FOLKS. AND IT'S GOING TO START HERE. TODAY, WITH VOTING IN MINNESOTA. SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

CSPANJB209202095	Joe Biden	2020-09-20	Joe Biden Remarks on Replacing Justice Ginsburg	"GOOD MORNING, GUYS, MR. ALLOTT. REGARDING THE NOMINATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT IF CHUCK SCHUMER WERE THE MAJORITY LEADER IN 2016 THAT MAYOR GARLAND WOULD BE ON THE COURT RIGHT NOW, SO THERE IS NO DISPUTING THAT. NUMBER TWO, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD FIND THIS INTERESTING, YOU KNOW, THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN PLAYING A CLIP OF JOE BIDEN SAYING THAT ""WE BELIEVE IN TRUTH AND NOT FACTS,"" AND THEY ARE SAYING IT IS A GAFFE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A GAFFE, I BELIEVE IT WAS A FREUDIAN SLIP. GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO THE CONSTITUTION CENTER. I HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF BEING A GUEST HERE. IT IS A PERFECT PLACE TO MAKE A SPEECH I'M ABOUT TO MAKE. I ATTENDED NASA EARLIER TODAY AND PRAYED FOR JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG AND HER FAMILY. THE NATION LOST AN ICON. THEY ALSO LOST A GRANDMOTHER AND MATRIARCH. WE KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS, TO WATCH A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL ABSORB THE CRUELTY AND PAIN OF THE DREADFUL DISEASE OF CANCER. I SPOKE TO HER DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER LAST NIGHT, EXPRESSING ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY'S SORROW, PARTICULARLY MY GROWN GRANDDAUGHTERS, ONE OF WHOM WAS A STUDENT OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S DAUGHTER. THEY MAKE CLEAR TO ME, DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER, THAT UNTIL THE VERY END JUSTICE GINSBURG DISPLAYED THE CHARACTER AND COURAGE YOU WOULD EXPECT OF HER. THEY SAID SHE HELD THEIR HANDS AND GIVE THEM STRENGTH AND PURPOSE TO CARRY ON. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT SHE PASSED AWAY ON ROSH HASHANAH. BY TRADITION, A PERSON WHO DIES DURING THE JEWISH NEW YEAR IS CONSIDERED A SOUL OF GREAT RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT WAS RUTH BADER GINSBURG , A RIGHTEOUS SOUL. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TO PRESIDE OVER HER CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AND STRONGLY SUPPORT HER ASCENSION TO THE SUPREME COURT AND. JUSTICE GINSBURG ACHIEVED A STANDING A FEW JUSTICES HAVE OR EVER WILL. SHE BECAME A PRESENCE IN THE LIVES OF SO MANY AMERICANS. I AGREE WITH WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID. SHE DID AS MUCH TO ADVANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND JUSTICE FOR WOMEN AS JUSTICE MARSHALL DID FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YES, THERE WAS HUMOR IN MENTIONS OF THE NOTORIOUS RBG AND HER IMPRESSIVE EXERCISE ROUTINES, BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE. SHE WAS , TO USE AN OVERUSED WORD , A TRAILBLAZER. A ROLE MODEL. A SOURCE OF HOPE AND A POWERFUL VOICE FOR JUSTICE. SHE WAS PROOF THAT COURAGE AND CONVICTION AND MORAL CLARITY CAN CHANGE NOT ONLY THE LAW, IT CAN CHANGE OUR CULTURE , IT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IN THE DATE , THE DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD , EXCUSE ME , SHE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND TOGETHER WE CAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE FOR JUSTICE IN HER NAME. HER GRANDDAUGHTER SAID YESTERDAY , AND SAID PUBLICLY, THAT HER DYING WORDS WERE, ""MY MOST FERVENT WISH IS THAT I NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENT IS INSTALLED."" AS A NATION, WE SHOULD HEAT HER FINAL CALL, NOT AS A PERSONAL SERVICE TO HER, BUT AS A SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY, AT A CROSSROADS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE, CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, THE ENVIRONMENT, EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS, IMMIGRANTS, WOMEN, WORKERS. AND RIGHT NOW OUR COUNTRY FACES A CHOICE. A CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL COME BACK FROM THE BRINK. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES TODAY. WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE NEWS OF HER PASSING, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO REPLACE JUSTICE GINSBURG WOULD RECEIVE A VOTE IN THE SENATE. WITHIN ONE HOUR OF HER PASSING. THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAID WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHEN HE NOMINATED MAREK TO REPLACE JUSTICE SCALIA IN 2016. AT THAT TIME, MAJORITY MCCONNELL MADE UP THE RULE BASED ON THE FICTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NOMINATION IN AN ELECTION YEAR TO THE COURT. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. THE ONLY RULE I EVER FOLLOWED RELATED TO THAT WAS THE CONSTITUTION'S OBLIGATION FOR SENATORS TO PROVIDE THEIR ADVICE AND THEIR CONSENT TO A PRESIDENTS JUDICIAL NOMINEE. BUT HE CREATED A NEW RULE, THE MCCONNELL RULE. ABSOLUTELY NO HEARING, NO VOTE, FOR A NOMINEE IN AN ELECTION YEAR. . PERIOD. NO CAVEATS. MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS AGREED WITH HIM, INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THE TIME. INCLUDING THE CURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WHO AT THE TIME, SAID, ""I WANT YOU TO USE MY WORDS AGAINST ME IF THERE IS A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN 2016 AND A VACANCY OCCURS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE FIRST TERM. YOU CAN SAY, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID, LET THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE, MAKE THE NOMINATION. AND YOU COULD USE MY WORDS AGAINST ME AND YOU WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT."" THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICAN SAID WHEN JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AWAY. ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE ELECTION DAY THAT YEAR. NOW, WE LOST JUSTICE GINSBURG ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS BEFORE AN ELECTION AND AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN CASTING THEIR VOTE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE 40% OF AMERICANS WILL HAVE VOTED BY THE FIRST. TENS OF MILLIONS. YOU CANNOT UNRING THE BELL. HAVING MADE THIS THE STANDARD, TO SERVE THEIR INTERESTS, THEY CANNOT FOUR YEARS LATER CHANGE COURSE WHEN IT DOES NOT SERVE THEIR ENDS. I AM NOT BEING NAIVE. I AM NOT SPEAKING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. I AM NOT SPEAKING TO MITCH MCCONNELL WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS AND HE DOES. I AM SPEAKING TO REPUBLICANS OUT THERE, SENATE REPUBLICANS, WHO KNOW DEEP DOWN WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY AND CONSISTED WITH THE CONSTITUTION AS I STAND HERE IN THE CONSTITUTION CENTER. NOT JUST WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR PARTY. I SPEAK FOR A MILLION AMERICANS , MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OUT THERE WHO ALREADY VOTED AND CONTINUE TO VOTE AND WILL HAVE MANY MORE BY THE TIME THE PROCESS IS FINISHED. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO VOTED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS IN LIVING MEMORY, TRUMP IS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO STRIP HEALTH CARE FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF HE SUCCEEDS, ONCE AGAIN DISCRIMINATE OR DROP COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES, CANCER, AND SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS. PERHAPS, MOST CRUELLY OF ALL, IF DONALD TRUMP HAS HIS WAY, COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19, WHICH ARE WELL BEYOND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 200 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED , 200,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED BY THE TIME I FINISH THIS TALK. BUT LUNG AND HEART DAMAGE COULD BECOME THE NEXT DENIABLE PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FOR OVER 6 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ALREADY CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE VOTING ALSO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT NEARLY HALF A CENTURY OF LEGAL PRECEDENT OVERTURNED. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. MILLIONS OF DREAMERS WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING EXPELLED FROM THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN. MILLIONS OF WORKERS, UNION WORKERS, WHO ARE AT RISK OF YOU , LOSING THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE DEMANDING THEIR VOICES BE HEARD, THAT EQUAL JUSTICE BE A GUARANTEE FOR ALL, NOT JUST SOME. THEY KNOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW. VOTERS IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE HEARD. VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER, THERE WILL BE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS WHO ALREADY VOTED. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, ALL VOTES IN THE NATION WILL BE HEARD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS APPOINTMENT. IT IS NOT ABOUT THE PAST. IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR FUTURE RIGHT NOW. AS THEY VOTE. TO JAM THE NOMINATION THROUGH THE SENATE IS JUST AN EXERCISE IN RAW POLITICAL POWER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE OF THE NATION WILL STAND FOR IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT POWER. PURE AND SIMPLE. POWER. THE VOTERS SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR ON THIS ISSUE, AS WITH SO MANY OTHERS, THE POWER IN THIS NATION RESIDES WITH THEM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE VOTERS. EVEN IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO PUT FORWARD A NAME NOW, THE SENATE SHOULD NOT ACT UNTIL AFTER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SELECT THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT. THEIR NEXT SENATE. THE SENATE SHOULD MOVE ON DONALD TRUMP'S SELECTION AND WAY THE NOMINEE HE CHOOSES FAIRLY. IF I WIN THIS ELECTION, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. AS A NEW PRESIDENT, I SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO NOMINATES JUSTICE GINSBURG'S SUCCESSOR. THE NOMINATION GET A FAIR HEARING IN THE SENATE BEFORE A CONFIRMATION HEARING , VOTE, AFTER A CONFIRMATION HEARING. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. WE ARE PROBABLY PASSING 200,000 DEATHS TO THIS VIRUS. TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED. HEALTH CARE IN THE COUNTRY HANGS IN THE BALANCE OF THE COURT. AND NOW THEY HAVE DECIDED TO JAM A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH THE SENATE. VOTERS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN CASTING THEIR VOTES. IN THE MILLIONS. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE WILL KNOW WHO THE VOTERS OF THE NATION HAVE CHOSEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE VOTERS ONE CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD ON WHO SERVES ON THE COURT. THERE IS NO COURT SESSION BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE ELECTION. THAT MOMENT IS NOW FOR THE VOTERS TO GET A CHANCE TO BE HEARD AND THEIR VOICES SHOULD BE HEARD. THEY WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS ABUSE OF POWER. THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ABUSE. THERE IS NO CAN , NO DISCUSSION ON THE EVE OF AN ELECTION OR THE LAME DUCK DONALD TRUMP LOSES. JUSTICE GINSBURG, WHAT HAPPENS? BUT THAT DISCUSSION ASSUMES WE MOVE THIS EFFORT TO PREVENT THE GRAVE WRONG JUST , THAT MCCONNELL IS PURSUING HERE. I BELIEVE THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD AND WILL BE HEARD. THIS FIGHT, THIS NOMINATION, WILL NOT BE OVER UNTIL THE SENATE VOTE. WINNING THAT VOTE, IF IT HAPPENS, IS EVERYTHING. ACTION AND REACTION, ANGER AND MORE ANGER. THAT IS THE CYCLE OF , THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS WILL CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE AS THEY GO DOWN THIS DANGEROUS PATH THAT THEY PUT US ON. WE NEED TO DEESCALATE, NOT ESCALATE. IT IS WHY I APPEALED TO THE FEW SENATE REPUBLICANS, WHO REALLY WILL DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS. PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR CONSCIENCE. DO NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM ANYONE NOMINATED , DO NOT GO THERE. UPHOLD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, YOUR CONSCIENCE. LET PEOPLE SPEAK. WE CANNOT KEEP REWRITING HISTORY AND SCRAPPING NORMS, IGNORING OUR CHERISHED SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. THAT INCLUDES THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF RELEASING THE LIST OF NOMINEES THAT I WOULD PUT FORWARD, AND THEY SAID BIDEN SHOULD RELEASES LIST AFTER RUTH BADER GINSBURG PASSED AWAY. IT IS A GAME FOR THEM. IT IS A PLAY TO GIN UP EMOTIONS AND ANGER. THERE IS RECENT , A REASON WHY NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS EVER DONE , FIRST, PUTTING A JUDGE'S NAME ON A LIST LIKE THAT COULD INFLUENCE THAT PERSON'S DECISION-MAKING AS A JUDGE AND THAT WOULD BE WRONG. ANYONE PUT ON A LIST LIKE THAT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL ATTACKS. ANY NOMINEE I WOULD SELECT WOULD NOT GET A HEARING UNTIL 2021 AT THE EARLIEST. SHE WOULD ENDURE THOSE ATTACKS FOR MONTHS ON END WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DEFEND HERSELF. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF I WIN, I WILL MAKE MY CHOICE FOR THE SUPREME COURT NOT JUST ON PARTISAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT ON WHAT PRIOR PRESIDENTS HAVE DONE, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, AND I HAVE SERVED MANY OF THEM. ONLY SEEKING THEIR ADVICE AND ASKING , IT SAYS ADVISE AND CONSENT. THE PRESIDENT IS THE PERSON WHO GETS TO NAME SOMEONE. AS EVERYONE KNOWS, I MADE IT CLEAR THAT MY FIRST CHOICE FOR THE SUPREME COURT WILL MAKE HISTORY AS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN JUSTICE. BUT I WILL CONSULT WITH SENATORS OF BOTH PARTIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND CIVIL LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY. THE CHOICE WILL BE MINE AND MINE ALONE, BUT IT WILL BE THE PRODUCT OF A PROCESS THAT RESTORES OUR FINEST TRADITIONS, NOT THE EXTENSION OF ONE THAT HAS TORN THE COUNTRY APART FOR YEARS. LET ME CONCLUDE WITH THIS. AS I SAID IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE FACE HISTORIC CRISES. A ONCE IN A GENERATION PANDEMIC, A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC RECESSION . THE RISE OF WHITE SUPREMACY UNSEEN SINCE THE 1960'S, AND A RECKONING ON RACE THAT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT CHALLENGING CLIMATE, A CHANGING CLIMATE RAVAGING OUR NATION AND THE WORLD AS WE SPEAK. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS WILL TOUCH EVERY PART OF THESE CRISES , EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES AND FUTURE. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS TO ADD A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT PLUNGES US DEEPER INTO THE ABYSS , DEEPER INTO THE DARKNESS. IF WE GO DOWN THIS PATH, I PREDICT IT WILL CAUSE IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE. THE INFECTION THIS PRESIDENT HAS UNLEASHED ON OUR DEMOCRACY, ENOUGH. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES, EVERYBODY. WE DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING. BUT WE HAVE TO REASON OUR WAY THROUGH WHAT AILS US, AS CITIZENS, AS VOTERS, AS PUBLIC SERVANTS, THAT IS THE CONSTITUTION. WE HAVE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND MUTUAL GOOD WROTE , MUTUAL GOODWILL IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT CONFRONTATION. THIS NATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY RUTH BADER GINSBURG BUT WE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE INSPIRED BY HER BUT GUIDED BY HER. BY HER WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO THOSE WITH WHOM SHE DISAGREES. TO RESPECT OTHER POINTS OF VIEW. JUSTICE GINSBURG GOT ALONG WELL WITH SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE COURT. SHE DID IT WITHOUT COMPROMISING HER PRINCIPLES, OR LOSING HER CORE PRINCIPLES. IF SHE COULD DO THIS, SO CAN WE. HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER MATTERS. HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER MATTERS. RESPECTING OTHERS MATTERS. JUSTICE GINSBURG PROVED IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SPINE OF STEEL. BUT ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OPEN HAND AND NOT A CLENCHED FISH , FIST TO THOSE WITH WHOM WE DISAGREE. THIS NATION NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT OVERCOME AND NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO WANT TO THE , TO DIVIDE THE NATION BETWEEN RED AND BLUE STATES, REPRESENTING THOSE STATES THAT VOTE FOR HIM AND IGNORING THOSE WHO DON'T. I DO NOT. I CANNOT. I WILL NOT FILL THAT , I WILL NOT BE THAT PRESIDENT. I WILL BE THE PRESIDENT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. FOR THOSE WHO VOTE FOR ME AND THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME. WE NEED TO RISE TO THE MOMENT, FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE SO DEARLY. FOR HIS VERY SOUL. MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND MAY GOD BLESS RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THANK YOU SO MUCH."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476046-1/joe-biden-remarks-replacing-justice-ginsburg	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks on the next steps in replacing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death was announced two days prior. Speaking from Philadelphia&rsquo;s National Constitution Center, Mr. Biden said President Trump should hold off naming a nominee to the nation&rsquo;s highest court until the results of the 2020 election are known. He called on U.S. senators including Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to make a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; choice to hold off on any confirmation activities until after the election as well.

CSPANJB219202096	Joe Biden	2020-09-21	Joe Biden Campaign Remarks in Wisconsin	FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO TALK ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND HIS ECONOMIC PLAN. THIS STOP MARKED HIS SECOND VISIT TO WISCONSIN. A CLOSE RACE IN THE STATE BETWEEN HIM AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THEY SAY, AND PART OF MY CITY, YOUR FAMILY DONE GOOD. A LONG TIME. GOD LOVE YOU. GIVE YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THIS QUICKLY, TRYING TO REACH A TRAGIC MILESTONE. 200,000 DEATHS RECORDED, AS OF TODAY BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS. 200,000 DEATHS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. EMPTY CHAIRS AND UNDOING TABLES, KITCHEN TABLES THAT WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WERE FILLED WITH A LOVED ONE, A MOM, DAD, BROTHER OR SISTER. IN MANY CASES, THE PAIN WAS MADE A LOT WORSE. I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THIS WITH CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY TELLING ME BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO VISIT THEIR ELDERLY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT IN THE NURSING HOME BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY STORIES I HEARD FROM THE NURSES, SAYING THEY HELD UP THE CELL PHONE TO THE PATIENT ON THE VENTILATOR, IN THE BED. THAT IS ALL THEY CAN SPEAK TO. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO HOLD FUNERAL SERVICES WHERE THEY COULD PRAY TOGETHER AND REMEMBER THE LOVED ONES THAT THEY LOST. SO MANY OF THE RITUALS HAVE COME TO HELP US COPE WITH PAIN AND LOSS, TO HELP US HONOR THE LIVES OF THOSE WE LOVED. THEY ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WHAT WORRIES ME NOW IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC FOR SO LONG, THAT I WORRY THAT WE RISK BECOME NUMB TO THE TOLL THAT IS TAKEN ON US AND OUR COUNTRY, AND COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LOSE THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE SORROW, LOSS AND ANGER FOR SO MANY LIVES LOST. WE CANNOT LET THE NUMBERS BECOME STATISTICS AND BACKGROUND NOISE, JUST A BLUR IN THE NIGHTLY NEWS. THEY ARE NO LONGER WITH US. SO MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED SOONER. BACK IN MAY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RELEASED A STUDY SAYING IF WE HAD ACTED ON MONTH SOONER, WE WOULD HAVE SAVED 70 LIVES. THE LEADING MODEL BEING USED TO TRACK THE VIRUS, THAT MODEL SAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THIS YEAR, WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WILL LOSE UP TO 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES. IT POINTS OUT THAT IF WE ACT BY DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN WISCONSIN, WEARING A MASK AND MAKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD SAVE OVER 115,000 OF THOSE LIVES. I HOPE TO GOD WE WILL NOT HAVE TO LEARN THE SAME BAD LESSON WE LEARNED THE FIRST NINE MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST LOSSES OF AMERICAN LIFE IN HISTORY. SADLY, IT IS NOT OVER. AS AWFUL AS THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN, IT COULD BE WORSE. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT 178,000 LIVES LOST. ALL THE PRESIDENT DOES IS DELIBERATELY CHANGE THE SUBJECT. IT IS INFURIATING. WE COULD SAVE LIVES, IF WE JUST TAKE SIMPLE STEPS. STILL, THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WE WATCHED TIM HOLDEN INDOOR RALLY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT KNEW OF THESE DANGERS BACK IN FEBRUARY. HE HID IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW BAD IT WAS. THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ANY FLU, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO US PUBLICLY. PUBLICLY, HE TOLD US IT WAS JUST LIKE THE FLU AND THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE WARM WEATHER. IT WAS ALL A LIE. HE KNEW IT. WHAT WAS HIS EXPLANATION? HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PANIC. TRUMP PANICKED. THE VIRUS WAS TOO BIG FOR HIM. WITH THIS CRISIS, A REAL CRISIS THAT REQUIRED SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP, HE WAS NOT UP TO IT. HE FROZE. HE FAILED TO ACT. AMERICA HAS PAID THE WORST PRICE OF ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING. WE DO NOT PANIC. UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE IT CRYSTALLIZES HIS WHOLE WORLDVIEW. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO CREATE A PANIC, HE WAS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH PANIC. HE WAS WORRIED THAT IF HE TOLD THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH, THERE WOULD BE A PANIC OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. HE SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HARD WORK. YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE, ALL YOU CAN SEE IS WALL STREET. YOU THINK WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY? YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP THANKS THAT HANDING OUT A TAX GIVEAWAY, PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY QUALIFIERS IS AN ECONOMIC PLAN? YOU THINK LIKE TRUMP THAT $15 IS TOO MUCH FOR AMERICA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS? ELIMINATED OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. TRY TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR 130 BILLION AMERICANS. PROPOSED A PLAN, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD, YOU WILL GET A LITTLE BUMP IN YOUR PAY, BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE OUT WITHHOLDING FOR YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT GUESS WHAT? SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF HE DOES THAT, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MIGHT GET THAT OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK, A LITTLE MORE IN YOUR PAYCHECK, BUT GUESS WHAT? TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD, SAY GOODBYE TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE GOT OUT OF IT, A LOT OF DAIRY FARMERS AND MANUFACTURING WENT UNDER, BUT GUESS WHAT? STARTING A TRADE WAR THAT A SURGE IN BANKRUPTCY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? I DID NOT KNOW THIS AT FIRST. AMERICA'S BANK GOT TO OPEN UP IN BEIJING. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BEFORE. LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE HAD A DEAL, BUT HE WANTED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BEFORE THEY LOWERED THE PRICES, TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS UNETHICAL. HE ASKED THEM TO SEND OUT $100 CHECKS WITH HIS NAME ON IT TO THE ELDERLY. SAYING THAT IS THE DOWN PAYMENT. THEY SAID, GOOGLE NOT DO THAT. THE DEAL FELL APART. NOW, SOME 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE TAX RATE ALL OF YOU PAY IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN BILLIONAIRES WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY ON INVESTMENTS. HE WANTS TO LOWER AGAIN, LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX. SOMEONE WHO MAKES THEIR MONEY OFF THE MARKET IS PAYING THE 50% RATE. IT DEPENDS ON THE TAX BRACKET. CLEWISTON PERCENT. THIS TAX CUT WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WHO IS HYDE DOES IT COME OUT OF? DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE SAYING HE WOULD REPRESENT THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT ONLY DID HE FORGET THEM, THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER REALLY RESPECTED US VERY MUCH. HE LOVES HIS RALLIES. THE NEXT TIME HE HOLDS ONE, LOOK CLOSELY. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM ANYONE IN THE RALLY. THOSE WHO COME ARE TIGHT AS CAN BE, RISKING DISEASE, BUT NOT TRUMP. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE. A REPORTER TRIED TO COME UP AND HE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. I DO NOT GET CLOSE TO THESE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IN THE CROWD RISKS THEIR LIVES, BUT NOT HIM. NOW WE KNOW WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE IN HIS RALLIES. A FORMER EMPLOYEE SAID HE CALLS HIS EMPLOYEES DISGUSTING. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS. THAT IS THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND NOT RESPECT. DO NOT KID YOURSELF. THIS IS A ONE-WAY STREET. NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THE WAY HE SPOKE ABOUT MANY OF YOU BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED YOUR NATION IN UNIFORM. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY EVERY OUTLET THAT HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS AND SUCKERS. THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED AND MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. MY SON SERVED AS A VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. HE COME , CAME HOME DECORATED AND DIED OF CANCER. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE SERVED VOLUNTEERED. JUST LIKE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I HAVE DEALT WITH PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP MY WHOLE LIFE. HE LOOKED DOWN ON US BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN YOU, GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN THEIR LIFE AND SQUANDERED IT. GUYS WHO STIFF ELECTRICIANS AND CONTRACTORS JUST TO PUT A FEW MORE BUCKS IN THEIR POCKET. THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID PAYING THEIR TAXES BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THE REST OF US, THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAN PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE COUNTRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT US TO KNOW WHAT HE PAID? HE HAD TO SUMMON THEM OVER. THEY SHOW THAT HE PAID ZERO. HE PAID ZERO, NOTHING. THAT IS A FACT. AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? THIS IS WHY I REALLY DO NOT LIKE GUYS LIKE THIS. HE SAID, IT MAKES ME SMART. PUT ANOTHER WAY, I AM NOT A SUCKER. WHY SHOULD I PAY? ZERO. WALL STREET IS A LONG WAY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY THERE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNION LABOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. I LEARNED A FEW SIMPLE LESSONS FROM MY PARENTS THAT I NEVER FORGOT. ONE IS FROM MY MOTHER. GENERALLY, REMEMBER, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR THE , EQUAL. IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND WE SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. I GOT MY BACK UP RECENTLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I SAW ON NATIONAL TELEVISION ABOUT THE RACE. I DO NOT BUY IT. JOE BIDEN WILL BE ONLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO DID NOT GO TO AN IV LEAGUE SCHOOL , IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL IN A LONG TIME. SOMEHOW, IT MEANT THAT I COULD NOT BELONG. HOW COULD A GUY WHO WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL BE PRESIDENT? I HAVE TO ADMIT, I SAID IT. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. HE CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME. YOU THINK I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH? I AM GOING TO BUST DOWN THAT DOOR. A LOT OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR STANDING. I SAY, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT A STATE SCHOOL PRESIDENT SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IF I AM SITTING THERE, YOU WILL BE SITTING THERE TOO. ANOTHER LESSON, I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. MY DAD LOST A JOB UP WE HAD TO MOVE WE HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND A, CAN JEAN AND THE KIDS STAY WITH YOU FOR ABOUT A YEAR? I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I HAVE A JOB IN DELAWARE. I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. TALK ABOUT PRIDE. HE USED TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WHAT YOU DO MATTERS. YOU MATTER. I DO NOT WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE START TO REWARD WORK. NOBODY MAKING LESS THAN FORTON THOUSAND DOLLARS , $400,000 IN THIS COUNTRY WILL SEE THEIR TAXES GO UP. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU WILL START TO PAY MORE. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. MANY OF THEM ARE PAYING ZERO. THEY TAKE NO TAX AT ALL. HOW CAN THAT BE FAIR? THE PRESIDENT TALKS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS. THE BILLIONAIRES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SEEING THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $800 BILLION. ALL THE BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA, DURING THE PANDEMIC, THEIR NET WORTH, COMBINED HAVE INCREASED BY $800 BILLION. THE REST OF US? 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED. 20 MILLION AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOME. SEVEN PLUS MILLION AMERICANS ARE WORKING PART-TIME, WHO WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. EVICTIONS ARE ON THE RISE. FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, THE KIDS ARE AT HOME AND NOT AT SCHOOL. IT IS THE WORKING PEOPLE WHO KNEW HE'D , WHO NEED A TAX BREAK. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. I SAID IT MANY TIMES. NEED TO I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST PRAISE OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. MY PLAN WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60%. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OBAMA AND I PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE IT A LOT MORE AFFORDABLE TO HAVE THAT HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER LABOR UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT DIDN'T SAY IN THE 1930'S, YOU CAN'T HAVE LABOR UNIONS. IT SAID WE SHOULD PROMOTE LABOR UNIONS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID, AND I WILL. ONE MORE THING. UNDER MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH UNION WORKERS AND PREVAILING WAGE, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL DO IT BY ENFORCING A REAL BUY AMERICAN PLAN. LOOK, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT $600 BILLION A YEAR IN PURCHASING POWER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EVERY YEAR FROM TAX DOLLARS AND DETERMINES HOW IT'S USED. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOD WILLING, AMERICAN COMPANIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AMERICAN PRODUCTS USING AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAINS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHO GET THE CONTRACTS. THAT MEANS AMERICAN ALUMINUM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR DEVELOPING MORE WIND AND SOLAR AND HYDROELECTRIC POWER. ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL REPLACE CARS IN THE FEDERAL FLEET. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FLEETS IN THE WORLD, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT THEM ALL TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GUESS WHAT? THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING MUCH MORE LIGHTER FRAMES, MORE ALUMINUM FOR AUTOMOBILES THAT ALREADY IF THEY ARE ALUMINUM BUILT, THEY CAN REDUCE BY 15%, EVEN WITH A COMBUSTION ENGINE. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND HOUSING. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK, INCREASED WORK AT HOME. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRANSFER 40 MILLION BUILDINGS AROUND AMERICA TO MAKE THEM WEATHER RESISTANT SO THEY ARE CHANGE THE WINDOWS, DOORS, WALLS, THE WHOLE RANGE. BUILDING BACK BETTER MEANS FIRING UP OUR SHUTTERED FOUNDRIES AND MOVING FORWARD TO BUSINESS THAT IS TRULY MADE IN AMERICA. I WANT TO SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING TO THOSE WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP LAST TIME. WHEN I WAS OUT HERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, YOU VOTED FOR US. THEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY CHANGED, AND THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP LAST TIME. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, BELIEVED YOU WEREN'T BEING SEEN, REPRESENTED OR HEARD. I GET IT. IT HAS TO CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT WILL CHANGE WITH ME. YOU WILL BE SEEN, HEARD, AND RESPECTED BY ME. THIS CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT WINNING VOTES, IT'S ABOUT RESTORING THE BASIC DIGNITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERY WORKER DESERVES. BASIC DIGNITY WE ALL HAVE WITHOUT WINNING BACK HEARTS AND SOUL OF AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE DEATH COUNT APPROACHING 200,000, THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE SAID , I WON'T QUOTE HIM. THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BLUE STATES RUN BY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS AND JUST LOOK AT THE RED STATES, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE DOING QUITE WELL. NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S A SIMPLE FACTUAL MATTER, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IF YOU COUNT ALL THE DEATHS IN THE RED STATES, WE ARE NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD IN DEATHS JUST BEHIND BRAZIL. BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, IT REFLECTS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP THAT HE HAS A DEEPLY FLAWED AND DIVISIVE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS NATION AND THE JOB HE HOLDS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING. IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, STATES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS, YOU'RE NOT HIS PROBLEM. HE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT, YOUR FAMILY OR WELL-BEING. I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I DON'T PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES OF AMERICA, I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ONE NATION UNDER GOD FOR REAL. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I'M NOT GOING TO GOVERN AS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT. I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT SOMETIMES TO SOME IN MY PARTY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO FIGHT AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME AS THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS HAS TO BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT ANGER AND DIVISION AND THE DARKNESS THAT'S OVERTAKEN THIS COUNTRY BEHIND US. WE HAVE TO PUT IT BEHIND US. I KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED SINCE I ENTERED PRIMARIES ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE CAN. WE'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES IN OUR HISTORY. WE'VE BEGUN ANEW. IF WE GET CONTROL OF THIS VIRUS, WE CAN. WE CAN REWARD WORK. WE CAN FIX THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE CAN BE A SAFE AND JUST NATION. WE CAN DEAL WITH THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH ALUMINUM IS GOING TO BE A GIGANTIC PART OF. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, ONE NATION. ONE NATION. ONE PEOPLE. ONE AMERICA. WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN OUR LONG HISTORY, THERE'S BEEN NOTHING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO , NOTHING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT GOING ALL OVER THIS NATION, WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. WE HAVE TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. THAT'S GOING TO BE MY PRIMARY JOB. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Y'ALL STAY SAFE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, MA'AM. APPRECIATE IT. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) WITH THE ONGOING GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN MANY SCHOOLS SHIFTING TO ONLINE LEARNING, THE STUDENTCAM COMPETITION GIVES STUDENTS A PLATFORM TO ENGAGE IN A NATIONAL CONVERSATION.

CSPANJB239202098	Joe Biden	2020-09-23	Joe Biden Campaigns in Charlotte, North Carolina	"GOOD AFTERNOON. OR GOOD MORNING. IT'S STILL GOOD MORNING, I BELIEVE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT ON THIS FABULOUS CHARLOTTE FALL DAY TO HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON THAT WE WILL HOPE TO SEE IN JANUARY, ON A STAGE, BEING INAUGURATED AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. [APPLAUSE] BUT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CONVERSATION, WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE IN CAMP NORTH END, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE CREATIVITY FLOURISHES. THE ARTISTS THAT HAVE WORKED ON THE ART THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY, WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THEM. THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT GIVE SO MUCH, AND THEY DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE. IN A PANDEMIC, WE OUGHT TO BE REWARDING PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK THAT MAKES US BETTER PEOPLE, AND THAT'S WHAT ARTISTS DO. SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE DAMMIT WESLEY. IS DAMMIT AROUND? OKAY. GIANNA MCCANTZ. WHERE'S GIANNA? GIANNA? CARLA LOW AS, GARRISON, MARCUS, FRANK, AND JOHN HARRISON. THEY HAVE DONE A MURAL THAT SAYS ""CAMP NORTH IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH , CAROLINA , BUILD BACK BETTER."" AND WE ALL KNOW WHOSE PLAN THAT IS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. I AM GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH, SOMEONE THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT IS A BIG PROFESSIONAL BOWLING FAN, THAT LIKES MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, BUT I'LL LET YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU REALLY KNOW HIM FOR. SO THANK YOU, LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT GUEST. (music) [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LYLES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE HOME. YOU GUYS KNOW I WAS IN A BUBBLE FOR A WHILE RECENTLY. MAN, THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. BEING BORN AND RAISED IN NORTH CAROLINA, THIS IS HOME FOR ME. ALWAYS WILL BE HOME FOR ME. AND SO TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND TO JUST HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS, WE HAD A CONVERSATION IN THE BACK AND I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT HOW GRATEFUL AND PRIVILEGED I AM TO BE A PART OF THESE TOUGH, DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME. BEING A PARENT, HAVE AN 11 YEAR OLD SON, A EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, THESE TIMES ARE VERY CRUCIAL AND VERY IMPORTANT. I CAN'T EXPLAIN ENOUGH HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED. AND YOU GUYS BEING HERE, EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RESPECT. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RESPECT. SO TEACHING MY KIDS ABOUT RESPECTING THE OFFICE, HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS, AND THAT'S WHY THIS ELECTION IS IMPORTANT. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SAY, ""MY VOTE DOESN'T COUNT."" I COME FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE YOU LIVE AND STUFF SAY, ""IT DOESN'T MATTER. AS BLACK PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW, IF I VOTE, WHAT'S GOING TO REALLY CHANGE? WE STILL GOT THE SAME RESTAURANTS ON THE CORNERS. WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING PLACES TO EAT. OUR HOMES, THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE, RIGHT?"" SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN REALLY ENFORCE OUR POWER IS BY VOTING. VOTING. SO THIS CONVERSATION IS UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT. SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE SO THAT WE CAN ASK SOME REAL QUESTIONS. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB WITH CHRIS. HE IS MR. PRESIDENT. HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNION. MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS KIDDING HIM. YOU KNOW, THE HARDEST THING, ONLY THING HARDER THAN BEING PRESIDENT OF A UNION IS BEING THE MAYOR OF A BEAUTIFUL CITY. FOLKS, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE EVEN HAVE AN ASTRONAUT IN OUR HOUSE AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK CHRIS AND THE MAYOR FOR BEING HERE, AND ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. OVER 200,000 AMERICANS HAVE PASSED AWAY. OVER 200,000, AND THE NUMBER IS STILL RISING. THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES IS BAD ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT PARTICULARLY BAD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. ALMOST FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY, THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CATCH THE DISEASE, COVID, AND WHEN IT'S CAUGHT, TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE AS WHITE AMERICANS. IT'S SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF THE INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME, IS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. YOU HAVE 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE FIGURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PAY THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT THIS MONTH, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OR NOT DO AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, AND YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROWN OUT IN THE STREET BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT. ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A REPRIEVE FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WHEN IT COMES AROUND. HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO DO THAT? AND THE WAY, IN FACT, THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND THE SENATE STEPPED UP AND PASSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS, INCLUDING KEEPING BUSINESSES OPEN AND THE LIKE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THEY INSISTED THERE BEING A THING CALLED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOMEBODY WATCHING WHERE EVERY DOLLAR WENT. THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DID IS FIRE THAT INSPECTOR GENERAL. THERE IS NO INSPECTOR. HE'S FIRED. FIRED. AND SO YOU'VE GOT ONLY 40% OF THE MONEY INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ONLY 40% OF IT. 60% HAS GONE TO THE MAR-A-LAGO CROWD. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE IS VERY MUCH IN DOUBT, ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE JUST PASSED A PACKAGE TODAY. MY GENERIC POINT IS, THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA POINTED OUT, THAT IF IN FACT THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW NOW HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS BACK IN FEBRUARY , HE IS ON TAPE WITH BOB WOODWARD SAYING HE KNEW HOW BAD IT WAS AND HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. IF HE HAD SPOKEN, AS I SAID, THEY SAID AT COLUMBIA, ONE WEEK EARLIER, 37,000 MORE PEOPLE BE ALIVE TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER INFLUX OF CASES, JUST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT'S EXPECTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEPENDING ON WHICH ESTIMATE YOU , TAKE, BETWEEN 138000 AND 178,000 MORE DEATHS. AND IF PEOPLE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE, AND WHEN YOU'RE AT A SOCIAL DISTANCE, AS I AM, YOU CAN TAKE A MASK OFF, BUT WEAR A MASK. THEY ESTIMATE THAT WOULD SAVE ABOUT CLOSE TO 90,000 PEOPLE. 89,000, AND SO IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. AND WE'RE NOT BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK A CYCLE. THE CYCLE THAT EXISTS IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE FINDS ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMIC HEAP, BUSINESSES AND OTHERS, WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD. WHEN THINGS GET BAD, THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES IN THE HOLE. AND WHEN THINGS GET BETTER, THEY'RE THE LAST ONES OUT. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS SIGNIFICANT REPAIR. AND WE'RE JUST ONLY BEGINNING, SLIGHTLY, TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS NOW. AND THIRDLY, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS PERSON, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, EVERY PERSON OUT THERE WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT FOR THEIR FAMILY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, ""EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY."" HE SAID ""JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A , LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. BEING ABLE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.'"" FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT ABLE TO BE DONE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY, IS HOW DO WE BUILD WEALTH? ULTIMATELY, ULTIMATELY THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY ONLY IS GOING TO HAVE ITS PLACE EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE WHEN THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH, BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH. AND THAT GOES FOR EVERYTHING FROM ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME, ACCESS TO JOBS, ACCESS TO JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EVEN SHOT. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT TODAY. IT GOES TO EDUCATION, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ACCESS BEYOND. EVERYTHING FROM A LOT OF POOR WHITES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS, POOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS LIVE IN TITLE I DISTRICTS, MEANING THAT THEY LIVE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW TAX BASE. RIGHT NOW WE SPEND $15 BILLION A YEAR TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT LOW TAX BASE. I INCREASED THAT TO $45 BILLION. BUT IT DOESN'T KEEP TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT TEACHERS SIGNIFICANTLY. 125,000 TEACHERS SHORT RIGHT NOW. BE OVER HALF A MILLION BY 2023. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLS, IN THE OLD DAYS, USED TO HAVE 1 , NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY, WE VIRTUALLY HAVE NO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO TEACHERS COME IN TO SCHOOL AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. WELL, THERE'S ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1,507 KIDS IN SCHOOL. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500. WE CAN DO THAT BY INCREASING THE MONEY I JUST TALKED ABOUT FROM 15 TO 45. AND SEND EVERY SINGLE CHILD THAT'S THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD, NOT TO DAYCARE, BUT TO SCHOOL. ALL THE STUDIES OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES IN THIS STATE AND EVERY OTHER HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THAT'LL INCREASE BY 58% THEIR CHANCES OF GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT THE ZIP CODE THEY COME FROM, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE, AND BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, I THINK A BIG ISSUE HERE IS ACCESS TO APPRENTICESHIPS AND ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COLLEGE, AND THE STUDENT DEBT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE. HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY ONE BIG, IMPORTANT THING, HOW DO WE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THIS IS A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY. AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, THE BLINDERS HAVE SORT OF BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW. THEY LOOK OUT THERE AND WE HAVE A PANDEMIC, UNEMPLOYMENT, RACE RELATIONS HAVE JUST BEEN DRAWN INTO FOCUS EVERYTHING FROM , POLICE BRUTALITY TO LACK OF ACCESS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN, AVERAGE PEOPLE HAVE GONE, ""MY LORD. HOLY MACKEREL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD."" A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT DID. BUT A LOT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD. WELL, I WON'T GO INTO IT. I'M TALKING TOO MUCH NOW IN MY OPENING STATEMENT, BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT IS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY, A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. BUT I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TURNED OFF. I BELIEVE NO MATTER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR, BUT EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA, EARLY VOTING. THEY HAVE FOUR-HOUR LINES IN THE FIRST DAY, AND WE'RE OVER 40 DAYS OUT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. THEY WILL NOT BE DISSUADED. SO THAT'S WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC. I WAS ASKED BY ONE OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS, WHEN I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, THEY SAID, ""CAN YOU DEFINE AMERICA FOR ME?"" I SAID, ""YES, I CAN, IN ONE WORD. POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES."" WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I THINK WE GOT A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEAR 2020 TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. WITH THAT, AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, I'M GOING TO HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST QUESTION WE ARE GOING TO ASK FROM OUR HOMETOWN STAR DUST CHRIS FAR FROM A STAR, BUT : APPRECIATE IT. MY FIRST QUESTION, YOU SORT OF SPOKE ABOUT EDUCATION. AND FOR ME, I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO AN HBCU. AND YOU, RIGHT DOWN THE STREET , NORTH CAROLINA IS KNOWN FOR HAVING A LOT OF HBCUS. MY QUESTION WOULD BE, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S NOT PROPERLY FUNDING, SORT OF GOING UNDER, SO WHAT COULD YOU DO FOR THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES? I WAS KIDDING CHRIS INSIDE. I WAS SAYING AS LONG AS I CAN SAY WHAT THE BEST HBCU IS IN AMERICA, DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. THAT'S A JOKE, BUT IT'S NOT A JOKE. THEY'RE GREAT. THAT'S HOW I GOT MY START, BY THE WAY. I WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE. BUT THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY STATE IN TERMS OF SEGREGATION AND IN TERMS OF DR. KING BEING ASSASSINATED. PART OF THE, MAJOR PART OF OUR CITY WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. THAT'S HOW I GOT ENGAGED. AND A LOT OF MY SUPPORT CAME OUT OF THAT HBCU. LOOK, RIGHT NOW, ONE THING ALL THE DATA SHOWS IS THAT, GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY, AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING THAT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CAN'T DO THAT A WHITE AMERICAN CAN DO, THAT A HISPANIC-AMERICAN, AN ASIAN -AMERICAN , NOT A SINGLE THING. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED? IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS. NOW, AN AWFUL LOT OF UNIVERSITIES, GREAT UNIVERSITIES LIKE UNC OR WAKE FOREST, A LOT OF SCHOOLS, THEY HAVE ENDOWMENTS, AND THE ENDOWMENT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO BID FOR THESE MAJOR FEDERAL INITIATIVES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BRING INTO THE SCHOOL A TECHNOLOGY OR A PROGRAM THAT IS ABLE TO BRING IN OUTSIDE SPONSORS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT SPONSORS, AND THEN HAVE STUDENTS WORK IN THOSE AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, CYBERSECURITY. CYBERSECURITY IS A BIG DEAL, BUT YOU HAVE TO , IN THE FUTURE, THERE'S GOING TO BE MILLIONS OVER TIME, GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE AREA OF CYBERSECURITY. BUT BECAUSE THE HBCUS, FOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC , THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENDOWMENT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE FACILITIES THAT CAN ATTRACT THE ENVIRONMENT, THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS PRIVATE ENDOWMENTS, THEY DON'T GET TO SET THESE UP. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, WE WENT DOWN TO ROANOKE AND WE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR AN HBCU TO HAVE A CYBERSECURITY PROPOSAL. THEY DID IT. THEY GOT THE CONTRACT. NOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING ARE TRAINING YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN WHO WILL GET OUT IN GOOD STARTING JOBS, JOBS WHERE YOU CAN END UP BEING PAID MORE THAN A HUNDRED GRAND A YEAR. AND THEY'RE FULLY, TOTALLY, THOROUGHLY CAPABLE. SO WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE PROPOSED , AND WE WILL GET THIS GET THIS DONE, I PROPOSED A 10 YEAR, $70 BILLION PROGRAM FOR HBCUS. THAT $70 BILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HBCUS BASED ON THEIR COMPETITION TO GET ACCESS TO IT, BUT EVERYONE WILL QUALIFY. EVERY HBCU. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS OTHER UNIVERSITIES TO. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY, THE PRESIDENT IS A YOUNG GUY, BRILLIANT GUY. THE RESULT IS WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE MAKES AN APPLICATION FOR DEALING WITH SOLAR ENERGY, BECAUSE IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT BASE, IT GETS A SIGNIFICANT INJECTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY, OR LIGHT METALS. STORAGE FACILITIES LONG AGO, THEY TOOK OVER A FACILITY LONG AGO. THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN THAT FACILITY WHO ARE NOW DOING METALLURGY THAT RELATE TO MAKING LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM AND METAL DECKS FOR AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. IT IS A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR AND WILL END UP BEING A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT. THE PEOPLE WHO GET TO WORK ON THAT, THE STUDENTS, THEY WILL GO OUT AND GET THESE GREAT JOBS. THAT IS THE FIRST THING I WILL DO FOR HBCUS. SECONDLY, WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BRING IN HBCUS TO ENGAGE IN MORE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THE GUYS THAT ARE COSPONSORS OF MY CAMPAIGN, THEY TALK OF THEMSELVES AS MORGAN MEN. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING RIGHT HERE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR YOU THE ABILITY TO GET TO THOSE UNIVERSITIES. HOW CAN YOU DO IT? I WILL SEE TO IT THAT ANY FAMILY, ANYONE WHO COMES FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES A TOTAL INCOME OF LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR GETS FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY DON'T GET IN. IF THEY GET IN AND QUALIFY, THEY PAY NOTHING TO GO TO COLLEGE. SECONDLY, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS THAT EXIST NOW THAT IF YOU PROVIDE FOR THE WORK, THAT YOU WILL VOLUNTEER TO DO SOMETHING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND YOU DO IT FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE, YOU CAN DEDUCT $10,000 A YEAR UP TO $50,000 OFF OF THAT DEBT YOU HAVE. AND YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT HAVE GRADUATED. THE AVERAGE DEBT IS ABOUT $19,000 A YEAR. WELL, IT'S HARD AS HELL TO GET STARTED. HARD TO GET STARTED WHEN YOU HAVE THAT DEBT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD. THE AVERAGE DEBT IS EVEN HIGHER. IT'S UP TO $28,000 A YEAR, SOMEONE GRADUATING FROM A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL. AND THAT'S WHY THE ECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED PRIOR TO, AND I'LL END WITH THIS, I'M TELLING YOU TOO MUCH, BUT BECAUSE I'M PRETTY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF, IT WAS POINTED OUT BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS, THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN BECAUSE THE ENTIRE GENERATION, THIS FROM 9/11 GENERATION THROUGH TO THE GENERATION NOW, AND COMING OUT OF THIS, THIS GOD-AWFUL CIRCUMSTANCE WE'RE IN, THEY, IN FACT, ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL BECAUSE OF STUDENT DEBT TO BE ABLE TO BORROW THE MONEY TO BUY A HOME, BUY A NEW VEHICLE, BUY AN APARTMENT, AND SPEND THE MONEY AND CAPITAL, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMPTION, BY CONSUMPTION. AND THIS GENERATION, THIS WHOLE NEW GENERATION FROM 9/11 ON, THAT IN FACT IS, THEY'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. SO THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS THAT ECONOMICALLY THIS WILL BENEFIT. THIS ISN'T JUST DRAINING MONEY. AND BY THE WAY, I PAY FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS BY THE WAY, I DEAL WITH THE TAX STRUCTURE. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. SO THAT'S A PIECE OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING WITH HBCUS. AND SECONDLY, I WILL, IN MY ADMINISTRATION, ELEVATE, ELEVATE THE STANDING OF HBCUS BY THE PEOPLE IN MY ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU, SO I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE SOMEONE THAT MIGHT HAVE A QUESTION FOR THIS FORUM. YES. HANNAH BONAPARTE: HI. THERE'S A MICROPHONE RIGHT THERE, AND THERE'S ONE ON THIS SIDE AS WELL. HANNAH BONAPARTE: HI, I'M HANNAH BONAPARTE. I JUST WAS LIKE WONDERING WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE? WE'RE GOING TO RAISE IT TO $15 AN HOUR NATIONALLY. I'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN RAISING IT AS I'VE GONE AROUND THE COUNTRY WORKING WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT IN FACT HAVE RAISED IT, INCLUDING NEW YORK CITY AND OUT ON THE WEST COAST, AS WELL. HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK, YOU'RE MAKING A WAGE UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL. NO ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE WORKING FOR A 40-HOUR WEEK JOB AND STILL BE LIVING IN POVERTY. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT IF WE PAY PEOPLE $15 AN HOUR AS A MINIMUM WAGE, YOU GROW THE ECONOMY. THE IDEA THAT THIS SOMEHOW PUTS PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE, IF YOU'RE MAKING 15 BUCKS AN HOUR INSTEAD OF $7 AN HOUR, YOU'RE ABLE TO BUY MORE THINGS. YOU'RE ABLE TO PAY MORE BILLS. YOU'RE ABLE TO DO MORE THAT ENDS UP INCREASING THE GDP, THE GROWTH OF THE WHOLE ECONOMY. SO IT'S NOT ONLY A GOOD THING FOR THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE MAKING A DECENT WAGE FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, ""GOD LOVE YOU, DEAR."" [LAUGHTER] ANDREA BROWN: IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU, CHRIS, FOR BRINGING UP EDUCATION AND THE HBCUS, BUT AS FAR AS K-12 EDUCATION, HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PUSH ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL EQUITY? WELL, AS A SIMPLE PROPOSITION FOR ME, I DON'T EXAGGERATE AS A SECOND GRADE TEACHER, WHY YOU'RE SO IMPORTANT. IF I HAD ONLY $1 TO SPEND IN EDUCATION AND I COULD SPEND IT POST-GRADUATION OR PRE-KINDERGARTEN, I'D SPEND IT PRE-KINDERGARTEN. NOT A JOKE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO BASED ON YOUR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, THAT 60% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN IS ALREADY DEVELOPED BY THE TIME THEY'RE THREE, FOUR, FIVE YEARS OLD. ANDREA BROWN: RIGHT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, PEOPLE START OFF BASED ON THEIR ZIP CODE AND THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND. THEY MAY START OFF WAY BEHIND THE CURVE. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO THEY COME INTO SCHOOL, IF THEY COME FROM A VERY POOR BACKGROUND IN A COMMUNITY RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM OR A SINGLE DAD, THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, THEY WILL HAVE PROBABLY HEARD 1 MILLION FEWER WORDS SPOKEN BY THE TIME THEY GET TO FIRST GRADE. THAT BY ITSELF IS AN IMPEDIMENT. NOBODY'S FORCED THAT ON ANYBODY, BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE IT. AND SO THE WAY TO CHANGE IT IS THREEFOLD. NUMBER ONE, AS I SAID, PROVIDE FOR EARLY EDUCATION, STARTING AT THREE YEARS OF AGE, AND IT'S NOT , THIS IS YOU THINK, ""OH MY LORD, WHY WE HAVE A THREE-YEAR-OLD GO TO SCHOOL?"" THEY LEARN AS RAPIDLY AS A SIX-YEAR-OLD, A 12-YEAR-OLD, A 14-YEAR-OLD. AND THEY JUST SUCK IT ALL UP. THEY JUST SUCK IT ALL UP. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY TEACHERS ENOUGH MONEY TO STAY IN THE BUSINESS OF TEACHING. MY WIFE'S A FULL-TIME TEACHER. MY WIFE HAS NEVER STOPPED. AS FIRST LADY, AS THE SECOND LADY, I SHOULD SAY, SHE TAUGHT 15 CREDITS EVERY SEMESTER AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BEFORE THAT, SHE TAUGHT JUNIORS AND SENIORS IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR 25 YEARS. I THINK IT WAS 25. MY POINT IS, A LONG TIME. ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL THE EXACT NUMBER BECAUSE MY WIFE IS 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM. I STARTED OFF NOT QUITE THAT MUCH. THERE'S NO WOMAN IN THE ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY AS OLD AS ANY MAN, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THE FACT IS THAT IT IS THE LIFEBLOOD , PEOPLE, THEY SAY, THESE CHILDREN , THEY ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT. IT'S BIZARRE, CRAZY FOR US. IN EVERY SINGLE EMPIRICAL STUDY DONE, THE MORE MONEY YOU SPEND, THE BETTER YOU EDUCATE A CHILD THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, THE BETTER THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS. EVERYBODY, ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S WHY WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR MORE DIRECT FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS. AS YOU KNOW, BETTER THAN MOST WILL KNOW, THE BULK OF ALL THE FUNDING, IF YOUR SCHOOL USES LOCAL FUNDING IT'S NOT NATIONAL FUNDING. IT'S NOT FEDERAL FUNDING. BUT FEDERAL FUNDING CAN FOCUS ON PARTICULAR NEEDS WITHIN SCHOOLS. ONE OF THOSE IS ACCESS TO EQUAL EDUCATION IN THE EARLY GRADES AND NOT BE DETERMINED BY YOUR ZIP CODE. THAT REQUIRES US TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON SCHOOLS THAT IN FACT, AND , TEACHERS LOOK, I'M NOT , GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU MAKE. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ALL THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A STUDENT BODY WHERE THERE'S STUDENTS OF COLOR, IT MAKES A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE IF THERE ARE TEACHERS OF COLOR, PARTICULARLY MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR. MR. BIDEN: A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE. IT'S JUST A FACTUAL PREDICATE. WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR TO GET IN AND TEACH. THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO RAISE THE SALARIES. RAISE THE SALARIES. I MEAN, IDEA THAT A TEACHER IS OUT THERE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS MAKING $40,000 YOU HAVE, , PROBABLY, A STUDENT DEBT LARGER THAN THAT. ENOUGH, FOR REAL. THAT'S WHY THE LAST PIECE OF THE STUDENT DEBT. ANYBODY WHO HAS A STUDENT DEBT WHO TEACHES, THAT COUNTS AS WORKING FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST. YOU GET TO DEDUCT OF THAT $10,000 STUDENT DEBT PER YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS, AND UP TO $50,000 IF YOU'RE TEACHING. WE CAN AFFORD THIS, BY THE WAY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE , JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE IDEA HERE. I CARRY THIS CARD WITH ME BECAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS, ""WELL, BIDEN'S GOING TO RAISE ALL TAXES, AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE , "" LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND IT. IF I HAVE IT HERE. ANYWAY, I HAVE A LIST OF HOW I WILL FUND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE JUST MADE CORPORATIONS NOT PAY 21%, AND 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAY NO TAX, ZERO, ZERO, OKAY, NONE , IF WE JUST MADE THEM PAY 28%, IT USED TO BE 38%, WE MAKE THEM PAY 28%, AND EVERYBODY HAD TO PAY IT, THAT WOULD RAISE A TOTAL OF $1,370,000,000,000. I'M NOT TRYING TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT'S TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. PRESIDENT HAS A NEW PROPOSAL. SOME OF YOU MAY LIKE IT. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD KNOW IT WORKS VERY WELL, AND THAT IS ANOTHER $30 BILLION TAX CUT FOR BILLIONAIRES. YOU THINK I'M MAKING IT LIKE BILLIONAIRE. I SOUND LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, ""BILLIONAIRES ARE BAD. "" THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. PROBLEM IS IN REDUCING THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX, IF YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY OFF INVESTMENTS AS OPPOSED TO SWEATING YOUR BROW OR WALKING UP AND GETTING A PAYCHECK, RIGHT, HE THINKS YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY 15% OF YOUR INCOME. YOU'LL PAY MORE AS A SCHOOL TEACHER THAN SOMEBODY MAKING $20 MILLION BUCKS. IT'S ALL COMING FROM INVESTMENTS. IT'S NOT RIGHT. DON'T WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. JUST ABOUT TIME EVERYBODY PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE WAY I DO THAT IS I RAISE THE TAX BACK FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES TO 39.4%. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 90%. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT WAS 39.4% WHEN BUSH WAS PRESIDENT. YOU JUST RAISE THAT TAX RATE BACK UP TO 39.4%. THAT RAISES 6%. THAT RAISES $90 BILLION. JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S MUCH MORE I COULD TALK, BUT MY POINT IS IT WILL NOT BY THE WAY, I WENT TO UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL. I WAS VERY FLATTERED THAT, I THINK IT'S 14 NOBEL LAUREATES IN ECONOMICS, JUST ENDORSED ME, AND SAID MY PLANS MAKE SENSE. ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT BIDEN'S GOING TO BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY AND BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND $400 BILLION, AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, NOT TRUE. WE CAN DO IT ALL BY JUST SOMEBODY JUST STARTING TO PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL. GIVE PEOPLE WHO NEED A BREAK, A BREAK. THANK YOU. HELLO. NICE TO MEET YOU. MY NAME IS SUBRINA COLLIER. MY HUSBAND AND I, CHEF GREG COLLIER, OWN RESTAURANTS HERE IN CHARLOTTE. ONE, UPTOWN YOLK, AND ONE HERE IN CAMP NORTH END, LEAH AND LOUISE. AS YOU KNOW, THE RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN HIT SEVERELY HARD THE PAST , I THINK IT BE SEVEN MONTHS NOW? A LOT OF US, WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND SMALL MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS, DIDN'T RECEIVE AS MUCH RELIEF, NATIONALLY. THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE HAS BEEN AMAZING WITH OFFERING GRANTS AND THINGS THAT WE CAN FLOAT US OVER AND STILL PAY OUR EMPLOYEES, BUT WE STILL HAD TO CUT STAFF. WE STILL HAD TO CUT HOURS. WHAT WOULD BE THE RELIEF FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, SPECIFICALLY RESTAURANTS? IS THERE A PLAN TO GIVE US SOME TYPE OF RELIEF? I DON'T KNOW, A TAX CUT, ANYTHING. YES. THERE WAS A BIG PLAN TO DO IT. THERE'S A MODAL PLAN. FIRST OF ALL, THE CARES ACT, WHICH PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE, WHICH WAS A TOTAL OF $2 TRILLION OVERALL, TWICE, WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE WHAT THEY CALLED THE MAIN STREET LENDING PROGRAM. FOR FOUR MONTHS, IT DIDN'T LEND A PENNY. NONE OF THE MONEY WENT OUT, NUMBER ONE, BECAUSE YOU GOT 20 REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE WHO SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO DEPEND ANYTHING ON ANYTHING, FOR REAL. THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS, AS I SAID, FIRED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING FOR CERTAIN. SECONDLY, ON THE EARLY PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THE SMALL BUSINESS IS DEFINED OF FEWER THAN 50 EMPLOYEES. NOW, MOST SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NEIGHBORHOOD SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 10 OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. WHAT I PROPOSE IS WE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT IN FACT PROVIDE FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THE PAYROLL FOR THE 10 OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. THAT'S A PRIORITY, AND THEN 50 AND UNDER. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT NOT ONLY HAS THAT NOT OCCURRED, A LOT OF THE MONEY HAS GONE TO VERY BIG BUSINESSES THAT DIDN'T , I MEAN, THEY MAY NEED IT, BUT THEY DIDN'T NEED IT TO STAY ALIVE. EVEN WHEN THEY GOT IT, WHAT DID THEY DO? THE COMMITMENT THAT I PROPOSED, AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD DONE, IS THAT RIGHT NOW, IF YOU GET A GOVERNMENT BAILOUT, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, ""LOAN TO STAY ALIVE,"" WHAT YOU CANNOT DO IS TAKE THAT MONEY AND EITHER BUY BACK YOUR OWN STOCK AND, OR INCREASE YOUR SALARIES WITH THAT MONEY. IT'S TO KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED, KEEP THEM ON A PAYROLL. SECONDLY , AND THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE DONE. THEY BUY BACK THEIR OWN STOCK, INCREASING THE NET WORTH OF THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE STOCK, AND IN FACT, PAY THEIR SALARIES BASED ON STOCK THEN. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, NUMBER ONE, WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY, BAILING PEOPLE OUT. SECONDLY, A LOT OF YOU DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCE. NOW THERE'S NO NATIONAL STANDARDS AS TO HOW TO OPEN. HOW DO YOU OPEN SAFELY? PRESIDENT SAYS, ""JUST PUT UP A SIGN, COME ON IN."" WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR EMPLOYEE. BEYOND YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GO, ""I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, DOES EVERYBODY HAVE TO HAVE THE MASK? DO THEY HAVE DIVIDERS IN THE RESTAURANT? TELL ME HOW THE SANITARY CONDITIONS ARE WORKING."" WELL, WELL, YOU NEED MONEY TO PAY FOR ALL THAT STUFF. THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED TO HAVE A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WHERE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY, NOT BORROW THE MONEY, GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC, INCLUDING FIXING THE TESTING FIASCO. YOU SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOUR EMPLOYEES CAN, IN 24 HOURS, GET A TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. YOU NEED TO DO THAT FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, AND THE PUBLIC LIKES TO KNOW THAT IS PROTECTION THAT THERE ARE PROTECTION AGAINST ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOUR RESTAURANT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MONEY IS ALREADY THERE. THE PRESIDENT IS JUST NOT RELEASING IT. DEPARTMENT IS NOT RELEASING THE MONEY. IT'S ALL DONE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY MOVING. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, OVER 30 MILLION IN UNEMPLOYMENT. HOW IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE GOING TO GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH UNLESS WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE BACK AND HELP YOU GET BACK IN BUSINESS? IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SCHOOLS. HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPENING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NATIONAL STANDARDS SET? NO NATIONAL STANDARDS SET. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS AN OUTFIT , AM I TELLING YOU TOO MUCH? YOU WANT ME TO STOP? OKAY. I'M REALLY GOOD AT THIS. THIS DRIVES ME CRAZY. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, THERE IS NO NATIONAL STANDARD FOR HOW TO OPEN SCHOOLS, HOW TO OPEN THEM SAFELY, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SAYS, ""I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S NOT MY RESPONSE , "" LITERALLY, THAT IS HIS PHRASE. ""IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY. I'M NOT THE BLAME FOR ANY OF THIS. LET THE GOVERNORS OR THE MAYORS TAKE CARE OF IT,"" AND THEN WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL HELP THAT'S NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. I'VE LAID OUT IN DETAIL BACK IN JULY, WHAT WE'D HAVE TO DO TO OPEN SAFELY AND INCLUDES PROVIDING THE PROTECTIVE PPE, THE MASK, AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED, GLOVES, ET CETERA, FOR THE SCHOOLS, THE SCHOOL TEACHERS, AND FOR THE CHILDREN COMING TO SCHOOL. SECONDLY, YOU HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN ONE ROOM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MODULES THAT ARE SMALLER. FOR THAT, YOU NEED MORE TEACHERS, NOT FEWER TEACHERS. YOU GOT TO PAY MORE TEACHERS. NUMBER THREE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SANITIZE THE SCHOOLS, WHETHER IT'S EVERYTHING FROM THE WATER FOUNTAIN TO THE LAVATORY, OR JUST THE SURFACES THAT ARE TOUCHED, AND WHAT IS BREATHED ON BY PEOPLE. THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THAT, LIKE IT WOULD FOR A RESTAURANT AS WELL FOR YOU TO HAVE TO DO THAT. THE MONEY IS THERE, AVAILABLE, TO DO THAT, BUT THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WHAT HE SAYS IS JUST OPEN UP AND MAKE SURE THAT , SCHOOL SHOULD JUST OPEN UP. IT ALSO RELATES TO HOW FAR DOWN YOU'VE GOT THE REINFECTION RATE. IF IT'S DOWN BELOW ONE, THEN IT'S RATIONAL. YOU CAN, WITH THOSE PROTECTIONS, GO AHEAD AND OPEN A SCHOOL, BUT WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY. IT REQUIRES TESTING AND TRACING TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL ON COURSE THERE. LOOK, THE OTHER THING IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE FEMA, THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY , THEY HAD AGREED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PROVIDE MASKS FOR SCHOOLS. THEY STARTED TO HAND THEM OUT TO SCHOOLS. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T LIKE THAT, OR SOMEBODY DIDN'T LIKE THAT. THEY SAID, THE RULING WAS MADE, ""OPENING SCHOOLS SAFELY IS NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY,"" SO THEY STOPPED IT. REFUSING TO EVEN PROVIDE MASKS FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. WELL, IF THIS ISN'T A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS. THE WAY WE'RE DOING THIS IS THE WAY , I WILL END WITH THIS. THE PRESIDENT WAS IN OHIO, I GUESS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AT A RALLY. I DON'T WANT TO MISQUOTE HIM. AND HE SAID AT THE RALLY AND I WROTE THIS DOWN, HE SAID THAT ""WE VIRTUALLY TURNED THE CORNER. NOBODY IS REALLY DYING."" HE SAID, ""YEAH, ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE DYING AND THEY'RE DYING BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEART CONDITIONS,"" OR OTHER, BUT QUOTE UNQUOTE, ""VIRTUALLY, THEY'RE VIRTUALLY NOBODIES. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES DYING."" SO YOU GO HOME AND YOUR MOM IS GONE, YOUR DAD'S GONE. HE'S A VIRTUAL NOBODY? THE IDEA, THE WAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE, AND THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR POWER TO DO SOMETHING. THE VIRUS WASN'T HIS FAULT, BUT THE WAY HE'S HANDLED IT HAS BEEN CLOSE TO CRIMINAL. AND SO MANY PEOPLE BREAKING THEIR NECKS AND BY THE WAY, MY DECEASED WIFE, WHEN I FIRST GOT MARRIED, I MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FROM SYRACUSE, NEW YORK, SKANEATELES, NEW YORK. AND I GOT ELECTED AND I WAS 29-YEARS-OLD. I COME FROM A VERY MODEST FAMILY. NOT BRAGGING ABOUT IT, BUT I WAS LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN CONGRESS FOR 36 YEARS. BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO EARN ANY MONEY WHILE YOU'RE THERE OTHER THAN YOUR SALARY. AND THEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE PRESS OUTLETS SAID, ""IT'S PROBABLE NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN ASSUMING THE OFFICE OF VICE PRESIDENT WITH FEWER ASSETS THAN JOE BIDEN."" I I HOPE THEY WEREN'T TALKING INTELLECTUAL ASSETS. WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29, I WAS IN WASHINGTON BEFORE I WAS SWORN IN AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED. AND MY TWO BOYS WERE NOT LIKELY TO MAKE IT. A TRACTOR TRAILER BROADSIDED THEM WHILE THEY WERE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. AND AT THE TIME, MY WIFE'S FATHER, MY FATHER-IN-LAW, HE CAME HOME FROM WORLD WAR II AND HE HAD OWNED A RESTAURANT. HE WAS A COOK IN WORLD WAR II IN THE NAVY AND HE ENDED UP OPENING UP A RESTAURANT IN A PLACE CALLED AUBURN, NEW YORK, A TOWN ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE, JUST SOUTH OF SYRACUSE. AND IT BECAME THE MEETING PLACE FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S A PLACE THAT DOCTORS WOULD START OFF THE MORNING GETTING THEIR COFFEE AND THE LAWYERS WOULD HAVE THEIR LUNCH AND KIDS AFTER GRADUATIONS WOULD COME TO THIS CALLED THE HUNTER DINERANT , AND THEN HE OPENED UP OTHER RESTAURANTS. AND IN ORDER TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME TO STAY, I DON'T BLAME HIM. I DO THE SAME WITH MY DAUGHTER. TRY TO CONVINCE AFTER HE GRADUATED TO TAKE A JOB IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, RATHER THAN GO BACK TO DELAWARE. HE OFFERED ME HIS PRIZE DINER. AND HE WAS MAKING AT THAT TIME, I WOULD HAVE MADE FIVE TIMES WHAT I MADE AS A LAWYER. A STARTING LAWYER SALARY IS SIX , $6,000 AND IT WAS $30,000 A YEAR. BUT THE PROBLEM WAS FOR THREE YEARS, I HAD FIVE YEARS I WATCHED HOW HARD HE WORKED. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. YOU GOT TO LOVE IT. EVEN IN GOOD TIMES THEY THINK YOU'RE CRAZY. IT'S 24 HOURS A DAY, BUT YOU DESERVE A BREAK AND YOUR EMPLOYEES DESERVE A BREAK. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING SO HARD TO KEEP THEM ON A JOB IS A TESTAMENT TO THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU ARE. BUT I PROMISE YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU IF I'M ELECTED, YOU'LL GET BOTH THE PPE. YOU'LL GET ALSO THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO OPEN AND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY, NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES, BUT TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN PLACE THAT YOU IN FACT CAN. I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF RESTAURATEURS UP AND AROUND THE COUNTRY SO THEY CAN OPEN UP AND DO EVERYTHING FROM HAVING PLASTIC SHIELDS IN FRONT OF THE CASHIERS, TO A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE IT SAFE, MAKE IT SAFE, AND YOU'LL GET THE HELP. I USED TO BE A CITY COUNCIL WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HARD. THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. MALCOLM GRAHAM: EXACTLY. FIRST, I WANT TO THANK YOU. YOU HONORED ME AND MY FAMILY BY SENDING A VIDEO TRIBUTE FOR MY SISTER, CYNTHIA GRAHAM HURD. OH MY LORD, I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T KNOW. I'M SORRY. MALCOLM GRAHAM: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. AS YOU KNOW, KILLED AT THE EMANUEL AME CHURCH SHOOTING IN CHARLESTON. AND SO MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU REIMAGINE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SPECIFICALLY THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION AFTER FOUR YEARS OF TRUMP? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AND I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY IT. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS TURNED INTO THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE LAW FIRM. HE ACTUALLY HAS THEM REPRESENTING HIM ON WOMEN WHO ACCUSED HIM OF RAPE. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF ME. I WILL NOT DIRECT THEM WHO TO PROSECUTE, HOW TO PROSECUTE, WHAT TO PROSECUTE. AND I WILL NOT BE INJECTING. I WILL NOT ENTER THEIR DECISIONS BASED UPON THE JUDGMENTS THEY MAKE ABOUT WHAT CASES THEY BRING AND THEY DON'T BRING. WITH REGARD TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION, I WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TWO THINGS. ONE, CIVIL RIGHTS PRESENCE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ELEVATED SO IT HAS ACCESS TO AND TRANSPARENCY TO ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS' ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. JUST SO THEY ARE AWARE THAT IT'S TRANSPARENT WHAT'S GOING ON. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT I ELEVATE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, EXCUSE ME, THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION TO HAVE A DIRECT OFFICE WITH INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, I'M THE GUY THAT WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED AS VICE PRESIDENT, I SAID, ""I WANT TO HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THAT ACT INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE."" BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE STANDING OF WHATEVER THAT OFFICE THAT COMES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. SO I WOULD MAKE SURE THERE'S A COMBINATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION HAVING MORE DIRECT AUTHORITY INSIDE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND BEING ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THAN IN FACT IT HAS NOW. BUT MOST OF ALL, MOST OF ALL, I WOULD HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS OATH OF OFFICE. IT'S NOT A JOKE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE OATH OF OFFICE THAT IN FACT COULD DO AND MOVE ON WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT HAD TO BE PURSUED WITHOUT MY INTERFERING TO SAY, ""NO, THEY'RE MY FRIENDS"" OR ""I KNOW THEM"" OR ""GO AFTER THIS PERSON. GO AFTER HILLARY,"" YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THIS KIND OF STUFF. I GET ASKED THE QUESTION ALL THE TIME BY THE PRESS THAT TRAVELS WITH ME, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THE SAME ONES THAT ARE TRAVELING TODAY HAVE ASKED IT, BUT I GET ASKED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. ""IF IN FACT YOU GET ELECTED, WOULD YOU PROSECUTE TRUMP? WOULD YOU PURSUE PROSECUTING TRUMP?"" AND THE ANSWER IS, I'M NOT GOING TO PURSUE PROSECUTING ANYBODY. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS SHOULD BE DONE, SHOULD BE DONE AND NOT POLITICIZE IT. IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS THING THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR IS THE POLITICIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT'S BECOME THE DEPARTMENT OF TRUMP AND THAT'S WRONG. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE VERY, VERY HEARTFELT FEELINGS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR HAVING POLICIES THAT REALLY FOLLOW WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TODAY, THANK YOU FOR GIVING US YOUR TIME, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, GIVING US THE CHANGES THAT YOU SEE FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WHO'S THE FELLOW WHO RUNS 26 ORGANIZATIONS FOR HOUSING? PUBLIC? I KNOW WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLY CONSEQUENTIAL. AND I LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PAPER ON THE WAY OUT OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD DO. IT'S VERY DETAILED AND I'D LOVE YOUR FEEDBACK. I'LL PUT A PHONE NUMBER ON IT, OKAY? BECAUSE IT IS A GIGANTIC, GIGANTIC, GIGANTIC UNDERTAKING. AND UNLESS WE CAN GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING, UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE FOR HOUSING, UNLESS WE CAN STOP THE GENTRIFICATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEFT OUT, THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REALLY , I'M NOT TRYING TO BOOST HIM. I'VE NEVER MET THE GENTLEMAN, BUT I DID READ YOUR BIO AND WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. AND I'D REALLY LIKE YOUR INPUT AND MAY ABLE TO CALL YOU IF I COULD, AFTER YOU GET WHAT I'M PROPOSING IN DETAIL AND SEE WHAT WE CAN WORK OUT. AND PART OF THE REASON I DO THIS AND WHAT I MISS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO LARGER ENGAGEMENTS IS THIS IS WHERE I LEARN. I'M A TACTICAL GUY. I MEAN, I'D RATHER BE SHAKING YOUR HAND AND LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND YOU TELLING ME WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND DON'T BE RELUCTANT AT ALL TO CRITICIZED MY PLAN IF YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD. I'VE WORKED ON IT REALLY, REALLY HARD. IT GOES FROM SECTION 8 HOUSING ALL THE WAY TO FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS, TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF THESE , ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU BEFORE I LEAVE, OKAY? YOU'RE VERY POLITE TO SIT HERE ALL THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GROUP PHOTO, SO EVERYBODY HAS THEIR MASK ON AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER ON TOP OF THE LADDER. SO DOES EVERYONE TURN AND MR. VICE PRESIDENT , CHRIS? DON'T JUMP. [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2020] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] IS THIS STILL ON? I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN, EVERY TIME I WOULD WALK OUT OF MY GRANDPA'S HOUSE IN SCRANTON, HE WOULD YELL ""JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH."" AND MY GRANDMA WOULD YELL ""NO, JOEY, SPREAD THE FAITH. WE CAN DO THIS."" WE CAN DO THIS. THANK YOU.

CSPANJB269202099	Joe Biden	2020-09-26	Joe Biden Remarks to U.S. Conference of Mayors	"ALTHOUGH I WOULD ADD THAT THE CONCERNS YOU SEE ABOUT THE COURT RELATE TO CASES WHERE THEY ARE DOWN REALLY DIVIDED. , WHERE THEY ARE NARROWLY DIVIDED. MOST OF THE CASES THE COURT PICKS UP AND HERE'S ARE GOING TO BE DECIDED ON MUCH LARGER MAJORITY BASIS. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAN JUST SIMPLY EXPANDING OR PACKING THE COURT TO GET AROUND A MAJORITY YOU DON'T LIKE. THIS RELATES TO CONGRESS. CONGRESS HAS A LOT OF POWER HERE. THE PEOPLE ARE NOT POWERLESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIRECT SAY OVER WHO SIX IN CONGRESS AND THEY CAN MAKE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN WE LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH JAMES WALLNER TO BRING YOU LIVE COVERAGE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN'S REMARKS AT THE 2020 FALL LEADERSHIP MEETING AT THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. I CAN SAY THAT I DID IT, YOU KNOW, I RAN FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE WE NEED YOU. BUT THE QUALITY OF LIVES IS SO MUCH IT IN YOUR HANDS ON YOUR SHOULDERS THAN ANYONE ELSE, MAKING SURE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE WALKING DOWN THE STREET, MAKING SURE GARBAGE GETS COLLECTED, MAKING SCHOOL SAFES ARE OPENS ARE SAFE AND OPEN. EVERYDAY LIFE THINGS, THEY ARE NOT PARTISAN THINGS, THEY ARE JUST PRACTICAL THINGS. PEOPLE LOOK TO YOU, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALSO ON THE FRONT LINES OF EMERGENCIES, FROM FIRES TO FLOODS TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, HELPING TO SAVE LIVES AS WELL AS LIVELIHOODS. THAT IS WHY I MADE IT A PRIORITY FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU, FROM THE TIME I GOT TO THE SENATE 180 YEARS AGO. [LAUGHS] AS WELL AS MY TENURE AS VICE PRESIDENT. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BECOMING A PRESIDENT, I SPEAK THIS COMMITMENT TO YOU , YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I AM GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, HELPING YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITIES BASED ON WHAT YOU THINK YOU NEED AND THE CHALLENGES YOU ARE FACING. BECAUSE THE PRESENT MAYOR POINTED OUT IT IS ABOUT THE BOTTOM UP. IT DOES NOT GO FROM THE TOP DOWN. WE ARE DEALING WITH FOUR HISTORIC CRISES ALL AT ONCE, A ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC THAT HAS CLAIMED OVER 200,000 AMERICAN LIVES, A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC RECESSION, A LONG-OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE, A CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS RAVAGING COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I NEED NOT TELL IT TO MAYORS IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, AND WASHINGTON STATE. NOT ONE OF THOSE CRISES SHOULD HAVE A PARTISAN DIMENSION. I REALLY MEAN THAT. NOT ONE SINGLE ONE. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, I AM NOT GOING TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO BE THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR AGAINST ME, WHETHER YOUR CITY IS RED OR BLUE, I WILL BE THERE FOR YOU, I PROMISE YOU. LEADING WITH THE FACTS AND WITH REALITY, PUTTING THE WELL-BEING OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FIRST, UNITING PEOPLE AROUND SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. TRAGICALLY, THAT IS NOT HOW THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS WIRED. THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS WITH THIS PRESIDENT IS A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS YOU PERSONALLY. THE DEVISE EVERYTHING INTO RED AND BLUE, BLUE STATES, RED STATES, DEMOCRATIC STATES. I THINK THAT IS WHY THE DAY BEFORE WE HELD 200,000 DEATHS, THE PRESIDENT HELD A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THE VIRUS WAS, QUOTE, ""AFFECT VIRTUALLY NOBODY,"" AND THEN WENT ON TO SAY, QUOTE, "" EXCEPT PEOPLE WITH HEART CONDITIONS AND OTHER PROBLEMS."" TO BE REFERRED TO BY THE PRESIDENT AS ""NOBODY'S,"" ASK THEM ABOUT THE ANTI-SEAT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. KIDS WHO LOST THEIR TEACHERS, FRIENDS AND GRANDPARENTS, COWORKERS, SISTERS AND BROTHERS, THEY WILL NOT SEE AGAIN. THE POLICIES WILL AFFECT ALL OF US, EVERY ONE OF US, IN EVERY COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS MAY BE THE TOUGHEST TIME IN A LONG TIME TO BE A MAYOR, ESPECIALLY A BIG CITY MAYOR, IN FACT, I AM SURE IT IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD. MAYORS HAVE FACED ADVERSITY BEFORE. SOME MAY REMEMBER IN 2008, THE ECONOMY WAS IN FREEFALL. WE WERE LOSING 700,000 JOBS A MONTH BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION. FAMILIES LOST , AND I KNOW YOU REMEMBER THIS , FAMILIES LOST MORE THAN $16 TRILLION , FAMILIES , IN PERSONAL WEALTH. PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER MISSED A MORTGAGE PAYMENT ALL OF A SUDDEN WERE UNDERWATER, BEING FORECLOSED ON, BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES THAT OCCURRED ON OUR STREETS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE VALUE OF THEIR HOME. IT WAS DEVASTATING. WE DID NOT SOLVE IT BY SAYING, ""YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. IT IS WHAT IT IS."" . WITH YOURWE WERE TOGETHER. WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP, WE PASSED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT. KEEPING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB. WE SENT MORE THAN $50 BILLION TO SCHOOL DISTRICT, SAVING MORE THAN 300,000 EDUCATION JOBS. WE PROVIDED MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RELIEF, HELPING FAMILIES TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE, TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOME. WE INVESTED IN THE FUTURE. WE PUT 48 BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, BUILDING 42,000 MILES OF ROAD. NEARLY 27,000 BRIDGES TO GO ALONG WITH THE BIGGEST CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENT IN ALL OF OUR HISTORY. I SAT SAID IT THEN, AND I WILL SAY AGAIN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT YOUR CITY MOST NEEDS. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR STATE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF THAT. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. EVEN CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT WE DID SAVED US FROM A DEPRESSION. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME THE HONOR OF LEADING THE RECOVERY EFFORT, THE FIRST THING I DID, I WENT TO THE MAYORS. SOME OF YOU WERE STILL AROUND THEN. I SPOKE WITH OVER 200 MAYORS. BECAUSE OF YOU, WE CAME THROUGH THE MOMENT TOGETHER. I REALLY MEAN IT. I WAS ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY. THAT AT THE SAME APPROACH WE SHOULD BE TAKING TODAY. IT STARTS WITH THE BUDGET. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. WE ARE GETTING SQUEEZED LIKE NEVER BEFORE. LOCAL SERVICES GETTING PARED BACK, IT IS A POLL JOBS ARE FALLING BY THE WAYSIDE, FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS COMPOUNDING THE DEVASTATION. WE STILL HAVE NO EFFECTIVE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR CURBING THE VIRUS. THIS IS INFURIATING. THE SCIENCE INSISTS WE COULD SAVE 110,000 , WE ARE EXPECTING CLOSE TO 200,000 MORE LIVES LOST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY. WE COULD SAVE 110,000 BY DATE OF JANUARY BY SIMPLY WEARING MASKS. AND THAT IS STRAINING YOUR BUDGETS EVEN MORE, BECAUSE IT KEEPS BUSINESSES FROM OPENING EVEN MORE, IT KEEPS EMERGENCY ROOMS FALL, HOLDING DOWN CITIES FROM SPRINGING BACK TO LIFE. THERE IS NO REASON , NONE , THAT WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE PASSED THE H.E.R.O.E.S. ACT, WHICH PROVIDED $915 BILLION IN LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. IT IS COLLECTING DUST RIGHT NOW IN THE SENATE. THE MAJORITY LEADER, WHO I KNOW WELL, SAYS, ""LET THE STATES GO BANKRUPT."" WE SHOULD HAVE AN LOCAL EMERGENCY FUND THAT DRIVES RESOURCES STRAIGHT TO YOU, EXPANDS YOUR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, REIMBURSES OVERTIME PAY TWO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. WHATEVER YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS , WHATEVER YOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS THE MOST, IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT RESOURCES, THE. THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT FOR JUSTICE, EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY PROTEST, FALLING ON YOU TO KEEP THE PEACE, AND, GOD, IT IS A TOUGH JOB UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE PRESIDENT SCAPEGOATS MAYORS AND FANS THE FLAMES OF VISIONS. DIVISION. WE CAN COMBAT VIOLENCE WHILE STILL ADDRESSING THE PAIN AND ROOTING OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND ALL AS YOU ALL DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME WEATHER , FIRES, FLOODS, SUPERSTORM'S , IT IS LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. YOU KNOW, WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES, TO MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IN SOME PLACES, IT IS ABOUT FLOODING. IN SOME PLACES, IT IS ABOUT THE WIPED OUT BY STORMS, ALONG THE COAST WHERE I LIVE. SOMETIMES IT IS JUST KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE FROM FIRES. BUT IT ALSO IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, MODERNIZING YOUR BUILDINGS AND YOUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, MAKING YOUR COMMUNITY STRONGER, GREENER, BETTER POSITIONED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THAT IS WHAT I PLAN ON DOING. THAT IS WHAT I DID WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAVE YOUR HONOR OF BEING , THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING YOUR PRESIDENT. WHAT WE CANNOT DO IS DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO PIECES. THAT IS THE ONLY STRATEGY THIS PRESIDENT SEEMS TO KNOW, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. IT CAN DISTRACT YOU FROM A PROBLEM, IT CAN CREATE A NEW PROBLEM TO DIVIDE YOUR ATTENTION, BUT I CANNOT ACTUALLY SOLVE ANYTHING. YOU WILL KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. DIVIDING OURSELVES GETS US NOWHERE. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN GOOD FAITH, COMPETENTLY, EFFICIENTLY. WE CAN DISAGREE ON POLICIES. WE HAVE TO COOPERATE. IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THESE CRISES AND ENSURE THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE STILL AHEAD, WHICH I FIRMLY BELIEVE THEY ARE. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, TRIED TO DO IN THIS CAMPAIGN. THAT IS WHERE I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, WORK WITH ALL OF YOU, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS. AS I SAID, IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT , BLUE STATES, RED STATES , IT DOES NOT MATTER TO ME. I PROMISE YOU, EVERY AMERICAN COMMUNITY DESERVES THE FULL SUPPORT OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. LOOK, BEING A MAYOR, AND I AM NOT KIDDING ABOUT THIS, IT IS HARD UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THE WORST THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO IS TO DRIVE WEDGES AND MAKE YOUR JOB TOUGHER BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT BENEFITS HIM OR STIRS UP CHAOS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES YOU DESERVE A PARTNER WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU. WHO WILL WORK WITH YOU. WORK ON YOUR PRIORITIES. SOMEONE WHO GETS YOUR BACK AND SAVES BACK, WORKS TO COVER YOUR BACK, NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE AND NO MATTER WHAT CHALLENGE YOU ARE FACING. YOU KNOW, THIS MOMENT WE ARE FACING NOW IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, IT IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IT SOUNDS CORNY, DOESN'T IT? BUT IT IS TRUE. IT IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IT IS TO OVERCOME ANGER AND DIVISION THAT HAS HELD US BACK FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE CAN EMERGE FROM THESE CRISES. WE CAN DO WHAT WE ARE BEST AT DOING , UNITE, WORK TOGETHER, AND IT STARTS WITH THE MAYORS. AND I REALLY MEAN THAT. IT STARTS WITH ALL OF YOU. I PROMISE YOU, IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, BECAUSE WE NEED YOU TO BUILD BACK AT BETTER. YOU ARE THE FOUNDATION STONE, NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE THE ONES LEADING THE WAY. AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS, OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, MORE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO CITIES THAN OUT OF CITIES. THERE'S SO MUCH , SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THE HATE AND DIVISION, THOUGH. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP POURING FLAMES ON THE FIRE. WE HAVE GOT TO SUPPORT THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL DO. YOU DO IT EVERYDAY. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC , AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME , ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY THAN I AM TODAY. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON NOW. THEY UNDERSTAND. THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THEY WANT TO GET THINGS DONE, AND SO IT IS GOING TO START WITH YOU. I PROMISE I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK. LOOK AT MY RECORD. I HAVE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR IDEAS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FUNNELED UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A STATE LEGISLATURE OR GO THROUGH A GOVERNOR, YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, STRAIGHT TO ME. I REALLY MEAN IT. SO GOD BLESS YOU, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. YOUR JOB IS TOO HARD FOR ME. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR BEING IN THE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE TODAY , LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE TODAY IN OUR VIRTUAL FALL MEETING. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WAS PUT DISSIPATED IN OUR SESSION ON THE PAST TWO DAYS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE NEVILLE, I WANT TO THANK YOU , ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE REACHING OUT TO US HERE IN LOUISVILLE, RAISING TO THE CHALLENGES."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476255-1/joe-biden-remarks-us-conference-mayors	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke at the 2020 fall leadership meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He talked about the importance of local government, the need to address systemic racism, building trust and accountability between communities and law enforcement, and the federal government&rsquo;s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

CSPANJB2792020100	Joe Biden	2020-09-27	Joe Biden Remarks on President Trump's Supreme Court Nomination	"AS THIS HURRICANE WAS BARRELING DIRECTLY INTO GALVESTON, IT WAS PUSHING BEFORE IT AN ENORMOUS WAVE, ESSENTIALLY. AN ENORMOUS MOUND OF WATER. WITH THAT MOUND OF WATER, THE WAVES CRASHING ON TOP OF IT THAT SLAMMED INTO GALVESTON. AND EVENTUALLY TURNED GALVESTON INTO A LAKE. JOE BIDEN SAYS IT IS UNFAIR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MOVING FORWARD WITH JUDGE MERRICK'S NOMINATION AT A TIME WHEN EARLY VOTING IS UNDERWAY. HERE ARE HIS REEFER GOOD AFTERNOON. THE FIRST WOMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN IN HISTORY OF OUR NATION TO LIE IN STATE IN THE U.S. CAPITOL. AND THOUGH IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN NEARLY THIS LONG, TO BESTOW THAT HONOR ON A WOMAN, IT NONETHELESS SPEAKS OF THE IMPACT JUSTICE GINSBURG HAS MADE ON OUR SOCIETY AND HER ENDURING LEGACY OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. SHORTLY BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG PASSED, SHE TOLD HER GRANDDAUGHTER , AND I QUOTE , ""MY MOST FERVENT WISH IS THAT I WILL NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENT IS INSTALLED. "" IT WAS NOT A PERSONAL REQUEST, IT WASN'T A FAVOR BEING ASKED FOR, IT WAS THE LAST ACT OF A LONG, UNFLINCHING CAREER OF STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. NEVER BEFORE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BEEN NOMINATED AND INSTALLED WHILE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ALREADY UNDERWAY. IT DEFIES EVERY PRESIDENT, EVERY , EVERY PRECEDENT, EVERY EXPECTATION OF A NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN AND THE RULE OF LAW REIGNS. BUT YESTERDAY, BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG COULD BE LAID TO REST AND AFTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAD ALREADY CASTED , CAST THEIR BALLOTS, THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED A SUCCESSOR TO HER SEAT. THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO THROW OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN TRYING TO ELIMINATE IT FOR A DECADE. TWICE, THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD THAT LAW, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE CONGRESS, EXPRESSING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAS REJECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS AS WELL. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THEY HAVE FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE TRAGEDY OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S DEATH. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM THAT THE REPUBLICANS SET A PRECEDENT JUST FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THEY DENIED EVEN THE COURTESY OF A HEARING AFTER JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AFTER HE PASSED AWAY NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO THEM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING ON A NEW PRESIDENT AND A NEW CONGRESS HAD BEGUN. ALL THAT DOES MATTER IS THAT THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OVERTURN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR. AS I SPEAK, WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY, A CRISIS HAS TAKEN OVER 200,000 LIVES, BETWEEN 750 AND A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY AND COUNTING. AND YET, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW, AS I SPEAK, TO ELIMINATE THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE ADMINISTRATION FILED A BRIEF IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT CONCLUDES, ""THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL."" THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL. PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN CLAIM ALL HE WANTS THAT HE IS GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THE FACT IS HE IS ALREADY FIGHTING TO TAKE THOSE PROTECTIONS AWAY AS WE SPEAK. IF HE HAS HIS WAY, MORE THAN ONE , THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES, AND CANCER COULD ONCE AGAIN BE DENIED COVERAGE. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD BECOME THE NEXT FLOOD OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS USED AS AN EXCUSE TO DENY COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WOMEN COULD ONCE AGAIN BE CHARGED HIGHER PREMIUMS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. PREGNANCY BECOMING A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AGAIN. SENIORS COULD SEE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES GO UP. AND THE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE GO DOWN. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SEES A CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS EXPLICIT MISSION , STEAL AWAY THE VITAL PROTECTIONS OF THE ACA FROM COUNTLESS FAMILIES WHO HAVE COME TO RELY ON THEM FOR THEIR HEALTH, FINANCIAL SECURITY, AND THE LIVES OF THOSE THEY LOVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST TWEETED AN HOUR AGO ON MY WAY HERE, AND I QUOTE, ""OBAMACARE WILL BE REPLACED WITH A MUCH BETTER AND FAR CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE. IF IT IS TERMINATED IN THE SUPREME COURT, IT WOULD BE A BIG WIN FOR THE USA."" IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT ON SATURDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD NOMINATE JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, AND ON LAY SUNDAY OUT CLEARLY WHAT HIS OBJECTIVE IS, TO TERMINATE OBAMACARE. THE JUDGE HAS A WRITTEN TRACK RECORD OF DISAGREEING ADAMANTLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISIONS, ON TWO OCCASIONS UPHOLDING THE ACA. IN FACT, NOT AS A JUDGE, BUT PRIOR TO GOING ON THE BENCH, SHE PUBLICLY CRITICIZED CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS' OPINION UPHOLDING THE LAW EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT. THEY ARE ALREADY VOTING IN DROVES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF DONALD TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO VOTE, THEY ARE RIGHT , THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR AND WATER, THEIR RIGHT TO EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, WORKERS COULD LOSE THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS, DREAMERS COULD BE THROWN OUT OF THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN, AND WOMEN COULD LOSE THE RIGHTS ENSHRINED IN ROE V. WADE FOR 50 YEARS. PEOPLE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE VERY SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY IS AT STAKE AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT AFFECT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. THEIR VOICES MAY NOT MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP, THEY MAY NOT MATTER TO MITCH MCCONNELL, BUT THERE ARE SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT IF THEY SHUT OUT THE VOICES OF THOSE DURING A VOTING PERIOD, DURING AN ELECTION, CLOSING THE DOOR ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY THEREAFTER. THIS IS WHERE THE POWER OF THE NATION RESIDES , IN THE PEOPLE, IN THE RULE OF LAW IN PRECEDENTS WE HAVE ABIDED BY. TO SUBVERT NEEDLESSLY, EVEN AS AMERICANS ARE CASTING THEIR VOTE WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL STEP TOWARDS THE BREAK AND A BETRAYAL IN THE EQUALITY AMERICA IS BUILT ON. THE PEOPLE DECIDE. SENATORS MUST NOT ACT ON THIS NOMINATION UNTIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FINISH THE PROCESS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OF SELECTING THEIR PRESIDENT AND THEIR CONGRESS. AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, IF THE PEOPLE CHOOSE DONALD TRUMP, THEN THE SENATE SHOULD GIVE HIS NOMINEE A HEARING AND A VOTE. IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT CHOOSE TRUMP AND CHOOSE ME, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINATION SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN, I SHOULD NOMINATE, CHOSEN BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS JUST BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, TO GET A FAIR HEARING, WHICH WOULD NOT EVEN OCCUR UNTIL EARLY FEBRUARY. A CONFIRMATION VOTE. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION PROVIDES ONE CHANCE , 1 , THE AMERICANS FOUR TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD ON WHO SERVES A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT. WHO MAKES THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE, THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS, AND MUCH ELSE. THAT CHANCE IS NOW. THAT MOMENT IS NOW. THE VOTERS IN MY VIEW ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS ABUSE OF POWER. AND FOR US TO CALL OURSELVES A DEMOCRACY, THEIR VOICES MUST BE HEARD. I URGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KEEP VOTING, TO LET YOUR CURRENT SENATORS KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO BE HEARD BEFORE A VOTE ON CONFIRMATION OF A NEW JUSTICE. AND I URGE EVERY SENATOR TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE BRINK, TAKE OFF THE BLINDERS OF POLITICS FOR JUST ONE CRITICAL MOMENT AND STAND UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION YOU SWORE TO UPHOLD. THIS IS A TIME TO DE-ESCALATE, TO PUT AN END TO THE SHATTERING OF PRECEDENTS THAT HAS THROWN OUR NATION INTO CHAOS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING DOES NOT ABSOLVE YOU OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO RIGHT BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. UPHOLD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, SOMEONE YOUR , SUMMON YOUR CONSCIENCE, STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE, STAND UP FOR OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. AMERICANS ARE WATCHING, AMERICANS ARE VOTING, AND WE MUST LISTEN TO THEM NOW. WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO EXERCISE THIS SACRED POWER. SO PLEASE LISTEN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND I WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. THEY SHOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WILL VOTE ON THE SENATE RACES THIS ELECTION AND THEY WILL VOTE REPUBLICANS OUT OF OFFICE. THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE. THAT IS THE FOCUS. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND STAY ON MESSAGE. THE CLEAR FOCUS IS THIS IS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE ACA WILL EXIST. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COVERED. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN CAN BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME PROCEDURE AS A MAN. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YES? YOU ASKED ME ONE QUESTION, FIRE AWAY. NO, I HAVE NOT. I CONCLUDED THAT THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN A POSITION, IF THEY WERE TO VOTE THE RIGHT WAY, THEY WOULD BE COMPROMISED. I HAVE RESPECT FOR A NUMBER OF MY FORMER REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND I AM HOPING THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING. I AM NOT , I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE UPSET WITH MY ANSWER. BUT WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IS PLAY THE TRUMP GAME, WHICH IS A GOOD GAME HE PLAYS. TAKE YOUR EYE OFF THE ISSUE BEFORE US. IF I WERE TO SAY YES OR NO TO THAT, THAT BECOMES A BIG ISSUE. THAT IS THE HEADLINE. I AM FOCUSED ON ONE THING RIGHT NOW, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. I'M FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE BEING CUT OUT OF THIS PROCESS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE PART OF, AND CUT OUT OF THE DESIGN IN ORDER TO TAKE AWAY THE ACA AND YOUR HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. THAT IS THE FOCUS, THAT IS WHAT IT IS, THAT IS THE DEAL. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR ME, I'M SORRY."	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476319-1/joe-biden-remarks-president-trumps-supreme-court-nomination	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered brief remarks in Wilmington, Deleware, on President Trump&rsquo;s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Speaking from a live music venue in Delaware&rsquo;s largest city, Mr. Biden said it was unfair of President Trump to move forward with Judge Barrett&rsquo;s nomination at a time when early and absentee voting for the 2020 election was already underway in many states. He called on the Senate to wait to move forward with any confirmation activities until after Election Day. Following his remarks, Mr. Biden answered a few questions from reporters.	476319-1	Speech		
CSPANJB2102020103	Joe Biden	2020-10-02	Joe Biden Campaign Remarks in Grand Rapids, Michigan	"WATCH THE NOMINATION PROCESS FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT STARTING ON OCTOBER 12. LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN.ORG. LISTEN LIVE ON THE C-SPAN RADIO APP AND BE SURE TO VISIT C-SPAN.ORG TO REVIEW A PLAYLIST OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S LEGAL VIEWS. HEY, FOLKS. GOOD AFTERNOON. BEFORE I START, I WANTED TO SLAIN THE DELAY. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING BY THE NUMBERS. WE HAD TO COVID TESTS THIS MORNING. EVERYTHING IS CLEAR. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR BEFORE I CAME. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN EVENT AFTER THIS AT A HEADQUARTERS. BUT BASED ON THE CROWD SIZE AND INDOORS, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BEST NOT TO DO IT. BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK MATT. MATT, YOU ARE DEAD RIGHT. YOU WERE PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE LINE. AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DID ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY OF LOCAL 951 FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. LOOK, LET'S START , I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING, WHICH I'M SURE ALL OF YOU DO AS WELL, SENDING MY PRAYERS FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE FIRST LADY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AFTER THEY TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19. MY WIFE, JILL, AND I PRAY THEY MAKE A QUICK AND FULL RECOVERY. THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICS. IT'S A BRACING REMINDER TO ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY AUTOMATICALLY. WE HAVE TO DO OUR PART TO BE RESPONSIBLE. IT MEANS FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, LISTENING TO THE EXPERTS, WASHING OUR HANDS, SOCIAL DISTANCING. IT MEANS WEARING A MASK IN PUBLIC AND IT MEANS ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO DO SO AS WELL. IT MEANS HAVING MASKING MANDATES NATIONWIDE. THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.D.C., CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, DR. REDFIELD SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE HELD UP A MASK, HE SAID, ""THESE FACEMASKS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERFUL PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL WE HAVE."" THEN HE HELD THE MASK UP AGAIN AND SAID, ""THIS FACE MASK IS MORE GUARANTEED TO PROTECT ME AGAINST COVID THAN A VACCINE."" END OF QUOTE. LEADING SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TELL US THAT WE CAN SAVE MORE THAN 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS ALONE IF EVERYONE WORE A MASK IN PUBLIC. SO LET ME REPEAT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WE CAN SAVE 100,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS, ACCORDING TO THE HEAD OF THE C.D.C., IF EVERYONE WEARS A MASK IN PUBLIC. SO, BE PATRIOTIC. IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A TOUGH GUY. IT'S ABOUT DOING YOUR PART. WEARING A MASK IS NOT ONLY GOING TO PROTECT YOU, BUT ALSO PROTECTS THOSE AROUND YOU. YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD, YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, HUSBAND, WIFE, NEIGHBOR, CO-WORKER. DON'T JUST DO IT FOR YOURSELF. DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS VIRUS ALSO UNDERSCORES THAT WE NEED REGULAR TESTING WITH RESULTS TURNED AROUND RAPIDLY AND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. IT'S NOT JUST THE FOLKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE OR WHO TRAVEL WITH ME THAT DESERVE REGULAR TESTING. IT'S FOLKS IN THE MEAT PACKING AND FOOD PROCESSING PLANTS, GROCERY STORE WORKERS, EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN DESERVES SAFETY AND PEACE OF MIND. AND IT MEANS WE NEED TRANSPARENCY. THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN CONTACT TRACING SO THAT EVERYONE WHO THEY MAY HAVE EXPOSED CAN GET TESTED THEMSELVES. THAT'S HOW YOU STOP TRANSMISSION FOR ANY EPIDEMIC. IT'S BASIC. WE NEED TO TAKE THE SCIENCE OF FIGHTING THIS DISEASE SERIOUSLY IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE LIVES. AND ABOVE ALL, THE NEWS IS A REMINDER THAT WE AS A NATION NEED TO DO BETTER IN DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC. TAKING THESE STEPS IS HOW WE'LL PROTECT OURSELVES. AND JUST AS IMPORTANT, IS HOW WE WILL PROTECT ONE ANOTHER. I HOPE YOU ALL , THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING THIS VIRUS, INCLUDING THE FIRST FAMILY, AND SO MANY AMERICANS TODAY RECOVER AND RECOVER SOON. OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE MORE THAN 207,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE DIED FROM THIS VIRUS. MANY OF THEM GOT UP THIS MORNING, THE BREAKFAST TABLE, THERE WAS AN EMPTY CHAIR OF SOMEONE THEY LOST AND THEY LOVED. WE UNDERSTAND. AND THERE'S MORE THAN 7 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW INFECTED, HAVE BEEN INFECTED. THAT INCLUDES FOLKS HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS AND ALL ACROSS MICHIGAN. ESPECIALLY ALL OF YOU WITH UFCW WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC AND ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE UFCW WORKERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF FIGHTING FOR DIGNITY AND RESPECT YOU DESERVE. I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH. THIS MORNING, THE SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT CAME OUT. THE LAST ONE BEFORE ELECTION DAY. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOBS BACK, TO WORK AGAIN. BUT THERE'S FEWER JOBS THAN WE'D HOPED FOR, AND MILLIONS OF FAMILIES, MILLIONS ARE STILL WONDERING WHEN IT WILL BE THEIR TURN TO COME BACK FROM THE BRINK. AND THE SIGNS, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL PRESS, ARE NOT ENCOURAGING. ONCE AGAIN, THE PACE OF JOB GAINS IS SLOWING DOWN. ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE SEEING TEMPORARY LAYOFFS TURN PERMANENT. THIS MONTH MARKED THE LARGEST SINGLE MONTH INCREASE IN LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE WE STARTED KEEPING RECORDS IN 1948. THERE ARE NOW AN ADDITIONAL 781,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WORK FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AND HAVEN'T FOUND IT. AND IN THE PAST, THAT'S A SIGN FOR PERMANENCY FOR THEM. WE'RE STILL DOWN 647,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. ALL TOLD, WE ARE NOW 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE EITHER LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS ENTIRELY. PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE FELL LAST MONTH AND REMAINS SHARPLY DOWN SINCE THIS CRISIS BEGAN, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. THERE'S ANOTHER ROUGHLY 700,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE, STOPPED LOOKING FOR A JOB. THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN, DEMONSTRATING ONCE AGAIN HOW THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TOUGH ON WOMEN AND FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENCY IN MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN IT CAME INTO OFFICE. MICHIGAN HAS LOST MORE THAN 361,000 JOBS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2017. IN FACT, FACTORIES WERE ALREADY CLOSING BEFORE COVID, LIKE THE PLANT HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS. THEY ANNOUNCED BACK IN JANUARY THEY WERE SHUTTING DOWN AND CUTTING 210 LOCAL JOBS. MANUFACTURING ALREADY SLIPPED INTO A RECESSION LAST YEAR. THE NET LOSS OF AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS YOU SAW HERE IN MICHIGAN. AND THAT ECONOMIC PAIN WAS ONLY AMPLIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC. YOUR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED, LIKE ALL PLACES AROUND AMERICA. MORE THAN 26 MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS WERE FILED BY AMERICANS LAST MONTH. 46 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR EMERGENCY SAVINGS, AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS WON'T FORGET HOW THE UFCW MEMBERS SAW THEIR JOBS TURNED SUDDENLY INTO A LIFE AND DEATH TASK. FOLKS, TODAY, TODAY'S REPORT REINFORCES ANOTHER PAINFUL TREND. THE CONTINUING OF WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL A K-SHAPED RECOVERY. THE K MEANS, THAT LETTER GOING UP, THAT'S THOSE ON THE TOP THAT KEEPS GOING UP. WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MIDDLE IS GOING DOWN AND BELOW. WE'RE SEEING THINGS GET WORSE. IT MEANS ESSENTIAL WORKERS, UFCW WORKERS, WHO SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, AND CONTINUE IT, ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. BECAUSE WHILE WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING, THIS IS A FACT, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST THE TOP 100 OF THEM. THEY'VE MADE UP MORE THAN $30 BILLION THIS YEAR, IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS. AND EVERYONE ELSE, THOUGH YOU KEEP HOPING, YOU GET THE BOTTOM OF THAT K-SHAPED RECOVERY. YOU GET THE DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THE BILL AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, HOW TO BALANCE DOING YOUR JOB WITH BEING A TEACHER TO YOUR KIDS BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOL HAS GONE REMOTE. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NECK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME FOR THE RISKS OF COVID ARE KEPT OUTSIDE. BECAUSE YOU WORK AT A MEAT PACKING PLANT OR AN ASSEMBLY LINE OR AT A CHECKOUT COUNTER. YOU KNOW, I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SCARY TIME AND UNCERTAIN TIME. I UNDERSTAND AND I SEE YOU. BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. A LOT LIKE GRAND RAPIDS. IT IS FULL OF AN AWFUL LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE BUSTING THEIR NECK EVERY DAY TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IN SCRANTON, MY MOM USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. SHE SAID, NOT JUST IN SCRANTON, BUT FROM THE TIME SHE LEFT THERE, SHE SAID, JOEY, NOBODY'S BETTER THAN YOU, JOEY. BUT EVERYBODY'S YOUR EQUAL. MY DAD'S CONSTANT REFRAIN AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON, WHEN THERE WERE NO MORE WORK AND WE HAD TO MOVE TO DELAWARE, HE MOVED AWAY FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR, COME BACK EVERY WEEKEND TO SEE US. BY THE TIME WE FINALLY A COUPLE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IN DELAWARE GOT TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME, MY DAD USED TO USE THIS EXPRESSION. HE SAID, JOEY, A JOB'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT SHAPED MY GROWING UP, AND I SUSPECT MOST OF YOU. THEY SHAPED MY WHOLE LIFE. SO I KNOW AND UNDERSTOOD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THIS THAT WALL STREET AND C.E.O.'S DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY, AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT'S WHY I'VE LAID OUT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA NOT JUST TO REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES, BUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN BUILD BACK AND BUILD BACK BETTER. AND AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FROM WALL STREET, MOODY'S, PROJECTED THAT MY PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ECONOMIC PLAN, AND $1 TRILLION MORE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. THAT'S NOT COMING FROM A LIBERAL THINK TANK. THAT'S COMING FROM MOODY'S. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. I'M GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE ONLY MAKING OVER $400,000. ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR WON'T PAY A PENNY MORE. I'M GOING TO ASK THE VERY BIG CORPORATIONS, THE FORTUNE 500 AND THE WEALTHY, TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR A CHANGE. THAT MEANS RAISING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE, WHICH WAS IN THE MID 30%'S AND IS NOW AT 20% BACK TO 28%. THAT MEANS MAKING SURE THAT NO BIG COMPANY GETS AWAY WITH PAYING ZERO TAXES, AS 91 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES DO TODAY. MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ZERO TAXES. HOW MANY OF YOU PAID ZERO TAXES? IT MEANS MAKING SURE THAT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS DON'T GET TO PAY THE LOWER TAX RATE BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING MONEY ON THEIR INVESTMENTS, BUT THEY PAY AT THE SAME RATE THAT THEY PAY FOR THEIR SALARY. THESE CHANGES IN THE TAX CODE WILL RAISE THE MONEY THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROWING THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHICH WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING, I SAID THAT'S THE REASON, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. HARDWORKING FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS, UNION JOBS. AND THIS IS, BY THE WAY, MY PLAN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY ANALYZED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS. TAKE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUILDING ROADS, BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS, PORTS, AIRPORTS WILL PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK IN GOOD-PAYING UNION JOBS AND CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. CLEAN ENERGY, JUST UPGRADING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZING TWO MILLION HOMES WILL CREATE AT LEAST ONE MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS. LEADING THE WORLD ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BUILDING 500,000 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ON THE HIGHWAYS WILL CREATE 1 MILLION NEW AUTO JOBS HERE IN THIS STATE. THE MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY IN THOSE AREAS, MAKING SURE, MAKING SURE THAT FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN MICHIGAN, WITH GOOD UNION JOBS. YOU KNOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS $600 BILLION A YEAR, OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS, TO PURCHASE EVERYTHING FROM MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO STEEL TO CARS TO TRUCKS TO FEDERAL FLEETS. THAT'S $600 BILLION. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE FINALLY MAKE GOOD ON THE COMMITMENT MADE A LONG TIME AGO THAT THESE PRODUCTS, ALL THESE CONTRACTS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN AWARD, MAKE SURE THOSE PRODUCTS WERE MADE BY AMERICANS IN AMERICA. MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S DONE. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WILL CREATE 5 MILLION NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY JOBS. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESSES COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE, WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE DEBTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE'LL MAKE INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE INCOMES AS WELL. $15 MINIMUM WAGE. NO ONE, NO ONE SHOULD BE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS JUST TO GET ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS TO AMERICA FROM OVERSEAS. AND DIRECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVITALIZATION FUNDS AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN WESTERN MICHIGAN COMPETE FOR NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS. FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO PRAISE YOU. WE'RE GOING TO PAY YOU A GOOD WAGE, TO ENSURE YOU HAVE A STRONG BENEFIT. WE'RE GOING TO EASE THE BURDEN OF THE MAJOR COST IN YOUR LIFE, HEALTH CARE. WE'LL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THROUGH A NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTION. A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC OPTION WHICH WILL GIVE PRIVATE INSURERS A REAL COMPETITOR. WE'LL INCREASE SUBSIDIES FOR YOUR PREMIUMS SO THEY'RE LOWER, SO YOU CAN AFFORD THE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIONS AND LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. IT WILL COST , THAT PLAN ALONE WILL COST OVER $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. BUT IT'S PAID FOR BY ELIMINATING THOSE TAX CUTS. FOR A 40-YEAR-OLD MAKING $50,000 A YEAR, YOUR MONTHLY PREMIUM WILL GO DOWN BY ONE-THIRD. WE'LL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WITH A PLAN THAT SLASHES THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UP TO 60%. MEDICARE WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES FOR DRUGS. FUNDAMENTALLY LOWERING THOSE PRICES. AND CHILD CARE, A LOT OF YOU ARE DEALING WITH THAT NOW. HOW DO YOU GO TO WORK IF YOU HAVE WORK AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS, OR AN AGING RELATIVE THAT'S IN TROUBLE? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. EVERY 3-YEAR-OLD AND 4-YEAR-OLD WILL HAVE ACCESS TO FREE QUALITY PRESCHOOL. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME FOR CARING FOR A YOUNG CHILD. AND EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE TUITIONS OF A STATE UNIVERSITY IS TUITION-FREE FOR ANY FAMILY MAKING LESS THAN $125,000. COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE FREE AND PROGRAMS FOR TRAINING WILL BE FREE AS WELL. IF YOU BUY YOUR FIRST HOME, YOU'LL HAVE A $15,000 HELP TO GET THERE. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, INCREASE THE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. THE PRESIDENT'S TALKING ABOUT GIVING , ELIMINATING THE WITHHOLDING TAX. WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY SAID IF THAT PLAN GOES THROUGH, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY 2023. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU, WE CAN DO THIS. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. I KNOW, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE TIRED OF FEELING OVERLOOKED AND DISRESPECTED. I GET THAT. THE PEOPLE I MET THIS WEEK TAKING A TRAIN THROUGH NORTHEASTERN OHIO AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, PEOPLE LIKE THE DEDICATED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FROM LORDSTOWN, OHIO, WHOSE HUSBAND, WHEN LORDSTOWN SHUT DOWN, ACCEPTED A TRANSFER, KENTUCKY, EIGHT HOURS AWAY. EACH DIRECTION. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS HEALTH CARE AND HIS PENSION AFTER THE G.M. PLANT CLOSED. FOLKS WHO WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WILL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STILL BE THERE FOR THEM? WHY, WHY, THEY ASK, WILL I BE THE 100 MILLION AMERICANS WHO COULD LOSE THE PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA AND DIABETES? WHERE ONCE AGAIN WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED A HIGHER PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE A WOMAN? WHERE INSURERS NO LONGER HAVE TO ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR KIDS ON A HEALTH CARE PLAN UNTIL AGE 26? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MEDICARE BENEFITS, YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY? WILL THEY STILL BE THERE WHEN YOU RETIRE? I AM ASKED MANY TIMES IN RECENT YEARS, HOW DO WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO STOCK OUR SHELVES, PACK OUR FOOD, TEACH OUR KIDS, LIKE MY FAMILY, TAKE CARE OF MY WIFE, TAKE CARE OF OUR SICK, WHO RACE INTO BURNING BUILDINGS AND PICK UP THE GARBAGE OFF OUR STREETS, WHO DID, HOW DID WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE Y'ALL DON'T THINK WE SEE YOU ANYMORE? OR HEAR THEM? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, RESPECT THEM? THAT HAS TO CHANGE. I KNOW IT CAN. I COME FROM THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE CAN GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL SO WE CAN GET OUR ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN FOR EVERYONE. BUT THIS CANNOT BE A PARTISAN MOMENT. IT MUST BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. BUT I AM , WILL RUN AND GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR AGAINST ME, I WILL REPRESENT YOU. AND THOSE WHO SEE EACH OTHER AS FELLOW AMERICANS WHO JUST DON'T LIVE IN RED STATES OR BLUE STATES, BUT WHO LIVE IN AND LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHO WE ARE. AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SINGLE SOLITARY THING AMERICA'S BEEN UNABLE TO DO. THINK OF THIS. NOT ONCE. NOT A SINGLE THING WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S GET THE HECK UP. REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. I WANT TO SAY GOD BLESS YOU, MAY GOD PROTECT THE FIRST FAMILY AND EVERY FAMILY THAT'S DEALING WITH THIS VIRUS, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT MORE IN OUR 9:00 HOUR THIS MORNING ON ""THE WASHINGTON JOURNAL"" BUT A STORY ABOUT IT TODAY, NEW SAFETY MEASURES BEING PUT IN PLACE , THANK YOU. ROCK 'N' ROLL. OK. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE ON THIS GORGEOUS DAY AND A MAGNIFICENT, MAGNIFICENT SETTING. I THINK ABOUT ALL THE LIVES THAT WERE LOST HERE. PLEASE, ALL, HAVE A SEAT. ON JULY 4, 1863, AMERICA WORKED WITH THE REMAINS OF PERHAPS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BATTLE ON AMERICAN SOIL. IT TOOK PLACE ON THIS GROUND AT GETTYSBURG. THREE DAYS OF VIOLENCE, THREE DAYS OF CARNAGE, 50,000 CASUALTIES WOUNDED, CAPTURED, MISSING, OR DEAD OVER THREE DAYS OF FIGHTING. WHEN THE SUN ROSE ON THAT INDEPENDENCE DAY, WE WOULD RETREAT. THE WAR WOULD GO ON FOR NEARLY TWO MORE YEARS. THE BACK OF THE CONFEDERACY HAD BEEN BROKEN. THE UNION WOULD BE SAVED. SLAVERY WOULD BE ABOLISHED. THE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND OR THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH , AND FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH AND FREEDOM WOULD BE BORN ANEW IN OUR LAND. THERE'S NO MORE FITTING PLACE THAN HERE TODAY IN GETTYSBURG TO TALK ABOUT THE COST OF DIVISION, HOW MUCH IT HAS COST AMERICA IN THE PAST, HOW MUCH IT IS COSTING US NOW AND WHY I BELIEVE IN THIS MOMENT WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN, THE CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT THE GREATEST OF CAUSES , THE END OF SLAVERY, WIDENING EQUALITY, PURSUIT OF JUSTICE, THE CREATION OF OPPORTUNITY, AND THE SANCTITY OF FREEDOM. HIS WORDS WOULD LIVE EVER AFTER. WE HEAR THEM IN OUR HEADS. WE KNOW THEM IN OUR HEARTS. WE DRAW ON THEM. WE SEEK HOPE IN HOURS OF DARKNESS. FOURSCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO, OUR FATHERS WOKE FORTH ON THIS CONTINENT A NEW NATION CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY AND DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. HERE ON THIS SACRED GROUND, ABRAHAM LINCOLN REIMAGINED AMERICA ITSELF. HERE, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPOKE OF THE PRICE OF DIVISION AND THE MEANING OF SACRIFICE. HE BELIEVED IN THE RESCUE, REDEMPTION, AND REDEDICATION OF THE UNION. ALL THIS AT A TIME NOT JUST OF FEROCIOUS DIVISION BUT OF WIDESPREAD DEATH, STRUCTURAL INIQUITY, AND FEAR OF THE FUTURE . AND HE TAUGHT US THIS , A HOUSE DIVIDED COULD NOT STAND. THAT IS A GREAT AND TIMELESS TRUTH. TODAY, ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE A HOUSE DIVIDED. THAT, MY FRIENDS, CAN NO LONGER BE. WE ARE FACING TOO MANY CRISES. WE HAVE TOO MUCH WORK TO DO. WE HAVE TWO BRIGHT A FUTURE TO HAVE A SHIPWRECK ON THE SHOALS OF ANGER AND HATE AND DIVISION. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY A CENTURY AND A HALF LATER AFTER GETTYSBURG, WE SHOULD CONSIDER AGAIN WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN EQUAL JUSTICE IS DENIED, WHEN ANGER AND VIOLENCE AND DIVISION ARE LEFT UNCHECKED. AS I LOOK ACROSS AMERICA TODAY, I'M CONCERNED THE COUNTRY IS IN A DANGEROUS PLACE. OUR TRUST IN EACH OTHER IS EBBING. HOPE REMAINS ELUSIVE. TOO MANY AMERICANS SEE OUR PUBLIC LIFE NOT AS AN ARENA FOR MEDIATION OF OUR DIFFERENCES BUT AN OCCASION FOR TOTAL, UNRELENTING PARTISAN WARFARE. INSTEAD OF TREATING EACH OTHER'S PARTIES AS THE OPPOSITION, WE TREAT THEM AS THE ENEMY. THIS MUST AND , THIS MUST END. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISANSHIP, THE SPIRIT OF BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. WHEN I SAY THAT, AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR TWO YEARS, I'VE BEEN TOLD I'M NAIVE. I'M TOLD THAT'S THE WAY THINGS USED TO WORK, BUT THEY CANNOT WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY CAN AND MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. THAT'S THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT , THE DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. REFUSAL OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IS NOT DUE TO SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IT'S A DECISION. IT'S A CHOICE WE MAKE. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE, WE CAN DECIDE TO COOPERATE AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER GOING ON IN THIS NATION THEN JUST OUR BROKEN POLITICS. SOMETHING DARKER, SOMETHING MORE DANGEROUS, AND ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, COMPETING VIEWPOINTS GIVE LIFE AND VIBRANCY TO OUR DEMOCRACY. NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING DEEPER. TOO MANY AMERICANS SEEK NOT TO OVERCOME OUR DIVISIONS BUT TO DEEPEN THE. WE MUST SEEK NOT TO BUILD WALLS BUT BRIDGES. WE MUST SEEK NOT TO HAVE OUR FIST CLENCHED PUT OUR ARMS OPEN. WE HAVE TO SEEK NOT TO TEAR EACH OTHER APART BUT SEEK TO COME TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME ON EVERYTHING OR EVEN ON MOST THINGS. THE SCENE THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR NORMAL. I MADE THE DECISION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW , NEO-NAZIS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND THE KKK COMING OUT OF THE FIELD WITH TORCHES LIGHTED, VEINS BULGING, CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE HEARD ACROSS EUROPE IN THE 1930'S. IT WAS HATE OUT IN THE OPEN IN AMERICA. HATE NEVER GOES AWAY. IT ONLY HIDES. WHEN IT'S GIVEN OXYGEN, WHEN IT'S GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD, WHEN IT'S TREATED AS NORMAL AND ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR, WE HAVE OPENED A DOOR IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO CLOSE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT'S JUST WHAT I WILL DO. I WILL SEND A CLEAR, UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE TO THE ENTIRE NATION , THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HATE IN AMERICA. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO LICENSE. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO OXYGEN. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO SAFE HARBOR. IN RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN RILED BY INSTANCES OF EXCESSIVE POLICE FORCE, HEART-WRENCHING CASES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. MY , PEACEFUL PROTESTERS BEING GIVEN VOICE IN CALLS FOR JUSTICE . VIOLENT EXAMPLES OF LOOTING AND BURNING THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED. I BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER. I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED DEFUNDING THE POLICE, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE INJUSTICE IS REAL AND IS THE PRODUCT OF A HISTORY THAT GOES BACK 400 YEARS WHEN BLACK, , WHEN BLACK MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WERE FIRST BROUGHT HERE IN CHANGE. I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LAW AND ORDER AND RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE CAN HAVE BOTH. THIS IS A NATION STRONG ENOUGH TO BOTH HONESTLY FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND STRONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SAFE STREETS FOR FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TOO OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS LOOTING AND BURNING. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR ARMED MILITIAS ROAMING AMERICAN STREETS, AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS MENACING OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU SAY WE SHOULD TRUST AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO DO THE JOB, AS I DO, THEN LET THEM DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT EXTREMIST GROUPS ACTING AS VIGILANTES. YOU SAY WE HAVE NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY, YOU HAVE NOT OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH IN AMERICA. THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL VOICES FOR JUSTICE IN RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS. GEORGE FLOYD'S SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, WHOM I MET WITH, WHO LOOKED AT ME AND SAID IN HER SMALL CHILD VOICE, ""DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD."" JACOB LIKE , JACOB BLAKE'S MOTHER IS ANOTHER WHO SAID VIOLENCE DOES NOT REFLECT HER SON AND THIS NATION NEEDS HEALING. DOC RIVERS, THE BASKETBALL COACH, CHOKING BACK TEARS WHEN HE SAID, ""WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. WE'VE BEEN HUNG. IT'S AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY AND THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US BACK."" I THINK ABOUT THAT. I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES FOR A BLACK PERSON TO LOVE AMERICA. THAT IS A DEEP LOVE OF COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR FAR TOO LONG NEVER BEEN RECOGNIZED. WE NEED AN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP THAT SEEKS TO DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, TO OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, TO BRING US TOGETHER, TO HEAL, TO HOPE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I WILL DO. WE PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR ALLOWING THE DEEP DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY TO IMPACT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE CORONAVIRUS. 210,000 AMERICANS DEAD, AND THE NUMBER IS CLIMBING. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NEARLY ANOTHER 210 THOUSAND AMERICANS COULD LOSE THEIR LIVES BY THE END OF THE YEAR. ENOUGH. NO MORE. LET'S JUST SET PARTISANSHIP ASIDE. LET'S END THE POLITICS AND FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT'S A SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATION . SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT'S A SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATION . TESTING, TRACING, DEVELOPMENT, APPROVAL, AND DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT IS A SCIENCE-BASED DECISION. WE CANNOT DO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. WE CANNOT GO BACK. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER STARTING TODAY. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT PUTS POLITICS ASIDE AND SAVES LIVES. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TO OPEN SAFELY. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT REFLECTS THE TRUE VALUES OF THIS NATION. THIS PANDEMIC IS NOT A RED STATE OR BLUE STATE ISSUE. THIS VIRUS DOES NOT CARE WHERE YOU LIVE OR WHAT POLITICAL PARTY YOU BELONG TO. IT AFFECTS US ALL. IT WILL TAKE ANYONE'S LIFE. IT'S A VIRUS. IT'S NOT A POLITICAL WEAPON. THERE'S ANOTHER ENDURING DIVISION IN AMERICA THAT WE MUST AND , THAT WE MUST END , THE DIVISION OF OUR ECONOMIC LIFE THAT GIVES OPPORTUNITY TO ONLY THE PRIVILEGED FEW. AMERICA HAS TO BE ABOUT MOBILITY. IT HAS TO BE THE KIND OF COUNTRY WHERE AN ABRAHAM LINCOLN, A CHILD OF THE DISTANT FRONTIER, CAN RISE TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE LAND. AMERICA HAS TO BE ABOUT POSSIBILITY , THE POSSIBILITY OF PROSPERITY, NOT JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGED FEW, BUT FOR THE MANY, FOR ALL OF US, WORKING PEOPLE AND THEIR KIDS DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY. LINCOLN KNEW THIS. HE SAID THE COUNTRY HAD TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPEN FIELD AND A FAIR CHANCE. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN THE AMERICA THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD TOGETHER. WE FOUGHT A CIVIL WAR THAT WOULD SECURE A UNION, THAT WOULD SEEK TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUALITY FOR ALL, AND BY FITS AND STARTS, OUR BETTER ANGELS HAVE PREVAILED JUST ENOUGH AGAINST OUR WORST IMPULSES TO MAKE A NEW AND BETTER NATION, AND THOSE BETTER ANGELS CAN PREVAIL AGAIN NOW. THEY MUST PREVAIL AGAIN NOW. 100 YEARS AFTER LINCOLN SPOKE AT GETTYSBURG, THE VICE PRESIDENT, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, ALSO CAME HERE. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID , HE SAID, OUR NATION FOUND ITS SOLE AND HONOR IN GETTYSBURG. WE MUST NOT LOSE THAT SOUL AND HONOR ON THE FIELDS OF HATE. TODAY, WE ENGAGE ONCE AGAIN IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THE FORCES OF DARKNESS, THE FORCES OF DIVISION, THE FORCES OF YESTERDAY ARE PULLING US APART, HOLDING US DOWN AND HOLDING US BACK. WE MUST FREE OURSELVES OF ALL OF THAT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL EMBRACE HOPE, NOT FEAR, PEACE, NONVIOLENCE, GENEROSITY, NOT GREED, AND LIGHT, NOT DARKNESS. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS TO THE BEST OF US, NOT THE WORST. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO PUSHES TOWARD THE FUTURE, NOT ONE WHO CLINGS TO THE PAST. I'M READY TO FIGHT FOR YOU AND FOR OUR NATION EVERY DAY WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WITHOUT RESERVATION AND WITH A FULL AND DEVOTED HEART. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ALLOW EXTREMIST AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS TO OVERTURN THE LEGACY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND HARRIET TUBMAN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. DON'T RETURN TO THE AMERICA THAT HAS BEEN A HAVEN AND HOME , TO RETURN TO THE AMERICA THAT HAS BEEN A HAVEN AT HOME FOR EVERYONE, NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND. WE ARE AT OUR BEST WHEN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ALLOW VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS TO THREATEN THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT WALK AWAY FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS TO AT LONG LAST FACE THE RECKONING ON RACE AND RACIAL JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK IN THE PARTISAN POLITICS THAT LETS THIS VIRUS THRIVE WHILE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THIS NATION SUFFERS. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ACCEPT AN ECONOMIC EQUATION THAT ONLY FAVORS THOSE WHO ALREADY GOT IT MADE , WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IT MADE. EVERYONE DESERVES A SHOT AT PROSPERITY. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, DUTY AND HISTORY CALL PRESIDENTS TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON GOOD, AND I WILL. IT WON'T BE EASY. IT WON'T BE EASY. OUR DIVISIONS TODAY ARE LONG-STANDING. ECONOMIC AND RACIAL INEQUITIES HAVE SHAPED US FOR GENERATIONS, BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD , I GIVE YOU MY WORD, IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL MARSHALL THE INGENUITY AND GOODWILL OF THIS NATION TO BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT. WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. WE MUST TAKE THE FIRST STEPS AND START WITH HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. LINCOLN SAID WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE, WITH CHARITY FOR ALL, WITH FIRMNESS AND THE RIGHT GOD GIVES US TO SEE THE RIGHT, LET US STRIVE TO FINISH THE WORK WE ARE IN TWO FIND THE NATION'S WOUNDS. NOW WE HAVE OUR WORK TO REUNITE AMERICA, TO BIND UP OUR NATION'S WOUNDS SO WE, YOU AND I TOGETHER , CAN PRESS ON EVEN NOW. AFTER HEARING THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, FREDERICK DOUGLASS TOLD PRESIDENT LINCOLN THAT WAS A SACRED EFFORT. WE HAVE TO BE DEDICATED TO OUR OWN SACRED EFFORT. THE PROMISE OF GETTYSBURG AND THE NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM WAS AT HAND. I THINK IT'S AT RISK. EVERY GENERATION THAT HAS FOLLOWED GETTYSBURG HAS BEEN FACED WITH A MOMENT WHEN IT MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION, IF IT WILL ALLOW THE SACRIFICES MADE HERE TO BE IN VAIN OR BE FULFILLED. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO ANSWER THIS ESSENTIAL AMERICAN QUESTION FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR TIME. MY ANSWER IS THIS , IT CANNOT BE THAT AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE HAVE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE AND NOW IN 2020, WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH ON THIS EARTH. NO, IT CANNOT AND IT MUST NOT. WE HAVE IN OUR HANDS THE ONLY POWER , THE POWER TO VOTE. IT'S THE NOBLEST INSTRUMENT EVER DEVISED TO REGISTER OUR WILL IN A PEACEABLE AND PRODUCTIVE FASHION, AND SO WE MUST , WE MUST VOTE. WE WILL VOTE, NO MATTER HOW MANY OBSTACLES ARE THROWN IN OUR WAY BECAUSE ONCE AMERICA VOTES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. LINCOLN SAID THE NATION IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. SO IT WAS, AND SO IT IS. TOGETHER AS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, LET'S JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT THE COMMON FOE OF INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY, HATE AND FEAR. LET'S CONDUCT OURSELVES AS AMERICANS WHO LOVE EACH OTHER, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WHO WILL NOT DESTROY BUT WILL BUILD. WE OWE IT TO THE DEAD WHO ARE BURIED HERE GETTYSBURG. WE OWE THAT TO THE LIVING AND THE FUTURE GENERATIONS YET TO BE BORN. YOU AND I ARE PART OF A COVENANT, A COMMON STORY OF DIVISIONS OVERCOME AND HOPE RENEWED. IF WE DO OUR PART, IF WE STAND TOGETHER, IF WE KEEP FAITH WITH THE PAST AND WITH EACH OTHER, THEN DIVISIONS IN TIME WILL GIVE WAY TO A BETTER DREAM OF THE FUTURE. THIS IS OUR WORK. THIS IS OUR DREAM. THIS IS OUR MISSION. WE CAN AND , WE CAN END THE HATE AND FEAR. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST , THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO THIS.

I THINK PITTS WAS UNDISCIPLINED, AND THE DO NOT THINK THAT HARRIS WAS STRONG ENOUGH ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT SHE COULD'VE BEEN. PENCE LIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD TO THE NEGATIVE WHEN HE KNEW THAT OUT OF 50 JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THAT NOT ONE HAS BEEN BLOCKED, AS HARRIS POINTED OUT. I DO NOT THINK THAT SHE WAS FORCEFUL IN THE FACT THAT WHEN HE ASKED HER A QUESTION ABOUT PACKING THE COURT, SHE SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUT THAT HE WAS NOT THERE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS, BUT RESPOND TO THE MODERATOR. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERATOR, I THINKS THAT SHE DID A POOR JOB WHEN IT COMES TO MODERATOR. (music) THANK YOU ALSO MUCH. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS VANESSA MONTES CAR SURVEY , I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARD-WORKING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY MOTHER IS NO LONGER HERE, BUT VERY PRESENT IN MY HEART. SHE TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF HARD WORK AND A SACRIFICE. SHE TAUGHT ME TO BE A WOMAN OF FAITH AND LOVE ABOVE ALL. I GREW UP IN PHOENIX ARIZONA. DUE TO THE IMMENSE SACRIFICE OF MY PARENTS HARD WORK, I WAS ABLE TO ATTEND A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, AND I AM UP PROUD GRADUATE OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER. I OWN SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. INCLUDING LEGENDS EVENT CENTER. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR VENUES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IF YOU TOLD ME EARLIER THIS YEAR, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT I WOULD BE STANDING FOR YOU, INTRODUCING YOU TO THE FUTURE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT. THIS HAS BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR MANY OF US. IN MY INDUSTRY, THE EVENTS BUSINESS, WE HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HARD. MY BUSINESS WAS SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE ONLY STARTED HOSTING SMALL EVENTS IN RECENT WEEKS. AFRAID FOR MY FAMILIES LIVELIHOOD, IT WAS A SACRIFICE THAT WE MADE TO KEEP OUR FRIENDS, BUT IT WASN'T EASY. WHILE BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS BENEFITED FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND LOANS, MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY, WAS LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES. OUR RESTAURANTS, OUR CLOTHING STORES, OUR TECH COMPANIES, WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS CITY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE IN PLACES WHERE OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS CELEBRATE MAJOR MILESTONES AND SPEND THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PLACE WHERE HARD WORK, ALONG WITH TALENT AND INNOVATION, CAN COME TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND HELP US BUILD BETTER LIVES. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN SENATOR HARRIS UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HARD WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MY BUSINESS IS MORE THAN JUST WHERE I WORK. IT IS PART OF WHO I AM. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE MEASURE HOW GOOD OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BY HOW WELL OUR WORKERS ARE DOING, WHETHER THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP AND WHETHER THEIR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. AND WHETHER THEIR KIDS HAVE A BETTER LIFE AHEAD OF THEM. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO HELP US BUILD BACK BETTER. WE KNOW WHAT'S WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP , WHAT WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP. NO PLAN FOR COVID-19 AND NO PLAN TO HELP US SAFELY REOPEN OUR BUSINESSES. AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, WE KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED EARLY VOTING STARTED YESTERDAY IN ARIZONA. I SAW PEOPLE LINED UP BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED TO BE THE FIRST AMONG TO CASTE THEIR BALLOTS. THIS CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. I AM GOING TO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. TO MAKE SURE MY VOTE IS COUNTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS, I AM VOTING NOT JUST FOR ME, I AM VOTING FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY, FOR MY SIX BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND FOR THEIR FUTURE. FOR MY FELLOW LATINOS PARENT , LATINOS. I HAVE FAITH THAT WE WILL ELECT THE LEADERS THAT WILL RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AS MR. BIDEN SAYS , [SPEAKING SPANISH] TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY GREAT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TWO STRONG AND OUTSTANDING LEADERS, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HI, EVERYBODY. WHERE IS VANESSA? THANK YOU, VANESSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF LABOR. EARLIER, JOE AND I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT THE INDIAN VETERANS NATIONAL MEMORIAL AND TAKE TRIBUTE TO THE AID OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM. WE WERE JOINED BY CINDY MCCAIN, A LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOE'S, AND SOMEONE I ADMIRE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO SERVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN IN THE SENATE AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AMERICAN. HE WAS A PATRIOT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND CINDY IS SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] AND SHE IS DOING IT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT JOE AND I WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT SHE AND JOHN DID, AND THAT IS PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. SO WE THANK CITY , CINDY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE IN ARIZONA TODAY. LATER, WE WILL TALK WITH WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD AND DOING EVERYTHING RIGHTS, BUT STILL STRUGGLING TO GET BY. THEY ARE WHO I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE. THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, WILL AFFECT EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES. THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY LAST GENERATIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. OUR NATION IS AT A CROSSROADS. JUST THINK, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, A RECKONING ON RACIAL JUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT IS BATTERING OUR COASTLINES AND SETTING THE WEST ON FIRE, AND THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE HANGS ON TOP OF IT ALL. BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ALONG WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS, HE IS TRYING TO JAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. WHO WILL RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FROM AS MANY AS 2.8 MILLION ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. TWO POINT EIGHT ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHILE THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BRING THE VIRUS TO OUR SHORES, HIS RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THE WAY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN IN NORMA'S , ENORMOUS. HIS REFUSAL TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS IS WHAT HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON OUR ECONOMY. I KNOW FOLKS ARE HURTING BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS THE THING. JOE HAS HAD A PLAN FOR COVID AT LEAST SINCE MARCH. HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, HE KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS AND THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL. JOE KNOWS THESE THINGS. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. EVEN WHEN JOE DID NOT HAVE THE BRIEFINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAD , MIKE PENCE HAD , JOE NEWBY BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THAT THIS COULD BE SERIOUS AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, WE WILL CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND SAVE LIVES AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. JOE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESTORES THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND EASES THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES. AND ABOVE ALL, JOE WILL BE A RESIDENT WHO UNITES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT, OLD AND YOUNG, FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND RACES TO MEET THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME.

[APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU, KAMALA. THANK YOU, VANESSA. WE MET BACKSTAGE AND THE FIRST INSTANT WE HAD WAS TO HUG EACH OTHER , NO, WE HAVE TO STAY 12 FEET APART. I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO RUBEN AND DANIEL FOR BEING HERE. BIG DEAL, MAN. I NOTICE , THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A POSTMAN'S HOLIDAY, COMING TO HEAR ANOTHER POLITICIAN SPEAK. AND PUTTING ON A TIE WHEN HE SHOWS UP WITHOUT A TIE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT AND COO OF THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL. WHERE ARE YOU? IS IN HERE OR IS HE IN HIS OFFICE? I WANT TO THANK HIM. ALSO, THE PRESIDENT OF LOCAL 1912. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, WE SAID, NOT A JOKE, IT WAS COINCIDENTAL, SHE SAID, I LOVE THE CARPENTERS, THE FIRST OUTFIT THAT ENDORSED ME WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE CARPENTERS. I SAID, I REMEMBER A GUY, PRESIDENT OF THE CARPENTERS UNION FROM DELAWARE, A 350-YEAR-OLD CITY, WAS THE FIRST WANT TO ENDORSE ME AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN WITH THEM MICHAEL CAREER. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FRIEND, WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER A LONG TIME. 520,000 CARPENTERS, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE ARMY TO HAVE BEHIND YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE MY FULL CAREER AND I HOPE YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD YOURS AS WELL. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN SCRANTON, THE CARPENTERS BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE AND WE ARE GOING HOME TOGETHER. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. PEOPLE WHO SHAPED THE SKYLINES, WHO BUILT THE FOUNDATIONS WE RELY ON, THE CARPENTERS. LABOR BROUGHT ME TO DANCE AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I'VE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE OF LABOR. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. I REALLY MEAN IT. I GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THIS, BUT IT IS TRUE. YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE SPINE OF AMERICA. YOU ARE THE ONES YOU BUILD THE COUNTRY, NOT WALL STREET AND CEO'S, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE BUILD IT AGAIN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER FOR REAL. KAMALA AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, BUT THE SENATOR HAD A HECK OF A NIGHT LAST NIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME CREDIT FOR KNOWING HOW TO PICK A VICE PRESIDENT. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER. SHE IS LIKE A YOUNGER SISTER. REMARKABLE CHARACTER AND VISION. ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE. ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE, NOT HER, ALWAYS. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. KEMAL AND I ARE ABOUT TO KICK OFF A TOUR VISITING BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY. SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, THEY ARE BUSTING THEIR NEXT, THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE JOBS THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATE ENTITIES. THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOUND ITSELF HAVING TO GO THROUGH REAL CHALLENGING TIMES. THE CONGRESSMAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN MOST PEOPLE KNOW. LIKE CHEF SOLANA, THE CHEF OWNS TWO RESTAURANTS IN PHOENIX. ONE, SHE HAD , SHE HAD TO CLOSE ONE OF THEM DOWN. SHE IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP THE OTHER ONE AFLOAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE VISITING IT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. IT ISN'T EASY. THE LOAN THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE BACK IN THE SPRING BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION PASSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE HELPS FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE IS SCRAPING BY, TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR HER 10 EMPLOYEES, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR DECADES. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE IS FACING A TERMINAL DISEASE. SHE HAD TO CANCEL HER OWN HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER FINISHING A ROUND OF TREATMENT TO RECENTLY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT IS DEVASTATING. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH. I THINK YOU ALL ARE. I KNOW I AM BECAUSE I KNOW WE KNOW IT DID NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. IF THEY HAD JUST DONE WHAT YOU PASSED, JUST MOVED FORWARD. HER STORY IS INCREASINGLY A COMMON STORY OF ARIZONA WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. TOO MANY ARE FACING HARD TIMES NOW. THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE IT IS ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. ALL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN HE COULD NOT FIND WORK WHEN COLD DIED , COAL DIED. HE HAD TO TAKE US UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT EVER HAS TO TAKE TO SAY, I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO ST. PAUL'S, THAT HAS LOST HIS JOB, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US TO OUR GRANDPA'S HOUSE, ME AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER AND MY MOM WHO WAS SHORTLY GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR MY DAD, SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN HAVE DONE THE SAME THING, HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND SAY, I HAVE TO ASK A FAVOR. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRIDE IT COST HIM. CAN YOU TAKE THEIR OF THEM , CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR A YEAR? I WILL BE BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB, ENOUGH TO GET US AN APARTMENT IN DELAWARE, HE ENDED UP THEN GETTING A GOOD JOB, A DECENT JOB MANAGING A CAR DEALERSHIP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. HE SAID, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I EXPECT THEM TO AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. AMERICA DESERVES A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE AMERICA , WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. WHO SEES WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE, WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOUR PROSPERITY, YOUR DREAM, YOUR AMERICAN DREAM. YOU ARE FACING REAL CHALLENGES AND THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATES THEM. WHO IGNORES YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY IT, I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, THE PRESIDENT LOOKS DOWN ON US. WHO THINKS THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, YOU ARE A LOSER, A SUCKER. THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH CINDY. MY SON PASSED AWAY NOW COMING ON FIVE YEARS, IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY, WON THE BRONZE STAR, HE VOLUNTEERED, HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE HAD TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. I PROMISE YOU, HE WAS NOT A LOSER, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE, LIKE ALL THE VETERANS WE MET WITH THIS AFTERNOON ALONGSIDE CINDY MCCAIN, ARE PATRIOTS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. JOHN MCCAIN, WHO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING ME TO DO HIS EULOGY, WE USED TO ARGUE, WE WERE LIKE BROTHERS, WE WOULD FIGHT LIKE HELL, BUT WE ALWAYS ENDED UP TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW IT USED TO BE. IT USED TO BE THAT WAY ACROSS THE BOARD. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SAY ANYTHING TO DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISTAKES HE MAKES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, HE RECENTLY SAID , I ASKED WHERE HE GOT THE COVID, HE SAID, I PROBABLY GOT IT FROM BLUE STAR PARENTS, PEOPLE WHO LOST A CHILD IN BATTLE. HE SAID, THEY LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO ME AND HUGGED ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO. LOOK. WE HAVE PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC LEADERSHIP. 210,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. WE LOSE MORE EVERY DAY. 6000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN LOST. 6000, DON. , GONE. 200 , 220,000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. 122,000 JOBS IN ARIZONA STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. NINE TIMES MORE ARIZONANS ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT EACH WEEK THEN BEFORE THE CRISIS HIT. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING, SCHOOLS ARE NOT BACK TO NORMAL. DONALD TRUMP CAN'T FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. THE HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACTS, THE SECOND BIG PACKAGE, TO GET PEOPLE ON THEIR FEET AGAIN. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND MITCH MCCONNELL DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. A LOT OF CITIES AND STATES ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. OUR FOUNDERS WERE SMART, THE REASON WHY THEY PUT THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THEY DID IS SO CONGRESS, THE SENATE, THE HOUSE GOOD DEFICIT SPEND TO COMPENSATE FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUT OF A HOLE. TRUMP IS SPENDING MORE TIME , I HAVE BEEN CALLING ON THIS FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS , HE SHOULD GET OUT OF HIS BUNKER AND OUT OF THE SAND TRAP OF HIS GOLF COURSES , NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. I HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. HE NEVER ONE SINGLE TIME TRY TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO GET A SETTLEMENT. NOT ONCE. YOU CAN'T NAME ME A PRESIDENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANY OF YOU THAT REFUSED TO DEAL THAT WAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. BUT THE LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ON HIS WATCH. ON TUESDAY, THE CONGRESS , I'M SURE YOU WERE NOT SURPRISED BY IT , ON TUESDAY, HE ANNOUNCED HE IS WALKING AWAY FROM NEGOTIATIONS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR WORKING THE WEALTHY. IF THIS WAS NOT SO TRUE, IT WOULD SOUND SO BIZARRE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FORGOTTEN THE PEOPLE THAT HE SAID HE IS FIGHTING FOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FOR WHERE I GREW IN SCRANTON. I NOTE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT THE WORKING CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I MEASURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WITH WHAT FAMILIES ARE TALKING ABOUT, SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLES. ABOUT HAVING A DECENT JOB AND BENEFITS. ABOUT KEEPING THE SMALL BUSINESS DREAM ALIVE. ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING. NEW TIRES. WE HAVE TO WAIT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEM. WE CANNOT DO IT. WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER THAT SHE CANNOT GO BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE WE CANNOT BORROW MONEY ANYMORE. WE HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY. INCLUDING HERE IN ARIZONA. WHO WORRIED ABOUT IF THEY CAN PAY THIS MONTH'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT. 20 MILLION. LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET THROWN OUT INDUSTRY IF THEY CANNOT PAY THE RENT. THESE GUYS PROVIDED FOR ALL OF THAT. NOTHING. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE. MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT JOEY, YOUR JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN ABOUT YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT IS WHAT KAMALA AND I ARE FOCUSING ON. TO SAY TO OUR KIDS, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN SAFELY AND STRONGLY. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO GET , WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER. YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS DONE SHOW, BUT THAT WAS THE PAST. IF WE CANNOT BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, WE ARE DEAD. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY THAT DEPENDS ON A CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT WAS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME, BUT I MADE A MAJOR SPEECH THAT I WORKED ON REALLY HARD IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO. I TALKED ABOUT IN LINCOLN TERMS, THAT WE HAVE TO BRING AMERICA TOGETHER. WE CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I'M RUNNING WITH A PROUD DEMOCRAT, WITH A CAPITAL D. BY WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, NOT A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK HARD FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. I PROMISE YOU. LOOK AMERICA. THE FACT IS, THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. FOR EVERYBODY. DOCTORS WHO VOTED FOR. AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH. ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS, AND DO NOTE THAT POWER IS? THE LITTLE STICKER THAT YOU HAVE ON. THE POWER TO VOTE. YOU CAN STILL REGISTER HERE IN ARIZONA TO VOTE. EARLY VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ARIZONANS VOTE BY MAIL. THOSE BALLOTS START TO ARRIVE AT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. KAMALA AND I ARE SAYING THAT THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY, AND NOT RISK DELAYS. TURN THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. YOUR VOICE CAN OVERCOME CORRECT AND YOUR VOICE THROUGH YOUR VOTE, CAN OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SETTING UP? THE ARGUMENT THAT THESE VOTES ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENS TODAY WITH THE FBI. THE FBI ARRESTED A GROUP OF MILITIAMEN. THEY HAD PLANNED AND PLANNED TO GO IN AND KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN. REMEMBER THOSE GUYS WOULD BE ASSAULT RIFLES STANDING IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS? THE PRESIDENT SAYING THINGS IN MY DEBATE WITH THEM, TO THE PROUD BOYS, AND ALL WHITE THE PREMISES GROUP, STANDS DOWN AND STAND READY? THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. WE CANNOT JUST WIN BY A VOTE. WE HAVE TO ALL TURN OUT. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN'T BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BREASTS. , WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. AT OUR BEST, WE ARE THAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS NOT A PROSAIC THING. THE FACT IS, AMERICANS NEVER FAIL. WHEN STANDING UP TOGETHER. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS, WAR AND ECONOMIC, STRONGER THAN WE WENT INTO THE CRISIS. FOLKS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES AT HOME AND IN THE WORLD THAN I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG TIME. I WORK WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. I MEAN IT. WE HAVE A CHANCE. TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE OUR COUNTRY, BUT TO CHANGE THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE WEST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO US. , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO U.S.. IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT A POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWING US. THAT EXAMPLE IS BEING TRASH AROUND THE WORLD. AS THE SENATOR SAID LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE, IT IS TRUE. 17 MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD 'S ASKS WHAT LEADERS THEY ADMIRE AND TRUST THE MOST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? MORE PEOPLE TRUSTED THE LEADER OF CHINA AND PUTIN OF RUSSIA RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS PROFOUND SECURITY AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. LET'S NOT QUIT FOLKS. THERE IS NO QUITTING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER QUIT, AND IF WE NEED YOU TO STAND UP AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE NEED YOU NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU EVERYBODY. (music) MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT WE ARE ALL LIVING AN EXAMPLE GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GIVE US WHAT YOU GET. DON'T LET OUR WORLD GO ROUND.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476759-1/joe-biden-senator-harris-campaign-arizona	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) campaigned in Arizona the day after the vice presidential debate.	476759-1	Speech		
CSPANJB9102020108	Joe Biden	2020-10-09	Joe Biden Campaign Event in Las Vegas	"HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO, LAS VEGAS. GOVERNOR'S IS A LACK, REPRESENTATIVE TITUS AND MY GOOD FRIEND , ACTUALLY HE IS A GREAT FRIEND , CONGRESSMAN WERE SPURRED. I WANT TO THANK THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL, , PRINCIPAL OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL FOR HOSTING THIS. JUST WHAT YOU NEED IT TODAY. I KNOW YOU , JUST WHAT YOU NEEDED TODAY. I KNOW YOU WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE BACK. I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. ALARCON DROVE, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION , ALEJANDRO, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO CHOSE TO COME HERE TO BECOME PARENTS IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. THANK YOU. YOU ARE JUST TRY TO DO RIGHT BY YOUR FAMILY, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I JUST LEFT THE LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY CENTER WHERE SENATOR ED FLOREZ, THE SON OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS , YOU GET TO SWEAR IN HIS DAD AS THE UNITED STATES CITIZEN LAST WEEK. HE BECAME A LAWYER TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS AND MAKE SURE , I'M THAT WITH A GROUP OF LATINO LEADERS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR RESPECT AND DIGNITY WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO, NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE COME FROM. YESTERDAY, I MET WITH KAMALA HARRIS AFTER HER OUTSTANDING DEBATE PERFORMANCE. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE RUNNING ALONGSIDE HER. SHE IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE, LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. WE MET WITH CINDY MCCAIN. THE WIFE, THE WIDOW, OF A DEAR FRIEND JOHN MCCAIN. WE MET WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, JUST A FAIR SHOT. WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL MY DAD WOULD SAY , WE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH MY GRANDPARENTS WHEN HE WENT DOWN SOUTH FROM SCRANTON TO WILMINGTON, DELAWARE LOOKING FOR A JOB. HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS JOEY, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. I HOPE THEY CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. IT WASN'T EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. A JOB, JOEY, IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING IN TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, WHO SEES WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT WHO IGNORES YOU, WHO LOOKS DOWN UPON YOU, AND JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE. THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS, THE DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON OUR GOVERNMENT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE DID NOT TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT HIMSELF OR OTHERS AND THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENTS, THE MORE , IS PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY? GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE SEEN HOW HE PUTS GOVERNORS AGAINST EACH OTHER. MORE THAN 200,000 AMERICANS ARE DEAD. WE LOSE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN AMERICA, WORSE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. MORE THAN 7.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND WE ARE STILL COUNTING. IN NEVADA, THERE ARE MORE THAN 82,000 CASES. 80% OF THE DEATHS HAVE BEEN SENIORS OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HIT HARD. NATIONALLY THE INFECTION RATE AMONG LATINOS IS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF OTHER , MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THIS FAMILIES. THIS MORNING, THERE IS AN EMPTY CHAIR AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE AND WHEN YOU GO TO DINNER AT NIGHT THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THERE IS GONE. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FOR YOU AND I, IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. LOSING FAMILY IS A DEVASTATING THING. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY THE SIMPLE NEGLECT OF THIS PRESIDENT. NEARLY I'M , 11 MILLION JOBS LOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED TO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. RECORD GROWTH AND AMERICANS FACING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PROBLEM OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, ONCE YOU GET PAST A CERTAIN POINT HISTORY TELLS US, THEY NEVER GET A JOB AGAIN. ALL TOLD THERE'S 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS. YULIA 700,000 PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE AND THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN . WE ARE STILL DOWN 600 47,000 JOBS IN MANUFACTURING NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. HERE IN NEVADA THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 13.2%, THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD. 50% OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE OUT OF WORK. TOURISM WENT DOWN 70% FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULT? PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE HOOVER TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. HERE IN NEVADA, AFTER SEEING 200,000 JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAVE SEEN JOBS GO DOWN UNDER THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE IS LEAVING US INTO WHAT HE CALLS A V-SHAPED RECESSION. IT IS A K-SHAPED RECESSION. FOR THOSE OF THE TOPIC KEEPS GOING. FOR THE MIDDLE LEFT US FOR THOSE AT THE TOP, IT KEEPS GOING UP. FOR THOSE AT THE BOTTOM, IT KEEPS GOING DOWN. IS THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. IF YOU GET THIS , THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST IN THE PANDEMIC, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL $3 BILLION. TOP 100. WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM HALF OF THAT K, IT'S A DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WILL PAY YOUR BILLS, PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SO MUCH FOOD INSECURITY AND AMERICA. BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE KIDS CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAS NOT PROVIDED THE WHEREWITHAL FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER, A NURSE FOR YOU WORK ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. IF YOU ARE A HOUSEKEEPER, A CASINO WORKER , GOVERNOR, YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED AND RESPONSIBLE. YOU FOLLOWED SCIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST. YOU MAKE CALLS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE ECONOMY SAFELY. YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE DONE THE SAME. AND THE HOUSE PASSED WHAT THEY CALL THE HEROES ACT MONTHS AGO. WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ALIENS OF DOLLARS TO KEEP FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. BUT DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN LEADER, DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. NOTHING IN JUNE, NOTHING IN AUGUST, NOTHING IN SEPTEMBER. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE AND SUFFER, WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON. IF THIS WERE NOT SO SERIOUS YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON? MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. I'M NOT JOKING. HIS PROPOSAL HAS ANOTHER TAX CUT FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. CUTTING THE MEANS BY WHICH WE FIND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, LEAVING THE ACTUARIES TO SAY IF THEY DO IT, BY MID-2023 THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. AND THE RELENTLESS EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE OF PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE. , 20 BILLION PEOPLE, 100 MILLION WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HE HAS ALREADY COST 10 MILLION PEOPLE FOR , THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT. IS UNCONSCIONABLE , IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY. IT'S LITERALLY BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ONE HUNDRED 82,000 NEVADANS. , 182,000 NEVADANS. TAKE AWAY PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID COULD VERY WELL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. TOSSING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' INSURANCE POLICY UNTIL AT LEAST 26, TAKING US BACKWARD WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS, INCREASED DRUG PRESCRIPTION COSTS, AND JUST AS HE VOWED TO ""TERMINATE"" THE FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE IDEA THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS TO PUT AT RISK FOR HUNDRED 10,000 NEVADA TO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY , 410,000 NEVADANS WHO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT ONCE DID PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL A HIGH LEVEL MEETING OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. I HAVE SERVED WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. NEVER DID THEY FAIL TO TRY TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. YOU KNOW WHY? HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME HIDING IN THE BUNKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, OR THE BUNKER OFF HIS GOLF COURSE, PLAYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF GOLF, AND THEN THIS TUESDAY, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID INTO THE DISCUSSIONS. HE WAS NOT EVEN STARTING THEM. NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS, NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS. AND TODAY HE SAYS, WELL, I'M BACK. DONALD TRUMP SHOWS NO URGENCY TO DELIVER HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, LIKE THE FAMILY I GREW UP IN AND LIKE ALL OF YOU, WHAT THEY NEED NOW, DESPERATELY. FOR EXACTLY TWO MONTHS SINCE THE EMERGENCY SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THE CONGRESSPEOPLE VOTED FOR HAS CLOSE DOWN. TWO MONTHS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN NEVADA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAITING AND HOPING FOR JUST A LITTLE EXTRA HELP TO STAY OPEN. NOW WE HAVE OVER 400,000 SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO HANG ON. HOW MANY MORE WILL GO UNDER? MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF YOUR BUSINESS IS CLOSED, IF YOU ARE FACING EVICTION, OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS WORRY WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE NEXT MONTH. NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR A POLICE OFFICER, HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AS WELL. WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED WE INHERITED THE WORST RECESSION SHORT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN HISTORY. WE PUT TOGETHER THE RECOVERY ACT. WE PUT TOGETHER IN 18 MONTHS TO PREVENT A RECESSION. I WAS ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT THE STATES COULD KEEP MOVING, KEEP TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, FIREFIGHTERS MOVING. RIGHT HERE IN CLARK COUNTY I WAS ABLE TO BRING $1.2 BILLION TO KEEP YOUR ECONOMY GOING. WE HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW. THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY PASSED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE START THE LONGEST SUSTAINED RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID ABOUT HELPING THE STATE? I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE SAID, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY. WE MAKE UP 4% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION AND WE HAVE 20% OF THE WORLD'S DEATHS. IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, EXPANDED TESTING AND TRACING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, WASHING HER HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE , WASHING YOUR HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATES. DON'T POLITICIZE THE RACE FOR A VACCINE, MR. PRESIDENT. JUST HAVE A PLAN FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HAVE A REAL PLAN AND THEN IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA I HAVE LAID OUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN LOOK BACK BETTER. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS , SOME ARE IN SUPPORT OF ME. HE SAYS BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY. MOODY DID A DETAILED ANALYSIS. MY ECONOMY WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THINGS DONE. THIS IS HOW MY PLAN IS , WORKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO RAISE UP HENNEY OF TAX. NOT A PENNY. HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS? I WOULD ASK THE CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 92 DO NOT , 92 MILLION DO NOT PAY A PENALTY , A PENNY IN TALKING , AND TAXES. DONALD TRUMP PAID $720 IN TAXES? COME ON. THE MONEY WE RAISED BY LIMITING THE $1.3 TRILLION OF THE TAX CUTS THAT AFFECTS THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS, WE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS INCLUDED ON THE DEAL. THE KINDS OF INVESTMENT THAT WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY,'S INCLUDING INDUSTRIES LIKE TOURISM. TO HELP THE ECONOMY BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. IT MEANS CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND SAID KNOWLEDGE HE, DUST TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE GIVES OUT $600 BILLION IN CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR, GUESS WHY? , GUESS WHAT? WHEN I AM PRESIDENT IT WILL GO TO KNOW OUTFIT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND SELL IT IN AMERICA. I MEAN IT. INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILDING ROADS, AIRPORTS, CLEAN ENERGY. WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. CREATING AT LEAST A MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, MAKING THE CLIMATE SAFER, SAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. WE'LL DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BY CREATING MILLIONS OF UNION JOBS. WE WILL FIGHT BACK STRONGER, THE MORE FREQUENT WILDFIRES. AND BY THE WAY. DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT HURRICANES THIS SUMMER? HE WAS TOLD HOW THEY WERE COMING ACROSS THE WARM WATER IN THE ATLANTIC AND THE CLOSER THEY GET TO THE SHORE THE WORST THEY GET. THAT'S THE WORST THEY GET , THE WORSE THEY GET. HE SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD DROP AN ATOMIC BOMB ON THEM. BLESS ME, FATHER, FOR I HAVE SENT. , FOR I HAVE SINNED. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER $100 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AVAILABLE FOR THESE BUSINESSES, CREATING JOB, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASING INCOMES. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NOT JUST WENT TO PRAISE YOU. WE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU WITH A GOOD WAGE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STRONG BENEFIT. WE WILL BUILD THE , WE WILL CREATE SUBSIDIES TO INCREASE PLANS THAT WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. IT IS A PLAN THAT WILL/, SLASH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. IF IN FACT MEDICARE IS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE FOR ALL THE DRUGS THEY BUY AND SAY, YOU WILL NOT SELL THEM UNLESS THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY ARE SUGGESTING, THAT WOULD DROP BY 60% THE COST OF DRUGS. WE WILL ALSO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE ACCESSIBLE AND WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD WILL GET ACCESS TO A HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IF WE WANT TO REWARD WORK ON THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF FAMILIES CARING FOR A CHILD OR AN AGING LOVED ONE. FOR THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, OFTEN WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID, UNDER SEEN, UNDERVALUED. THAT IS WHY MY PLAN WILL ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION FOR CAREGIVERS AND WE WILL TRIPLE THE FUNDING FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME. WE WILL MAKE FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. WE WILL MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE FOR AMERICA'S IT QUALIFY. AND IF YOU ARE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME, WE WILL PROVIDE A 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO HELP YOU GET THERE. WE WILL INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE PAY FOR ALL THIS AND WE GROW THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. HE THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I SEE THE WORLD FROM SCRANTON. COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU LIVE IN. THE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC ACCESS IS FAMILIES TALKING ABOUT THIS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND THEY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. HOW MANY TIMES HAS SOMEONE , I KNOW THIS TIRES ARE BALD. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BORROW FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THOSE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND MY TABLE. IF WERE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER . I MADE A SPEECH AND I THOUGHT REALLY HARD ABOUT IT IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA AT THE BATTLEFIELD LAST WEEK. I SAID AT THE TIME WE ARE FACING A CRISIS NOT UNLIKE WE DID OVER GETTYSBURG. I SAID I AM RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD WE CANNOT BE HERE AND NOW AND 2020, WE CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH FROM THIS EARTH. FOLKS, WE HAVE IT IN OUR HANDS AND I MEAN THIS , WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE POWER. WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER IN A DEMOCRACY? THE POWER TO VOTE. IN NEVADA, THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS VOTE EARLY AND RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY. BALLOTS IN CLARK COUNTY WERE MAILED TWO DAYS AGO. YOU CAN RETURN YOUR BALLOT BY MAIL. YOU CAN DROP IT OFF WITH A DROPBOX. JUST MAKE A PLAN. SERIOUSLY. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/NV. MAKE A PLAN. MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. WE CAN BE BETTER WE CAN BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER AGAIN WITH HIM GONE. FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING OR HAS NEVER EVER, EVER BEEN ANYTHING THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER, NEVER. FOLKS, LET'S STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

CSPANJB10102020109	Joe Biden	2020-10-10	Joe Biden Campaigns in Erie, Pennsylvania	THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CORRECT THE MYTH THAT UKRAINE WAS THE PERPETRATOR HERE. I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AS A DEMOCRACY IS THAT FOR YOU ARE ABLE TO DEFEND YOUR ELECTION, THE FACTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH 2016. BY THE ORDERS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE 2016 ELECTION IN ORDER TO HELP DONALD TRUMP AND A SOW DISCORD WITHIN THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. RUSSIA SPREAD PROPAGANDA AND SOCIAL MEDIA. IT REACHED OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS ONLINE. RUSSIA MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HACKED EMAILS. RUSSIA MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. , GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS RICK, AND I AM A THIRD-GENERATION FARMER RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. BACK IN 2016, I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO. HE MADE TONS OF PROMISES, THE WORKING MAN TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. AS HE TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY, HE PROMISED TO BRING BACK JOBS AND PROMOTE THE ECONOMY. IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CON MAN. HE SO BE AND OTHERS ON THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD CHANGE THINGS IN WASHINGTON. YOU HEARD IT, DRAIN THE SWAMP. PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, WHO FELT IGNORED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED BY OUR NATIONAL LEADERS. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE DID THE HAD AN IMPACT ON THOUSANDS OF FARMERS LIKE MYSELF, WAS THE START OF THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. IT WAS A DOUBLE WHAMMY. DUE TO THE TARIFFS COMPOUNDED WITH THE EFFECTS OF WHAT CHINA PUT ON WITH THE PRICES. SOYBEANS WAS THE MOST TALKED ABOUT IN THE PRESS. THIS ADDED UP TO A 40% EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY ON MY FARM. TRUMP HAS HEARD OF FARMERS BEING TRUE PATRIOTS. HE BOUGHT US OFF. THE POLICIES HAVE CAUSED FROM IT IS HARD FOR THE FARMING COMMUNITIES AND FARMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE I'M A PATRIOT, I'M LOUDLY SPEAKING OUT AGAINST TRUMP AND HIS OF INITIATION. WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHY I NO LONGER SUPPORT, I TELL THEM THAT THE LIST IS TOO LONG. THE UNNECESSARY TRADE ISSUES WERE JUST THE START AND JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THE TRADE WAR AFFECTED EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA, WHETHER THEY KNEW IT ARE NOT. HIS THREATS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IMPACT MILLIONS. HIS PUSH TO ELIMINATE PAYROLL TAXES, AND FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. PEOPLE NEED THAT SAFETY NET THE MOST. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HIS TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE CONSTITUTION, THE VALUES THAT HAVE HELD THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER FOR CENTURIES. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AN AD IN WHICH I HELD PRESIDENT TRUMP FEDERALLY ACCOUNTABLE AND NEGLIGENT TO HOW HE MISINFORMED THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THAT AD WAS MADE THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO BEING AIRED. WHEN IT WAS AIRED, IT WAS AIRED ON THE SAME DAY AS PAUL WOODRUFF'S BOOK. WHEN WE HEARD HOW SERIOUS TRUMP NEW THE VIRUS WAS. AND CHOOSING NOT TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I FELT SO VINDICATED BY MAKING THAT AD WHEN I HEARD THAT RECORDING. THIS GUY CLAIMS TO BE PRO-LIFE3 BUT HIS NEGLIGENCE HAS HELPED TO LEAD MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE TO AN EARLY DEATH DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. HE HAS PUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES AT RISK FOR NOTHING MORE THAN PURE PROFIT OF WALL STREET. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PRO-LIFE, HE IS PRO-PROFIT. OUR LIVES AND ONE IS HAVE BEEN NOTHING MORE THAN A GAME TO HIM. WE DESERVE SO MUCH MORE OUT OF A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WHY AM I SUPPORTING AND SPEAKING OUT IN FAVOR OF VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN? IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WHEN I LISTEN TO JOE, I THINK OF MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. I THINK OF THE FUTURE THAT I WANT FOR THEM. THE AMERICA THAT I WANT THEM TO INHERIT. I KNOW THAT WHEN JOE BIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT, HE WILL WORK HARD TO PUT A COUNTRY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED AND SET THE NEXT GENERATION UP WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. HE WILL BE A LEADER THAT WE CAN TRUST AND BELIEVE. HE WILL BE ONE THAT WILL WHO WILL FIGHT FOR OUR CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE HIS OWN. THAT IS WHY I AM HONORED AND PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) [NO AUDIO] [APPLAUSE] HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BACK HERE IN ERIE. I WOULD TO SAY HELLO TO ALL OF ERIE. TO ALL LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS HERE ARE JOINING US HERE. AND TO YOUR NEXT SENATOR, WE NEED TO TURN OUT AND SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATS DOWN THE LINE. FOLKS, LOOK. I WENT TO THINK , I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. FOR EVERYONE AT THE UA FOR HOSTING THIS INCREDIBLE TRAINING FACILITY. I AM SO THINK TO OF EARNED THE ENDORSEMENT OF UA. YOU HAVE PROUD PLUMBERS AND MORE BEHIND ME THAN I COULD POSSIBLY THANK YOU FOUR. I WANT TO THANK RICK FOR SHARING HIS STORY AND BEING A PART OF A CONVERSATION THIS YEAR, HE SHARED HIS STORY WITH AMERICA. RICK, DELAWARE IS THOUGHT OF AS BEING A GREAT CORPORATE ENTITY AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT WE HAVE A $4 BILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. A LOT OF FARMERS ARE BEING HURT REALLY BADLY. FARMERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEING GUIDED BY THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS PROMISES. OUR FARMERS AND UNION MEMBERS WHO DO AN HONEST DAYS WORK, SEE THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS PROMISES AND WHAT THEY ARE. THANK YOU, RICK, FOR YOUR OP ED THAT YOU WROTE LAST YEAR. A BUNCH OF HOT AIR AND COLD WIND. FOLKS, THIS IS IT. THE ELECTION IS HERE. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE STARK, AND THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. AFTER MY DEBATE IN CLEVELAND LAST, I TOOK A TRAIN. I HAVE WRITTEN A LOT. , I HAVE RATED IT A LOT. I HEARD THE SAME STORY, EVERYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY. YOU ARE TRYING YOUR BEST, BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE SCRANTON. HE WAS IN SALES, HE WAS NOT IN THE COAL MINES. THEY TELL ME THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE FIRST ELECTED IN THE STATE SENATOR , OUR MEMBER SAYING THAT HE MADE THAT WALK THE A LOT OF YOU KNOW HERE IN ERIE. TO TELL HIS KIDS THAT WE CANNOT PLAY AND THAT LITTLE LEAGUE BALL GAME ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO LEAVE, DAD DOES NOT HAVE A JOB. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US HOME, MY MOM AND THE THREE CHILDREN AT THE TIME, HOME TO MY GRAND POPS. HOW MUCH PRIDE IT MUST HAVE COST HIM. HE STARTED COMMUTING EVERY WEEKEND, 157 MILES DOWN IN DELAWARE WHERE HE HAD GROWN UP. WE END UP IN CLAREMONT DELAWARE AND WENT TO WILMINGTON WHERE MY DAD GOT A SALES JOB. IT TOOK ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A HOME. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOEY, I DO NOT EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS. MORE THAN 10,000 ARE DEAD. WE LOSE ANYWHERE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE DEBT. , PEOPLE DEAD. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD THAT A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY, HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. 175 CASES , 175,000 CASES RIGHT HERE PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN YOU LOSE A CHILD AND LOOK AT THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE AT NIGHT. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING AND THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. SIMPLE NEGLECT ON THE PART AT THIS ADMINISTRATION. MANY JOBS HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED INTO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. WE ARE STILL DOWN ON THE MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. MORE THAN 40,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENCY SINCE HOOVER THAT IS GOING TO END UP LEAVING OFFICE THAN WITH FEWER JOBS THAN HE STARTED OFFICE. THIS IS CALLED A K-SHAPED RECOVERY. EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW, IT IS GOING DOWN. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST PEOPLE RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS IS A STARTLING FACT TO MEET. , TO ME. THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC MADE 300 BILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. 100 INDIVIDUALS MADE $300 BILLION THIS YEAR. THE BOTTOM HALF GOT THIS SLIDE DOWN. THIS PRESIDENT CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM SCRANTON AND CLAREMONT, FROM REAL , FOR R EAL. I SEE IT FROM ERIE. MY PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE WORKING PEOPLE. THE ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WHO GOT UP THIS MORNING AND HAD THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION. HOWDY, I KNOW THAT WE NEED FOUR NEW TIRES, BUT WE CANNOT DO IT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO WAIT. I KNOW WE JUST LOST OUR INSURANCE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO HANG IN THERE. OR, HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE, LITERALLY A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING A PRESCRIPTION OR PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IF I SAID THAT 10 YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS WRITING A FICTION STORY. BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH. THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING TODAY AND RIGHT NOW. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS PUT OUT BY HIGHLY RESPECTED WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN IS GOING TO CREATED 80.6 MILLION JOBS IN FOUR YEARS , 18.6 MILLION. I DOUBLE CREATES 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING LESS THAN $40,000. , $400,000. FOR THOSE MAKING MORE THAN THAT, I WILL ASK THE WEALTHY TO BEGIN TO PAY. 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES TODAY PAY ZERO DOLLARS TAX. HOW MANY OF YOU PAY ZERO TAX? BILLIONAIRES ARE PAYING A TAX-FREE AS INVESTMENT MONEY, A LOWER TAX RATES THEN IF YOU HAVE A JOB AS A PLUMBER. HOW CAN THAT BE? THE MONEY THAT I AM GOING TO RAISE IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE CLASS BACK , GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK. TO GET IT BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT FAST AND HELPLESS BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CREATED MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. THE PRESIDENT TURNS TO ME, IN THAT STATE OF UNION ADDRESSES, AND HE SAID THAT SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AND HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WE GO BACK THE LONGEST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA. UPGRADING THE WATER AND PIPES, MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT. BILL AND LAY DOWN BY UNION PLUMBERS AND PIPE FEEDERS HERE. WE ARE GOING TO UPGRADE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS WITH WEATHERIZATION OF 2 MILLION HOMES. THIS WILL. ONE MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL BACK BETTER , BUILD BACK BETTER. HE PROMISES INTRA-FRACTURE PLANTS. HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. HE PROMISED TO RELIEVE MAIN STREET SLAMMED BY THE RECESSION. GUESS WHERE THAT MONEY WENT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED? A WENT TO THE WEALTHY. , IT WENT TO THE WEALTHY, AND IT DID NOT GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES. MY PLAN TO REVITALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO BUY IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE OVER $3.7 TRILLION BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL FIX WATER PIPELINES AND UPGRADE LED PLANTS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD $100 BILLION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. 4 MILLION BUILDINGS. ADVANCED HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE A RACE FOR JOB CREATION FOR UNIONS, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT I DID THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. NOT ONE SINGLE SOLITARY DOLLAR WENT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PREVAILING WAGE. [APPLAUSE] I AM ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT CORPORATE AMERICA WANTED TO TAKE CARE , TAKEOVER RESIDENCY A PURCHASE SHIPS , APPRENTICESHIPS. I'M GOING TO PASS THE PROACTIVE , PO-ACT. STRENGTHEN LABOR STANDARDS, THE OSHA RULES. THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN DO, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO. WORKERS. HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET BENEFITED. MY DAD HAD ANOTHER EXPRESSION. AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB, AND WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. HE SAID JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR GET IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. EVERY TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HOAX. I THINK JOBS. NO MATTER HOW MANY LIES HE TELLS, I'M NOT BANNING FRACKING. PERIOD. [APPLAUSE] I SAID INSIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER'S WITH POWER. THE ONLY POWER THAT WE HAVE IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE GUYS THEY KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER CITED AT THE GATE FROM TAKING EVERYTHING. THAT IS A FACT. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON FEARING THE MOST? THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON IT. WE WILL HAVE A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, AND PREMIUMS WILL BE LOWER. WE WILL HAVE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER OUT OF COSTS EXPENSES. WE WOULD DO THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE TAKE BACK FROM THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, WITH PLANS THAT WILL , WE WILL WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, BUT PRESCHOOL. THE MATTER WHAT THE BACKGROUND, IF YOU START THEM AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND. TALK TO THE WOMEN AROUND HERE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD FOR FIVE YEARS. I COULD NOT AFFORD HELP. THANK GOD THAT HAD MY SISTER AND MOM AND BROTHER TO HELP WITH MY KIDS, WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. WHEN ERIE GETS ITS FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPENED, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FREE FOR ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GET IN. THAT IS A FACT. [APPLAUSE] THAT COST $6 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE GIVE AS A TAX REDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE THE 9/11 GENERATION. THEY GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, NO GRADUATIONS. THEY ALL GOT SHUT DOWN IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND NOW. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST HOME DOWN PAYMENT. A LOT OF THEM ARE COLLEGE GRADUATES, AND THERE IS NO JOBS, NO ACCESS. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL GET A TAX CREDIT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYING, PROVIDING A DOWN PAYMENT. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MANY OF SENIORS, SO YOU CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE, LIKE WE HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. EARLY VOTING IS OPEN HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. GO TO EARLY VOTING IF YOU CAN. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/PA TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE AND WAKE ABOUT EARLY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEAL THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AND A SECRECY ENVELOPE AND SIGNED THE DECLARATION ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE BEFORE YOU RETURN IT. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I AM SO PROUD IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF SONY PROUD, PATRIOTIC REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THE HOMELAND SECURITY TOM RIDGE. WE AGREE ON THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY. AFTER ALL THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AND AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE, IN THE YEAR 2020, THAT WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TO PARISH ON THIS EARTH, AS LINCOLN SAID. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALL OF THIS DIVISION BEING PUSHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. ALL OF THIS ENCOURAGED. IN THE DEBATE THAT WE HAD, I ASKED HIM TO CONDEMN THE PROUD BOYS? HE SAID TO STAND DOWN AND STAND READY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, FOR REAL. WE CAN ARGUE LIKE HELL, THAT THE END OF THE DAY, WE COME TOGETHER. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. WHY? THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. I THINK THAT WE CAN PULL THIS TOGETHER. I AM OPTIMISTIC. I'D GENUINELY AM. YET TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OUT AND VOTE. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE LOSE THIS IS BY WHAT IS GOING ON RELATIVE TO THE POLLING PLACES. NOT EIGHT SINGLE SOLITARY REASONABLE PERSON SAID THAT MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE CORRECT. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THAT. TRY TO PUT PEOPLE IN POLLING PLACES, THE SAME GUYS THAT YOU SAW BLOCKING PEOPLE'S WAY IN VIRGINIA WITH BANNERS AND RACIAL SLUR ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. SO I SAY TO YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. LET'S GO OUT AND VOTE, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] WHERE MY GOING? AM I GOING THIS WAY? THANKS EVERYBODY. THANKS A MILLION. THANK YOU! [APPLAUSE] (music) U.S. ARMY.

HE SAID NOTHING REEDIT HE TOLD WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THAT'S WHY HE SAID NOTHING. WE DON'T PANIC . AMERICA DOESN'T PANIC BUT TRUMP HAD REARED HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN UNCONSCIONABLE . THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT , THE MORE RECKLESS HE SEEMS TO GET . DOCTOR FAUCI, HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT ON HIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE ROSE GARDEN, HE REFERRED TO THAT AS A SUPER SPREADER. ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT GOT THE DISEASE , HOW IS HE RESPONDING WEST AND MARK GET WHAT GUESS WHAT, HE'S RUNNING AN AD YOU PROBABLY SAW . QUOTING DOCTOR FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT, WAY BACK IN MARCH REFERRING TO PUBLIC OFFICIAL , DOCTOR FAUCI SAID I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE .IN THE RECENT AD THAT'S GOING OUT NATIONALLY , TRUMP QUOTES DOCTOR FAUCI AS SAYING THAT ABOUT HIM, THE PRESIDENT READ TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN LIGHT TAKING IT SOUND LIKE FAUCI WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP. HE WENT ON AIR AND THE ACTING OUT SAYING THREE DAYS AGO, I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THAT QUOTES . IT WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT . AND EVEN AFTER THAT , FAUCI SAID HE DIDN'T SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGN, EVEN AFTER FAUCI LAID THIS OUT THE CAMPAIGN SAID WE ARE STILL GOING TO USE IT BECAUSE HE DID SAY . EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T ABOUT . THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS IT WAS A KNOWING LIVE LIKE WE ARE BEING TOLD ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS . AS A CONSEQUENCE, HIS MONTHS OF IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION , HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS WERE AROUND YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE THIS MORNING ? SOMEONE YOU LOVE , SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT . SOMEONE YOU KNEW, A FAMILY MEMBER OR A NEIGHBOR . MISSING, AND WHY? BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE . LOOK, I DO THIS CAMPAIGN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN BETWEEN SCRANTON AND PARK AVENUE, BETWEEN ALITO AND PARK AVENUE AREA ALSO CAN SEE IS FROM PARK AVENUE IS WALL STREET . THAT'S WHY HIS ONLY MESSAGE FOR AMERICAN PROSPERITY THAT HE VALUES HIS IN DOW JONES AND INDEX . LIKE A LOT OF YOU , I'VE SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME WITH GUYS LIKE TRUMP LOOKING DOWN ON ME . THE IRISH CATHOLIC KID IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD . GUYS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER THAN ME BECAUSE THEY HAD A LOT OF MONEY . GUYS WHO INHERITED EVERYTHING THEY EVER GOT AND STILL MANAGED TO SQUANDER IT . I HAVE TO ADMIT , I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ON ON RECORD SAYING , I STILL HAVE A BIT OF A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT GUYS LIKE HIM . I READ SOME STORIES AFTER I GOT THE NOMINATION THAT QUOTES, BIDEN GETS ELECTED , YOU'LL BE THE FIRST NON-IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL GRADUATE TO GET ELECTED IN 80 OR 90 YEARS . HAVE A SEAT MAN . LIKE SOME STATE , I'M PROUD OF IT, IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH IN TERMS OF MONEY BUT FULL, SINCE WHEN CAN SOMEONE WHO WENT TO A STATE UNIVERSITY NOT BE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT ? FOLKS, I KNOW IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT . I SAT BACK FOR EIGHT YEARS WATCHING AND PARTICIPATING . MY MOM TAUGHT ME THAT WHAT YOU ARE PROBABLY TAUGHT BY YOUR PARENTS TOO. HE SAID JOEY, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU . BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL . I DON'T MEASURE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNT . I DON'T RESPECT PEOPLE BASED ON WHETHER THEY OWN A MANSION . I DON'T JUDGE THEM WHETHER THERE BASED ON WHETHER THEY BELONG TO A COUNTRY CLUB . YOU WANT TO MEASURE BY PEOPLE BY THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR HONESTY , THEIR COURAGE . THEIR COURAGE FOR MOMMIES TO SAY THE GREATEST KIDS OF ALL , THE GREATEST VIRTUE IS COURAGE . YOU'RE REDEEMED BY YOUR COURAGE . THAT'S WHAT SHE'D SAY , AND REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY . HONESTY, LOYALTY, THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN YOURSELF . THOSE ARE THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE WERE RAISED IN IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY . DECENCY, HONOR, OPPORTUNITY THESE ARE THE VALUES I LEARNED GROWING UP IN SCRANTON AND MY GUESS IS YOU LEARNED GROWING UP IN TOLEDO WHEREVER YOU GREW UP PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY OR STOCK AND EVERY PENNY MY DAD MADE WENT TO PAY THE BILLS , KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. EVERY PENNY OUR FRIENDS IN SCRANTON MADE WENT TO PAYING THE BILLS AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL AND WE LOOKED OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBORS . THAT'S WHY I HAVE A DIFFERENT MEASURE BY WHICH I JUDGE THE HEALTH OF AMERICA'S ECONOMY . I SEE HARD WORK , HARD-WORKING WOMEN AND MEN TRYING TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY , JUST WANT EVEN SHOT . THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR A FAIR SHOT . AND YOU KNOW, GIVEN A SHOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NEVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRIES DOWN. NEVER. ANOTHER EXPRESSION MY DAD WOULD HAVE IS WHEN YOU SEE THE ABUSE OF POWER , THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO RESPOND TO IT AND THAT'S WITH POWER . AND THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE TO TAKE ON CORPORATE AMERICA IS UNION POWER . THAT'S THE ONLY POWER . I CAN THINK BACK TO 2008 WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED AND WE HAD THE WORST DEPRESSION IN HISTORY, PRESIDENT OF PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT . $800 BILLION WAS NEEDED TO SAVE OUR ECONOMY. WE GET IT WITH LESS THAN 2/10 OF ONE PERCENT WASTE OR FRAUD . WE WERE ABLE TO SEE A HIGHWAY OTHER STATES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS THEIR ECONOMIC PAIN AND RECOVER AND REBUILD . TO MAKE SURE WE GET TEACHERS , FIREFIGHTERS AND COPS , PUBLIC NURSES ON THE JOB. PEOPLE WERE BEING LAID OFF NOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT . SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE FIRED BECAUSE OF LACK OF MONEY. WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPED UP AND STARTED LONGEST SUSTAINED ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY . AT THIS GUY INHERITED AND THEN SQUANDERED AGAIN . BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE STATES . HE SAID QUOTE, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT . I HEARD THAT BEFORE , YOU HEARD IT TOO. THE REPUBLICANS SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY . LIKE I SAID, I COME FROM AN AUTOMOBILE STATE . THE AUTO INDUSTRY SUPPORTED 108 HIGHLANDS , WAS ON THE BRINK . WAS MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO BUT YOU REMEMBER LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. IT WAS ON THE BRINK. BARACK AND I BET ON YOU THE AMERICAN WORKER AND IT PAID OFF . ARGUED AN AMERICAN WORKER WAS NOT FINEST WORKER IN THE WORLD READ MANAGEMENT SCREWED UP, YOU DIDN'T . YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE AND BY THE WAY , IT'S ALL GOT PAID BACK BUT GUESS YOU MADE THE GREATEST SACRIFICE ? AUTO WORKERS. YOU MADE THE SACRIFICES TO GET IT BACK . SO IT'S OVER THE MANY OBJECTIONS OF MANY WHO STEPPED IN , RUSHED IN TO SAVE THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER GAVE 1 MILLION JOBS AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE ? REMEMBER WHAT TRUMP SAID IN 2017? HE SAID DON'T MOVE, DON'T SELL YOUR HOUSE . IT'S SHUT DOWN THE ON SLOT AFTER A DECADE IN CLEVELAND , I MET WITH AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN LORDSTOWN, HER HUSBAND WAS THERE AS WELL . ONE OF THE WORKERS LOST HIS JOB . HE HAD TO ACCEPT THE TRANSFER TO KENTUCKY EIGHT HOURS AWAY , ONE WAY TO CHANGE HEALTHCARE IN HIS PENSION. HE'S GONE 16 HOURS A WEEKEND . TO SEE HER AND THE TWO KIDS TRUMPS THE TRAIL DOESN'T STOP THERE. HE BETRAYED UNION WORKERS AT GOODYEAR WHEN HE CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF BUYING GOODYEAR TIRES BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL GRUDGE . HE PASSED THE TAX BILL TO THE SUPER WEALTHY CORPORATIONS THAT PROVIDED INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS . FOLKS, MANUFACTURING IS THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA . WHERE IN A MANUFACTURING RECESSION BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP EVEN BEFORE THE VIRUS DID YOU WERE DOWN 647,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE BECAUSE THE CRISIS STARTED . OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS MEANING WE'RE SENDING MORE OVERSEAS AND COMING TO US , ANYWHERE BUYING MORE OVERSEAS AND WE'RE SELLING AND IT'S HIGHER THAN IT'S BEEN IN A LONG TIME. THERE'S STILL NINE, 10,900 AUTO WORKER MANUFACTURING JOBS IN OHIO THAT HAVE NOT COME BACK. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER 90 YEARS AGO , THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS AND HE HAD WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE . DONALD TRUMP'S ONLY PLAN IS MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY . MOST OF YOU IF YOU STILL HAVE A JOB PAID MORE LAST YEAR IN TAXES, $750 , COME ON. THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED . WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT . $30 MILLION , A NEW PROPOSAL . FOR THE GAMES OF THE HUNDRED RICHEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA , 30 BILLION . THEY MADE $30 BILLION . ALONE. THIS YEAR. WHILE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED . IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC , WHY DO REPUBLICANS HAVE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC NEED FOR LOCALITIES? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. IT'S ABOUT FINALLY GETTING HIS WISH TO WIPE OUT THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT . BECAUSE THEIR NOMINEE SAID IN THE PAST THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN . HIS RELATIVES EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE . SECTIONS FOR WELL OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN HIS PLEDGE TO TERMINATE THE TAX DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOCIAL SECURITY . DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUARIES OF SOCIAL SECURITY THE PART OF SAID? IF IT GOES THROUGH , TAXIS TALKING ABOUT WILL ACTUALLY BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023 . GO HOME AND TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT . NOT ONCE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED FOR A HIGH-LEVEL MEETING BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE . THIS IS GOING ON NOW. THE HOUSE HAD ALREADY PASSED TAX IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER HIS POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RECONCILE PEOPLE IN REAL TROUBLE. GET HELP TO STATES LIKE WE DID . NOT ONCE CALLED A MEETING BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS . TO DELIVER THE NEW RELIEF PACKAGE OR WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES GOING BANKRUPT . HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN THE BUNKER OF HIS GOLF COURSE OR IN THE BUNKER OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE WAS WILLING TO ACTUALLY SIT TO TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT. CHECK IT OUT . FIRST PRESIDENT I CAN EVER REMEMBER IN THE MIDDLE OF A NATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS DID NOT TRY TO CALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER . HE TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER DO THAT . [APPLAUSE] FOLKS , THAT'S WHY MY BILL BACK BETTER PLAN IS BUILT AROUND A SIMPLE CONCEPT . IT'S TIME TO REWARD WORK , NOT WEALTH . WORK. I NEED IT. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY A BIG WALL STREET FIRM CALLED MUTED MOVIES , NOT DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK, THEY DID AN ANALYSIS OF MY ECONOMIC PLAN TO REVIVE THIS COUNTRY . AN ANALYSIS OF HIS. WHAT THEY CONCLUDED . MY PLAN WOULD CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . 7 MILLION MORE AND THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC PLAN IT WOULD GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF AN ADDITIONAL TRILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. WHAT THESE GUYS DON'T GET IS YOU DO WELL, WHEN MY FAMILY GOES WELL , EVERYBODY DOES BETTER . EVERYBODY DOES BETTER . THAT'S THE GOD'S TRUTH . HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR . IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN 400 YARD BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TAX RACE AREA IF YOU'RE MAKING OVER 400 . BUT LOOK, YOU PAY A PENNY MORE. IN FACT, TENS OF MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WILL GET A TAX CUT WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST . IF WE JUST RAISE THE TAX BACK TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE 20% THAT GENERATES OVER $100 BILLION. YOU HEAR ME? THAT IS MONEY. IT SHOULD BE $1.3 TRILLION AND THAT IS WHAT IT RAISES TO HELP HARD-WORKING FOLKS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE COMES ALONG THIS TIME. MY PLAN WILL CREATE 1 MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND BUILDING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEEDED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. YOU'RE NOT INVESTING IN RESEARCH RESEARCH. IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. YOU KNOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVERY YEAR SPENT $600 BILLION JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SHIPS AND PLANES, CARS AND TRAINS AND ALL THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTRACTS FOR. I PROMISE YOU THIS, EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT, EVERY SINGLE CONTRACT WILL BE ONLY LET TO A COMPANY OR FIRM THAT MAKES IT IN AMERICA FROM BEGINNING TO END, NOT A JOKE. IT WILL USE TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS, SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES AND 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND IN EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. WE WILL REBUILD CRUMBLING SCHOOLS, RETROFIT FORMALLY IN BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZE 2 MILLION HOMES CREATING 1 MILLION NEW JOBS AND THE REASON WHY EVERYONE FROM THE ELECTIVE WORKS IN EVERY MAJOR STRONG SUPPORT AND IT WILL ALL BE DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR LABOR. YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE $800 BILLION, NOT ONE SINGLE CONTRACT WHEN OUT THAT WASN'T PREVAILING WAGE, NOT ONE. [HONKING & CHEERING] SO WE WILL END TRUMPS NEW INCENTIVE FOR SENDING JOBS ABROAD AND THAT IS WHAT HE HAS DONE, MORE JOBS GOING ABROAD NOW. ANY COMPANY THAT WILL OFFSHORE A JOB WILL 10% PENALTY. ANY COMPANY THAT BRINGS BACK A JOB WILL REOPEN TO CLOSE FACTORIES LIKE A MANUFACTURING THEY WILL GET A 10% CREDIT FOR THEIR INVESTMENT. WE WILL MAKE A TRADE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY AMERICAN WORKER EVERY AMERICAN JOB AND ACTUALLY GET RESULTS. NOT TRUMPS TRADE WAR, ERRATIC TWEETS AND BLUSTER BUT IT IS ONLY STIFFED AMERICAN WORKERS AND CONSUMERS, INCLUDING FARMERS FARMERS. HE HAS LET YOU DOWN. HE HAS LET US DOWN. I PROMISE YOU I WILL STAND UP TO CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES I WILL INVEST IN THE AMERICAN WORKER BECAUSE I KNOW NO ONE, NOBODY CANNOT COMPETE IN AMERICAN WORKER WHEN THEY GOTTEN A FAIR SHOT. NOBODY IN THE WORLD. ONE MORE THING, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN AND NORMA'S FLEET OF VEHICLES BUT WE WILL CONVERT MANY OF THEM TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND YOU WILL STILL NEED TO BUILD THE TRANSMISSIONS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME BUT ANY NEW JOB IN THAT AREA WILL GO TO PEOPLE WHO IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY ARE WHO IN THE MANUFACTURING AND UAW WILL MAKE THESE NEW VEHICLES. SOURCE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA HEARD THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE AND DEMAND SUPPORT TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO COMPETE IN THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY WILL STEP UP AND I WILL EXPAND CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN MODERN NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR AMERICA CONSUMERS TO MOVE TO THE VEHICLES OF THE FUTURE. BY BUILDING A NETWORK OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHARGING STATIONS AND TO SWAP OLDER FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS AND WE WILL MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT HIS TECHNOLOGY IS TAKING US AND MAKE SURE UAW LEADS THE WAY AND HOW WE DO IT. TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN 1 MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. FOLKS, IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN DO ANYTHING AND I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IN THE NEXT FOUR, SIX YEARS, EIGHT YEARS THAN ANYTHING THAN ANY TIME IN MY WHOLE CAREER. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEY'VE SEEN WHAT THE COMBINATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE RACIAL INEQUALITY WE ARE FACING AND WHAT IS GOING ON INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE READY TO STEP UP AND THEY KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE. NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING IS BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND I MEAN THAT. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS STRONGER THAN WE WOULD BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE. AS I SAID TO OTHER WORLD LEADERS NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THERE IS NO QUIT IN AMERICA. THERE IS NONE. IN AMERICA WE CAN DO ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO IF WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER, NOTHING CAN STOP US. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING PRETTY AND RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR THE SENATE WHEN IRAN AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR VICE PRESIDENT AND RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR PRESIDENT. I PROMISE YOU THIS, I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL GOVERN FOR EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR ME AS WELL AS AGAINST ME. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BEAT WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. [HONKING & CHEERING] THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO VOTE, VOTE AND VISIT OHIO .COM. GOD LETS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE AUTOWORKERS. WHICH WAY AM I GOING? [HONKING & CHEERING] MY GRANDFATHER WOULD SAY JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDFATHER SAID JOEY, NO SPREAD IT. GO SPREAD THE FAITH. LET'S WIN THIS THING.

[APPLAUSE] IT GIVES ME GREAT HONOR AND HOPE TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) HELLO CINCINNATI. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

THANK YOU FOR THAT PASSPORT INTO THE CITY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP WORKING FOR YOU I CANNOT SEEM IN THE LIGHT. THANK YOU MR. MAYOR IN THE MAYOR IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND WITH A HELLO ONE OF THE MOST DECENT MEN I KNOW WHO OCCUPIES MY SEAT IN THE UNITED STATE SENATE WE WERE TRUMAN SCHOLARS TOGETHER YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT I APPRECIATE IT. KATE YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. THERE IS AN OLD JOKE A LONG TIME AGO A SENATOR SAID TO ME WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND MY SECOND TERM HE SAID JOE, I WILL COME TO DELAWARE AND CAMPAIGN FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU WHENEVER WHOLESALE LANDERS BUT DID NOT HURT YOU BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE KATE, WE NEED YOU IN U.S. CONGRESS AND THEY MEAN THAT. THE REASON I SAY THAT YOU ARE HEALTHCARE ADVOCATE AND A CANCER SURVIVOR, MOM, AND WE NEED LEADERS LIKE YOU REPRESENTING PEOPLE IN THE FIRST DISTRICT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON EVERY DAY. IN THE DISCUSSIONS TAKING PLACE AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE IN THE MORNING WHEN FAMILY STILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION, JOYCE. BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME SAY I AM SADDENED TO HEAR ONE OF MY BASEBALL HEROES, JOE MORGAN, A GOOD MAN PASSED AWAY. MY CONDOLENCES TO THE MORGAN FAMILY AND HIS TEAMMATES. HE PLAYED ONE YEAR AT THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES. I WILL GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BUT I HAPPEN TO GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HE WANTED TO HAVE DINNER YOU HAD TO BE A YANKEES FAN BECAUSE OF THE AAA BALLCLUB AND MY GRANDPA WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN AND A GREAT YANKEES FAN. IT WAS HARD BACK THEN BUT IN DELAWARE IF YOU ARE NOT A PHILLIES THE END WE PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WERE NOT A PHILLIES FAN I WOULD BE SLEEPING ALONE. [LAUGHTER] YOU THINK I'M KIDDING. I AM NOT. BURGER PLAYED FOR A YEAR IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY. HE WAS THE VOICE AS ONE OF THE GREAT BASEBALL ANNOUNCERS IN HISTORY . . . . CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN OHIO. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT YOU WIN OHIO YOU ARE THE STARTING GATE AND AGAIN I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS I WAS TELLING THE MAYOR WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE I WAS 29 IN WASHINGTON AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER SAYING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD JUST BEEN KILLED AND MY TWO BOYS WERE BADLY INJURED AND THEY WERE NOT SURE IF I'D MAKE IT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK ABOUT THREE HOURS AND THE JAWS OF LIFE TO GET MY KIDS OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE THEY WERE BROADSIDED BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER. MY SISTER MANAGED MY CAMPAIGN MY YOUNGER SISTER AND MUCH YOUNGER BROTHER RAISED ALL THE MONEY WE RAISED, $187,000. WE WENT TO OUR GOVERNOR TO DETERMINE WHO THEY WOULD PICK IN MY SPOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T PLAN ON GOING. A LOT OF REALLY FINE MEN WHO IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME AND REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAME TO ME AND SAID HE'S COMING TO STAY FOR SIX MONTHS AND HELP US ORGANIZE. I STARTED COMMUTING EVERY DAY BACK AND FORTH. THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE WHEN THEY PUBLISHED THAT, THEY KEEP RECORDS ON HOW MANY MILES YOU TRAVEL. AND I TRAVELED OVER A MILLION 4,000 MILES. I USED TO LIKE TO TAKE THE TRAIN HOME BECAUSE IT COST A LOT OF MONEY BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT FELT MUCH MORE SECURE BUT THEY HUMORED ME AND LET ME GO HOME. I REMEMBERED GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND I GOT TO KNOW THEIR FAMILY. THEY SAID I JUST READ JOEY. BIG DEAL. WENT TO NEW JERSEY AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILES YOU TRAVEL ON AMTRAK, NO I DON'T. HE SAID WE FIGURE 117 HERE AND THE NEXT NUMBER OF DAYS YOU TRAVEL TO MILLION 100,000 ON AMTRAK. I THINK I HOLD A RECORD OTHER THAN A CONDUCTOR. MY POINT IS WE WILL END UP MOVING HIGH-SPEED RAIL IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE AND THE REASON I WENT HOME IS THE SAME REASON YOU ALL TRY TO AND THAT IS TO BE THERE IN THE EVENING WHEN MY KIDS WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING, MY SON, AND MY DAUGHTER ASHLEY, GET THEM BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING ON THE WAY TO THE STATION AND THEN AS THEY GOT OLDER IT WASN'T THE CASE, BUT KISS THEM GOOD NIGHT. I KNOW DAD, WE'VE GOT TO SAY THREE HAIL MARYS. IT'S ONE WAY THAT I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE PRESS THAT TRAVEL WITH ME FOR REPEATING IT, BUT USUALLY I COULD GET THE 7:00 ON THE FAST TRAIN. YOU GET OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY EXIT AND I WONDER LITERALLY SITTING THERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW WHAT WERE THOSE PARENTS TALKING ABOUT AT THAT DINING ROOM TABLE, WHAT WERE THEY DOING BEFORE THEY PUT THEIR KIDS TO BED. MY GUESS IS THEY TALK ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY. THEY ARE ASKING QUESTIONS AS PROFOUND AS ORDINARY. ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. WHO'S GOING TO TELL HER WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO BACK TO THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOU'VE GOT TO DRIVE ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET NEW TIRES. IT'S ABOUT ANSWERING THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE WASN'T A COALMINER BUT MY GREATGREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS A MINING ENGINEER. MY DAD USED TO SAY THE JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KIDS IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. THAT IS A LESSON THAT I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN AND IT'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA WHEN MY DAD TOOK US TO DELAWARE BUT WE FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AGAIN AND THAT IS THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD IN SCRANTON LIKE HERE IN CINCINNATI. UNEMPLOYMENT IS UP AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK REMAINS VERY CERTAIN AND MISHANDLED. ACROSS OHIO IN THIS COUNTRY FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEXT RENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENT OR WHETHER THEY WILL BE OUT IN THE STREET. WHETHER THEY CAN PURCHASE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG THEY NEED OR HOW MUCH FOOD THEY CAN PUT ON THE TABLE. MAKING HARD CHOICES WORRYING ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL A CHILD IS ENROLLED IN IS GOING TO BE OPEN. WHAT DO THEY DO IF I GO TO WORK, WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM, HOW DO WE DO THAT? THEY SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP DOING BETTER AND BETTER EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS RECESSION. YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. 215,000 PEOPLE DEAD. EXPERTS ARE TELLING US WE MAY LOSE UP TO ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES BY THE END OF JANUARY ALL BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT ONE THING, THE STOCK MARKET. IT'S ESTIMATED IF WE JUST WORE MASKS, THE ONE I JUST TOOK OFF TO SPEAK THE EXPERTS SAY WE COULD SAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR 100,000 LIVES. THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY I THINK IT WAS THE 28TH OF JANUARY WHEN THE COMMITTEE KEPT TELLING US HOW SERIOUS THE PANDEMIC WOULD BE, HE KNEW THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND AN EXTREMELY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, AIRBORNE, BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. BUT OUT OF HIS DESIRE TO TRY TO GET BOB WOODWARD TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM HE DID A LONG INTERVIEW WITH THEM AND HE WENT ON RECORD SAYING HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS, BUT HE DID AND SAID NOTHING EXCEPT PRAISING THE GREAT PERFORMANCE AND HOW TRANSPARENT HE WAS. ASK YOURSELF WHY DID HE NOT TELL THE COUNTRY OR HOW BETTER OFF WOULD HE BE HAD HE TOLD THE COUNTRY. HE SAID NOTHING. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. HE HAS BEEN UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER HE'S PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. DOCTOR FAUCI, THE MOST RESPECTED PERSON IN THIS AREA, IN THE COUNTRY REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN AS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT PUBLICLY CRITICIZING YOU AND HOW IS HE RESPONDING, HE IS RUNNING A NATIONAL AS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY QUOTING HIM OUT OF CONTEXT. DOCTOR FAUCI SAID BACK IN MARCH REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. BUT TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN WERE USED TO DECEPTION AND NOT TELLING THE TRUTH AND TOLD A LIE BY PUTTING FAUCI IN THE AD IN PLYING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP SAYING HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD DO ANY BETTER. AFTER FAUCI SAW THE AD HE WENT PUBLIC. HE CAME AFTER THAT AND SAID I DIDN'T GIVE PERMISSION AND IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER HE SAID THAT. AND I LISTEN TO YOUR TALK. EVEN AFTER HE SAID THAT, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. THEY CONTINUED TO LIE AND SAID WE ARE KEEPING IT IN THE AD. THE SAME THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO INCREASE TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FOLKS AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF CREDIBILITY. LOOK, THEY USE IT KNOWING THAT IT'S A LIE. CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OTHER MAJOR MAINSTREAM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS? AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MONTHS OF OVERWHELMING LYING AND MISLEADING AND IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION, ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND THE DINNER TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE, HOW MANY? HOW MANY BROTHERS, SISTERS, MOMS, DADS ARE GONE? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS DESPITE THE CRISIS WE FACE, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. WE ALWAYS COME OUT OF THE CRISIS STRONGER. THAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF WHO WE ARE. WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK AND GIVE EVERYBODY A FAIR RETURN ON THEIR WORK AND BEGIN TO REWARD WORK AND NOT JUST WEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE BREAK THE CYCLE WILL. THE ANSWER IS JUSTICE. I KNOW THE NATION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SAFE STREETS FOR THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND TOO OFTEN TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF LOOTING AND BURNING WHICH IS NEVER JUSTIFIED. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR THE ARMED MILITIA ROAMING THE STREETS. WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS MANAGING THE COMMUNITIES. READING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MICHIGAN, THE GOVERNOR IS A GOOD FRIEND. THEY ARE IN THE DRIVEWAY WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS. WHAT ABOUT THOSE GUYS YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME LACKS HE SAID I WOULD TELL THEM TO STAND BACK AND STAND BY. I WORKED IN THE COMMITTEE IN DELAWARE AND THAT IS CALLED A DOG WHISTLE. THEY SAY WE SHOULD TRUST THE AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES THROUGH THEIR JOB AS I DO AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT THE GROUPS ACTING AS VIGILANTES. THEY SAY WE HAVE NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU HAVEN'T OPENED YOUR EYES TO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS FOR A LONG TIME. I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I DECIDED TO RUN WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS MARCHING OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM AND ASK THE PRESIDENT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. MARK IT DOWN. THERE'VE BEEN A VERY POWERFUL VOICES IN THE RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS. I'VE SPENT SOME TIME. I KNELT DOWN TO SAY HI TO HER AND SHE SAID IN A SOFT VOICE DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD. ALSO GOT TO KNOW JACOB'S MOM AND THE WHOLE FAMILY. VIOLENCE DIDN'T REFLECT HER SON AND THE NATION NEEDED HEALING. ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND PRETTY MOVING CHOKING BACK TEARS REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, QUOTE, WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. IT'S AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T LOVE US BACK. THINK ABOUT THAT. THERE'S A DEEP LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR TOO LONG HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY RECOGNIZED. SOME TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF. WE'VE NEVER MET THAT STANDARD. MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER. IT WAS TURNED BACK IN A BIG WAY. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I THINK WE NEED THE LEADERSHIP TO DE-ESCALATE TENSION AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER TO HEAL AND HOPE. THAT IS A PRESIDENTS JOB. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE AND BUILD WEALTH. IT'S ABOUT JOBS, GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY, FAMILIES OF COLOR BUILDING WEALTH, BEING ABLE TO PASS IT DOWN LIKE MY IRISH CATHOLIC FOLKS WERE ABLE TO DO AND BUILD HOME-EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS, MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS RECESSION WHETHER IN THE CITY OR THE SUBURBS. TESTING, TRACING, NOT POLITICIZING THE RACE FOR A VACCINE WITH SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PPE, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES AND FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TO REOPEN SAFELY. IF YOU NOTICE THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS RESPONSIBILITY HE SAID I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS A QUOTE. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. NO NATIONAL STANDARD HAS BEEN SET BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH AND WE CAN DO SO MUCH. FOR SO MANY FAMILIES EXPERIENCING IT BETWEEN RAISING YOUR KIDS WHILE CARING FOR AND AGING LOVED ONE. IT'S REAL. PROTECT YOUR HEALTHCARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. WHY DO SO MANY REPUBLICANS TODAY HAVE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT WITH 22 DAYS LEFT TO GO. THINK ABOUT THAT. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS $145 BILLION UP TO THE STATES AND LOCALITIES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LAY OFF COPS, FIREFIGHTERS, SCHOOL TEACHERS, NURSES, FIRST RESPONDERS. I WILL TELL YOU WHY THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S ALL ABOUT WIPING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN AN OBSESSION SINCE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. THE NOMINEES SAID IN THE PAST THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AWAY FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS BECAUSE OF HIS MISHANDLING OF THE ECONOMY AND COVID, 10 MILLION HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING COVERAGE FOR 100 PLUS MILLION AMERICANS AND COMPLICATIONS TO COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD PUT HOW MANY MILLIONS IF THERE'S ALREADY SO MANY CONTRACTING COVID IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT HAPPENS THEN, IT CANNOT BE COVERED. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US BACKWARDS WHERE THEY CAN CHARGE A WOMAN MORE FOR THE SAME TREATMENT THAT THEY CHARGE A MAN. PREGNANCY ONCE AGAIN BECOMES A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WE COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH A NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTION. A NONPROFIT PUBLIC OPTION WHICH IS GIVING A REAL COMPETITOR AND INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES SO PREMIUMS ARE LOWER AND YOU CAN AFFORD PLANS AND LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. WE CAN ONLY DO ANY OF THIS IF THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER. LAST WEEK, WENT TO GETTYSBURG PENNSYLVANIA WHERE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TOLD US A HOUSE DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. TODAY HOPE SEEMS ELUSIVE. THE POLICIES ARE RIPPING US APART. AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE AND GET PUNISHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. I REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISAN. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. STILL BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. I SAY THAT AND I SAID THAT FROM THE TIME I ANNOUNCED. YOU'VE GOT A LOT DONE BEFORE, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE CAN, AND WE MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE. I'MI AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] THERE WILL BE NO BLUE STATES AND RED STATES. IT'S ONE AMERICA. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. IT'S HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AND THOSE THAT VOTED FOR ME. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT, THE ABILITY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYBODY. WE CAN DISAGREE ON POLICY, BUT STILL CARE. YOU HAVE A SACRED DUTY, A SACRED OBLIGATION TO VOTE. IT MATTERS. OHIO MATTERS. YOU ELECTED ME AND I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN 2020. I PROMISE TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. SO PLEASE, VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE TO REQUEST YOUR ABSENTEE BALLOT AND VOTE BY MAIL TO CONFIRM YOUR EARLY VOTING LOCATIONS TO VOTE EARLY IN PERSON AND FIND YOUR POLLING PLACE. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A PLAN. BRING ALONG FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE THEIR PLAN TO VOTE AS WELL. NO MATTER WHAT, DON'T LET ANYBODY DISCOURAGE YOU AND TELL YOU THAT YOUR VOICE WILL NOT BE COUNTED. IT DOES. DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY THE TALK OF HAVING SOME OF THESE PROUD BOYS STAND THERE WITH THEIR RIFLES TO TRY TO OPEN CARRY AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. YOU DECIDE OUR FUTURE. VOTE AND TURN OUT IN LARGE NUMBERS. I SAID I WAS RUNNING TO RESTORE AMERICA. IT'S TIME TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS TIME, BRINGING EVERYBODY ALONG. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, AGE, GENDER, DISABILITY, EVERYBODY GETS TO COME ALONG. IT'S TIME TO UNITE AMERICA. WE WILL DO THAT BY CHOOSING HOPE OVER FEAR, SCIENCE OVER FICTION, TRUTH OVER LIES AND UNITY OVER DIVISION. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE NATION WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER. SO IT'S TIME TO STAND UP, TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY, UNITE, AND LET'S FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICA. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. ..

YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE PUBLISHED THIS PIECE OF IT MID-SEPTEMBER, RHOMBUS IS KEPT, TRUMP'S CLAIMS A MONUMENTAL STEP STILL AT IT. ALSO THIS TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY. REPUBLICANS WILL BE PROVIDING FAR BETTER HEALTHCARE THAN THE DEMOCRAT COME DEMOCRATS AT FAR LOWER COST AND WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. JULIE ROVNER, WHAT WE NOTE THAT ANY POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN OR WHITE HOUSE LED HEALTHCARE PLAN? Guest: NOT VERY MUCH. THE PRESIDENT DID FINALLY HAVE A BIG AND FAILING. HE MADE SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA OF HIS AMERICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN , (music) (music) (music) (music) BRING ME YOUR HIGHER LOVE (music) (music) GOOD AFTERNOON, BROWARD COUNTY. WELCOME TO THE CALL SECTOR SOUTH WAS FOCAL POINT SENIOR CENTER HERE IN PEMBROKE PINES. MY FRIENDS, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE TO WELCOME SOMEONE WHO I KNOW WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] I SAY 32 YEARS BECAUSE WE BACK WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA I WAS A MEMBER OF STUDENTS FOR BIDEN IN 1988 AND WHERE MY BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT BUTTON ON MY BACKPACK ALL OVER CAMPUS. AND SO THE THRILL AND OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY HERE IN PEMBROKE PINES AND WELCOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TO OUR DISTRICT AND OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA IS JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. BECAUSE THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION ARE SO HIGH FOR ALL OF US. BUT FOR OUR SENIORS IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY, , HEALTH, SAFETY AND SURVIVAL. WE HAVE WITNESSED AN EPIC FAILURE BY DONALD TRUMP TO CONFRONT AND MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC. JUST LOOK AT OUR LIVES RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT THAT GATHERING WE ARE IN MIDST OF. GRANDPARENTS CAN'T SAFELY SEE OR HUG YOUR KIDS OR THE GRANDKIDS. WE'VE HAD MORE THAN 15,000 NEEDLESS FUNERALS HERE IN FLORIDA. FUNERALS WHICH BY THE WAY WE CAN'T FULLY ATTEND AS FAMILIES BECAUSE THIS BY RACE ISN'T TRULY UNDER CONTROL. OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS SO TIED TO TRAVEL AND LEISURE IS BEING RAVAGED. AND FROM THE BEGINNING TRUMP HAS FAILED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY LEAVING A RECORD OF DEATH, DECEIT AND THE NILE IN HIS WAKE. HE LEFT SENIORS TO INFER THEMSELVES WITH NO PLAN TO CONTAIN THIS DEADLY VIRUS. EVEN WHEN CHUCK MANAGES TO RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS HE PUT SENIORS IN MORE DANGER. ABOUT ONE IN THREE FLORIDIANS RELY ON THAT ABOUT ONE IN THREE OLDER FLORIDIANS RELY ON SOCIAL SECURITY AS THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME, AND OVER 4.5 MILLION COUNT ON MEDICARE. YET DONALD TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS THREATEN THE SURVIVAL AND STABILITY OF THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, NEITHER OF THESE MEN WALKED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT THE BLESSINGS OF FLORIDA SENIORS. AM I RIGHT? YES, THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. [APPLAUSE] MUCH IS MADE IN THE RISE OF THE YOUTHFUL AND THANK GOD FOR IT BUT IT IS RESIDENCE WHO ARE 65 AND OLDER WHO STILL MAKE ELECTIONS HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVELS THROUGH FLORIDA, AND ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF OUR SENIORS TURN OUT AT THE POLLS EVERY SINGLE ELECTION. SO WHILE TRUMP CLOSES DOWN THE GOVERNMENT SPENT THE NEXT GREAT FORCE, LIES TO AMERICANS ABOUT THE THREAT IT POSES OR PUSHES ANOTHER QUACK CURE, JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN TO GET COVID-19 UNDER CONTROL. AND FOR THE LONG TIME SECURITY OF OUR SENIORS, JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN THAT STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY COMPARED TO JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN SHOCKINGLY DONALD TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR HE WOULD SHRED THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THIS VITAL SAFETY NET FOR OUR SENIORS. YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. THIS MAN WANTS TO TRY TO WIN FLORIDA AND HE WOULD SHRED THAT VITAL SAFETY NET. JOE BIDEN RIGHTLY SAYS THIS THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IN THAT BATTLE JOE BIDEN WILL NOT HAVE VITAL PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TO FALL VICTIM TO THIS. IT IS A LIFE-SAVING PROGRAM FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN SENIOR CITIZENS. SO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. JOE BIDEN WON'T SACRIFICE SOCIAL SECURITY OR THREATEN THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE. JOE BIDEN WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SCREW WITH ALL THE POLITICAL MUSCLE HE CAN MUSTER. THE INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED A CRISIS IN OUR NURSING HOMES AND LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. AS TRUMP CONTINUES TO SIT ON HIS HANDS, JOE BIDEN RELEASED A PLANNED INCREASE SAFETY AND OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY SO OUR LOVED ONES CAN BE CARED FOR WITH THE DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE. WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING MEDICARE AND LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN WILL GO TO BAT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS BECAUSE HE'S DONE ALL DISLIKED HER PROTECTING SENIORS ISN'T JUST SOME REALITY SHOW GIMMICK AND JOE BIDEN , THEN MOVED ON FROM THE NEXT DAY. PROTECTING SENIORS IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. IT'S WHO HE'S ALWAYS BEEN. FROM THE VILLAGES IN CENTRAL FLORIDA TO SUNRISE LAKES AND KINGS POINT IN BROWARD COUNTY, IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS OUR SENIORS KNOW THAT THEY CAN TRULY COUNT ON JOE BIDEN. THEY CAN, JOE BIDEN TO PROTECT SOURCES COULD BECOME PRESERVE MEDICARE AND MAKE THEIR MEDICATIONS LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE AFFORDABLE. AND DEEP DOWN SENIORS KNOW THEY CAN COUNT ON JOE BIDEN TO TAKE OF THIS VIRUS IT SAFELY REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR FRIENDS, CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. FLORIDA SENIORS KNOW THEY HAVE A FRIEND AND ALLY IN JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS STOOD BY THEM AND EVEN IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS ONE HE WILL NEVER LEAVE THEIR SIDE. THAT TRUST WILL SHOW ITSELF ON ELECTION DAY. IT ALREADY IS. I JUST KNOW IT. 21 DAYS, MY MY FRIENDS. ON TO VICTORY FOR FLORIDA, , FOR FLORIDA SENIORS AND FOR ALL OF AMERICA. 90 SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] , THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) HELLO, MY NAME IS TOBY FOYER. I WAS BORN IN THE BRONX. I GREW UP IN NEW YORK CITY. I I GOT MARRIED AND HAD TO MAKE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. I WORKED 25 YEARS AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE IN ADMINISTRATION AND MOVED HERE TO BROWARD COUNTY IN 1998 TO ALLEGEDLY RETIRE. WELL, IT WASN'T MUCH, MUCH OF A RETIREMENT FOR ME. I IMMEDIATELY BECAME INVOLVED WITH MY CONDO ASSOCIATION OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY, AND I SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON THE CITY COMMISSION. I LIKE TO CALL MYSELF A PROFESSIONAL VOLUNTEER. I WORK WITH FLORIDA AMERICA, THE WESTERN MUSIC SOCIETY, WESTERN FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY, AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN, TO NAME JUST A FEW. IN SHORT, I LIKE TO STAY BUSY. WE OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES, BUT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS, THIS REALLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE WILL EVER VOTE IN. LIKE SO MANY SENIORS I PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND I PLANNED MY RETIREMENT AROUND THAT INCOME. BUT NOW DONALD TRUMP IS THREATENING TO DEFINED SOCIAL SECURITY. SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS DEPEND ON SOCIAL SECURITY , DEFINED , AS THEIR SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME. AND FOR A PRESIDENT TO BREAK HIS PROMISE TO US IS UNCONSCIONABLE, ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. BEFORE COVID-19 AND MY WEEKS WERE JAMMED WITH SO MANY THINGS, MEETINGS, SOCIAL GATHERINGS, TRIPS AND SO MUCH MORE, BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED. COVID-19 HAS TURNED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN. MEETINGS ARE OVER ZOOM NOW AND I TRY TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FRIENDS OVER THE PHONE, BUT IT IS SIMPLY NOT THE SAME. I AM INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO BE LIVING WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO WORKS FROM HOME, BUT I DON'T EVER LEAVE MY HOUSE AND LESS IT'S TO PURCHASE GROCERIES AND ESSENTIALS EVERY TWO WEEKS. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS, I , IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. NONE OF US WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES AT HOME IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER SCREEN. AND IF DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT LIE TO US AND HE HAD DECIDED TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY, THINGS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS. BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WRITTEN SENIORS OFF AS EXPENDABLE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? WE ARE NOT AND WE WON'T. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A DISASTER FOR SENIORS. WE DESERVE BETTER. WE DESERVE A LEADER WHO CARES ABOUT US. I KNOW JOE BIDEN WILL LOOK AFTER US. I KNOW JOE WILL PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY, AND I KNOW HE WILL ALWAYS , LOWER THE COURSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND KNOW HE HAS A REAL PLAN TO BE COVID-19 SO THAT OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, WE COULD SEE THEM AGAIN. OUR KIDS, OUR GRANDKIDS, AND GET LIFE BACK TO NORMAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. JOE BIDEN WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR SENIORS, AND THAT'S WHY I ENCOURAGE YOU AND ASK YOU TO PLEASE GET OUT TO VOTE EITHER BY MAIL OR IN PERSON FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS THE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO HELLO. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEE IF YOU HAVE ONE. THANK YOU SO VERY, VERY MUCH. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CONGRESSWOMAN. SHE'S BEEN A TIRELESS , WHERE IS DEBBIE? THERE SHE IS. THANK YOU DEBBIE. YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND A LONG TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT. TOBY, I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. TOBY MOVED FROM A HIGH RENT DISTRICT AND BROOKLYN COMES AT THE HIGHEST WITH DISTRICT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THESE DAYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TO HEAR THE STORIES COME TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THESE TOUGH TIMES, DIFFICULT TIMES. TODAY, TODAY'S STORY IS CERTAINLY ONE IN SOUTH FLORIDA. WE ARE ALL LIVING SOME VERSION OF IT RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES BEING PUT ON HOLD. THE SAME STORY BEING MOVED BY PEOPLE LIKE CARL WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW WELL. CARL IS HERE TODAY I'M TOLD. I DON'T KNOW , [INAUDIBLE] HEY, CARL. HOW WERE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE HERE. LIGHT WAS SHINING LIGHT IN MY EYES LOOKING AT YOU, MAN. I APOLOGIZE. CARL IS 39 , NO, 93 WHEN HE ACTS LIKE HE'S 39 YEARS OLD. DOING SO MUCH IN THIS COMMITTEE, A FEW THANK YOU ALL DECIDED TO RENAME THIS COMMUNITY CENTER IN HIS HONOR. I'VE HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU, , AND LOOK FORWARD TO SAY HELLO TO YOU PRIVATELY. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING CARL BACK IN 2012. HE MAY MAY NOT REMEMBER IT BUT HIS STORIES WITH HIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT YOUR CARL IS A SIGN OF AN IMMIGRANT. CARL SERVED OUR NATION HONORABLY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THAT IS SWEETHEART AND NEEDY, THE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR 67 YEARS. TOGETHER THEY BUILT THE FAMILY, FOUR CHILDREN, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN AND MORE THAN 30 YEARS THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE, STAYING ENGAGED IN ALL THE LOCAL ISSUES. CATCHING SUNNY MATINEES AND PERFORMANCE AT THE ART CENTER AND THE CENTER, AND SOCIALIZING WITH NEIGHBORS AND TO JOIN NIGHTS IN THE TOWN AND A COUPLE TIMES, TO A THREE TIMES A WEEK GOING OUT. BUT THEIR STORY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IS A A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN STORY THESE DAYS. IT HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED THIS YEAR. CARL AND ANITA HAVE BEEN OUT I'M TOLD TO A IN SEVEN MONTHS AND THERE ARE NO MORE STANDING MATINEES OTHER THAN GETTING GROCERIES THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THEIR APARTMENT LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE DO. IT'S HARDER THAN EVER TO SPEND TIME WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE, OTHER THAN ON ZOOM OR ON A COMPUTER CONNECTION. WE HAVE ALL FELT THE SCENT OF INTERRUPTION IN OUR LIVES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T NORMAL, THAT THINGS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. WE LOOK AROUND AT OUR NEIGHBORS AND WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE HURTING. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY, WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE SEALED OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER DONE, AND WONDER AN AWFUL LOT IS WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT'S BEEN THE STORY, THE ENTIRE STORY OF MY GIVE DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE FACT THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. HE'S NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON YOU. HIS HANDLING OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ERRATIC JUST LIKE HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN. AND IT HAS PREVENTED FLORIDA SENIORS AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FROM GIVING THE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT JUST BEEN WILLING TO NOT DO THE WORK. I THINK IT'S THAT JAN THAT I'M NOT SURE HE CARES ABOUT DELIVERING ANY REAL HELP. I THINK IT'S BOTH. PEOPLE SAFENET WILLING TO DO THE WORK. I DON'T THINK HE CARES MUCH ABOUT IT. WHILE WE ARE LOSING PRECIOUS TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES HE'S BEEN STUCK IN A SAND TRAP ON ONE OF HIS GOLF COURSES. AND WHEN HE DOES DECIDE TO LIFT A A FINGER IT ISN'T TO HELP YOU. IT'S TO PROPOSE NEW TAX CUTS FOR MILLIONAIRES. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. 100 WEALTHIEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA ARE EXPECTED TO GET ANOTHER $30 $30 BILLION TAX CUT HE IS PROPOSING. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THAT TAX THAT WAS PASSED IN 2019, AFTER 2017 WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS. AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND RAISE RICES ARE MEDICINES THAT YOU RELY ON TO STAY HEALTHY. AND THEY ARE STILL DOING IT EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE BUT TRUMP DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT LOWERING THE HEALTHCARE COST BECAUSE HE IS BEHOLDEN TO HELP HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE DRUG COMPANIES. AFTER ALL, HE'S ASKING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, ASKING RIGHT NOW TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE SENIORS ABILITY, MOST OF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE, BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY IN THE ACT WE PASSED I WAS ABLE HELP PUT IN PLACE, WAS YOU HAVE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES, ANNUAL CHECKUPS AND MAMMOGRAMS FOR FREE UNDER MEDICARE. IF THEY GET STRUCK DOWN THAT GETS WIPED OUT AS WELL. THE RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR MANY SENIORS AND PUT MEDICARE TRUST FUND AT RISK. AND BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND, I SEE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT REMEMBER DEBBIE WILL REMEMBER, WHEN HE'S NOT A BAD GUY IN TERMS OF HIS PERSONALITY WHEN THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BECAME SPEAKER, , WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY PROPOSE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS CUT IN MEDICARE FROM THE START, RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. THIS PRESIDENT , DEBBIE POINTED OUT, HE WANTS TO TERMINATE THE TAX, IS DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOURCES TO BECOME TERMINATE IT. SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, NOT JOE BIDEN PORTABLE THINK TANK FOR A NEWSPAPER, THE ACTUARY, SOLSTICE COULD HE SAYS, THAT WOULD BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY IN JUST A FEW YEARS, PUTTING THOSE MONTHLY CHECKS FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF SENIORS WHO RELY ON, MANY OF THEM DO A THING TO RELY ON, AT RISK. ALL THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO DO IS PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES FUTURES. LAST WEEK HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUOTE WALKING AWAY FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE NEVER, INEVITABLY FULLY ENGAGE IN. HE NEVER FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEM. THEM. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. DEBBIE WORKING LIKE THE DOUBLE IN-HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACT. THEY PASSED TWO OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION EARLIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, PEOPLE BEING KICKED OUT OF THE HOMES. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO DEPEND ON LOCAL BUDGETS BUT LOCAL BUDGETS ARE BEING BROKEN AND HAVE TO BE BALANCED. I WILL JUST TAKE, MAKE NO HERE. WHEN WE INHERITED THE LARGEST RECESSION, THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE THE DEPRESSION, WHAT HAPPENED? PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. FIRST THING I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF WAS THAT PUT $147 BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS, NOT HAVE TO FIRE POLICE OFFICERS OR FIREFIGHTERS COME NOT FIRED FIRST RESPONDERS, NOT TOO CLOSE TO HEALTH CLINICS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR STRAIGHT TO THE BREAKING POINT TURKEY TURNED HIS BACK ON EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN, TOOK AWAY SUPPORT FROM PPE AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VENTILATION YOU TO REOPEN SCHOOL SAFETY WHICH WE COULD DO IF WE FUNDED IT. HE TURNS HIS BACK ON EVERY SINGLE WORKER WHOSE JOB HASN'T COME BACK. AND NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS A DEAL. ONE DAY HE'S TWEETING RELIEF PACKAGE IS TOO BIG, THE NEXT DAY SAYING IT'S TOO SMALL. IT'S ALL A GAME. HE THINKS HE IS STILL ON HIS GAME SHOW. NO, , REALLY, HE ASKED THAT WAY FOR REAL. THIS IS A FLUKE AGAIN HE IS PLAYING. HIS LATEST GIMMICK HE WANTS TO MAIL SENIORS AT $200 PRESCRIPTION DRUG CASH CARD WITH HIS NAME ON IT SO YOU GET IT BEFORE ELECTION WITH HIS NAME ON IT. BUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO RAID MEDICARE TRUST FUND TO PAY FOR THAT $200 WHICH SENIORS HAVE ALREADY SPENT BY PAYING MONEY INTO. HE THINKS HE CAN TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET WITH ONE HAND AND PUT IT BACK WITH HIS NAME STAMPED ON IT ON THE OTHER HAND. AND CALL IT A GIFT. IT'S DISHONEST. IT'S RECKLESS AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY. IN FACT, ALL IT DOES UNDERMINE THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND INCREASE OVERALL OUT-OF-POCKET COST FOR SENIORS. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO LOWER COME HE SAYS HE WANTS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES, OKAY? BUT HE HASN'T DONE A SINGLE THING TO DO IT. IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL, DEBBIE SUPPORTED, THE BRINK OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD GIVING MEDICARE THE POWER IN WASHINGTON THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE, TO NEGOTIATE TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND SAY IF AN ASPEN IS GOING TO COST HIM BEING CHARGED, I'M MAKING THIS UP, IF AN ASPEN WILL COST TWO CENTS AN ASPEN, THEY SAY WILL ONLY PAY YOU A PENNY, THEY ARE EITHER GOING TO DO OR NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO GET DEBBIE AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO DO THIS FOR YEARS. WE LOWER DRUG PRICES. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE SAID IF IT PASSES HE WILL VETO IT, THREATENED TO VETO IT. FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC AND DECISIVE , DIVISIVE LEADERSHIP HAS COST US FAR TOO MUCH. 215,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19, AND RISING. EXPERTS SAY WE WILL LOSE NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS UNLESS HE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED COURSES. I PRAYED PRAY FOR HIS RECOVERY WHEN HE GOT COVID. I HOPE THAT WE COULD COME OUT OF IT, BUT WHAT IS HE DONE? HE HAS JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON MISINFORMATION HE DID BEFORE MAKING IT WORSE. SO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET THAN HE DOES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF SENIORS ONE DAY BEFORE RECROSS THE THRESHOLD OF 200,000 THIS, YOU MAY RECALL THIS, THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDENT WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THAT THE VIRUS WAS, AND THE QUOTE, AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY QUOTE, JUST ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH HEART AND OTHER PROBLEMS. NOBODY, THINK ABOUT THAT. WHO WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID IT INFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY? HE IS TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S SENIORS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU, TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY. YOU WORKED HARD TO WHOLE LIFE CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY, BUILDING A FAMILY, BUILDING THE COUNTRY, SERVING AMERICA. YOU DESERVE SECURITY, DESERVE RESPECT AND PEACE OF MIND BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT. BY THE WAY, IF THIS WASN'T SO BIZARRE YOU WOULD THINK, IF I TRIED TO MAKE A MOVIE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN AMERICA YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLE, NON-JOE, YOU ARE EXPENDABLE. YOU ARE FORGETTABLE. YOU ARE VIRTUALLY NOBODY. THAT'S HOW HE SEES THIS. THAT'S HOW HE SEES YOU. IT'S NO SURPRISE, THIS IS THE SAME AND IT LOOKS IN THE MIRROR , PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, CAUSING LOSERS AND SUCKERS. I CARRIED THIS CARD WITH ME EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT'S MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE I HAVE BLACK BOX THAT SAYS DAILY TROOP UPDATE. THE NUMBER OF TROOPS WHO DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 6924. 6924. ROUGHLY 6900. 924 BECAUSE OF YOU ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS LEFT THE FAMILY BEHIND, DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED. EVERYONE. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 53,000 AS OF TODAY. 194. EVERYONE. WITH ONLY ONE SACRED OBLIGATION IN AMERICA, TO CARE FOR THOSE WE SENT TO WAR AND EQUIP THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? LOSERS. MY SON VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. BEFORE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN KOSOVO FOR EIGHT MONTHS. BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY FOREIGNER HAS A WAR MONUMENT AND A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THAT COUNTRY NAMED AFTER HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO HELP THEM SET UP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR A YEAR. MY SON WAS NOT A LOSER. AND ALL THOSE LEFT BEHIND COME HE PASSED AWAY BUT ALL THOSE HE LEFT BEHIND, THEY ARE HEROES, THEY ARE PATRIOTS. I IMAGINE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY SIX 4-STAR GENERAL AND A LOT OF OTHERS ENDORSE ME TO USE TO WORK FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE HIS HEART ISN'T. THAT'S HOW HE SEES US. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE HAS BROUGHT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CRISIS. THIS IS THE SAME MAN YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE WERE AVERAGING 1000 LIVES LOST PER DAY. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. SUCH CONCERN AND EMPATHY. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S WHY IT IS WHAT IT IS. THIS PRESIDENT AS DEBBIE REFERENCED, BACK IN JANUARY WHEN HE WAS BEING BRIEFED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE SAID I NEVER READ THE BRIEFING. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT. DIDN'T HAVE TIME. WELL, HIS EGO MOVED IN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE FAMOUS JOURNALIST TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. WHAT HAPPENED? BOB WOODWARD INTERVIEWED HIM. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNEW IT WAS A DANGEROUS AND HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DIDN'T DO A THING. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU. HE DIDN'T TELL ANY AMERICAN. WHY? HE TOLD WOODWARD ON TAPE, TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT THE MORE RECKLESSLY SEEMS TO GET. THANK GOD WILL HAVE THREE WEEKS LEFT TO GO TO DR. FAUCI, MOST RESPECTED DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY ON THIS DISEASE, REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN USING THE WHITE HOUSE AS A BACKDROP FOR POLITICAL EVENTS, HE SAID IT WAS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT. AND HOW IS TRUMP RESPONDING? HE'S RUNNING A NATIONAL AD QUOTING DR. FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT. WITHOUT YOU SAID WAY BACK IN MARCH, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ACROSS THE NATION, HE SAID, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE COME IN THE QUOTE MEANING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IT DOES I GOT A PIECE THE COMPANY TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DELIBERATELY LIED. THEY HAVE PUT DR. FAUCI IN THEIR AD, ASSERTING THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY MORE. BUT HOW CHEAP IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY , BUT DR. FAUCI IS MEANT OF INTEGRITY. AFTER THE AD CAME OUT HE SAID I I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO USE THAT QUOTE AND I WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER DR. FAUCI SAID THAT COME HE DIDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. TRUMP AD CAMPAIGN SAID THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE ADD, KNOWING, KNOWING IT WAS A LIE. CAN ANY OF YOU EVER REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE MONTHS OF LIFE, MISLEADING AND RESPONSIBLE ACTION A PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY INTO CHAIRS AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HEARTS ARE BROKEN? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, CAN'T JUST REACH OVER AND TOUCH? THEY CAN HEAR THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS VOICE ON THE PHONE. WELL, HE THROWS SUPER SPREADER PARTIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS HELD EACH OTHER WITHOUT CONCERN OF THE CONSEQUENCES. HOW MANY OF YOU BEEN UNABLE TO HUG YOUR GRANDKIDS IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS? I GOT SIX OF THEM. TWO HAVE BEEN BEEN MY DECEASED SONS BOYS, CHILDREN, , A BOY AND GIRL, LIVE NOT FAR FROM IT. BILLY RAY CONCEDED, I STAND ON THE BACK PORCH AND A STANDDOWN AND I BRIBE THEM WITH HAAGEN-DAZS BARS. BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY I CONTACT THEM. I CAN'T HUG THEM. I CAN'T EMBRACE THEM. AND I'M LUCKIER THAN MOST BECAUSE THE ARE NEARBY, THOSE TWO OF THE SIX. MY GRANDKIDS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, HOPE WILL GROW TO TREAT ONE OF THE AS KINDNESS, RESPECT AND EMPATHY. QUALITIES THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER EVER SHOWN. IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR AS CARELESS RESPONSE HAS CAUSED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE ONLY SENIOR THAT DONALD TRUMP CARES ABOUT, THE ONLY SENIOR IS SENIOR DONALD TRUMP. DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. AND BY THE WAY, MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING PARTICULARLY HIT BY THIS. WE REALIZE AS OF ABOUT A MONTH AGO, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS ONE IN 1000 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL OF AMERICA HAVE DIED. THE ESTIMATE IS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONE IN 500 AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND AMERICAN WILL DIE. ONE IN 500. IF HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND WE HIT 400,000, THAT IS MORE PEOPLE, SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DIED, 400,000 DEAD, THEN WORLD WAR II. IN LESS THAN A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T MOVE. THE ONLY ONE DOUBLE TROUBLE DO ANYTHING FOR HIS DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS. WE CAN FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY WE CAN BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER TO PASS REAL RELIEF AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA TO BUILD BACK BETTER. MY ECONOMIC PROPOSAL, AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK FOR DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK THAT SAYS THIS. AND IF THE ANALYSIS PUT OUT MY MOOD IS, A WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY ECONOMIC PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS BETWEEN NOW AND IN THE FIRST TERM. 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND CREATE A TRULY MORE DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. IT'S SOLID, IT'S REAL. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON A SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE, IT SECURITY. I'M GOING AS BIG CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TAX STRUCTURE. THAT MONEY WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE WHO CARRY WITH IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WITH ME NOW, I DON'T, A CARD THAT LISTS ALL OF WHAT IS IN THE TAX CODE. WE WENT AHEAD, PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN, BARACK AND I'M SUGGESTING WE REDUCED CORPORATE TAX FROM 35% TO 28. 28. I WAS A CONSENSUS. HE REDUCED IT TO 21 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE COST? $1.3 TRILLION. WE JUST TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28 AND IT WILL GENERATE $1.3 TRILLION MORE. .. CUT THE TAX AND 35 TO 21. THE SENATE RACING BACK TO 28%. $1.3 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE INSTEAD OF DOING BIG CORPORATIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS FOR BUYBACK IN THEIR OWN STOCK, MOVING OVERSEAS, WE SHOULD INVEST IN CANCER, DIABETES, ALL LEVERS AND PARKINSON'S I PROPOSE GIVING NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH $50 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, CANCER, DIABETES, OLD-TIMERS AND PARKINSON'S. IF WE DO NOT FIND AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S WITHIN THE NEXT 19 YEARS, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED THAT EXISTS IN THE U.S. NOW WILL BE OCCUPIED BY OLD-TIMERS PATIENTS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE THIS EXPRESSION, JOE, IF EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOTHING IS IMPORTANT. WHERE OUR PRIORITIES? OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA HAS AN EQUAL SHOT. IT'S ABOUT YOU, WHAT'S FAIR, ABOUT WHAT OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE WE CAN DEAL WITH CANCER IN THESE OTHER DISEASES BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NO INTEREST. HE WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE. PROPOSES MORE TAX CUTS. DONALD TRUMP, EASE THE BURDEN ON MAJOR COSTS IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDING A FINANCIAL BURDEN IN CAREGIVING FOR MANY FAMILIES WITHOUT CARING. RIGHT NOW, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, 800,000 AMERICANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME COMMUNITY CARE, SIGNED UP FOR, AN AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS WAITING. FOR SOME, FIVE YEARS, MY PLAN MAKES INVESTMENTS SO THE STATE CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST. THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ALLOW MEDICAID TO AGAIN USE IT NORMA'S PARTY AND NEGOTIATE PRICES AND BRING THE COST DOWN FOR EVERYONE. GIVING ALL AMERICANS ACCESS THEY ALSO HATE MY DOING, SO DO THE DRUG COMPANIES. THE EXPERTS TO SET PRICES, LIFE-SAVING DRUGS THAT COST AN ARM AND A LEG FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION, THE BOARD WAS SET UP AND SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU BEEN CHARGED BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE INVESTED, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF THE DRUG WITHOUT TAKING OTHER ACTION THAT HAS REQUIRED YOU TO IMPROVE THE DRUG. IT CAN ONLY BE RAISED WITH MEDICAL INFLATION. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY LAND/COST BY 60%. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD TO SELL THINGS JUST TO GET THE DRUGS HAVE GROWN UP EXPONENTIALLY? WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASED BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS TO PROTECT YOUR PENSION INCLUDING PENSIONS, SO MANY FLORIDIANS EARN AND DESERVE. FOLKS, I WILL END WITH THIS, I AM CONFIDENT AS BAD AS THINGS ARE, HOW CAN I GET BETTER? I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THIS AND MORE. WE JUST HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. A PROUD DEMOCRAT AND WILLING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, ALL AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, ALL THE YEARS WE SERVE AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD, WE CANNOT LET OURSELVES REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE TO VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM/FL. CAN STILL REQUEST YOUR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. DEADLINE IS OCTOBER 24. REQUEST YOUR BALLOT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, MAIL IT OR DROP IT IN A DROP BOX TODAY AND TIRED OF US ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN AS IF THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NOTHING WE'VE EVER DECIDED TO DO, IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED. WE'VE DONE TOGETHER. REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, YOU HAD TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT. THEY USED TO KIDNEY IN THE SENATE WHAT I WAS THE. ANSWERING THE UNASKED QUESTION, WHY WAS HE DOING? HE SAID BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO POSTPONE. REFUSED TO POSTPONE ONE MORE DAY WITHIN OUR CAPACITY AS AMERICANS AMERICANS, THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. NO LIMIT TO OUR FUTURE. WE GOT TO STAND UP, LIFT OUR HEADS UP THE ONLY THING THAT CAN AMERICA IS A AMERICA ITSELF. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. WHO WE ARE, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. SIGNS OVER FICTION. YET, TRUTH OVER LIVES. WE CAN DO THIS AND I PROMISE YOU YOU, MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. [APPLAUSE] THANKS.

CSPANJB16102020114	Joe Biden	2020-10-16	Joe Biden Remarks in Michigan on Health Care	"WE ARE JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY. CONTROL OF CONGRESS AND WHO OCCUPIES THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE DECIDED. STAY WITH US TO HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN MAKE THEIR CASE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WATCH DEBATES AND SOME OF THE HOTLY CONTESTED HOUSE AND SENATE RACES. COVERAGE EVERY DAY ON C-SPAN. OR LISTEN ON THE FREE APP. YOUR PLACE FOR AN UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. JOE BIDEN CAMPAIGNED IN MICHIGAN TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. PRESIDENT TRUMP WON MICHIGAN FOU R YEARS AGO. GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER LEADS OFF THE EVENT. GOVERNOR WHITMER BELIEVES IN SCIENCE, AND FACTS. WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN WE WOULD BE OTHERWISE. WE SHARE A PASSION FOR HEALTH CARE. TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. WE ARE THE HUNCH THAT COMES TO REPRESENTING MICHIGAN IN THE SENATE. BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS WE NEED LEADERSHIP. WE NEED NATIONAL LEADERSHIP TO LEAD US THROUGH THIS. JOE BIDEN HAS PROVED HE CAN DELIVER THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP. IT WAS JOE BIDEN WHO HELPED LEAD US THROUGH A REALITY. HE HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I REMEMBER THAT FIGHT. FOLKS WERE TRYING TO DEMONIZE IT AND ATTACKING IT. I REPRESENTED A REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. THIS REALLY MOVES US FORWARD IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY. I SAID I'M VOTING FOR THIS. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED. I STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBER PUSHING THE GREEN BUTTON WE WENT UP TO VOTE. HOW OFTEN CAN YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES? THAT IS WHAT WE MADE SURE TO DO. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BILL IS ON THE BALLOT. AFTER ALL THAT FIGHTING, ALL OF THAT STRUGGLING. IT IS ON THE BALLOT NOW. BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S RECKLESS LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH WILL BE TAKEN UP A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE SELECTION, IT COULD VERY WELL BE THROWN OUT. THIS NEW NOMINEE HAS MADE CLEAR WHAT HER POSITION IS. WE WILL GO BACK TO THE DATA , BATTLE DAYS. 1.7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE COULD LOSE THE PROTECTION THEY HAVE NOW. WHEN BEING A WOMAN WAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. 800000 AND ARE STATE NOW HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THEY WILL BE BACK TO ANNUAL ALL CAPS BEING ELIMINATED. AND LIFETIME CAPS ON LAMINATED. FOLKS WILL FIND THEMSELVES BEING FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ALONE IN TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MY OPPONENT IN THIS SENATE RACE IS ALSO OPPOSED. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER COME UP WITH A PLAN. THEY HAVE TIME TO DO IT. IF YOU ASK WHAT'S THE PLAN, THEY GIVE YOU A BLANK STARE AND THEY WILL HAVE SHALLOW TALKING POINTS AND NEVER ADDRESSED THE ISSUES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE ARE SERIOUS TIMES. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. WE HAVE PEOPLE LOSING HEALTH CARE. WE NEED SERIOUS LEADERSHIP. WE NEED STEADY LEADERSHIP. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND JOE BIDEN ALSO NEEDS FRIENDS. HE NEEDS A MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SO WE CAN MOVE THIS AGENDA. HE CANNOT DO IT ALONE. I WILL SAY IN CLOSING, THIS ISSUE IS NOT ACADEMIC. THIS IS NOT TALK. THIS IS REAL. THESE ARE REAL STORIES. I HAVE PEOPLE WITH VISIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COME INTO MY OFFICE IN TEARS, NOT KNOWING WHAT THE FUTURE WILL MEAN FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. PEOPLE'S LIVES LITERALLY HANG IN THE BALANCE. THAT IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND WHO WILL SHARE HER STORY ABOUT WHAT AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE MEANS TO HER AND HER FAMILY. PLEASE WELCOME ALEXIA. (music) I AM EVERYDAY PEOPLE YEAH, YEAH DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SHOOBY DOOBY DO YEAH (music) WOW. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, GOVERNOR WHITMER, SENATOR PETERS, CENTER SAMUEL , I AM GRATEFUL TO BE HER WITH YOU. I'M A STAY-AT-HOME MOM WITH THREE AMAZING CHILDREN. A 10 EUROS, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD, AND A FOUR-YEAR-OLD MY HUSBAND MICHAEL OPERATES OUR SMALL BUSINESS. WHEN WE ARE FULLY STAFFED, OUR STAFF MEMBERS DO NOT QUALIFY TO NEGOTIATE WITH HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. BECAUSE OF THAT, BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, MY FAMILY DID NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE UNTIL 2014. WE SADLY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. TO SAY THIS FOR A LOT OF STRESS ON HER FAMILY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. MY HUSBAND, LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS, HAS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT WAS ALWAYS WORSE WHEN HE COULD NOT SEE A DOCTOR OR TAKE HIS MEDICATION REGULARLY. I LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR MY KIDS WOULD LOSE THEIR DAD, I WOULD LOSE MY HUSBAND, AND WE WOULD LOSE OUR BUSINESS. WHEN I WAS PREGNANT IN 2010 AND 2012, I TRY TO GET COVERAGE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET COVERAGE AT RATES I COULD AFFORD. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ACA WE COULD TAKE A DEEP BREATH. AND YOU BEST BELIEVE AS SOON AS THE MARKETPLACE OPENED UP, WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES TO SIGN UP COVERAGE. A TREMENDOUS WEIGHT WAS LIFTED FROM OUR SHOULDERS. WE HAVE NOT HAD TO SWITCH PROVIDERS AND THE PRICING OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE CONSISTENT PRICES WE CAN AFFORD. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS IS BEEN A REALLY TOUGH YEAR. I KNOW WE CAN ALL FEEL THAT. OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY COVID-19. SINCE REOPENING, BUSINESS HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE AT BEST. MY BUSINESS WORKED SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. THIS GIVES US THE PEACE OF MIND THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THE CHALLENGE. WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRAINED TO DO I AM INFURIATED. THIS PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE HAS HAD FOUR YEARS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. THEY HAVE HAD FOR YEARS TO PROVE THEY WILL NOT KICK PEOPLE OFF THEIR COVERAGE. THEY HAVE HAD FOUR YEARS TO SHOW AS THEY WILL PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE MY HUSBAND, AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT TRY TO STOP THE ACA AT EVERY SINGLE TURN. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND GARY PETERS IN NOVEMBER. JOE BIDEN IS SOMEONE WE CAN TRUST. HE IS SOMEONE WITH INTEGRITY WHO DOES WHAT HE SAYS IS GOING TO DO. HE BELIEVES IN SCIENCE, AND I BELIEVE IN HIM. HE BELIEVES IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT'S TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR ALL OF US. HE WILL TRULY BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR HIM OR NOT. OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DOES NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY OR OUR SMALL BUSINESS EITHER. IF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS SERIOUSLY FROM THE BEGINNING. HE WOULD'VE HAD A PLAN. HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT ALL AMERICANS. HE WOULD NOT TRY TO GUT THE INSURANCE OF 20 MILLION AMERICANS. WE NEED TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS AND WE NEED TO REELECT GARY PETERS TO THE SENATE. THEY WILL FIGHT FOR US AND OUR HEALTH CARE, AND WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE , I AM SO PROUD TO SAY , OUR GREAT GOVERNOR, GRETCHEN WHITMER, AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. PEOPLE, KEEP ON LEARNING SOLDIERS, KEEP ON WARRING WORLD, KEEP ON TURNING (music) I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND I AM SO PLEASED THAT JOE BIDEN IS BACK IN MICHIGAN. WE KNOW THIS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIMES, AND THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS. ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING REASONS IS THE HEALTH CARE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IS ON THE BALLOT AND THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE. IS PERSONAL FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. IS PERSONAL FOR ME. 18 YEARS AGO I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE SANDWICH GENERATION, AND THAT SIMPLY MEANS I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY FOR WHOM I WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER. MY MOTHER AT THE END OF HER LIFE AND MY DAUGHTER AT THE BEGINNING OF HERS. WHILE MY MOM BATTLED BRAIN CANCER, I WAS ON THE PHONE FIGHTING HER INSURANCE COMPANY, WHO WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING COVERING HER CHEMOTHERAPY. THERE ARE SO MANY AMERICANS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR STORY THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS OR ARE GOING THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW. THE BRAIN CANCER THAT KILLED MY MOM WAS THE SAME KIND THAT TOOK VP BIDEN'S SON BEAU. THAT TIME OF MY LIFE WAS DEVASTATING AND IT CHANGED ME, AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO DELIVER HEALTH CARE FOR MICHIGANDERS, TO ENSURE WE EXPANDED MEDICAID, AND NOW 800,000 PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. IT TOOK WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET IT DONE. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. I WAS THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER. WE FOUND COMMON GROUND BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL DO THE SAME. I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN SHOWS UP AND HAS OUR BACK WHEN WE NEED HIM. HE WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE WORKED TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. HE WAS HERE DURING THE AUTO INDUSTRY RESCUE. MICHIGAN SUPPORTS JOE BIDEN BECAUSE JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS MICHIGAN. THE JOE BIDEN WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE IS THE JOE BIDEN WHO ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVES AND WORKS TO GET THINGS DONE AND WORKS WITH ANYONE HE NEEDS TO. HE'S A GOOD, DECENT AMERICAN WHO WILL PROTECT AND EXPAND HEALTH CARE. GOOD PAYING JOBS, JOBS YOU CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY ON. AND HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WHERE YOU COME FROM, YOU HAVE A FAIR SHOT. HE WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AVAILABLE FOR MORE AMERICANS. WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT FOCUSED ON FINDING COMMON GROUND. HE HAS BEEN RUNNING A SCORCHED EARTH AGENDA FOR YEARS. NOT ONLY DOES HE WANT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE, BUT HE'S IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE ACA. INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE HEAT DOWN, HE RATCHETED UP WITH INCENDIARY RHETORIC. INSTEAD OF BUILDING BRIDGES, HE FOCUSES ON BUILDING WALLS. HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN. IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION, OUR CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. WHILE JOE BIDEN WORKS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED 218,000 AMERICANS, NEARLY 7000 MICHIGANDERS, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WORKS TO TAKE THAT HEALTH CARE AWAY. THEY HAVE ENDANGERED THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE TRUMP VIRUS RESPONSE THREATENING OUR LIVES AND ECONOMY, BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES ON THEIR QUEST TO DENY COVERAGE TO PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. NEARLY EIGHT MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR COVERAGE, TOO. THE DIFFERENCE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. THAT'S WHY WE ARE OPTIMISTIC. WITH OUR HISTORIC LEADERSHIP, OUR PHENOMENAL CAPACITY FOR CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, INDUSTRY, AND EVASION, AND MANUFACTURING, AMERICA CAN HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE REFORMED WITH THE UNIFIED COVID RESPONSE THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES, MITIGATED THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT AND MADE US A GLOBAL LEADER, THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NEVER HAD A PLAN TO PROTECT AMERICANS. THEY SQUANDERED OUR MIGHT AND OUR CAPACITY BY MAKING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THE PRESIDENT TREATED COVID-19 LIKE THE CRISIS HE KNEW IT TO BE FROM THE BEGINNING. MORE THAN 60 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. 218,000 DEATHS. LINES AT FOOD PANTRIES. AMERICANS BANNED FROM TRAVELING TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE COVID NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP. IT'S STILL GETTING WORSE. THERE IS GOOD NEWS. THERE IS A CREDIBLY DECENT MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IS FIGHTING FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. TO THE MOMS WHO ARE AT HOME, WORKING, TRYING TO GET THEIR KIDS LOGGED ON TO ZOOM, EVEN THE LAUNDRY DONE, TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO SPENT A LIFETIME BEEN SOMETHING GREAT AND ARE HANGING ON BY THEIR FINGERNAILS, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO THE GRANDPARENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE, MUCH LESS HUG THEIR GRANDKIDS, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS TO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE, JOE BIDEN IS WORKING FOR YOU, TOO. WHICH CANDIDATE CAN GET COVID-19 UNDER CONTROL? WHICH MAN IS GOING TO GET US BACK TO WORK. WHO COULD BRING US TOGETHER AS A NATION. IN MOST YEARS, IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THERE ARE TWO DECENT CHOICES. THIS YEAR THERE IS ONE. JOE BIDEN. WE MUST ALL VOTE AS IF OUR LIVES AND OUR LIVELIHOODS AND HE SOUL OF OUR NATION DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. WITH THAT, I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT'S, JOE BIDEN. HELLO, MICHIGAN. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME, TELLING YOUR STORY. IT'S IMPORTANT. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF STORIES LIKE YOURS ALL OVER AMERICA. I TRAVELED THE COUNTRY, TOO MANY DON'T HAVE TO BE. FOLKS, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. THERE IS NOT A BETTER GOVERNOR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S A FACT. I'VE MET VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM. GARY, WE BADLY NEED YOU BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, PAL. WE BADLY NEED YOU BACK. [APPLAUSE] MY SISTER, DEBBIE STABENOW, GOD LOVE YOU. WE WORKED TOGETHER SO CLOSELY FOR SO LONG AND AS VICE PRESIDENT AS WELL. FOLKS, LOOK, WE NEED TO SEND AREA BACK FOR ANOTHER TERM STANDING UP FOR MICHIGAN, MICHIGAN FAMILIES, SMALL BUSINESSES. HE WAS OUR MAIN CONGRESSIONAL PARTNER IN 2010 WHEN WE PASSED CRITICAL LEGISLATION SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT GIVING ME THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GO OUT AND ROUND UP SUPPORT. MY GO TO GUY TO GET IT DONE, AND I MEAN IT SINCERELY, WAS GARY. HE WAS THE GO TO GUY. HE ALWAYS SHOWS UP AND HE ALWAYS SHOWS UP FOR MICHIGAN. LIKE ALL OF YOU, JILL AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT GOVERNOR AND HER FAMILY ARE SAFE. IT'S AN UNUSUAL YEAR. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT YOU ARE A LEADER. YOU STAND UP STRAIGHT AND TALL AND YOU DON'T THEN. IT'S NOT EASY TO LEAD AND MOMENTS OF CRISIS, BUT THAT THE DETERMINATION WHETHER YOU HAVE A REAL LEADER, WHEN YOU STEP UP TO THE CRISIS. AND YOU STEPPED UP. YOU'VE DONE IT AND YOU KEEP DOING IT. [APPLAUSE] AS I SAID A MOMENT AGO, YOU'RE DOING BETTER THAN PUT IN MUCH EVERYONE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU'VE SHOWN THIS WHOLE NATION HOW TOUGH AND THOUGHTFUL YOU ARE. TOUGH LIKE MICHIGAN. I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THIS STATE HAS TO BE SO PROUD OF YOU. I KNOW I AM AS I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU AND I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU FRIEND. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE FBI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO DISCOVERED THESE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND STOPPED IT. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THAT IS WHO THEY ARE, DOMESTIC TERRORISTS. [APPLAUSE] PLANNING TO BLOW UP A BRIDGE ON AMERICAN SOIL TO THREATEN THE LIVES OF POLICE OFFICERS, TO KIDNAP AN ELECTED LEADER, NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING IN VIRGINIA. IT IS THE SORT OF BEHAVIOR YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM ISIS. IT SHOULD SHOCK THE CONSCIOUS OF EVERY AMERICAN. THE FAILURE TO CONDEMN THESE FOLKS IS STUNNING FROM THE OUTSET. I REMEMBER, IT MATTERS, YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE , WORDS MATTER. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT PARTICULARLY MATTER. WHEN THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" THAT IS THE CALL THAT WAS HEARD. THAT WAS THE DOG WHISTLE, JUST LIKE WHEN HE SAID THERE WERE ""VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES"" IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, VEINS BULGING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC SLOGANS, CARRYING CONFEDERATE FLAGS AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED PROTESTING. THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER, EVER, EVER HEARD , ""THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES."" THOSE WORDS WERE HEARD JUST LIKE WHEN HE STOOD ON THE DEBATE STAGE WITH ME AND REFUSED TO DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE TOLD A RIGHT WING EXTREMIST GROUP TO STAND BACK AND STAND BY. STAND BACK AND STAND BY. AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. NOT ONLY SHOCKED US, BUT IT STUNNED THE WORLD. THOSE WORDS, WE HEARD. YOU KNOW THE REASON I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND I KNOW DEBBIE KNOWS THIS. I HADN'T PLANNED ON RUNNING EVER AGAIN AFTER MY SON DIED. BUT WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THOSE WOODS, I THOUGHT HOW IN GOD'S NAME, HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN I REMAIN SILENT? I SAID AT THE TIME, IT WAS SOMEWHAT NOT CRITICIZE BUT PEOPLE , I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I SAID WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. I THINK WE ARE. WHAT I SAW AT CHARLOTTESVILLE IN THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO IT IS WHY I WENT TO GETTYSBURG BATTLEFIELD IN PENNSYLVANIA LAST WEEK. IT IS NEEDED TO STAND UP TO HATE IN AMERICA AND HER JUST AS LINCOLN DID TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. I HAVE LEARNED HATE NEVER GOES AWAY, IT ONLY HIDES. IT NEVER GOES AWAY. IF YOU GIVE IT OXYGEN, IT COMES OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS AND GROWS. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR, FROM THE PRESIDENT ON DOWN, IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HATE IN AMERICA. NONE. IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP REVELS IN DIVISION AND CHAOS. HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO DISTRACT US FROM FOCUSING ON HIS FAILURES TO DEAL WITH THIS VIRUS AND PROTECT THE NATION. HE STILL LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD. HE KEEPS TELLING US THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR LIKE A MIRACLE. HE SAID, I THINK LAST NIGHT IN HIS TOWN HALL , I DID NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HEARING IT. I WAS DOING ONE MYSELF. HE SAID ""WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER."" AS MY GRANDFATHER MIGHT SAY IF HE WERE HERE, HE'S GONE AROUND THE BEND. TURN THE CORNER? MY LORD. IT'S NOT DISAPPEARING, IN FACT, IT IS ON THE RISE AGAIN. IT'S GETTING WORSE, AS PREDICTED. WE ALL KNOW THE TERRIBLE PRICE THIS NATION HAS PAID. LIVES LOST, UNEMPLOYMENT WAY UP, ACROSS MICHIGAN AND THE COUNTRY, FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENT. WHETHER HEALTH CARE WILL BE RIPPED AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YOU WORKED SO DAM HARD, GARY, TO KEEP , WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUDGET. KIDS AT SCHOOL, ARE THEY ABLE TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL? MORE THAN 215,000 AMERICANS, I THINK IT'S 217 AS OF THIS MORNING, AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19. EXPERTS HAVE SAID AND HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF THAT NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES ARE LIKELY TO BE LOST IN THE COMING MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THE FIRST OF THE YEAR IF WE CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO FOLLOW SCIENCE. HE REFUSED TO EMBRACE WEARING A MASK , HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN HIM MAKE FUN OF BIDEN WEARING A MASK? BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. HE PUTS HIS SUPPORTERS IN SUCH JEOPARDY. IT'S ESTIMATED BY HIS OWN FOLKS IF WE JUST WORE A MASK NATIONALLY, ALMOST 100,000 LIVES WOULD BE SAVED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. HIS OWN DIRECTOR OF THE CDC SAID WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, EVEN IF WE HAD A VACCINE, THIS WOULD PREVENT OR DEATHS. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF JANUARY, THEN THE VACCINE WOULD. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY SAD ABOUT ALL OF THIS? I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, BUT EVERY TIME I REPEAT IT, I GET MORE , WELL , I'M NOT VERY HAPPY. THE PRESIDENT KNEW AND LIED ABOUT KNOWING. HE KNEW IN JANUARY. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND WHAT THEY CALL THE PDB , THE PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFINGS, WHICH I SAT IN ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM AS VICE PRESIDENT. THEY LAID OUT IN DETAIL TO HIM HOW DEVASTATING THIS COULD BE. HOW MUCH LIFE COULD BE LOST AND SO ON. HE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE. DIDN'T READ THOSE REPORTS. THAT SURPRISED NO ONE THAT HE DIDN'T READ THE REPORTS. EVERYBODY SAID MAYBE HE DID, BUT THEN, AS IS ACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE OF HIS EGO, HE WANTED TO IMPRESS A FAVORITE JOURNALIST. HE DID A LONG INTERVIEW WITH BOB WOODWARD. BOB WOODWARD, RENOWNED JOURNALIST, TAPED THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM, EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS, HOURS. HE TAPED AN INTERVIEW WERE TRUMP SAID HE KNEW THIS DISEASE WAS DEADLY, SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THE FLU. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD YOU. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD THE PUBLIC. AND THE REASON HE LIED AGAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. DONALD TRUMP PANICKED. THAT'S WHO PANICKED. [APPLAUSE] THE CONSEQUENCE WAS OVERWHELMING NEGLIGENCE , HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE THIS MORNING WHERE THE DINING ROOM TABLE LAST NIGHT? HOW MANY? HOW MANY WOMEN OR MEN THAT WHEN THEY GOT IN BED LAST NIGHT REACHED OVER TO TOUCH THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE AND THEY WEREN'T THERE? YOU ALL KNOW WHAT LOSS IS. IT'S PROFOUND. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS AVOIDABLE. THE MISHANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC ISN'T ENOUGH FOR TRUMP. ON TOP OF THAT, HE STILL TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE. TRUMP IS STILL DETERMINED IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC , BY THE WAY, IF PROJECTIONS, PRAY GOD THEY ARE NOT RIGHT, IF THEY ARE RIGHT, IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, THERE WILL BE OVER 200,000 ADDITIONAL DEATHS. THAT WILL BE ONE YEAR, 400,000 AMERICANS WILL HAVE DIED. THAT'S MORE THAN LOST IN ALL OF WORLD WAR II. DO YOU HEAR ME? WORLD WAR II WAS FOUR YEARS. MORE AMERICAN SOULS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST THEN IN WORLD WAR II. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE STILL DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE. JUST LIKE YOUR OPPONENT CALLS IT A DISASTER, TALK ABOUT A DISASTER , THERE IS A DISASTER. THE GUY'S 2000%, 200% WITH TRUMP , I HOPE EVERYBODY REMEMBERS. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE. IT'S AS REAL AS IT GETS. ON NOVEMBER 10, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKE THE CASE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN IN ITS ENTIRETY. I KNOW EVERYBODY THINKS THEY KNOW, BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU, 10 MILLION OF YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE YOUR EMPLOYERS HEALTH INSURANCE HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. 10 MILLION AMERICANS ALREADY WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. IF TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, 20 MILLION MORE AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE. IT IS GOD-AWFUL, IN THE MIDST OF THIS GOD-AWFUL ECONOMIC CRISIS, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 4 MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN. LIMITS ON BENEFITS WILL BE BACK. AND BY THE WAY, A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND WORSE. I CAN DISTINCTLY REMEMBER SITTING ON THE BED WITH MY SON WHO CAME BACK FROM A YEAR SERVING IN IRAQ, WHICH THIS PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT LOSERS , LOSERS , WITH THE SAME SIGNIFICANT DISEASE THAT YOUR MOM HAD, STAGE FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA. WHEN IT WAS DIAGNOSED AND HE GOT HOME, WE ASKED THE DOCS, IT WAS A MATTER OF MONTHS, NOT IF. WE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE. I REMEMBER WATCHING HIM ON THAT BED. HE MADE IT ALMOST 16 MONTHS. TOWARD THE END, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME, THIS IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU. I CONSCIOUSLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD IT FEEL LIKE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK IN AND SAY MR. BIDEN, YOU HAVE OUTRUN YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE? LOTS OF LUCK. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. INSURERS, IF THEY WIN, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COURT PACKING IS ABOUT. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP YOUR KIDS ON YOUR POLICY UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. WOMEN WILL BE CHARGED MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A WOMAN. OLDER FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED MORE. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID WILL BECOME PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS JOINING ASTHMA, DIABETES, EVEN PREGNANCY. IT WILL ALLOW INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY COVERAGE ALTOGETHER. GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE IS WHY THEY ARE RACING TO GET THIS NOMINEE THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. TRUMP HAS MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS YOUR OPPONENT HAS, HE WANTS TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE IN ITS ENTIRETY. WITH THIS NOMINEE, HE'S MADE THAT INCREDIBLY CLEAR AS WELL. MICHIGAN DESERVES SO MUCH BETTER. IT DESERVES LEADERS LIKE GARY AND DEBBIE STABENOW, PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO LEAD WITH DECENCY AND HONOR, WHO ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEEDS. THINK ABOUT HOW TO EASE THE BURDEN ON YOUR FAMILY. THAT'S THE SORT OF LEADER YOU'VE GOT IN GRETCHEN, AND GOVERNOR WITMER AS WELL. IN THE STATE SENATE, SHE LED THE CHARGE TO EXPAND THE OBAMACARE MEDICAID EXPANSION. SOME OF THE STATES REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS DID NOT EXPAND EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR THE FRONT-END. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO COVERAGE. AFTER WE PASSED OBAMACARE WITH THE HELP OF DEBBIE AND GARY, DEBBIE STABENOW AND GARY PETERS, WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE UNINSURED RATE BY 55% IN MICHIGAN. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BECOMING HER PRESIDENT, WE WILL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO KEEP A PRIVATE PLAN IF YOU STILL HAVE ONE. SOME OF THE PLANS NEGOTIATED ARE GOOD PLANS. WE WILL ALSO OFFER A MEDICARE-LIKE PUBLIC OPTION WHICH WILL FORCE PRIVATE INSURERS TO KEEP PREMIUMS LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AGAINST A PUBLIC INSURER THAT DOES NOT HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE IN MIND. IF YOU CHOOSE THIS PUBLIC OPTION OR PRIVATE PLAN, IT WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES FOR YOUR PREMIUMS SO THEY ARE LOWER. YOU CAN AFFORD OUR PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY PLAN WILL/THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BY 60%. NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK. SERIOUS FOLKS LOOKING AT THIS. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. MY PLAN LOWERS HEALTH CARE COSTS AND GETS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE QUICKLY AT A TIME WHEN MICHIGAN FAMILIES DESPERATELY NEED THAT RELIEF. THEY NEED IT NOW. FAMILIES ARE REELING RIGHT NOW. THEY NEED A LIFELINE NOW. AND I PROMISE YOU WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH COVERAGE THE SAME WAY I WOULD MY OWN FAMILY. I GREW UP, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE, IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA AND WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, A HOME WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRAND POP WITH US. WHEN MY DAD MOVED FROM SCRANTON WITH NO WORK AND MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE AND STAYED WITH MY GRANDPA FOR A YEAR AND CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. HE FINALLY GOT A JOB, IT ENDED UP BEING SECTION EIGHT HOUSING BUT IT WAS DECENT AND WE WERE HAPPY. IT TOOK MY DAD THREE YEARS TO GET A JOB GOOD ENOUGH THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY BUY A HOME. BOUGHT THAT SMALL HOME. THERE WERE 70 HOMES LIKE IT, THREE AND FOUR BEDROOM HOMES. BUT THE WALLS WERE THIN AND I LOOK BACK AND I WONDER HOW MY MOM AND DAD DID IT. I REMEMBER YOU COULD HEAR HIM RESTLESSLY ROLLING IN THE BEDROOM NEXT TO ME AND I ASKED MY MOM THE NEXT MORNING, WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD? SHE SAID HONEY, IT'S COMPLICATED. I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOM? I WAS LIKE 14 YEARS OLD. SHE SAID THE COMPANY JUST LOST HIS HEALTH INSURANCE. WE ARE GOING TO BE OK. ALL THE PEOPLE ROLLING AROUND IN BED TONIGHT, TOMORROW NIGHT, LAST NIGHT, TRUMP DOESN'T SEE THINGS THIS WAY. BECAUSE HE ONLY SEES THINGS, SEES THE WORLD FROM A PARK AVENUE PERSPECTIVE. I'M NOT BEING A WISE GUY, I'M BEING LITERAL. HE CAN ONLY SEE FROM HIS PENTHOUSE, WALL STREET. I SEE THE WORLD FROM WHERE I GREW UP. MY MOM TAUGHT ME, MY MOM HAD A BACKBONE LIKE A RAMROD. MY MOM TAUGHT ME AND SAID LOOK AT ME, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, JOEY. BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. I THINK YOU AND I, WE MEASURE PEOPLE, WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, WE MEASURE PEOPLE ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR HONESTY, DECENCY, RECOGNIZING SOME THINGS ARE BIGGER THAN JUST YOUR SELF INTEREST. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT , RESPECT, DECENCY, HONOR, OPPORTUNITY. OUR FAMILY AND YOURS WERE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING, JUST AN EVEN SHOT. GIVE IT A SHOT AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. THAT'S WHAT MICHIGAN NEEDS NOW COME A SHOT TO COME BACK STRONG. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED 10 YEARS AGO IN YOUR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, THE HEART AND SOUL OF MICHIGAN WAS ON THE BRINK. MY STATE USED TO BE AN AUTO STATE, A SMALL POPULATION, WE HAD THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF AUTOWORKERS THAN ANY STATE IN THE NATION BECAUSE WE HAD LESS THAN A MILLION PEOPLE. THE LARGEST GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER PLANTS OUTSIDE OF MICHIGAN. BUT YOU REMEMBER LIKE I DO, YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE YESTERDAY. WHEN BARACK AND I DECIDED WE HAD TO BET ON MICHIGAN, REMEMBER THE LOW BACK, EVEN FROM DEMOCRATS? WE CAN'T COMPETE. WE BET ON AUTOWORKERS. WE BET ON THE UAW, AND THEY CAME THROUGH AND PAID OFF. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. THE INDUSTRY WASN'T IN TROUBLE, IT WASN'T IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THE AUTOWORKERS, BUT BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER, SAVING OVER ONE MILLION JOBS BY THAT ONE DEAL. [APPLAUSE] DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN WORKER. BY CONTRAST, ON DONALD TRUMP'S WATCH, WE ARE IN A NATIONWIDE MANUFACTURING RECESSION BEFORE COVID STRUCK. WE ARE NOW DOWN NEARLY 650,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOW. NOW IT IS RISING. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE, GOD WILLING, TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN HE HAD WHEN HE STARTED IN OFFICE. THE LAST ONE WAS HERBERT HOOVER. FOR REAL. FOLKS, WE CAN BRING THIS ECONOMY BACK. I'M POSITIVE OF IT. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT. WE KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING IT. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS ON WALL STREET, MOODY'S, A WELL-RESPECTED FIRM HAS DONE AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF EVERY ASPECT OF MY PLAN AS WELL AS HIS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONCLUSION WAS? THIS IS MOODY'S, NOW. MY PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE THAN HIS WOULD, AND $1 TRILLION MORE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. BY INVESTING IN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, YOU SEE THESE ADS IN MICHIGAN , BIDEN IS GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. ONCE AGAIN, FLAT, UNADULTERATED LIE. NO ONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR WILL PAY A PENNY MORE. IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN THAT, YOU ARE GOING TO START PAYING THE RATE YOU PAID UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W. BUSH. I'M GOING TO ASK BIG CORPORATIONS IN THE VERY WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR A CHANGE. TRUMP'S MORE THAN $2 TRILLION TAX CUT, I'M GOING TO ROLL BACK $1.5 TRILLION OF THAT, GIVEAWAYS TO THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE TOP 1%. THE MONEY WE RAISE, WE WILL INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE, GROWING THE MIDDLE CLASS, THIS TIME MAKE SURE WE BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, BLACK, WHITE, HISPANIC, DISABLED , EVERYONE COMES ALONG. OUTSIDE ECONOMISTS SAY MY PLAN WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS IN MANUFACTURING. WE WILL INVEST IN BUILDING MORE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT SAID I HAD AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IN 2017, THEN 2018, THEN 2019, THEN 2020. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PLAN. I'M GOING TO BUILD A RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS, BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND PORTS. ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. ONE MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HIGH-SPEED BROAD BAND FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD. $100 BILLION TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING SCHOOLS. ONE REASON WE CAN'T SEND OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN SAFE NOW. WE ARE GOING TO RETROFIT AS WE STARTED IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WHEN THE PRESIDENT ALLOWED ME TO RUN THE RECOVERY ACT. WE ARE GOING TO RETROFIT 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZE 2 MILLION HOMES. THAT ALONE WILL SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. IT IS ALL GOING TO BE DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR. [APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO END , HE TALKS ABOUT HIS TRADE DEALS. AS GARY AND DEBBIE KNOW, HE INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO SEND JOBS ABROAD. ABROAD. MORE ARE TAKING THEIR JOBS OVERSEAS. ONE THING MORE , THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES AND I PROMISE YOU THE PRESIDENT CONTROLS IT. I'M GOING TO CONVERT THOSE GOVERNMENT FLEETS INTO CLEAN VEHICLES MADE AND SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'M GOING TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN CLEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SWITCH TO FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NETWORK OF 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OFFER CONSUMER REBATES TO SWAP FUEL INEFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR AMERICAN-MADE MODELS AND TOGETHER, THIS WILL MEAN ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES, MORE THAN A MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE WILL OWN THE ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE MARKET IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] I GUARANTEE YOU WE CAN DO THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. I REMEMBER YOU AND I TALKING, GOV, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT I WAS RIGHT. THAT USED TO BE THE OLD DAYS. YOU GOT A LOT DONE. YOU USED TO HAVE TO WALK ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET EVERYTHING DONE BUT EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. WELL, FOLKS, IF WE CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY, WE ARE IN TROUBLE. AMERICA AND OUR SYSTEM RUNS ON CONSENSUS. COMPROMISE IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I'M GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I DO NOT SEE AMERICA IN TERMS OF RED AND BLUE. BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, THAT'S THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. IT'S A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYBODY. WE CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE SEE. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, WHEN WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE TO VOTE. AND PEOPLE ARE TURNING OUT IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT, GO VISIT I WILL VOTE.COM/M-I. EARLY VOTING IS HAPPENING NOW. IN EVERY CITY, TOWNSHIP AND CLERKS OFFICE ACROSS THE STATE. YOU CAN REGISTER AND VOTE IN ONE QUICK STOP. YOU HAVE YOUR BALLOT ALREADY, MAIL IT OR DROP IT IN A DROPBOX TODAY. DON'T WAIT. VOTE. DON'T JUST VOTE FOR ME AND SENATOR HARRIS AND GARY, VOTE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE. WE ARE GOING TO NEED GARY BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE LOOKING OUT FOR MICHIGAN FAMILIES BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY MEAN THIS, IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS TIME, LET'S BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. DEBBIE MAY REMEMBER MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CAUCUS USED TO KID ME BECAUSE I WOULD QUOTE PRESIDENT KENNEDY ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON AND HIS FAMOUS SPEECH. EVERYBODY REMEMBERS DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT. THE ONE I REMEMBER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION OF , THAT WASN'T IMPLICITLY BEING ASKED , WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? HE SAID WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE AMERICAN WORK AMERICA MUST DO NOW TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. THERE'S NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN DO THIS. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, UNITY OVER DIVISION, SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND YES, TRUTH OVERLIES. [APPLAUSE] SO, FOLKS, THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

And I just w ant to say thank y ou. Detroit Youth Choir. Wh at an amazin g per formance. Well, folks, I've got some really great news b ecause guess who's r ight behind m e. Vi ce Presi de nt Joe B iden is here. He is ready to come o ut, and I can't wa it to see him. And we are so happy that h e's right back here in Mi chigan and right here in Detroit. We know t hat Joe cares about this state and we know beca use he ha s been here before a nd he's been here when we nee d him. And with whe n he has been h ere, we h ave had the op portun ity t o actually see fir sthand what leader ship really means and what leadership can dio I'm talking about. Back in 2000 1008 when we were in the mids t of, ah, financ ial crisis that was br ought about by the greed that we saw on Wall Str eet that brought ou r economy to the edge. And when that happe ned, it also bro ught our auto indust ry to the edge the livelihood f or so many of us in this state. Y ou know, I remember I was newly elected to the Ho use of Repre sentatives in Congress. I represented a district which included the Chrysler headq uarters up in Auburn Hi lls, and I will never fo rget this meetin g. This is in my min d forever. As I win and met with the CEO, the c ompany and some of the ex ecutiv es as times were gett ing really rough. And I remembe r meeting and h e was saying, Co ngressman, he go es, I want you to b e cleared and whe re we are here in Chrysler, we know the financial m arkets of weekend and collapse. You ca n't ge t credit, our sales air do wn, we're jus t teetering. An d he goes, I wil l tell you ri ght now tha t we're prob ably around thre e w eeks away f rom actually liquidating this co mpany, not reorganizing i t, liquidating this company. And I looked around the meeting and th e folks that we re there a lot of the pe ople I don't think they had ever heard the CEO say that the comp any was gonna be liquidated in three weeks or fo ur weeks. And I had this v ision, this horri ble vision that went in to my head and you k now that Chrysl er headquarters, that big bui lding in that huge parking lot I had this vision of gra ss growing in the pa rking lot because there weren't cars there. I had vision s of fam ilies w ho sudden ly saw their liv elihoo d disappear. And all the other busin esses that rely on the au to industry in t his state and i n this countr y. It was a bleak time. Well, I ju st wa nt to say we have to remember and we sho uld all think Pr esident O bama and Joe Biden f or standing w ith Americ a companies. The re are people th at said Let him go bankrupt. Let h im go away. Joe Bid en said No, I will stand with American workers. I will always stand wit h them to make sure that t hey have the op portunity to be successful and t o be able to l ive that American dream. That, ladi es and gentlemen, is Joe B iden. H e has stood with us in t he past. He w ill stand with us in the future, an d that's why we will el ect him the next president of the United Stat es. Yeah, t hat is leadershi p. And rig ht now we are see ing the oppos ite from the Whi te House. We are s eeing a presiden t, President Trump, who does not know how to lea d. And we need a president t hat leads, not twee ts. But that's wh at we have. The mi smanagement that we've seen in this White House is pa infully ap parent to all of us i n the pande mic, the mism anagemen t as to where we are. We continue t o deal with this pandemic. Yo u look at other count ries and how they dealt with it. They're f ar alo ng. But we had a presid ent that fa iled to take action quickly, failed to acknowledge us, told us it would disappear. Do not engage in the administ ration in dealing w ith getting ahead o f this virus. He has faile d miserably. T hat's why we need to elect. Joe B iden is our ne xt presid ent because we've go t to deal with this pandemic. Bu t Joe Biden can 't do it al one, as wonderful is. He is. He nee ds help in Wa shington, which is w hy he needs toe ha ve a Democrati c majority in th e United Stat es Senate. We cannot le t Mitch McConnell. Do what he did to Pres ident Obama and block every initiative. We 've got t o make sure that we elect Democ rats all across this country, and I got good news for every body. We'v e got a real shot. We have grea t candidates. We've got states that we c an pic k up. But we have a c hal lenge for a ll of us here in M ichigan. Th at gets very difficul ty. If we don't wi n this Senate se at here in Michiga n, we must m ake sure t his state stays blu e and I ge t reelected and go ba ck. As a De mocrat from the state of M ichigan, in the Uni ted States, Senate and and voters, voters have a real choice. I'm proud to stand wi th Joe Biden. My o ppo nent, John James, says he supports Donald Trump 2000%. He is w rong in supporting Donald Trump, and t he peo ple of Michigan will reject his support of Donald Trump on Election Day. But we've g ot a lot of wor k to do. They are pourin g money in to this ra ce. I'm sure you see the neg ative false ads that are piloting on the television fa ct checkers a ll say they're f alse, they're demon strably fal se, their smears an d they're part of the kind of campaigns we see fr om Donald Trump and the Republicans. When it's about division and falsehoods, that's not who we are as Dem ocrats as Dem ocrats. We have a visio n for the future where all America ns will be able to share in the bounty of this great count ry. But w e have to get out an d vote. We've got to fight the billion aires who are pouring money int o this race, and t here's a lot we have to dio . I know. I urge all of you get pa rt of th e one campaign, get o ut there, help us give y our time , whatever you can to make t he calls. W e've go t great organizer' s back there from the one campaig n work with them in order to get out the v ote. We have 18 days. I ju st want t o leave you with t his with this kind of tak e away. As you drive o ut here tonight, I want everybody to just t hink back to 2016. J ust think back, take a mo ment, close your eyes and just think ab out that morning aft er the e lection and ho w we felt when we saw that H illary wasn't able to prevail on Donald Trump. One. Rem ember that feel ing in y our gut an d how we f elt and every one of us. I think I said it. Everybod y like could I have just done a little bit? Mawr? Could I have put two more hours and call ti me? Cou ld I have knocked down a few mawr doors? The ele ction was over, but I got gre at news for you. When yo u wake, I want you to wake up tom orrow and have tha t feeling and say , Oh my gosh, there's sti ll 2.5 weeks I ca n doom or I can work to day I can sign up for the on e campaign. I can make call s I could talk to my friends. I'm n ot going to squander one sin gle day bec ause that one day may make the diff erence between taking back this count ry and not doing it. We will wo rk that day, an d when we get done wor king and I can assure you, the whole countr y is watching Mich igan right now we are the cente r of the p residential rac e. We are the center o f this U S Senate rac e. People are g onna be watching to see what we do, and I will say that next morning. Think now, the morning after this election, when we get up and people all across the country will get up and we will join them when they jump out of their seats and they scream and holler because they'll say, Thank God. Michigan is a blue state. We've elected Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. We have a majority in the U. S. Senate in Congress. Democrats have prevailed. Thank you. Yes . Ye ah. Thio should. There's a new me coming o ut and ju st ha ve C ome on n ow get E completely positive, I think this time arou nd, ladies and gentlemen, please help me. Welcome Ellio tt W hitfield.

What a n honor to be h ere with all of you at with the Vice President Biden as such an im portant time i n our country history. My name is Everett CJ Witch B ill. I'm a teach er. I've been in teaching for t he past 22 yea rs. I am curre ntly fourth or f ifth grade teach er at dark. O kay, eight Elementary middle school unde r the guida nce. The leadership press pri nciple.

Why Gar den Terrace, Martin and David, who travel a cross the country to visit o ur wonderful city Detroit, Mi chigan, L et me t ell you, okay, le t me tell you, let us have thing about me. I grew up on the east side of Detroit . I'm the youngest of fo ur Children have o verc ome many ch allenges, including stu tter like Vice President Joe Biden growi ng up g rowing up on Dav idson Stre et by Mc Nichols in th e streetcar, Mitchell co uld be called listeni ng to my gra ndmother, Miss Miss Willie Mae Davis, who share he r wisdom with all of her family. W hat quote? Finall y remember WAAS Good b etter Best n ever let her rest until you're good. It' s better. You're bet ter is best. I still t hink about that phrase a lot. When I look aroun d in our country and you kn ow what, we are not at o ur best as attention, he t ried public scho ol district. We tea ch our Children the characters to tra de, to resp ect each other, to show emp athy, to have com passion to one another and finally to recogniz e each other rights. The cu rrent pr esident, United States doesn't practice this at all. He does not have the d ecency to wear a mask. That's Charles n ot gonna r espect. He doe s not ha ve the decency to pract ice right, the s ocial distan ce that shows l ack of empathy and compassi on. And he ignored scie nce, which viola tes ot her people's health. He is not a le ader that wh ich Childre n could look u p to. The good n ews is we have a chance to make that change by letting Jo e Biden a s our pr esident. Your body is a leader we can trust , count on and be p roud of. He has showed compassion and two others in variou s ways, regardless of the party lines. He shows that he care s. I appreciate his hist ory of work in g with people of color. He was Presi dent Obama's vice presi dent and he picked Kam ala Harris to be Hiss. That's why I voted for him today. That's righ t. Befor e I came here, I filled out my absente e ballot for J oe Biden and calmly hairs. I si gned the back , put in an env elope an d dropping the D rop box. It was th e easiest thin g to do. Look , my fellow teachers, my parents, Gu ardian grandpa rent's Detroiters pe ople liv e in Oa kland, weighi ng an d also to Mac omb County. We have to vote. There's too muc h at stake.

I've always be lieved in Michigan we have the finest auto workers in t he worl d here in Michigan. That' s not hyperbol e. That's a fact e I wanna thank you, Chairwoman Barn es. Thank you very, very much. And L ieutenant Governor Gilchrist, you've b een a good friend, Gov ernor Wit tner, you've been an incredible leade r. Tested. She had been tes ted and proven under crisi s cond itions and extr aordinary circumstanc es. Your l eadership through thi s pandemic has saved countless l ives of Michi ganders here. G ov That's a fact. A nd yo u've shown the who le nation just ho w toug h you are. Michig an Tough. I'm proud to call your friend and Senator Debbie Staben ow. Gary Peters. Tha nk you fo r fighting for the people o f Michigan w ho need help now but aren't get ting i t bec ause the Republica n leader , Mitch McCon nell, cares more a bout shoving thro ugh a Supreme Court nomination to ta ke away your hea lthcare th an he does helping the hur ting peopl e in this city, t his state in this country we ca n't forge t. The winning in N ovember does n't just m ean defeating Donal d Trump. It means wi nning back to United St ates Senate and exp anding our majority in the House of Repre sentatives. That's why we need to send Gary b ack to Washingto n. D . C. Yeah, I rea lly mean that we nee d him. T hat's the g uy who knows what he believes and says what he believes and does wh at he believe s and alongside De bbie Stabenow. For the people of Michigan, but not quite frankly, for the whole country, folks, i s my co aches to say it's go time. It's the most important election o f ou r lifetime s, and you co uld mak e all the d ifference here in Mich igan, the c hoice is as cle ar as ever, and the sta kes are hi gher tha n ever. The stak es are in this election. Remind me of something my d ad used to say, said Joey. A j ob's abo ut a lot more than a pa ycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your commun ities. Be able to look your child in the eye and say, Honey is gonna be okay and made it well , that's a lesson N ever I've never for got ten. That's wha t I grew up su rrounded by hard working families in Sc ran ton, Pennsylv ania. Claymont, De lawa re. How many p eople today, though, can look their kids in t he eye and s ay everything's gonna be alright and mea n it? Thes e times ar e hard. Une mpl oyment is way up due t o the pand emic. Jus t this week, over a mil lion 200,000 more people file for unemployment. The economic outlo ok for next year remai ns uncertain, and across Michigan a nd th e country. Folks are worried about maki ng their nex t rent payme nt or the mortgage payment or the car pay ment. They're wor ried whether or not the y can purchas e the prescripti on drugs they nee d or put food on the table. Have to make a choice. Worried about sending th eir kids t o school, worried about not sending their kid s to sc hool. They s ee the people of the top doing a hell of a lot b etter while the rest of her left to won der who's looki ng out f or me. That's Dona ld Trump's presidency. More t han 215 S outh. I think it's now 217, 000 dead Amer icans because of Kovar, 19 and, experts s ay, will lose nearly 200,000 more live s in the next few months. All b ecause this president cares Mawr about his Park Avenue perspec tive on the wor ld in the s tock ma rket than he doe s about you be cause refused to follow the science. It's es timated. If we just wore these ma sks between now a nd the end of the year, we'd sav e 100,000 lives. Folks, you know what's really s ad about all this? The president kne w he kne w back in Januar y how dangerous this virus Waas, and he h it it f rom the American p eople, he told the j ournalist Bob Woodward in a taped int erview. The d isease was deadly a nd Janne r dead ly and far wors e than the flu an ai rborne. But her e's what he d id. According to New York Times toda y, hi s administrati on gave Wall Street investors heads up ab out it, didn't tell us, but gave Wall St reet inves tors ahea d up. But the A merican people, he said nothing. That's why they made so much money. By quote selli ng sho rt, they knew wh at was coming. Wha t happened to the res t o f us, he told Bob, or dered he didn 't want to pani c the Ameri can people. We don't pani c. He panicked. And his reckless per sonal conduc t, since hi s diagnosis has been unconscionable. Lo nger. Donald Trump is p resident, the m ore reckles s he gets. Dr. Fa uci, the le ading e xpert i n the country, refer red to the president 's an nouncement on the Suprem e Court in the Rose Garden a s quote a super spre ader e vent causing so many people to get covered. And how did Trump re spond? Responde d by r unning a nati onal ad taking Dr F auci's wor ds out of context, Dr Fa uci said way back i n March, quo te, I can 't imagine anybody could be doing Mawr, referrin g to the public health off icials that Trum p took that quote out of context and put in a camp aign ad deliberately line, m aking i t sound like D r Fauci was talking a bout him. Even after foul, s he as ked him to take the ad down. Trump 's campaign said they continue to u se the ad knowing it was a lie. That b ehavior is no s urprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans wh o put the ir lives on the line like my son p ut the lives on the line to save our nati on. Calls the m losers an d suckers. My son both spen t a year in Iraq o n The Bron ze Star, the con spicuous service belt. He was no sucker, an d the people he left beh ind were heroes. And now now is a con sequence of this overw helming lin e. Misleading, irrespo nsible act ion on the par t of Donald Trump . How many empty cha irs are there goin g to be around the dining room table t onight because of his negligen ce? Folks, w e're so much bett er than this i s a country. D esp ite the crisis we face, we haven't enormous opport unity. The build b ack better the Americ an people that th e blinders taken off to r eplace Dona ld Trump' s incentive s for co mpanies to ship j obs overseas with real policies and tax credits to revitalize Am erican manufacturing. T o make it in America. M ake it in M ichigan by American look. We 're going to do ever ything to give e veryone a fair retur n on their work. Unequ al chance to get ahead, for ex ample, and communities of color here in Detr oit and all a cross the c ountry, the questio n is, how do we break the cycle? We're i n good times . You lag behin d and bad times. Yo u're the first hit , then h it the hardest and the recovery. The last one is the bounce b ack. The ans wer is about justice, criminal justice, policin g, reform. This nation is s trong enough to both hone stly face system ic racism and strong eno ugh to provide safe st re ets for our families a nd small business es that too often b ear the brunt of looting and burni ng. We have no need for armed militias r oaming America s treets, and we sh ould have no tole rance for extremist white supremacist gr oup menacing ou r community. And the se guys were hatching violent a nd der anged schemes li ke the one against Go vernor Rittner that t he FBI and local law en forcement uncov ered and stopp ed last week. But make no m istake, that was a planned ac t of te rrorism. A plot? Think of th is. A plot in the United States of America to blow up a bridge on America n soil, to threaten the lives of police officers to kidnappi ng American leader . There's a sort of behavior you mig ht expect fro m Isi s and shoul d shock the conscience or American to see that sort of tw isted thin king take root here in Amer ica. We'll all pre sident does. Trum p does is fan the flam es of hatred and divisi on in this country, telling t he proud boys in the debate with M ay. When I said, Well, you condemn them, he said, I'll tell them to stand bac k a nd stand by. What the h ell is the matter with this guy attac king Gover nor Wit tner on the same d ay this plot was expose d? It's despicable. And by the same measure, we say we have no need to fa ce racial injustice. This country, you haven't opened your eye s to the truth of America today, the powerful v oices for justice in recent we eks and mo nths. George Fl oyd, six year ol d daughter who I met with, a nd when I met the family Jean I kn elt down to say hi to her and sh e said, lo oked at me and said, Daddy, change the w orld. Jacob Blake's mother, another on e when I met with her, said violence does n't reflect who her son is and the natio n needs hea ling and said she 's playing praying for the police officers. O r Doc Rive rs, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said Q uote, We're the ones get ting killed, W e're the one s getting shot. We 've been hung. I t's amazing why we keep loving this co untry, and this country do esn't love us back. Think abou t that. Think ab out what it takes to be a black person. Love America tod ay that is a d eep love. This country t hat is far too long has not been fully recogn ized. W hat we need in Americ a's leadershi p to seek the esca late tensions, o pen the lines of commun ications to bring us back together again to he el toe hope a s president. That's precisely what I'll do . But true justice is al so about jobs, go od paying job s, financial stability, families of c olor building, build ing wealth, pas sing it down. T hat's how I delive r equal ity and e quity. Another example. More and more wome n are dropping out of the work place because of the r ecession. We're in a city around the suburbs, hav e a plan to deal wit h pandemic respon sibly. New tes ting Tracing , masking, not polit icizing The race for vaccine plannin g for safe and equita ble distribution, Provi ding PP and other resource i s for schools to reope n safely. He's the careg iving crisis that so many fa milies were e xperiencing. Squeez e bet ween r aising yo ur k id and car ing for your agent loved o nes and protect your hea lth care in the Middle East pandemic. Why do n't Republicans have th e time? As I sai d, toe h old a hearing on the Supreme Court inste ad of addressing t he significant upcoming needs of l ocal communities. I'll te ll you why. It's about w iping out Obama care, wipi ng it off the books because her nomi nee is said in the past that th e law should b e struck do wn is gonna take a way health care co verage for 20 millio n Americans. I'll al so take away pre vent protections f or pre existing conditions that m ore than 100 million people in America h ave compl ications of covert 19. We'll also add to t hat lo ng scoring hea rt damage could well be come th e next pre exis ting conditi on t hat will toss out. The rule allows Child ren to be co vered on th eir parents. Heal th insurers. So lays 26. We'll take us backwards to an insur ance compani es coul d charge a woman mo re for health care than a man ju st because she's a w oman, f olks, we coul d d o so much be tter together. I' ll build on the affor dable care Act w here you can choose to k eep your pri vate in s urance as well as o ffer Medi caid like public option, which will giv e private in surance real comp etition. W e're gonna incre ase subsidies so your prem iums are lower. You c an afford to p lan with lower deductibles, l ower out of po cket spendi ng, folks. We could only do this if we com e tog ether as a c ountry. Abraham Lincol n told us that a h ouse divided can not stand today. Trust is , Ebby , Hope seems elu sive. Instead of healing, w e're being ripped apar t. I refused to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipa rtisan in this c ountry, a spiri t of being able to work wi th anothe r. When I say that, I'm told tha t used to be the w ay Joe used to get a lot of things d one . But things have changed. Well, I'm he re to tell you can't happen again, and t hey must must if there's anything going to get anything done. I'm runn in g is a proud Democrat , but I will govern as an American presiden t I work with Democr ats and Republ icans. That's wh y so many Republican l eaders ha ve endorsed me. They know I've done it. We'l l do it again. For those who don't support me as well as those who do. Folks, that's the j ob of a president, the duty to care the duty to heal. And you, too have a sacred duty. As my f rien d John Lewis used t o say , Vote, it matters. Michiga n ma tters. You e lected me and Barack Obama in 200 0 and 12 and yo u bet on us when we be t o n you and bet on American worker s. We bet on t he U. A W. I'm asking f or yo ur trusted support in 2020 for Came l and may we 'll alwa ys have your bac k, I prom ise y ou. So please v ote. He lp us G et out the vot e Goto. I will vot e dot com slash m I i n Detroit more than 20 years. Look, you have now 20 early voting centers. They're open now all across the city, open seven days a week in election day, it's a one stop shop. You could go get registered and vote right then and there. So don't wait. Vote today. Tell everyone you know everyone you meet vote, vote, vote. And no matter what, don't let anybody discourage you or tell your vote won't count, because it does you, The American people are gonna decide the future of this country vote. It's time to restore America's soul. It's time to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle class and unions built the middle class. No matter what your ace rager gender folks, folks, look, it's time to unite America. It really is. I'll never forget what President Kennedy said about going to the moon. My colleagues in the Senate used to kid me but raising it when I bring it up in a caucus, he answered the question that was on everybody lips. But nobody asked. Why are we doing this? He said. We're doing it because we refused to postpone. I refused to postpone any longer. The work America must dio. There's nothing beyond our capacity. There's no limit to America's future. The only thing could tear America apart is America itself. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's show him who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and, yes, truth over lies. It's standard time to stand up Take back our country. God bless you all And may God protect our troops. Go get him. We can do this. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you. That would be the people got Thio World Go around. Got Thio?

CSPANJB18102020116	Joe Biden	2020-10-18	Joe Biden Campaign Event in Durham, North Carolina	ONE OF , THE MOST PROTECTABLE THING ABOUT THIS COVID PANDEMIC IS ITS UNPREDICTABILITY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST IS THE ABSOLUTE PARTISANSHIP OF THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE ONE HALF OF THE COUNTRY THINKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT , AND THE OTHER THINKS EVERYTHING IS HUNKY-DORY. I AM MORE OF THE FORMER. I HAVE STUDY PANDEMICS FOR MORE THAN HALF OF MY LIFE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MORE PARTISAN APPROACH. AND FRANKLY A MORE WRONGHEADED ONE. PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST CENTURY WHERE WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH THE WONDERS OF MODERN SCIENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MODERN VIROLOGY AND VACCINE SCIENCE. NOT TO MENTION MODERN MEDICINE. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT. SOME OF MY CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES HAVE A HYPOTHETICAL ISSUE AND I SAY NO IT IS NOT. THERE ARE SEVERAL COUNTRIES DOING FAR BROTHER , DEBTOR THAN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF A MORE , FAR BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF A RIGOROUS, STEP-BY-STEP PROGRAM WHERE THEY PUT DOWN THE METHODS, DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY NEED TO AND WHAT IS GOING OUT IN THE COMMITTEE. BETTER AND MORE WIDESPREAD TESTING, CONTACT TRACING AND A LESS BUSINESS LEADERSHIP STYLE WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR OF MY STAY. THAT WOMAN IS THIS OR THAT. OR LIBERATE MICHIGAN OR THINGS LIKE THAT. SO, IT IS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC. NOT TO MENTION, THE UNDERMINING OF SUPERB SCIENTIFIC AGENCIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SUCH AS THE NIH, THE CDC, EVEN THE FDA. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHERE GOVERNMENT DOES WORK AND WORKS RATHER WELL. AND THEY HAVE ALL BEEN STYMIED. WE HAVE CAREER SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE BEEN OVERRIDDEN AND STYMIED IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ONLY INAPPROPRIATE, IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE DANGEROUS. , [HONKING AND CHEERING] HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE. THERE IS A REASON WHY HV YOU POSIT ARE DOING REALLY WELL. THEY WILL DO EVEN AT HER. I TELL YOU WHAT STOP , WHAT. YOU ARE MAKING YOUR FAMILY PROUD, MA'AM. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKERS AHEAD OF ME. SOON TO BE COMMISSIONER, JESSICA HOLMES, I KNOW YOU ARE HERE SOMEWHERE. STATE REPRESENTATIVE LOUIS IS HERE. [HONKING] AND A GREAT COACH. MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS WITH ME TODAY AND WENT TO A SCHOOL COACH LAWSON WENT TO FOR LITTLE WHILE IN WASHINGTON. SHE IS RECRUITING SOME OF THE GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WENT TO SCHOOL. SHE SHOWED ME A VIDEO YOU WERE DOING WERE YOU MADE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMPETING IN THE HEART OF WINNING. YOU TALKED ABOUT WORKING HARD AND COMPETING. AND EVERYONE WORKS HARD BUT YOU SAID WORKING HARD IS ESSENTIAL BUT COMPETING IS EVEN MORE CONSEQUENTIAL. DID YOU COMPETE WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD? COMPETING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE IN WHAT IS AT THE OF WINNING >> , WINNING. MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO REPRESENT THE FIRST AND FOURTH DISTANT , DISTRICT WITH DECENCY AND HONOR CAN TELL YOU WE ARE DOING BOTH, WORKING HARD AND COMPETING LIKE WE NEVER DID BEFORE BECAUSE SO MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR THIS NATION. THE VERY SOUL OF THE NATION IS AT STAKE. AS MY COOK , AS MY FOLKS USED TO SAY IN COLLEGE, IT IS GO TIME. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME. THE CHOICE IS AS CLEAR AS IT HAS EVER BEEN AND STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION REMIND ME OF SOMETHING MY DAD USED TO SAY WHEN WE LOST IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WHEN I WAS A KID. HE OWES USED TO SAY A JOB IS A LOT , ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. HE SAID, AND THIS IS THE GODS TRUTH, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT WILL BE OK. THAT IS A LESSON I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. I GREW UP AROUND A LOT OF HARD-WORKING FOLKS. HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY THINK THEY COULD LOOK THERE KID IN THE EYE RIGHT NOW AND SAY, IT WILL BE OK, AND MEAN IT? SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HURT. OVER HALF OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY HAVE A BILL FOR $400 THEY DID NOT EXPECT IN ONE MONTH AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT. THEY EITHER BORROW MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. AS UNEMPLOYMENT IS WAY UP. 1,000,200 THOUSAND PEOPLE FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT JUST THIS WEEK. FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT, WHETHER HEALTH CARE WOULD BE RIPPED AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC, WORRYING ABOUT SENDING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL OR NOT. THEY SEE FOLKS AT THE TOP DOING BETTER THAN EVER WHILE LEFT TO WONDER, WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT IS DOWN FROM'S PRESIDENCY. MORE THAN 217,000 AMERICANS DEAD BECAUSE OF COVID-19. NEARLY 4000 IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. ON FRIDAY, WE SAW THE HIGHS NUMBER OF NEW CASES IN ONE DAY SINCE JULY STOP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS, THE WORST DAY SINCE JULY. YES, THE OTHER NIGHT , YET, THE OTHER NIGHT, TRUMP SET AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES WE HAVE TURNED THE QUARTER , CORNER. MY GRANDFATHER WOULD SAY, THIS GUY IS AROUND THE BEND IF HE THINKS THAT. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. HE CONTINUES TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EXPERTS SAY WE ARE LUCKY TO LOSE AS MANY AS 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR ALL BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT HIS PARK AVENUE PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE WORLD, THE STOCK MARKET, THEN HE DOES ABOUT YOU. HE REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. IT IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN THE END OF THE YEAR , NOW IN THE END OF THE YEAR, 100,000 LIVES. HIS OWN HEAD OF THE CDC SAID THAT. WHAT IS SAD IS THE PRESIDENT KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THE VIRUS WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN JANUARY. HE HIT IT FROM THE COUNTRY. HE IS ON RECORD. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD IN A TAPED INTERVIEW THAT THE DISEASE WAS DEADLY AND MUCH WORSE THAN THE FLU AND HERE'S WHAT HE DID. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO, I GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP BUT HE DID NOT TELL US. THAT IS WHY THEY MADE SO MUCH MONEY BY SELLING SHORT. YOU ALL GOT SOLD SHORT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS COMING? BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF US TRIED TO CLAIM WITH WOODWARD THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. [HONKING] THE SELFISH BEHAVIORS NO SURPRISE. THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO LOOKS AT AMERICANS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, LIKE SO MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE DONE, LIKE MY SON DID WINNING A BRONZE STAR. HE CALLS THEM SUCKERS AND LOSERS. WHO THE HELL DOES HE THINK HE IS TALKING ABOUT? THESE ARE HEROES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE SACRIFICING. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL OF THE IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION, HOW MANY CHAIRS WERE EMPTIED AT THE TABLE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS NEGLIGENCE? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. DESPITE THE CRISIS WE FACE, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. WE COULD BUILD BACK BETTER. WE JUST HAVE TO STAND UP AND TAKE IT BACK. LOOK. WE CAN BUILD THE ECONOMY AND AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE QUESTION IS, IN THE GOOD TIMES COME YOU LAG BEHIND. THE ANSWER IS ABOUT JUSTICE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM. THIS NATION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO BE HONEST THAT WE FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM FOR THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TOO OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF LOOTING AND BURNING. WE HAVE NO NEED ROAMING THE AMERICANS , AMERICA'S STREETS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR AN EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP MARCHING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT IF YOU SAY WE HAVE NO , NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU HAVE NOT HOPE , OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH. THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL VOICES FOR JUSTICE IN RECENT MONTHS. GEORGE FLOYD'S SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, I KNELT DOWN TO SAY HI TO HER AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD. JACOB BLAKE'S MOTHER SAYS VIOLENCE DOES NOT REFLECT HER SON AND THE NATION NEEDS HEALING AND SHE SAID SHE PRAYS FOR POLICE OFFICERS. DOC RIVERS, A BASKETBALL COACH, CHOKING BACK TEARS WHEN HE SAID WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. WE HAVE BEEN HUNG. IT IS AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY IN THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US BACK. THINK ABOUT THAT, WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A BLACK PERSON, TO LOVE THE COUNTRY TODAY AS HE DOES, A DEEP LOVE FOR THE COUNTRY. WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, AND BRING US TOGETHER, TO HEAL AND TO HOPE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WILL DO. TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ABOUT GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY. IT WAS RIGHT HERE A CENTURY AGO THAT AN OASIS OF BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES THRIVED. EVEN IN THE ERA OF JIM CROW. THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF FLOURISHING BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. A PLAYSET OFFERED THE GIVING FAMILIES A REAL SHOT AT A HOME, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE DEBT-FREE SO THEY COULD BUILD WEALTH AND PASS OPPORTUNITY DOWN. THEY BUILT EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS GROUP IN AMERICA. THAT IS HOW WE DELIVER EQUALITY AND EQUITY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, MORE WOMEN ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS RECESSION, WHETHER IN CITIES OR SUBURBS. I HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, TESTING, TRACING, MASKING, PLANNING FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION, PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PPE AND OTHER RESOURCES, FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. SO MANY FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING, SQUEEZED BETWEEN RAISING HER KIDS AND CARING FOR AN AGING LOVED ONE. PROTECTING YOUR HEALTH CARE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC, WHY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WILL TELL YOU WHY, FOR REAL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. IT IS ABOUT WIPING OBAMACARE OFF THE BOOKS, THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THEIR NOMINEE HAS SET IN THE PAST, THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19, 7 MILLION PEOPLE INFECTED, WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENIED YOUR COVERAGE. WOMEN WILL BE CHARGED MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. FOLKS, WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. I WILL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. YOUR GOVERNOR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO EXPAND MEDICAID, BUT IT IS BEING BLOCKED BY REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE. MY PLAN WILL INVOLVE 357,000 UNINSURED WITH CAROLINIANS IN A PUBLIC OPTION FOR FREE AUTOMATICALLY. IT IS GOING TO MAKE A LIFE-CHANGING DIFFERENCE FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. WE CAN ONLY DO ANY OF THIS IF WE COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT A BIPARTISANSHIP, ESPECIALLY BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. I SAID THAT FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED, I WAS TOLD, MAYBE WE USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, THAT WAS YOUR REPUTATION IN THE SENATE, BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED, THEY DON'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY CAN AND THEY WILL AND THEY MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DID, THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT, A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, AND YOU TOO HAVE A SACRED DUTY, TO VOTE, AND IT MATTERS. NORTH CAROLINA MATTERS. SENATOR HARRIS AND I ARE ASKING YOU FOR YOUR TRUST AND SUPPORT. WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, SO PLEASE VOTE AND HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/NC. EARLY VOTING STARTED ON THURSDAY. WE HAVE TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. WE CAN'T LET UP. YOU CAN VOTE EARLY IN PERSON UNTIL THE 31ST, BUT DON'T WAIT. GO VOTE TODAY AND DON'T JUST VOTE FOR ME AND SENATOR HARRIS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNORS RACE, SENATE RACE, A RECORD NUMBER OF BLACK WOMEN ON THE BALLOT, LABOR COMMISSIONERS, THE COURTS. FOLKS, THEY ARE READY TO DELIVER FOR NORTH CAROLINA FAMILIES, SO VOTE. IT IS TIME. WHEN I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY, I HAD NOT PLANNED ON RUNNING AGAIN AND I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, MY SON HAD JUST DIED AND I HAD NO INTEREST. THEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING TORCHES. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, THEIR VEINS BULGING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE SAME PILE THAT WAS SHOUTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S, CARRYING NAZI FLAGS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED WHO WAS PROTESTING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WHEN ASKED FOR COMMENT, THIS PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. VERY FINE PEOPLE. I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THIS. IT IS TIME TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL. IT IS TIME TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, NO MATTER YOUR RACE, AGE, RELIGION, GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR DISABILITY. WE CAN DO THIS. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF, THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED. IT IS TIME TO UNITE AMERICA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN I WAS A KID WHEN WE WERE GOING TO THE MOON. EVERY KID IN SCHOOL HURT HIS SPEECH. HE USED THE LINE IN THAT SPEECH, MY SENATE COLLEAGUES IN THE WHITE HOUSE HEARD ME USE ALL THE TIME, THAT MADE THE MOST IMPRESSION ON ME. HE ASKED, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? HIS RESPONSE WAS, HE SAID, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. THIS IS AMERICA. WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE AMERICA'S WORK THAT MUST BE DONE. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER MAILED HERE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE HERE IN , NEVER FAILED. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, SO LET HIM DO WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. FOLKS, IT IS TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. NO MORE TIME GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

CSPANJB23102020119	Joe Biden	2020-10-23	Joe Biden Remarks on the Pandemic Response	"JOE GOT $3.5 MILLION FROM RUSSIA AND IT CAME THROUGH PUTIN BECAUSE HE WAS FRIENDLY WITH THE FORMER MAYOR OF MOSCOW, THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW'S WIFE. HE GOT $3.5 MILLION , YOUR FAMILY GOT $3.5 MILLION AND SOMEDAY YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN. I NEVER GOT ANY MONEY FROM RUSSIA. I DON'T GET MONEY FROM RUSSIA. ABOUT YOUR THING LAST NIGHT, I KNEW ALL ABOUT THAT. THROUGH JOHN RATCLIFFE, WHO IS FANTASTIC, HE SAID THE ONE THING THAT IS COMMON TO BOTH OF THEM, THEY BOTH WANT YOU TO LOSE, BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER TO RUSSIA BETWEEN THE SANCTIONS. NOBODY TOUGHER THAN BE ON RUSSIA. BETWEEN THE SANCTIONS, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH NATO, I GOT THE NATO COUNTRIES TO PUT UP AN EXTRA 130 BILLION GOING TO $420 BILLION A YEAR. THAT'S TO GUARD AGAINST RUSSIA. WHILE HE WAS SELLING PILLOWS AND SHEETS, I SOLD 10 COMBUSTORS , TANK BUSTERS TO UKRAINE. THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP. LAST NIGHT, WE SAW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REPEATEDLY LIE ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE SAW HIM REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MET WITH PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. INSTEAD, IT HAS COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES AND PUSHED MILLIONS INTO POVERTY. WE SAW HIM DIMINISH THE PAIN FELT BY SO MANY AMERICANS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT IS GOING AWAY, WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT. THEY ARE QUOTES. AS I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT, WE ARE NOT LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT, WE ARE LEARNING TO DIE WITH IT. THIS IS A DARK WINTER AHEAD. ALREADY, MORE THAN 200 20,000 PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. 220,000 EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINNER TABLES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS HAD TO E NDURE THE AGONY OF SAYING GOODBYE TO SOMEONE THEY LOVED OVER VIDEO CHAT, WHO COULD NOT GATHER THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS, EVEN THEIR FULL FAMILY TO GRIEVE TOGETHER AT A FUNERAL SERVICE. WORSE YET, A NEW STUDY FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 130,000 AND 210,000 OF THOSE DEATHS WERE AVOIDABLE. LEADING MEDICAL JOURNAL IN AMERICA, FRANKLY IN THE WORLD, WROTE AN UNPRECEDENTED EDITORIAL , TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEY CRITICIZE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT RESPONSE AND STATED THAT HE TOOK A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO A TRAGEDY. COVID-19 DWARFS ANYTHING WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT HISTORY AND IT IS NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. THE VIRUS IS SURGING IN ALMOST EVERY STATE. WE PASSED 4.8 MILLION CASES. WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED THIS WEEK WHAT HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY TO GET THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE RIGHT FROM THE START, HIS ANSWER WAS, AND I QUOTE, NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH. AS MANY AS 210,000 AVOIDABLE DEATHS, THERE IS NOT MUCH HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY? THE UNITED STATES IS 4% OF THE ENTIRE WORLD POPULATION, YET WE MAKE UP 20% OF ALL THE DEATHS WORLDWIDE. IF THIS IS A SUCCESS, WHAT DOES A FAILURE LOOK LIKE? WE ARE MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE HAS GIVEN UP. HE HAS QUIT ON YOU. HE HAS QUIT ON YOUR FAMILY. HE HAS QUIT ON AMERICA. HE JUST WANTS US TO GO NUMB AND RESIGN TO THE HORRORS OF THIS DEATH TOLL AND THE PAIN IT IS CAUSING SO MANY AMERICANS. HE CAN'T ERASE HIS OWN WORDS OR DEEDS. IN FEBRUARY, HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THIS VIRUS WAS. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD, THIS DISEASE WAS DEADLY, FAR WORSE THAN THE FLU. BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING US HOW BAD IT WAS GOING TO BE, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, HIS ADMINISTRATION ONLY GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP. THEY MADE A BUNDLE DOING SOMETHING CALLED SELLING SHORT OR BETTING AGAINST THE MARKET THE REST OF US TOOK THE FULL BRUNT OF IT. IN JUNE, WHEN WE BEGIN TO SEE THE RESURGENCE OF COVID-19, I CALLED OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WAVERING, AND WAVING THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS. BUT THEN, IT WAS AS IF HE DECIDED TO GO ON OFFENSE FOR THE VIRUS, HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASKS, NO SOCIAL DISTANCING, WHERE PEOPLE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS, INVITING THE VIRUS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, HOSTING WHAT DR. FAUCI CALLED SUPER-SPREADER FEARS EVENTS, ENDANGERING MORE PEOPLE'S LIVES BY TELLING THE PUBLIC, DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DISEASE, DON'T LET IT DOMINATE YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN ARIZONA WILL END UP SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD VOTED FOR TRUMP, LISTENED TO HIM, DIDN'T THINK THE VIRUS WAS A BIG DEAL. AT DAD BECAME INFECTED , ENTER DAD BECAME INFECTED, AND HE DIED. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD'S ONLY PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WAS ""TRUSTING TRUMP."" EVEN AFTER CONTRACTING THE VIRUS HIMSELF, DONALD TRUMP STILL REFUSED TO PROMOTE UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING, WHICH COULD HAVE SAVED OVER 1000 AMERICAN LIVES, AND COULD STILL SAVE OVER WHENEVER THOUSAND AMERICAN LIVES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HELD PRISONER BY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES. WE CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH. WE CAN COME TOGETHER WITH , WITH WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, COME TOGETHER WITH GREAT PASSION AND DETERMINATION. I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I PLANNED TO DO IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I WILL IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO POSITION OUR COUNTRY TO FINALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS VIRUS, AND GET BACK OUR LIVES. I WILL REACH OUT TO EVERY GOVERNOR IN EVERY STATE, RED AND BLUE, AS WELL AS MAYORS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS, DURING TRANSITION, TO FIND OUT WHAT SUPPORT THEY NEED AND HOW MUCH OF IT THEY NEED. I WILL ASK THE NEW CONGRESS TO PUT A BILL ON MY DESK BY THE END OF JANUARY, WITH ALL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SEE HOW BOTH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE END, WHAT IS NEEDED. LOOK, A PANDEMIC DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES, NOR DO I. AS I SAID, NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES, UNITED IN OUR SPOTS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND BEAT THIS VIRUS. FIRST, I WILL GO TO EVERY GOVERNOR TO GET A MASK MANDATE IN THEIR STATE SAID IF THEY REFUSE, I WILL GO TO CITY AND COUNTY EXECUTIVES TO GET LOCAL MASK MANDATES IN PLACE NATIONWIDE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MANDATE MASK WEARING AN ALL FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION, BECAUSE MASKS SAVE LIVES. PERIOD. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA. THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR INITIALLY TRIED TO BAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM INITIATING MASK MANDATES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT HAPPENED? IN JUNE, ARIZONA ENTERED A SURGE OF CASES, HOSPITALS WERE FLOODED. THE STATE HEALTH SYSTEM WAS OVERWHELMED. CITIES AND COUNTIES APPEALED THE GOVERNOR'S RULING. THEY IMPOSED THEIR OWN LOCAL MANDATES, COVERING MOST OF THE STATE. THE RESULT? CASES FELL BY 75%. WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT, IT IS A SCIENTIFIC IMPERATIVE. IT IS A POINT OF PATRIOTIC PRIDE, SO WE CAN PULL OUR COUNTRY OUT OF THIS GOD-AWFUL SPIRAL THAT WE ARE IN. IT IS A TESTAMENT OF WHAT WE WERE TAUGHT BY OUR FAMILIES AND BY OUR FAITH, LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. SECOND, I WILL PUT A NATIONAL TESTING PLAN IN PLACE WITH THE GOAL OF TESTING AS MANY PEOPLE EACH DAY AS WE ARE CURRENTLY TESTING EACH WEEK, A SEVEN-FOLD INCREASE. THERE IS A KEY DIFFERENCE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ME. I BELIEVE IN TESTING. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. I BELIEVE IN THE EXAMPLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROVED THAT WIDESPREAD GAINS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY OPEN CRITICALLY, EVERY SCHOOL, EVERY WORKER, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE EASY ACCESS TO REGULAR, RELIABLE, FREE TESTING. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE NEED TO INCREASE BOTH LAP-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WITH RESULTS BACK IN 24 HOURS OR LESS, AND FASTER, CHEAPER SCREENING TESTS THAT YOU COULD TAKE AT HOME OR IN SCHOOL. WE HAVE , WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH. STATES ARE STILL OPERATING ON THE FLY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MOSTLY ON THEIR OWN. AND MANY AMERICANS STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET A TEST, OR HOW. THIS ISN'T BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO MASTER, NOT IF WE ARE DIRECTING A COORDINATED EFFORT TO CROSS GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR, INSTEAD OF LEAVING CHAOS TERRAIN , CHAOS TO REIGN. WE WILL MASS-PRODUCE THE SUPPLIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TESTS AND TAP MORE OF OUR NATION'S LAB CAPACITY, SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR TEST RESULTS MORE QUICKLY. WE WILL BUILD A NATIONAL CORPS OF CONTACT TRACERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK. WE WILL ALSO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING A TEST AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND THAT NO ONE, NO ONE IS SCARED THAT BEING TESTED FOR COVID MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL DEFEAT THIS VIRUS IS IF WE DEFEAT IT EVERYWHERE. THE THIRD POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS, WE WILL CLOSE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, THE PPE GAP, AND GET GEAR OUT TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED. EVERY HEALTH CARE WORKER WILL HAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF PROPERLY-FITTED N95 MASKS. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE STILL RATIONING THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL USE THE FULL POWER OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO DRIVE THE PRODUCTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, MASKS, GOWNS, GLOVES AND MORE, AND ENSURE IT IS DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY. I WON'T STOP UNTIL THE NATION'S SUPPLY EXCEEDS THE DEMAND AND OUR STOCK PILE'S PLAN IS, ESPECIALLY IN HARD-HIT AREAS AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE VIRUS. I WILL APPOINT A FULLY-EMPOWERED SUPPLY COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF FEELING IN THE GAPS. WE WILL MAKE SURE WE CAN MANUFACTURE CRITICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE AT HOME, SO WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THIS CRISIS. FOURTH, I WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT, RELIABLE, TRUSTED, DETAILED NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR REOPENING SAFELY, AND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE NEED A SINGLE SOURCE OF GUIDANCE THAT WE CAN TRUST, WHERE WE KNOW THE INFORMATION WON'T CHANGE FOR ANY REASON, OTHER THAN THE SCIENCE THAT GUIDES IT. NOT POLITICAL LICKS. IN , NOT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. NOT PUBLIC IMAGE. SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT AN ON AND OFF THING, AND WE LEARN MORE EVERY DAY ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW IT SPREADS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND ADJUST OUR BEHAVIOR TO RESPONSIBLY RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES CAN'T MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION, THE SCIENCE. IT'S NOT JUST MORE DETAILED AND EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE THEY NEED, IT IS CONSULTATIONS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SO PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO TURN WITH THEIR QUESTIONS. IT IS HAVING A GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS IN YOUR CORNER, NOT A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON YOU. AND ONCE WE GOT OUR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING TOGETHER, ONCE THERE IS UNIVERSAL MASKING, ENOUGH PPE AND TESTING TO GO AROUND, SIGNS-BACKED WRITINGS TO HELP US MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS, THEN WE CAN GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY, OUR BUSINESS IS GROWING, AND OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN WITHOUT WASTING ANOTHER MINUTE. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT, I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY. I AM GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. AND FINALLY, WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMS HE FOUND A CURE. YET WE HAVE 1000 PEOPLE DYING EACH DAY. MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE ARE IN HOSPITALS RIGHT NOW BATTLING THE VIRUS. LIFESAVING THERAPIES SHOULDN'T JUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE BECAUSE LEARN ANY DAY THAT ONE OF THESE VACCINES CURRENTLY IN TRIAL IS SHOWING ITSELF TO BE EFFECTIVE. THAT WILL BE A WONDERFUL DAY FOR OUR PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD EVERYWHERE, WHETHER IT COMES NEXT WEEK OR IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. BUT IT WILL STILL BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE ANY VACCINE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE, AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE IT GETS TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE AND THE COMFORTABLE. , EQUITABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO, IN THE MEANTIME, IS DOING HIS JOB TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ONCE WE HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE, IT HAS TO BE FREE TO EVERYONE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INSURED. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THE VACCINE MUST BE FREE, AND FREELY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE MORE REASON THAT IT IS SO DESPICABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, TO GET THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE ACA, INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER RECOMMENDED VACCINES FOR FREE. SO OVERTURNING THE ACA WOULD MEAN PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THAT IS WRONG, VERY, VERY WRONG. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE ISN'T A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS A RIGHT. THAT IS WHY, AS PRESIDENT I WILL BUILD ON AND PROTECT THE ACA BY ADDING A PUBLIC OPTION THAT WILL COMPETE WITH PRIVATE PLANS TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD. I WILL BRING DOWN RUG PRICES BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. I WILL MAKE SURE AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE, AND THOSE WITH INSURANCE HAVE ACCESS TO FREE COVID-19 VACCINE. AND I WILL DIRECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BULK PURCHASE AS MANY DOSES AS NECESSARY OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE, SO WE CAN PROVIDE IT FREE TO THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED, OR MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. THROUGHOUT ALL THIS, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. AND I WILL EMPOWER THEM. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DAMAGED FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT , AND IN OUR LEADERS, AND GOVERNMENT ITSELF. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PUBLIC SERVANTS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS WE FACE IN THE COMING YEARS. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS GIVE IT TO YOU, AS FDR SAID, STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. I WILL DELIVER ON MY PROMISES. I WILL LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICS. I WILL LET DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS SPEAK FREELY, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. AND I WON'T LET FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ROB US OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN QUALITIES, OUR HOPE IN THE FUTURE AND OUR FAITH IN OURSELVES. WE CAN BEAT THIS VIRUS. WE ARE NOT TO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINK , WE ARE NOT TOO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINGS. WE ARE AMERICANS. IMAGINE A TRUE, NATIONALLY-COORDINATED PLAN THAT SPARES NO EXPENSE SO THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN WITH FULL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. IMAGINE EVERY SMALL BUSINESS GETTING A RESTART THAT HELPS COVER THE COST OF INSTALLING PLEXIGLASS, PPE, AND MINIMIZING THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS AND WORKERS. IMAGINE OLDER AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVING THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH TRUSTING THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IS WORKING FOR THEM. IMAGINE, INSTEAD OF STAYING LOCKED IN THEIR ROOMS, THEY ARE ABLE TO HUG THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS THAT THEY LOVE AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE. IMAGINE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICAN, IMAGINE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE THAT TREATS YOUR NEEDS AS A PRIORITY, NOT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND I JUNE 8 A IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE , AND IMAGINE A DAY IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN ENJOY A DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY AND MAYBE GO TO A MOVIE, WHEN YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY, WEDDINGS, ACTUATIONS, SURROUNDED BY YOUR NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS. THAT IS THE BIDEN-HARRIS AGENDA TO BEACH COVID-19. IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, AND THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, WATCHING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR A MASK, AND PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING A Y LONGER. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT IF WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND KEEP FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER, WITH ONE ANOTHER, I PROMISE YOU WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE MUCH FASTER THAN THE RATE WE ARE GOING NOW. YOU ALL KNOW THIS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN THEIR BEST TO THIS COUNTRY IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND THIS TIME ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT. I'M NOT JOKING WHEN I SAY THIS, I THINK EVERY DAY ABOUT THE BRAVE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HOSPITAL WORKERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS, EMTS AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. THEY ARE NOT FIGURATIVELY, BUT LITERALLY PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE DAY IN AND THEY OUT TO CARE FOR PEOPLE. I'M THINKING OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO CARRIED THE REST OF US ON THEIR SHOULDERS THROUGH THESE MANY MONTHS, GROCERY CLERKS, DELIVERY CLERKS, DRIVERS, FOLKS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE, THE MEATPACKERS AND SO MANY MORE PEOPLE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, UNDER COMPENSATED, HAVE GIVEN THE BEST OF THEIR COUNTRY , HAVE GIVEN THE BEST TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN WE NEEDED IT THE MOST. THINK OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND KEEP THEIR BUSINESS IS OPEN, AND SADLY, OF ALL THOSE WHO COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THE HELP THEY WERE PROMISED. I THINK OF THE PARENTS WORKING FROM HOME WITH ADDED MAN'S OF OVERSEEING THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION. I THINK ABOUT EDUCATORS WHO ARE SPENDING HOURS LEARNING HOW TO TEACH ONLINE. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO, GIVING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THEIR STUDENTS. I THINK OF THE FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WHO STEPPED UP, DONATING TO CHARITIES, DOING GROCERY RUNS FOR OLDER RELATIVES AND NEIGHBORS, FINDING NEW WAYS TO CONNECT AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT WE KNOW. THAT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. AND LIKE JOHN F. KENNEDY, WHEN HE COMMITTED TO TAKE US TO THE MOON, HE SAID, I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT EXIST FOR THIS COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE AMERICAN PURPOSE THAT WILL NOT ONLY LEAD OUR COUNTRY BACK, BUT LEAD THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE IS NO CHALLENGE, THERE IS NO CHALLENGE WE CANNOT MEET, NO ENEMY WE ARE UNABLE TO FACE, NO THREAT WE CAN'T CONQUER IF WE STAND TOGETHER, UNITED, BOUND BY OUR COMMON RESOLVE, DETERMINATION AND VALUES. FOLKS, TOGETHER WE CAN HARNESS THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT JUST TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THIS VIRUS, BUT TO GET BACK BETTER. I PROMISE YOU, AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR HEART, WE CAN DO THIS. WE MUST DO THIS. AND WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO IT. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THANK YOU, AND KEEP THE FAITH.

EARLIER TODAY, JOE BIDEN MADE AN UNANNOUNCED CAMPAIGN STOP AT AN EARLY POLLING LOCATION IN CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND GOT REMARKS FROM CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS. THIS IS 25 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE CONVERSATIONS] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAN. YOU GUYS HAVE DONE ONE HECK OF A JOB. THE NUMBER THEY GAVE ME ARE ALMOST HARD TO BELIEVE. KNOCKING ON 250,000 DOORS. WE'VE GOT MORE VOLUNTEERS, MORE PEOPLE ENGAGED. HOW'S THE FEEL OUT THERE? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU'RE DOING MORE OF YOUR CIVIC DUTY. SHE GAVE ME A PASSPORT TO COME INTO THE DISTRICT. [LAUGHTER] I SPOKE TO THE CONGRESSWOMAN BEFORE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAN. LOOK, I WILL SAY A FEW THINGS FOR THE PRESS AND A LITTLE BIT. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THIS PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF, THEY HAVE GIVEN UP. ALL THESE SUPER SPREADERS GOING ON. I WISH I COULD SHAKE EACH ONE OF YOUR HANDS AND THANK YOU PERSONALLY, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. AS MY GRANDFATHER SAID, [INDISCERNIBLE] MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER IN WASHINGTON AT SOME POINT. I FEEL GOOD. IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER. I AM KIND OF SUPERSTITIOUS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING. IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THE WHISTLE BLOWS. [INDISCERNIBLE] I'M HEADING TO GEORGIA TOMORROW. WE ARE MAKING THE ROUNDS. IT JUST FEELS GOOD. WHEN I WENT TO IRELAND, I KEPT SAYING TO THE PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD COME, WE WOULD SIT IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. FINALLY ONE DAY, THEY SAID, WHY DON'T YOU COME TO IRELAND? AND THEY SAID IT IS A LAND OF 100,000 WELCOMES. I HAD TO GO BACK ON BUSINESS AND WE WENT BACK AND THEY DID A WHOLE GENEALOGY OF MY FAMILY. I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER REPUTATION, BUT I THINK WE ARE RELATED. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY HAILS FROM. WITH H1N1, IT WAS , [INDISCERNIBLE] NO PANIC, NO ANY OF THAT. BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT WAS BARACK , I KNOW YOU SAW HIM IN PHILLY, BUT HE'S A GOOD FRIEND. BUT THE POINT IS, THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERTS SAID LOOK, THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE ARE A LOT MORE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES TRANSMITTED THAT YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL HIGH ENOUGH. AND PANDEMICS ARE GOING TO BE CAUSED. SO WE SET UP AN OFFICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WE HIRED PEOPLE, WE PUT PEOPLE , EXPERTS FROM THE CDC AND OTHER AREAS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE WOULD PUT THEM IN OTHER COUNTRIES SO YOU WOULD SEE IT COMING. WE HAD 34 PEOPLE IN CHINA. AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE , HE NEVER ASKED THEM TO GO INTO WUHAN TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST , HOW BAD THE SITUATION WAS. AND REMEMBER, HE WAS PRAISING THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, PRESIDENT XI. FROM THE BEGINNING, IT IS CLEAR. WE WILL BE COVID, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH FUTURE PANDEMICS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST BEAT IT IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE TO GO BEYOND THAT. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY WITH COURT PACKING. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY PACKED THE LOWER COURTS AND ARE ALREADY DOING THAT? [INDISCERNIBLE] WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT , BY THE WAY, I THINK YOU ARE ASKING LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, BECAUSE OF YOUR HARD WORK, IF I AM ELECTED, WE WILL SET UP A COMMISSION. A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR, LIBERAL SCHOLARS, AND MAINSTREAM SCHOLARS. YOU CAN HAVE THEM DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT, IF ANY, CHANGES SHOULD TAKE PLACE. HOW LONG TO STAY IN COURTS, IF THERE IS A CONTROLLER. AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THE SUPREME COURT. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF COURT PACKING OR SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD X NUMBER. BUT WE LISTENED TO ALL IDEAS BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME THE SILLIEST QUESTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. A LOT OF SCHOLARS ARE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES TO HOW THE PRESIDENT PROCEEDS. AND I ASKED THEM TO REPORT BACK TO ME AS SOON AS WE ARE ELECTED IN 180 DAYS AND WE WILL DECIDE WHAT WE ARE DOING. MORE QUESTIONS, YOU ARE A PAIN IN THE NECK. THIS GUY. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE IS. , BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT , [SHOUTING] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. FOLKS, HOW ARE YOU? THANKS. WE ARE GLAD TO BE HERE. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOOK, YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS WENT ON TELEVISION TO ADMIT TO THE COUNTRY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WASN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. THE WASHINGTON POST HEADLINE TODAY SAYS WHITE HOUSE GIVES UP ON TRYING TO SLOW VIRUS SPREAD. NO CAVEATS. JUST A DEADLY ADMISSION. EARLIER IN THIS PANDEMIC, TRUMP CALLED HIMSELF A WARTIME PRESIDENT. FIGHTING A WAR AGAINST AN INVISIBLE ENEMY. I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS, AS YOU WELL KNOW, THAT HE WAVED THE WHITE FLAG ALL THE WAY BACK THEN. HE WASN'T DOING MUCH AT ALL. SOME PEOPLE SAID I WAS BEING HARSH OR UNFAIR. THE WHITE HOUSE IS COMING OUT RIGHT NOW AND ADMITTING WHAT I SAID MONTHS AGO WAS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. LOOK AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DEAD. 220,000. IT IS EXPECTED AS MANY AS ANOTHER 200,000 COULD DIE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR. AND HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL IT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST POSSIBLE PRESIDENT, THE WORST POSSIBLE PERSON TO TRY TO LEAD US TO THIS PANDEMIC. HE EITHER DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO OR HE JUST DOESN'T CARE. ON FRIDAY, DR. FAUCI, THE NATION'S MOST RESPECTED INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT MET WITH HIS COVID TEAM FOR MONTHS. EVEN WORSE, SATURDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE COVID-19 COUNT WASN'T REALLY GOING UP. EVERYTHING WAS LEVELING OUT. HE SUGGESTED THE DOCTORS WERE INFLATING THE NUMBERS, CATCH THIS, BECAUSE DOCTORS GET MORE MONEY. WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH THIS MAN? DOCTORS AND NURSES HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TRYING TO SAVE LIVES. AND HE SAYS THE REASON THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TESTING IS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY. MR. PRESIDENT, MORE THAN 1000 HEALTH-CARE WORKERS LOST THEIR LIVES FIGHTING COVID. DOCTORS, NURSES. THEY ARE NOT PROFITING. THEY ARE DYING. BUT REMEMBER, DURING THE DEBATE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT, DURING THE DEBATE, TRUMP SAID THAT WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THIS COVID. HE'S ASKING US TO LEARN TO DIE WITH IT. FOLKS, THIS HAS GOT TO END. WE CAN AND THIS CRISIS. IF WE WOULD ONLY GET TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND WORK OUT A COMPROMISE ON THE SPENDING BILLS OUT THERE. IT THAT WAY WE CAN SAFELY OPEN SCHOOLS. IT WILL COST $200 BILLION TO DO IT. BUT IT IS WORTH DOING IT. WE CAN LOWER CLASS SIZES, MORE TEACHERS, VENTILATION, PPE, MASKS, GLOVES, SANITATION. ALL THE BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IF WE PROVIDED THE HELP WE SAID WE WOULD DO. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO DO. TESTING AND TRACING. WE SHOULD BE POURING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO HOW WE GET RAPID TESTING SO THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN HOURS WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE. MANY PLACES YOU HAVE TO WAIT, SOMETIMES UP TO SIX DAYS OR SEVEN DAYS. AND LOOK, FOLKS. I PROMISE YOU THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SHAME. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHAME. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING. MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE. AS MANY AS 200,000 IS SUGGESTED BY SOME. BUT AS POINTED OUT, IF WE JUST WORE A MASK AND KEPT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND GOT TESTED, WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR OVER 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. AT THE RATE HE'S GOING, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. BY THE WAY, I AM HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS. BUT LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR, I'M NOT SHUTTING DOWN OIL FIELDS AND I'M NOT ELIMINATING RACKING. I'M INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE POLLUTION. THEY GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $25 BILLION AND $40 BILLION IN SUBSIDIES. THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TO DOING A LOT OF OTHER GOOD THINGS. BY THE WAY, I TRAVELED THE LAST FEW DAYS. I'VE TOLD YOU WHERE I WILL BE TRAVELING. I WILL BE GOING TO IOWA, WISCONSIN, GEORGIA, FLORIDA, AND MAYBE OTHER PLACES AS WELL. THERE'S A LOT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WELL IN TERMS OF BEING ONLINE AND EVERYTHING FROM FUNDRAISING EFFORTS TO MAKING SURE , I MET TODAY WITH A GROUP OF LEADERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAYING OUT WHERE WE WILL GO. CONSTANTLY, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DAY THAT HASN'T BEEN A 12 HOUR DAY AT. LOOK, YOU KNOW ME. I AM NOT OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT ANYTHING. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN EARN EVERY VOTE POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HAS TO BE REESTABLISHED. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS A GREAT DEAL TO ME PERSONALLY AS WELL AS POLITICALLY. I THINK WE WILL WIN MICHIGAN. I THINK WE WILL WIN WISCONSIN. I THINK WE WILL WIN MINNESOTA. I THINK WE HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN NORTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, IOWA. BECAUSE OF OVER 6 MILLION INDIVIDUAL VOTERS, THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION OF $49, WE ARE ABLE TO COMPETE LIKE WE HAVE BEFORE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL. THE REASON WHY IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE NOT TRAVELING AS WE ARE NOT PUTTING ON SUPER SPREADERS. WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. EVERYBODY IS WEARING A MASK AND TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE SOCIALLY DISTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE. NO, NO, NO. IT IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AND I'M NOT GOING TO ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THAT AT ALL. THERE IS SOME LITERATURE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING FROM ONE COURT TO ANOTHER COURT, NOT JUST STAYING THE WHOLE TIME ON THE SUPREME COURT. BUT I HAVE MADE NO JUDGMENT. IT IS JUST A GROUP OF SERIOUS SCHOLARS THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED FROM THIS POINT ON. WE WILL GIVE THEM 180 DAYS, GOD WILLING, IF I AM ELECTED, TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A RECOMMENDATION. LOOK, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, ALL PARENTS ARE TAUGHT THAT THE EXAMPLE YOU SET IMPACTS ON HOW YOUR KID REACTS. THE EXAMPLE YOU SET MATTERS TO THE REST OF THE COMPANY. THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT MATTER. THEY MATTER A GREAT DEAL. AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PUTS ON THESE SUPER SPREADER EVENTS, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS ANNOUNCED. ALL THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING HIS FAMILY, THANK GOD THEY SEEM TO BE OK. ALL PEOPLE CAME DOWN WITH COVID. , ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CAME DOWN WITH COVID. I'M JUST HOPING THAT HE CAN LEARN A LESSON. I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR CELEBRATING. THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE COULD BE DOING. BUT IT IS JUST NOT APPROPRIATE NOW. I HOPE HE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS ACT WITH SOME DISPATCH AND DO WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS. PEOPLE SHOULD BE TESTED FIRST BEFORE THEY EVEN SHOW UP. NUMBER TWO, THEY SHOULD BE WEARING MASKS. NUMBER THREE, THEY SHOULD BE SOCIALLY DISTANCED. NUMBER FOUR, IT SHOULD NOT BE A HUGE CROWD, WHETHER IT IS OUTSIDE OR NOT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE]	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477400-1/joe-biden-campaign-event-chester-pennsylvania	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unannounced campaign stop to an early polling location in Chester, Pennsylvania, a suburb southeast of Philadelphia. He was greeted there by Representative Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), and he talked to a group of volunteers supporting his campaign at the early polling location. Afterward, he delivered brief remarks, most of them focused on the Trump administration&rsquo;s response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He said White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadow&rsquo;s recent comments on the virus amounted to President Trump giving up on fighting the pandemic that had already claimed more than 220,000 lives in the U.S and more than 1 million worldwide.	477400-1	Speech

COMING UP WEDNESDAY MORNING WE WILL DISCUSS THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO WITH CLEVELAND.COM LEAD POLITICAL REPORTER SETH RICHARDSON. AND LAUREN COPELAND. WATCH C-SPAN'S WASHINGTON JOURNAL, LIVE AT 7:00 EASTERN, WEDNESDAY MORNING. BE SURE TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT MESSAGES AND TWEETS. NEXT, JOE BIDEN HOLDING A CAMPAIGN EVENT WITH VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS IN WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA. HOME OF FDR'S LITTLE WHITE HOUSE. HE TALKED ABOUT UNITY AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DURING THIS 25 MINUTE EVENT. (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. WHAT A MAGNIFICENT SETTING. IT'S HARD WHEN YOU DRIVE IN HERE NOT TO THINK OF CIRCUMSTANCES PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT FACED AND HOW HE OVERCAME SO MUCH FOR SO MANY. GOOD AFTERNOON. A FEW WEEKS AGO I SPOKE AT GETTYSBURG ABOUT THE NEED TO UNITE OUR NATION. TODAY, I'M HERE IN WARM SPRINGS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO HEAL OUR NATION. OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH PAIN AND SO MUCH SUFFERING, AND SO MUCH LOSS IN AMERICA. OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO A VIRUS. MANY OF THOSE LIVES LOST IN THE CRUELEST WAY POSSIBLE. ALONE. ALONE. ALONE IN A HOSPITAL ROOM. ALONE IN A NURSING HOME. NO FAMILY, NO FRIENDS, NO LOVED ONES BESIDE THEM IN THOSE FINAL MOMENTS. IT HAUNTS SO MANY OF THE SURVIVING FAMILIES. FAMILIES WHO ARE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. I, AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT LOSS FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE YOU LOVE. HE FEEL THAT DEEP BLACK HOLE OPENING UP IN YOUR CHEST. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING SWALLOWED INTO IT. THE TRAGIC TRUTH OF OUR TIME IS THAT COVID HAS LEFT A DEEP AND LASTING WOUND IN THIS COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS, AND WE SEE THE EMPTY STOREFRONTS IN THE SHUTTERED BUSINESSES. THE VISIBLE SIGNS OF LOST HOPES AND BROKEN DREAMS. BUT WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS ALL THOSE PARENTS STARING AT THE CEILING LATE AT NIGHT WONDERING, HOW AM I GOING TO PAY THE MORTGAGE? HOW AM I GOING TO PAY OUR RENT? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IF ONE OF MY KIDS GET SICK NOW THAT I'VE LOST MY HEALTH INSURANCE. GROWING UP, LIKE MANY OF YOU, I WATCHED MY FATHER STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK. HE MADE WHAT I CALLED THE LONGEST WALK ANY PARENT COULD MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO HIS CHILDREN'S BEDROOM TO TELL A CHILD YOU CANNOT PLAY ON THAT LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SAME SCHOOL. WE CAN'T STAY HERE, JOEY, WE CAN'T STAY IN SCRANTON ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO MOVE. THERE ARE GOOD JOBS IN DELAWARE. WHEN I GET ONE I WILL COME BACK FOR YOU, YOUR SISTER, YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR MOM. ONLY 157 MILES AWAY, JOEY. MY FATHER CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND FOR THAT YEAR, BUT HE ALWAYS SAID WHEN WE FINALLY GOT SETTLED IN DELAWARE, HE USED TO SAY, JOBS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. MY SISTER HEARD IT AS WELL, VALERIE. HE SAID, IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT, IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND RIGHT NOW, IN THIS AUTUMN AFTERNOON, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FEEL THEY HAVE LOST ALL THAT. A SEASON OF PROTEST HAS BROKEN OUT ALL ACROSS THE NATION. SOME OF IT IS SENSELESS BURNING, LOOTING AND VIOLENCE THAT CAN'T BE TOLERATED AND WON'T. BUT MUCH OF IT IS A CRY FOR JUSTICE. FROM A COMMUNITY THAT HAS LONG HAD A KNEE OF INJUSTICE ON THEIR NECK. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE. NOT FORGOTTEN BY ME, NOT BY US AND NOT BY THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO INSPIRE A NEW WAY OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. THESE ARE HISTORIC, PAINFUL CRISES. THE INSIDIOUS VIRUS, THE ECONOMIC ANGUISH, THE SYSTEMATIC DISSEMINATION. AND ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE ROCKED THE NATION, ANY ONE OF THEM, YET, WE HAVE BEEN HIT BY ALL THREE ONCE. THE PAIN IS STRIKING AT THE HEART OF ALL OF OUR COUNTRY AND GOES BACK NOT MONTHS, BUT YEARS. OUR POLITICS FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN MEAN, BITTER AND DIVISIVE. YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW IN THE DISTANCE. WE HAVE STOPPED SEEING DIGNITY AND ONE ANOTHER. WE STOPPED SHOWING ONE ANOTHER RESPECT. TOO MANY AMONG US SPEND MORE TIME SHOUTING THAN LISTENING. MORE TIME FIGHTING BEEN WORKING TOGETHER. MORE TIME DEMONIZING BEEN , MORE TIME DEMONIZING OTHERS AND LIFTING THEM UP. THE DIVISIONS IN OUR NATION ARE GETTING WIDER. ANGRY PEOPLE UPSET. ANGER AND SUSPICION ARE GROWING. OUR WOUNDS ARE GETTING DEEPER. MANY WONDER, HAS IT GONE TOO FAR? HAVE WE PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN? HAS THE HEART OF THIS NATION TURNED TO STONE? I DON'T THINK SO. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT. I KNOW THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW OUR PEOPLE. I KNOW WE CAN UNITE AND HEAL THIS NATION. WARM SPRINGS IS A GOOD PLACE TO TALK ABOUT HOPE AND HEALING. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT CAME TO USE THE ""THERAPEUTIC WATERS"" TO REBUILD HIMSELF. STRICKEN BY THE POLIO IN 1921, HE SUFFERED FROM PARALYSIS. LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICANS IN THOSE PRE-VACCINE DECADES, FDR LONGED TO LIVE AN INDEPENDENT LIFE. A LIFE THAT WAS NOT DEFINED BY HIS ILLNESS. TO HIM, AND TO SO MANY OTHERS FACING PHYSICAL CHALLENGES, WARM SPRINGS OFFERED THERAPY FOR THE BODY, AND I MIGHT ADD, AND THE SOUL. BUT IT OFFERED SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL. FDR CAME LOOKING FOR A CURE. BUT IT WAS THE LESSONS HE LEARNED HERE THAT HE USED TO LIFT A NATION. HUMILITY, EMPATHY, COURAGE, OPTIMISM. THIS PLACE REPRESENTED A WAY FORWARD. A WAY OF RESTORATION, RESILIENCE AND HEALING. AS YEARS HAVE FOLLOWED, FDR HAD COME BACK TO WARM SPRINGS OFTEN. THINK ABOUT HOW TO HEAL THE NATION AND THE WORLD. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID. LIFTING US OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. DEFEATING TYRANNY, SAVING DEMOCRACY. THEN IT WAS HERE, ON APRIL 12, 1945 THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DIED. A CASUALTY OF WAR AS SURELY AS ANY WHO FELL IN COMBAT. AND THE FREE WORLD MOURNED. AMERICAN LEADERS WEPT. MAYBE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, WAS REACTION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NAVAL CHIEF PETTY OFFICER GRAHAM JACKSON, A BLACK MAN, CRIED AS HE PLAYED HIS ACCORDION AND TRIBUTE TO FDR NOT FAR FROM HERE. AND THE STORY IS TOLD, THAT WHEN FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT FUNERAL WENT BY, A MAN COLLAPSED AND GRIEF. THE NEIGHBOR ASKED HIM, DID YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT? HIS RESPONSE WAS, NO, THE MAN SAID, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. FEW WORDS BETTER DESCRIBE THE KIND OF PRESIDENT OUR NATION NEEDS RIGHT NOW. A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT IN IT FOR HIMSELF, BUT FOR OTHERS. A PRESIDENT THAT DOES NOT DIVIDE US, BUT UNITES US. A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS NOT TO THE WORST IN US, BUT TO THE BEST. A PRESIDENT WHO CARES LESS ABOUT HIS TV RATINGS AND MORE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A PRESIDENT WHO LOOKS NOT TO SETTLE SCORES, BUT TO FIND SOLUTIONS. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING, BUT BY FACT. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT I HOPE TO BE. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS FOR THOSE WHO DO. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. A DUTY OF CARE FOR EVERYONE. THIS PLACE, WARM SPRINGS, IS A REMINDER THAT THOUGH BROKEN, EACH OF US CAN BE HEALED. THAT AS A PEOPLE AND A COUNTRY, WE CAN OVERCOME THIS DEVASTATING VIRUS. THAT WE CAN HEAL A SUFFERING WORLD. AND YES, WE CAN RESTORE OUR SOUL AND SAVE OUR COUNTRY. THESE LAST HOURS, PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WAS AT WORK ON A SPEECH THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY. HE WAS TO SAY QUOTE, TODAY, WE MUST CULTIVATE THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS, THE ABILITY OF ALL PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS TO LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER IN THE SAME WORLD AT PEACE. TO LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW I SEE AMERICA. THAT IS HOW I SEE THE PRESIDENCY. THAT IS HOW I SEE THE FUTURE. I TELL YOU THIS FROM MY HEART. I BELIEVE AMERICA , I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN HOPE, NOT FEAR. UNITY, NOT DIVISION. LOVE, NOT HATE. THE PRESIDENCY THOUGH IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE AMERICAN COURSE. HISTORY IS NOT ONLY A STORY OF THE GREAT AND FAMOUS. OUR HISTORY IS A STORY OF WE THE PEOPLE. OF ALL OF US TOGETHER. I HAVE LONG SAID THE STORY OF AMERICA IS A STORY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. CHANGING OUR COUNTRY , CHANGE IN OUR COUNTRY COMES WHEN THE VOICES OF THE POWERLESS REACH THE YEARS OF THE POWERFUL. WHEN THOSE WHOSE NAMES WE WILL NEVER KNOW RISK THEIR LIVES IN THE WORDS OF DR. KING, THEN THE ARK OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE TOWARD , BEND THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE FOR JUSTICE. BENDING THAT ARC IS THE WORK TOWARD TIME. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US. RED STATES, BLUE STATES, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS. I BELIEVE IN THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART WE CAN DO IT. PEOPLE ASK ME, WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT, JOE? BECAUSE WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CANNOT DO. THE NEWS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT'S DEATH WENT OUT ON THE WIRES. AN EDITOR IN CHICAGO TRYING TO HIS COLLEAGUE AND SAID, CLEAR THE DECKS FOR ACTION. I SAY TO YOU TODAY, IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, CLEAR THE DECKS FOR ACTION FOR WE WILL ACT. WE WILL ACT ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY PRESIDENCY TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. WE WILL ACT TO PASS AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL FINALLY REWARD WORK, NOT WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL ACT TO PASS MY HEALTH CARE PLAN TO PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN AND DRUG PRICES THAT ARE GENETICALLY LOWER. WE WILL ACT TO PASS THE BITING CLIMATE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAY, HIGH-PAYING LABOR JOBS. WE WILL ACT TO ADDRESS , WE WILL ACT TO GIVE WORKING PEOPLE A SHOT AGAIN. WE WILL ACT TO RESTORE OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRACY AND OUR FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER. TODAY, WE ARE FACING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS. WITH WINTER AT HAND, IT IS GETTING WORSE. JUST LAST FRIDAY, 83,000 NEW CASES IN ONE DAY. SATURDAY, ANOTHER 83,000 CASES. NEARLY 1000 PEOPLE A DAY ARE DYING. ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. AND THE PRESIDENT KEEPS TELLING US NOT TO WORRY. HE KEEPS TELLING US WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER. HE SAYS , IT IS AS REMOVED FROM REALITY AND AS REMOVED FROM REALITY AND IS OFFENSIVE WHEN HE TOLD US THE VIRUS AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY, JUST THE ELDERLY WITH HEART CONDITIONS. VIRTUALLY NOBODY. JUST THE ELDERLY WITH HEART CONDITIONS. AS IF THEY DO NOT MATTER. WHAT HE SAID IN RESPONSE TO THE NUMBER OF DEATHS REACHING 1000, HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. IN THE SPRING, THE PRESIDENT DECLARED IN HIS VOICE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HE WAS GOING TO WAGE WAR ON THE VIRUS. INSTEAD, HE SHRUGGED, HE SWAGGERED AND HE SURRENDERED. HIS CHIEF OF STAFF LAST WEEK MADE A STUNNING ADMISSION. AN ADMISSION THAT I BELIEVE BUT NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD SAY SAYING QUOTE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC, END OF QUOTE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. IT IS A CAPITULATION. IT IS THE WAIVING OF A WHITE FLAG. IT IS A WINDOW INTO THE SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT THIS WHITE HOUSE, THAT THEY HAVE NEVER REALLY TRIED. THINK ABOUT ALL THE FRONTLINE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE REST AND SOME GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF THIS PANDEMIC. THINK ABOUT ALL THE FIRST RESPONDERS. THINK ABOUT ALL THE GROCERY STORE CLERKS, THE DRIVERS, THE DELIVERY DRIVERS OF TRUCKS. TEACHERS, PARENTS AND THE KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE VIRUS. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE DIED. THEY WERE GIVING THEIR ALL WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVING UP. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WE CAN AND WE WILL CONTROL THIS VIRUS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NEVER WAIVE THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. JUST IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE TODAY IF THE PRESIDENT HAD EMBRACED WEARING MASKS INSTEAD OF MOCKING IT. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE TODAY IF THE PRESIDENT HAD PRACTICED SOCIAL DISTANCING INSTEAD OF HOLDING SUPER-SPREADER FEARS VENCE SUPER-SPREADER FEARS VENCE. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE IF THERE WAS A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF TESTING AND TRACING. I FIRST PUT FORWARD A DETAILED PLAN ON HOW TO DEAL WITH HIS VIRUS BACK IN MARCH. THIS ADMINISTRATION IGNORED IT. I RELEASED SEVERAL MORE DETAILED PLANS IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED. THE MOST RECENT JUST LAST WAKE. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS YET TO OFFER A SINGLE PLAN. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL JOURNALS IN THE WORLD, THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE CALLED THE PRESIDENT, DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT AND WENT ON TO SAY THE PRESIDENT TURNED A CRISIS INTO A TRAGEDY. I AM READY TO ACT. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. STARTING ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, WE WILL DO IT. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR IN THESE CLOSING DAYS ABOUT WHAT I MEAN AND ABOUT WHAT I INTEND TO DO IN THAT BATTLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR BETTER ANGELS PREVAIL OVER OUR WORST INSTINCTS. I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THE NATION, WHAT WE BELIEVE AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHO WE WANT TO BE. IT IS ABOUT OUR ESSENCE. IT IS ABOUT WHAT MAKES US AMERICANS. IT IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL. TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE SEEN CHARLATANS, THE CONMEN, THE PHONY POPULISTS WHO SOUGHT TO PLAY ON OUR FEARS, APPEAL TO OUR WORST APPETITES AND PICK AT THE OLDEST SCABS WE HAVE FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN. THEY APPEAR WHEN THE NATION HAS BEEN HIT THE HARDEST AND WE ARE AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. NEVER TO SOLVE ANYTHING BUT ONLY TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES. POPE FRANCIS WARNS US AGAINST THIS PHONY POPULISM THAT APPEALS TO QUOTE, THE MOST SELFISH INSTINCTS. HE GOES ON TO SAY POLITICS IS SOMETHING MORE NOBLE THAN POSTURING, MARKETING AND MEDIA SPIN. THESE SEW NOTHING BUT DIVISION, CONFLICT AND CYNICISM. HE SAYS FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO LEAD, WE WOULD DO WELL TO ASK OURSELVES, WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY? WHAT IS MY REAL AIM? POPE FRANCIS ASKED THE QUESTION THAT ANYONE WHO SEEKS TO LEAD THIS NATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER. MY ANSWER IS THIS. I RUN TO UNITE THIS NATION AND TO HEAL THIS NATION. I HAVE SAID THAT FROM THE BEGINNING AS BADLY NECESSARY. THE BIBLE TELLS US THERE IS A TIME TO BREAK DOWN AND A TIME TO BUILD UP. A TIME TO HEAL. THIS IS THAT TIME. GOD IN HISTORY HAVE CALLED US TO THIS MOMENT AND TO THIS MISSION WITH OUR VOICES AND OUR VOTES. WE MUST FREE OURSELVES FROM THE FORCES OF DARKNESS, FROM THE FORCES OF DIVISION, AND THE FORCES OF YESTERDAY. THE FORCES THAT PULL US APART, HOLD US DOWN AND HOLD US BACK. IF WE DO SO, WE WILL ONCE MORE BECOME ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE. A NATION UNITED. A NATION STRENGTHENED. A NATION HEALED. THAT IS MY GOAL. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST DO. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. STAY SAFE AND WEAR YOUR MASK.

CSPANJB28102020127	Joe Biden	2020-10-28	Joe Biden Remarks on the Coronavirus Pandemic	"YOU ARE WATCHING C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT, CREATED BY AMERICA'S CABLE TELEVISION COMPANIES AS A PUBLIC SERVICE AND BROUGHT TO YOU TODAY BY WE LOOKED AT THE LATEST REPORTED DATA HOW WE ARE ON AN UPWARD SLOPE OF A BIGGER WAVE OF CONFIRMED INFECTIONS THAN ANYTHING WE EXPERIENCED TO DATE. WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS WOULD BE NEEDED TO TURN THIS AROUND AND HOW WE MADE WORSE BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECLARATION OF SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS. WE DISCUSSED THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF WEARING MASKS, PROTECTING YOURSELF, PROTECTING YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TO SAVE AROUND 100,000 LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD BETWEEN NOW AND JUST AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL. IT IS PATRIOTIC. WEARING A MASK P, WHERE ONE,ERIOD. WE FOCUSED ON THE WEIGHT THIS VIRUS IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, PARTICULAR BLACK, LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. WE ARE SEEING RACE-BASED DISPARITIES ACROSS THE ASPECT OF THIS VIRUS, HIGHER INFECTION RATES LOWER ACCESS TO TESTING AND HARDER TIME QUARANTINING SAFELY BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. LOWER ACCESS TO QUALITY TREATMENT WHEN THEY ARE INFECTED AND TRAGICALLY, HIGHER MORTALITY RATES. ONE IN 1000 BLACK AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM THIS VIRUS. THIS IS A STAGGERING STATISTIC AND 57% OF BLACK ADULTS, 46% OF LATINO ADULTS KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED OR BEEN HOSPITALIZED BY THIS DISEASE. FOLKS, WE HAVE LOST MORE THAN 220,000 LIVES IN THIS VIRUS ALREADY. BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN UP. OVER THE WEEKEND, THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS WENT ON TELEVISION AND ADMITTED THAT THEY WAVE THE WHITE FLAG AND DECLARED SURRENDER. HE SAID, "" WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC."" THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN OMAHA AFTER THE TRUMP RALLY ENDED. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING OLD AMERICANS AND CHILDREN WERE STRANDED IN SUBZERO FREEZING TEMPERATURES FOR HOURS. SEVERAL FOLKS ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL. IT'S AN IMAGE THAT CAPTURED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WHOLE APPROACH THIS CRISIS. HE TAKES A LOT OF BIG PRONOUNCEMENTS, HE MAKES A LOT OF BIG PRONOUNCEMENTS BUT THEY DON'T HOLD UP. HE GETS HIS PHOTO OP AND THEN GETS OUT. HE LEAVES EVERYONE ELSE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS FAILURE TO MAKE A RESPONSIBLE PLAN. IT SEEMS LIKE HE JUST DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THEM. THE LONGER HE IS IN CHARGE, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S TIME TO CHANGE. MEANWHILE YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE OFFICE AND THIS STUNNED ME, PUT OUT A STATEMENT ENDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A TOP ACCOMPLISHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. A TOP ACCOMPLISHMENT OF TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN INFECTION RATES ARE GOING UP IN EVERY STATE IN OUR UNION. REFUSAL OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY WE ARE LIVING THROUGH AT A TIME WHEN ALMOST 1000 AMERICANS PER DAY ARE DYING, EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S AN INSULT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON SUFFERING FROM COVID-19 AND EVERY FAMILY WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE. THERE IS NOTHING MORE PERSONAL TO AMERICAN FAMILIES THAN THEIR HEALTH CARE AND THE HEALTH CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. I KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR HEART RIPPED OUT, LOSING A LOVED ONE TOO SOON, TO SIT IN A HOSPITAL BEDSIDE AND FEEL THERE IS A BLACK HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CHEST HIM IS NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO. I AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO WATCH A BELOVED PERSON DIE, LIE THERE DYING OF CANCER OR SOME OTHER DISEASE WITHOUT WONDERING , HAVING TO WONDER WHETHER YOU CAN PAY FOR THE MEDICAL BILLS OR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF GOD FOR BID, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO SAY WE WILL NOT COVER THE TREATMENT. AND YET TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON A SINGLE-MINDED CRUSADE TO STRIP AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTH CARE. THAT WOULD ONLY CREATE ANOTHER ENORMOUS CRISIS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IN TWO SHORT WEEKS, EXACTLY ONE WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE ITS CASE ASKING THE SUPREME COURT TO STRIKE DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT "" IN ITS ENTIRETY."" LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THEIR ARGUMENT THAT THE ENTIRE LAW MUST FALL WHICH WOULD STRIP 20 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTH CARE OVERNIGHT, RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN UPSWING IN A PUBLIC PANDEMIC, THE UPSWING. LOOK, JUST THIS WEEK ON 60 MINUTES, WE HEARD WHAT TRUMP TOLD LESLEY STAHL ABOUT THE UPCOMING SUPREME COURT CASE ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND I QUOTE , I HOPE THAT THEY END IT. IT WILL BE SO GOOD IF THE END IT. END OF QUOTE. THERE IS NO QUESTION, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP NOMINATED JUSTICE BARRETT TO THE COURT. THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICANS JAMMED HER THROUGH, THE CONFIRMATION IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION. REPUBLICANS TRIED AND TRIED SINCE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED TO OVERTURN IT AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY FAILED. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED EVERYTHING HE CAN ON HIS OWN TO SABOTAGE THE LAW. SO NOW, TO WHAT I CHARACTERIZE AS A BLATANT ABUSE OF POLITICAL POWER, THEY HAVE ADDED TO THE COURT A JUSTICE WHO CRITICIZED CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS'PREVIOUS DECISION TO UPHOLD THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN HOPES THEY CAN DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ONCE AND FOR ALL THROUGH THE COURTS NO MATTER HOW MANY AMERICANS THEY HURT IN THE PROCESS. LET'S REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THE SELECTION. IF YOU HAVE DIABETES, ASTHMA, CANCER OR EVEN COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19, YOU WILL LOSE THE PROTECTION THIS LAW PROVIDES. INSURERS WILL ONCE MORE BE ABLE TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY YOUR COVERAGE. WOMEN COULD AGAIN BE CHARGE MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. AND CHILDREN WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE POLICIES UNTIL AGE 26. ON TOP OF ALL THAT, OVERTURNING THE ACA COULD MEAN THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO GET COVID-19 VACCINES ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE. THAT'S RIGHT. THE LAW THAT SAYS INSURERS REQUIRE TO COVER THE VACCINE FOR FREE IS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HE'S ATTEMPTING TO STRIKE THAT DOWN. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE, IT'S A RIGHT THAT EVERYONE HAVE ACCESS TO. THIS COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE VIRUS, ATTACKED DOCTORS. I CAN'T GET OVER THIS GUY. HE ATTACKED DOCTORS CLAIMING THEY ARE OVERREPORTING COVID CASES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY. DOCTORS ARE OVERREPORTING CASES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY. YOU KNOW, OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES AND OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT ENORMOUS RISK EVERY DAY. MORE THAN 1000 OF THEM HAVE ALREADY DIED. IN AN ATTEMPT TO BEAT BACK THIS PANDEMIC AND SAVE LIVES. THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THEIR PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD RATHER SPEND HIS TIME DESPERATELY TRYING TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE THEN EVEN ONCE BOTHER TO PUT FORWARD A HEALTH CARE PLAN ON HIS OWN. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TURN THIS AROUND BY VOTING. IF SINCE , WE HAVE SIX MORE DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE IT IN THEIR HANDS TO PUT THIS COUNTRY IN A VASTLY DIFFERENT PATH. THIS IS MY COMMITMENT TO YOU , I WILL PROTECT AND BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. YOU CAN MAKE IT STRONGER, I WILL MAKE IT STRONGER WITH YOUR HELP TO LOWER PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. WE WILL BRING DOWN DRUG PRICES TO ALMOST 2/3 OF WHAT THEY ARE BY ALLOWING MEDICARE THAN TO NEGOTIATE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WERE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, MAKING THE PRICE LOWER WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE, MEDICARE SAYS WE WILL ONLY PAY YOU X AMOUNT FOR THE FOLLOWING MEDICINES. THAT WILL LOWER PRICES DRASTICALLY, MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.WE WILL MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS TO FREE COVID-19 VACCINES. THIS IS NOT BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. IF WE COME TOGETHER, WE CAN STAND TOGETHER. IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS A UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, WE CAN TRANSCEND OLD DIVISIONS AND SHOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, AS I SAID YESTERDAY IN WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA, I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT IN IT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR OTHERS A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T DIVIDE US BUT UNITES US, A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS NOT TO THE WORST IN US BUT THE BEST IN US. A PRESIDENT WHO LOOKS NOT TO SETTLE SCORES BUT TO FIND SOLUTIONS. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING BUT BY SCIENCE, REASON AND FACTS. EVEN IF I WIN, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK TO END THIS PANDEMIC. I'M NOT RUNNING ON THE FALSE PROMISE OF BEING ABLE TO END THE PANDEMIC BY SWITCHING , A BEING ABLE TO END THE PANDEMIC BY FLIPPING A SWITCH BUT WHAT I CAN PROMISE YOU IS WE WILL START ON DAY ONE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS. WE WILL LET SCIENCE DRIVE OUR DECISIONS. WE WILL DEAL HONESTLY WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER QUIT. THAT'S HOW WE WILL SHUT DOWN IS VIRUS SO WE CAN GET BACK TO OUR LIVES A LOT MORE QUICKLY THAN THE PACE WE ARE GOING AT NOW. I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO PROTECT YOUR HEALTH CARE, I PROMISE YOU, JUST LIKE I FIGHT FOR MY OWN FAMILY. WE CAN DO THIS, I PROMISE YOU. I'M GOING TO GO DO WHAT I HOPE ALL OF YOU DO, I'M GOING TO WALK OUT OF THIS TILTING AND I'M GOING TO GO VOTE. I'M GOING TO GO VOTE. THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT, NOT JUST ME BUT THE DOWN BALLOT AS WELL. THEY WILL CHANGE THINGS FOR US AND MAKE IT BETTER. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE INSURE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR , ENSURE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. I KNOW THIS COMMUNITY. AND I WILL SAY THIS REAL SLOW. I KNOW WE NEED TO JOE BIDEN. ANYBODY WITH ME? WE NEED JOE BIDEN. RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT'S TO ADDRESS US HAS LEFT US IN A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS. I LOST A VERY DEAR COUSIN TO THIS PANDEMIC. I CAN'T SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN WHEN I WANT TO. I HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH MY 94-YEAR-OLD MOTHER. BUT WE KNOW MORE THAN 220 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. AND IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. AFTER THE ELECTION, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ANY LONGER. JOE BIDEN HAS THE PLAN TO BEAT CORONAVIRUS. AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER. LIFTING UP ALL COMMUNITIES. JOE IS THE GUY. ARE YOU WITH ME? JOE IS THE GUY THAT GOT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED. I REMEMBERED BEFORE THE ACA, THERE WERE CONSTITUENTS THAT COULD NOT GET INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. JOE CHANGED THAT. HE DELIVERED. IF HE GETS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO LOWER COST AND EXPAND COVERAGE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED? EVERYBODY AGREE WITH ME? THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. COME ON, TAMPA, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. I MET JOE AND HE HAS THAT HUMANS TOUCH. , HUMAN TOUCH. IT IS A BLESSING. HE KNOWS WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH. HE CAN FEEL, YOU CAN FEEL EMPATHY BECAUSE HE HAS CHARACTER. SO VOTE EARLY, TAMPA. DON'T WAIT. WE CAN CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY ON EVERY ISSUE THAT MATTERS TO US. BUT ONLY IF WE VOTE. MAKE A PLAN, BRING A FAMILY, BRING YOUR FRIENDS. BECAUSE IT'S ALL ON OUR LINE. TAMPA, FLORIDA, IT IS AN HONOR. AND I AM JUST SO EXCITED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A MAN WHO WILL BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. AND RESTORE THE SOUL. I WILL SAY THAT AGAIN. RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. LET'S GIVE HIM A TAMPA WELCOME. (music) HOLY MACKEREL. HELLO, TAMPA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE YOU ARE SO FAR AWAY, YOU MIGHT BE IN DELAWARE. GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL. THANKS FOR SO MANY OF YOU BEING HERE. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, GOD LOVE Y'ALL. CHLOE, THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. AND FOR ALL THAT YOU DO. A PERSON CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR COMMUNITY, BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN YOU NAME THAT HAVE DONE MORE FOR THE CITY AND ITS PEOPLE THEN CHLOE? TURNING ABANDONED BUILDINGS AND DANGEROUS LOTS AND REPLACING THEM WITH LIFE AND HOPE. MAKING SURE TO BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO BUILD HOMES FOR LOCAL FAMILIES, HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND TAMPA. INSTILL PRIDE, PURPOSE, AND NEIGHBORHOODS. IN LAYING THE GROUNDWORK, THAT IS THE WORK THAT CHANGES THE WORLD. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE OTHER SPEAKERS HERE TONIGHT INCLUDING A REMARKABLE MAYOR. THANKS FOR THE PASSPORT INTO TOWN. I APPRECIATE IT. AND MY FRIENDS, CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE CRIST. THANK YOU, PAL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND KATHY CASTOR. HER DISTRICT. I SOUGHT PERMISSION TO COME AND SHE SAID OK. AND NOW COHEN WHO WE HAVE TO SEND TO CONGRESS. I JUST SPENT TIME WITH ONE OF MY BEST BUDDIES, A GUY I SERVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME IN THE U.S. SENATE, BILL NELSON. I HAVEN'T SERVED WITH ANYONE WITH MORE CHARACTER,. , AND DECENCY THAN BILL , CHARACTER, COURAGE, AND DECENCY THAN BILL. HIS WIFE IS SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T SHE? FIVE DAYS LEFT. FIVE DAYS. BUT WHO'S COUNTING, RIGHT? WHO'S COUNTING? SCRANTON? I HAVE A SCRANTON SIGN HERE. I'M GETTING CONFUSED HERE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE VOTED. 75 MILLION. AND MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE WHEN THIS IS OVER. I BELIEVE WHEN YOU USE YOUR POWER, THE POWER OF THE VOTE, WE LITERALLY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. AND FOR FOLKS AT HOME AND ABROAD. HERE IN FLORIDA, YOU ARE THE ONES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. CEO'S AND WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. YOU DID. I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HARD-WORKING FOLKS. , MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE DID, HARD WORKING FOLKS. AND YOU ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY. I SET I GOT INTO THE RACE FOR THREE REASONS A YEAR AGO. LITTLE OVER A YEAR. I MEANT IT. THE FIRST WAS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE MORE DECENT, HONORABLE, MORE RESPECTFUL. WE ARE BETTER PEOPLE. THE SECOND REASON WAS TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS. TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG THIS TIME. AND THIRDLY, TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE US. THESE FINAL DAYS. KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT WITH YOU AND THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM. WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE CAN OVERCOME. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAT I AM TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE WILL NEVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, GIVEN THE CHANCE. ON NOVEMBER 3, WE WILL UNITE THE COUNTRY AND SHOW THE WORLD WHO AMERICA REALLY IS. I MEAN IT. I KNOW IT'S HARD. OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS, THERE HAVE BEEN SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING. SO MUCH LOSS IN AMERICA. THE 225,000 PEOPLE DEAD. 225,000. ESTIMATES ARE IF WE HAD REACTED RESPONSIBLY, THERE WOULD BE 160,000 FEWER DEAD. BECAUSE OF COVID-19, WE ARE PAST THE 9 MILLION MARK OF PEOPLE INFECTED. MORE THAN 16,000 PEOPLE IN FLORIDA HAVE BEEN LOST. AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND ON THE EDGE. IT'S A FREIGHT TRAIN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF HE STAYS IN OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP WAS GIVING UP OVER THE WEEKEND. I'M QUOTING. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. IT IS OBVIOUS HE'S NOT. AT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK, TRUMP SAID THAT WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER. IT IS GOING AWAY. WE ARE GOING TO LIVE WITH IT. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD HIM. HE'S ASKING US TO DIE WITH IT. THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. DONALD TRUMP HAS WAIVED THE WHITE FLAG, ABANDONED FAMILIES, AND SURRENDERED TO THE VIRUS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER GIVE IN, AND WE DON'T COWER. DONALD TRUMP JUST HAD A SUPER SPREADER EVENT AGAIN. HE'S SPREADING MORE THAN JUST CORONAVIRUS. HE IS SPREADING DIVISION AND DISCORD. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL BRING US TOGETHER, NOT PULL US APART. I WILL PUT A PLAN IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER TESTING, TRACING, MASKING. DOCTORS IN AMERICA, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT'S OWN CDC DIRECTOR AND DR. FAUCI WHO SAID THAT IF WE JUST WORE A MASK BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES. FOLKS, THAT IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY, FOR GOD 'S SAKE. BUT STILL, DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO LISTEN TO SCIENCE. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE POLITICIZING THE RACE FOR A VACCINE. WE SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR ITS SAFE USE AND FREE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION, PROVIDING PPE FOR NATIONAL STANDARDS AND BUSINESSES UP AND SAFETY , OPEN SAFELY. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY. I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY FROM BARACK AND ME. JUST LIKE HE INHERITED EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE. IT'S A FACT. HE SQUANDERED THAT A QUANT TO ME , HE SQUANDERED THAT ECONOMY LIKE HE SQUANDERED EVERYTHING ELSE. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU. I GUARANTEE YOU. WE CAN BUILD BACK. AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT WEALTH. AND WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES A SINGLE SOLITARY PENNY FOR WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT NO ONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 WILL PAY A SINGLE PENNY MORE IN TAXES. NOT ONE PENNY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR IT. I WILL ASK THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT DID NOT PAY A SINGLE PENNY AND FEDERAL TAXES. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. WHY SHOULD A FIREFIGHTER, AND EDUCATOR, A NURSE PAY A HIGHER RATE THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY CORPORATE AMERICA? BECAUSE YOU DO. YOU DO. WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THAN DONALD TRUMP PAYS? YOU KNOW, IF WE MADE THIS AS A MOVIE 10 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WOULD THINK WE ARE MAKING IT UP. BUT IT'S TRUE. WE WILL BOOK , DELIVER TO ACTUALLY FOR THE WORKING CLASS. HELP YOU PAY HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. FOR CHILD CARE. FOR ELIMINATING COLLEGE DEBT. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS. AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. TRUMP GOT HIS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND HE DID IT FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON. SOMETHING HE'S BEEN TRYING TO DISTANCE THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED. TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE'S GOING AT IT AGAIN. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CANCER, ALL DISEASES THAT ARE OUT THERE. FOLKS, LOOK. 8.4 MILLION FLORIDIANS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. OBLIGATIONS OF COVID-19 WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS. A LOT OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT BUT BEFORE WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INSURANCE CHARGED WOMEN MORE FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE AS MEN JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. A FACT. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS YOUR RIGHT. WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMA CARE, WE WILL STRENGTHEN AND BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE IT. AND YOU CAN CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION IF YOU DON'T. DEDUCTIBLES, PREMIUMS, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, REDUCING UNKNOWN BILLING. REDUCING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY UP TO 60% BY ALLOWING , NOT MAKING THIS STUFF UP , ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, THE GUY WHO RUNS IT, THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023. AS MY WIFE WOULD SAY, GOOGLE IT. YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, PAL. HE SAID TRUMP IS BANKRUPT. HE PROBABLY IS, HE OWES $400 BILLION TO SOMEBODY. , $400 MILLION TO SOMEBODY. WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR MILITARY FAMILIES. OF ALL THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IT, NOTHING HAS , SAID, NOTHING HAS BOTHERED ME WORSE THAN THE WAY HE HAS SPOKEN TO THOSE THAT SERVED IN UNIFORM. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY DECEASED SON, BEAU BIDEN WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE SERVICE MEDAL AND OTHER AWARDS, VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. GAVE UP HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL JOB TO GO. HE WASN'T A SUCKER OR LOSER. HE WAS A PATRIOT LIKE ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE. LIKE YOUR SONS, YOUR DAUGHTERS. YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS. WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THEIR DIGNITY. THE RESPECT THEY ARE DUE. WHILE DONALD TRUMP FAILS TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY, WE CAN DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE WHILE HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT WORSE. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE SYSTEMIC RACISM IS A PROBLEM. HE WON'T SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER. WE KNOW THEY MATTER. THAT'S WHY PROTEST HAS BROKEN OUT ACROSS THE NATION. BY THE WAY, PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING. VIOLENCE MUST NEVER BE A TACTIC TOLERATED. AND IT WON'T. BUT THESE PROTESTERS HAVE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR AND JACOB BLAKE WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN. NOT BY ME, NOT BY US, NOT BY THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I MET WITH A FAMILY, THE LITTLE DAUGHTER LOOKED AT ME. SHE IS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD. I KNELT DOWN TO TALK TO HER IN 00, AND THE FAMILY. SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MY DADDY IS CHANGING THE WORLD. GUESS WHAT? INSPIRATION COMING FROM HER DADDY WOULD HAPPEN. THERE'S A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. TRUE JUSTICE IS MORE THAN JUST DEALING WITH ABUSE. IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE. IT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS, HOUSING, ACCESS TO CAPITAL. GOOD PAYING JOBS. A MINIMUM WAGE OF $15 AN HOUR. FINANCIAL STABILITY, GIVING FAMILIES OF COLOR A REAL SHOT. THE OWNER WHO WILL START A SMALL BUSINESS AND SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE DEBT FREE SO THAT THEY CAN PASS ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR GENERATIONS LIKE WE DID. LIKE SO MANY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES HAVE IN THE PAST. BUT WE HAVE TO VOTE TO ENSURE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO VOTE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CRISIS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN FLORIDA, IT IS A CRISIS. WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACT MORE THAN MOST. DEVASTATING HURRICANES THAT LAY WASTE TO ALL COMMUNITIES. THE ECONOMIC TOLL IS ASTOUNDING AND IT GROWS EVERY YEAR. BUT THE HUMANS WHOLE IS WORSE. LOST LIVES, LOST HOMES, SMALL BUSINESS IS SHATTERED, FIRST RESPONDERS PUT AT RISK. THE WEST COAST BURNING. THE MIDDLE PART OF THE COUNTRY FLOODING. DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE, HE SAYS HOAX. SPEAKING OF HOAXES, REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE INCREASING VIOLENT HURRICANES AND THE FREQUENCY? HE SAID, MAYBE WE SHOULD DETONATE A NUCLEAR BOMB OVER THE ATLANTIC. BY THE WAY, THE SAME STABLE GENIUS THAT SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAD IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR IS WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH AIRPORTS. WHOA. YO, MAN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. HIS ANSWERS TO FAMILIES IN PUERTO RICO STRUGGLING THROUGH HURRICANE MARIA, WHAT DID HE DO? TOSS ROLLS OF PAPER TOWELS AT THEM. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL ANSWERS. WE KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS JOBS. WE CAN BUILD A STRONGER AND MORE CLIMATE RESISTANT NATION, CREATING MILLIONS OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE CAN CHANGE THE PATH WE ARE ON. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW. TIME IS RUNNING OUT IN THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD FORMER YEARS OF TRUMP WHO THINKS HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR HIM. I DON'T SEE THE PRESIDENCY THAT WAY. I RUN AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. IT IS STARTING TO RAIN SO I WILL SHORTEN THIS FOR YOU. I DON'T SEE AMERICA THAT WAY. YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN BARACK AND ME IN 2012 AND 2008. EACH DAY WE WERE IN OFFICE, WE WORKED FOR YOU AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT RED STATES OR BLUE STATES, ONLY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WAS REMINDED THAT LAST MONTH WHEN I VISITED GETTYSBURG. WHEN I WENT TO GETTYSBURG TO MAKE THAT SPEECH, ABRAHAM LEE , LINCOLN SAID A HOUSE DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. A NATION DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. I WAS REMINDED OF THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK. RETURN YOUR BALLOT TODAY. PRESIDENT KENNY SAID WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. LET'S NOT POSTPONE AND GET OUT OF THE RAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, THANK YOU. (music) GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE ROAD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD NOW.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477499-1/joe-biden-drive-campaign-rally-tampa	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks at a &ldquo;drive-in&rdquo; campaign rally in Tampa.

CSPANJB30102020134	Joe Biden	2020-10-30	Joe Biden Campaign Event in St. Paul, Minnesota	"I THINK GERRYMANDERING IS SOMETHING BOTH PARTIES HAVE ENGAGED IN. WHILE I AGREE IT CAN AND DOES WORK AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INTENTIONS, IT IS NOT UNIQUELY IN THE PROVINCE OF REPUBLICANS. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IT AS WELL, MOST NOTABLY IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. PENNSYLVANIA HAS BEEN DEALING WITH IT , I AM SO HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. THIS FEELS LIKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT DAY. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A HEALTH CRISIS AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY THIS PANDEMIC AND IT FEELS SO PERSONAL. IT IS YOUR HEALTH, YOUR JOBS, THE BUSINESSES YOU BUILT, YOUR KIDS EDUCATION. WE ARE SEEING A SPIKE IN CASES HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST. 2400 LIVES LOST IN MINNESOTA. AND COVID IS NOT THE GREAT EQUALIZER. YOU KNOW IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS OUR ELDERS, PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A SAFE WAYS TO LIVE, PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING IN LIFE. AND THERE IS NO QUESTION TRUMP'S RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A DISASTER. [HONKING] THAT HAS HURT US. THAT HAS HURT OUR FAMILIES. TRUMP AND MY OPPONENT SAID THIS PANDEMIC WOULD JUST GO AWAY. CASES CONTINUE TO RISE. THEY MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE WHO WEAR MASKS, BUT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DIE. TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL, ALL SUMMER AND FALL FAILED TO PUT TOGETHER ANY KIND OF STRATEGY TO HELP MINNESOTANS AFFECTED BY THIS VIRUS. I'M THINKING ABOUT THE IDLED WORKER AT THE MINE IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA WAITING FOR THAT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO BE RENEWED. I'M THINKING ABOUT THE MOM TRYING TO WORK AND MAKE SURE HER DAUGHTER IS GETTING THE EDUCATION SHE NEEDS REMOTELY. MEANWHILE, MY OPPONENT IS SUING GOVERNOR WALZ FOR DOING THE THINGS HE NEEDS TO DO TO KEEP US ALL SAFE. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT IN THIS MOMENT, IS IT MINNESOTA? [HONKING] IT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT. WHAT WE WANT IN THIS MOMENT IS STRONG, EMPATHETIC LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP THAT LIFTS UP THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE. THAT IS WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT IS WRONG IN OUR COUNTRY, IT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE IT RIGHT. THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON BUILDING FORWARD. LET'S GET THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. WE CAN DO THAT. WE CAN DO THAT. [HONKING] THIS IS NOT JUST GOING TO GO AWAY. WE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THIS. THEN, LET'S BUILD FORWARD WITH EVAN OR AND PEGGY FLANAGAN, WITH ME AND AMY KLOBUCHAR IN THE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [HONKING] WITH JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS, PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO GET RESULTS. AND WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND LET'S START WITH REBUILDING A SUPPLY CHAIN WITH MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. [HONKING] LET'S SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND LET'S START WITH THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. [HONKING] LET'S ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT IS HOLDING TOO MANY PEOPLE BACK. WE CAN DO THAT WITH JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. [HONKING] THIS IS A CHOICE, MINNESOTA. LET US CHOOSE LEADERSHIP ROOTED IN STRENGTH AND DECENCY AND OPTIMISM. LET'S CHOOSE LEADERSHIP FOCUSED ON GETTING RESULTS. LET'S CHOOSE LEADERSHIP THAT BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN US. AS PAUL WELLSTONE SAID, FULFILLING THE PROMISE WE ALL DO BETTER WHEN WE ALL DO BETTER. [HONKING] MINNESOTANS, THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICAL PARTIES. THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN OR NONE OF THE ABOVE. THIS IS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS ELECTION IS OVER AND FOR DAYS AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE, THE PEOPLE, WILL WIN. [HONKING] 1,970,000 MINNESOTANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. [HONKING] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE ARE HELL-BENT TO WIN HERE IN MINNESOTA. [HONKING] HERE IS THE THING, MINNESOTA, AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT , JUST YESTERDAY, A FEDERAL COURT THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION RULE WE HAD BEEN COUNTING ON IN MINNESOTA. SO IT IS SO IMPORTANT, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY VOTED AND YOU HAVE A MAIL-IN BALLOT, YOU MUST NOT PUT THAT BALLOT IN THE MAIL. YOU MUST HAND-DELIVER THAT BALLOT SO YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOTE WILL BE COUNTED AND HEARD. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. [HONKING] WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST VOTER PARTICIPATION OF ANY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND WE NEED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR VERSE , EVERYTHING THE ONE OF YOUR VOICES TO BE HEARD. DON'T PUT YOUR BALLOT IN THE MAILBOX. WHEN WE DO THIS, WHEN WE DO THIS, MINNESOTA, WE THE PEOPLE WILL PUT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [HONKING] WE WILL WIN THIS SENATE SEAT. [HONKING] WE WILL PUT A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [HONKING] AND THEN WE WILL GET TO WORK. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MINNESOTA. LET'S GET TO WORK. [HONKING] (music) (music) HELLO, AND A SODA. ARE YOU READY TO WELCOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN? [HONKING] ARE YOU READY TO REELECT MY GOOD FRIEND, TINA SMITH TO THE U.S. SENATE? [HONKING] WE ARE GOING TO SHOW JOE HOW MINNESOTA HOLDS THE RECORD ALMOST EVERY YEAR FOR THE BIGGEST TURN OUT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM DOWN. [HONKING] WE KNOW THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO STOP OUR VOTES FROM BEING COUNTED, TO STOP MINNESOTANS FROM VOTING. THEY ARE DOING IT TO EVERYONE WITH THESE LAWSUITS. BUT ARE YOU GOING TO LET TO REPUBLICAN ELECTORS AND SOME LAWSUITS STOP OUR PEOPLE FROM VOTING? NO. SO I WANT TO REMIND YOU, AND I WANT THE COUNTRY TO LISTEN TO THIS. MINNESOTANS, YOU DUTIFULLY MAILED AND YOUR BALLOTS, BUT IF YOU HAVE ONE AT HOME RIGHT NOW, YOU 380,000 PEOPLE OUT THERE, DO NOT MAIL IT IN. BRING IT TO A DROPBOX, RIGHT? THEN YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON ALL OVER OUR STATE EARLY. IT IS EASY TO DO. THEN, IF YOU DON'T DO THOSE TWO THINGS, YOU CAN VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW AND WHERE YOU VOTE, GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM AND FIND OUT. THAT IS, IF YOU ARE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE, WE WILL SEND JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [HONKING] I WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO DONALD TRUMP. DESPITE HOW MANY TIMES HE HAS COME TO MINNESOTA, MINNESOTA IS NOT TRUMP COUNTRY. IT IS YOUR COUNTRY. [HONKING] ONE OF THE LAST TIMES HE CAME, HE MADE US A PROMISE, A BIG PROMISE, THE PRESIDENT DID. HE SAID IF HE DOESN'T WIN MINNESOTA, HE'S NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN. [HONKING] SO, MINNESOTA, LET'S HOLD HIM TO IT. [HONKING] ONE OF THE TIMES, HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE, HE SAID WHY DON'T SUBURBAN WOMEN LIKE ME? WELL, LET'S SHOW HIM HOW MUCH THEY DOUBT. [HONKING] THIS IS OUR MOMENT. OUR COUNTRY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE RULE OF LAW CAN'T TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE IS ABOVE IT. DECENCY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT IT. OUR DEMOCRACY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE CAN BULLDOZE THROUGH IT AND THE AMERICAN DREAM CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE CAN CHOOSE WHO LIVES IT. [HONKING] FOR ME, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE, THE REASON PEOPLE ARE VOTING IN DROVES, THE REASON OVER 85 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE VOTED IS THAT FOR SO MONEY PEOPLE, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TV COMMERCIALS AND NUMBERS AND RHETORIC, THIS IS PERSONAL. IT IS PERSONAL FOR ME. MY HUSBAND GOT REALLY SICK WITH THIS VIRUS EARLY ON IN MARCH AND HE ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL FOR NEARLY A WEEK WITH PNEUMONIA, ON OXYGEN. HE MADE IT THROUGH. HE IS HERE. JOHN IS RIGHT HERE. [HONKING] AND WHEN I FOUND OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY KNEW WAY BACK THEN BECAUSE HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE KNEW IT WAS AIRBORNE AND AT THE TIME, WE WERE CLEANING UP EVERY SURFACE, WHICH WE SHOULD DO, BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS AIRBORNE BACK THEN. HE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN SICK, BUT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T TELL US. THEN MY DAD GOT IT IN HIS ASSISTED LIVING AT AGE 92 AND I WILL NEVER FORGET STANDING OUTSIDE THE GLASS, LOOKING IN, THREE OF THE 16 PEOPLE WHERE HE LIVED DIED AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND HE LOOKED SO SMALL AND SO SAD AND CONFUSED. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME I EVER SEE HIM, LIKE THAT. HE MADE IT THROUGH. BUT SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH. SO MANY AMERICANS, OVER 225,000 AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BE AT THEIR THANKSGIVING TABLE AND THERE IS GOING TO BE AN EMPTY CHAIR. 24 MINNESOTANS HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY. BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CLAIMS EVERYONE FOR EVERYTHING. HE BLAMES DR. FAUCI, HE BLAMES HIS OWN PEOPLE, HE LITERALLY SHOULD HAVE A SIGN ON HIS DESK THAT SAYS THE BUCK STOPS ANYWHERE BUT HERE. [HONKING] JOE BIDEN, HE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY , SEE HOW PERFECT THAT WAS? HE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA BECAUSE, AS HE HAS SAID, THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT. THIS IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THIS MOMENT, MINNESOTA, WE DESERVE LEADERS WHO ARE AS RESILIENT AS OUR PEOPLE. WE DESERVE LEADERS WHO WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, WHO DON'T WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND SAY WHAT MEAN TWEET CAN I WRITE? HOW CAN I DIVIDE PEOPLE? JOE BIDEN WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BUILT THE SUPPORT OF YES, OUR FIRED UP DEMOCRATIC FAITH BUT INDEPENDENCE AND REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF JOHN KASICH, FORMER REPUBLICAN EVAN OF OHIO. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF COLIN POWELL. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF MY FRIEND, CINDY MCCAIN. HE HAS BUILT A COALITION THAT WILL HELP US WIN, BUT IT WILL ALSO HELP US GOVERN SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIMES. YES, THIS PANDEMIC, BUT ALSO OUR ECONOMY, CLIMATE CHANGE, AFFORDABLE EDUCATION, AND YES, UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AMERICA DESERVES PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [HONKING] SO, JOE BIDEN IS A MAN OF SCRAPPY WORKING CLASS ROOTS. A MAN WHOSE OWN HARDSHIPS HAVE ONLY MADE HIM MORE DETERMINED TO LIFT UP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. HE HAS A PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER AND YOU CAN COUNT ON HIM TO HELP THIS COUNTRY NOT JUST RECOVER BUT RENEW ITS SPIRIT TO TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. YES, HE WILL BE COMPETENT, BUT HE WILL ALSO GOVERN FROM HIS HEART. HE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA. SO RECENTLY, HE GAVE HIS LAST CLOSING ARGUMENT IN GEORGIA. THAT WARMED MY HEART BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. AND AS I WENT AROUND THE COUNTRY, I TOLD THE STORY HE TOLD AT WARM SPRINGS AND HE WENT THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT WENT TO RECOVER FROM THE POLIOVIRUS AND HE WAS A BELOVED PRESIDENT AND CAME IN AT A VERY, VERY HARD TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY AND IN LITERALLY 100 DAYS CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. THAT IS THE BURDEN THAT WILL BE ON JOE BIDEN'S SHOULDERS. AND WHEN FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT COMPLETED HIS WORK, AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS, WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS SO BELOVED THAT THE COUNTRY STOOD UP, SPONTANEOUSLY AT THE TRAIN TRACKS WHERE HIS BODY WAS TAKEN THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THERE'S A STORY OF A GUY, A REGULAR GUY STANDING BY THOSE TRACKS WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND THE REPORTER LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID SIR, THE GUY IS SOBBING , DID YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT? AND THE GUY SAID NO. I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. [HONKING] THAT IS JOE BIDEN. SO IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BALANCE YOUR TODDLER ON YOUR KNEE AND TRIED TO ALLEN'S YOUR LAP TOP ON YOUR DESK, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE A DAD THAT HAS TO TEACH A FIRST GRADER TO USE THE MUTE BUTTON JUST SO SHE CAN LEARN TO READ, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU'VE GOT A PARENT IN A NURSING HOME, ASSISTED LIVING OR EVEN IN THEIR OWN HOUSE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN GO AND GIVE THEM A HUG, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE IF YOU ARE GOING TO FILL YOUR REFRIGERATOR OR FILL YOUR PRESCRIPTION, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. THIS IS IT, MINNESOTA. AND I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING TO EVERYONE AT HOME WATCHING. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN THE EXTREME OF OUR POLITICS AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR YOU AND YOU ARE TIRED OF THE NOISE AND THE NONSENSE, JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. SO LET US GET OUT THE VOTE. LET US NOT LET ONE POLITICAL PARTY STOP THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENCE COMING TOGETHER ELECTING A MAN OF TRUE GRIT, A MAN WHO LOVES THIS NATION, A MAN WHO WILL GET UP EVERY MORNING AND THINK OF YOU INSTEAD OF HIM AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. THANK YOU, MINNESOTA. LET'S GO AND WIN. [APPLAUSE] [HONKING] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, MAMA AIN'T NOTHING WRONG AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, NOW AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG (music) HELLO, MINNESOTA. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF AN HONOR IT IS TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. I'M A MINNESOTAN WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WE HAVE ALL HEARD ALL YEAR HOW THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME AND MAYBE IN HISTORY. IT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. THE VERY FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY IS ON THE BALLOT. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I LIVE THAT. IN 2012, WHEN I WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS A VICIOUS DISEASE, WHERE A BODY ATTACKS ITSELF THROUGH ITS OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM. SO MY BODY STARTED ATTACKING MY JOINTS AND EATING HOLES INTO MY BONES. IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL. SOMETIMES JUST TURNING A KEY IN A LOCK CAN FEEL LIKE MY KNUCKLES WILL JUST FIRST OPEN. BUT THERE IS NO CURE. BUT I DID FIND A MEDICATION. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MEDICATION COSTS $54,000 PER YEAR, EVERY YEAR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW, MY MEDICATION WOULD HAVE BANKRUPTED ME. MY PREGNANCY ITSELF COULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. BUT THE ACA KEPT ME AND MY FAMILY AFLOAT FOR EIGHT YEARS. JOE BIDEN HELPED PASS THE ACA. [HONKING] NOW, 20 MILLION MORE AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE NOW THAN 10 YEARS AGO. JOE BIDEN FOUGHT FOR MILLIONS LIKE ME WHO HAVE THE EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHEN I TELL YOU THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION ARE LIFE AND DEATH, I AM SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND YES, SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, I DO TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. [HONKING] BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO REPEAL THE. HE SAID THAT. HE IS AT THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW ASKING THEM TO STRIKE DOWN THAT LAW. IF THAT HAPPENS, IF I LOSE MY INSURANCE, I WILL GET THAT $54,000 WILL. I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN, WE WILL HAVE AN ALLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD OF AN ADVERSARY. [HONKING] HE WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER BEFORE. INSTEAD OF REPEALING THE, HE WILL BUILD ON IT. HE WILL ADD A PUBLIC OPTION TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND HE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND OTHER HEALTH COSTS. MINNESOTANS ARE ALREADY VOTING IN RECORD NUMBERS. BUT THE JOB IS NOT DONE YET. WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT. I CANNOT RELAX. UNTIL WE ARE CERTAIN EVERY MINNESOTAN HAS DONE THEIR JOB AND CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR JOE BIDEN AND, HARRIS. [HONKING] HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO. IF YOU HAVEN'T VOTED YET, GOAD DO IT TODAY. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM/MN TO FIGHT AND EARLY VOTING SITE NEAR YOU. AND IF YOU HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT YOU HAVEN'T MAY YIELD , YOU HAVEN'T MAILED IN YET, TAKE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO A DROP OFF LOCATION. IF WE DO THAT IN THE NEXT FOUR DAYS, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN. [HONKING] WITH THAT, IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE MAN HIMSELF, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. (music) (music) [""LET'S GO CRAZY"" BY PRINCE PLAYING] HELLO, MINNESOTA. JESSICA, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR STORY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THE OTHER AMERICANS HAVE STORIES LIKE YOU, FACED WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS, FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES AND FORCED THINK NOT ONLY ABOUT FACING THE BATTLE BUT HOW THEY CAN AFFORD THE TREATMENT. WHILE INSURANCE COMPANIES COME IN AT THE MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON BEAU WAS LYING IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER HE CAME HOME FROM IRAQ AFTER A YEAR. HE HAD STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY DIDN'T TELL HIM HOW LONG HE WAS GOING TO LIVE. AS HE LAID THERE FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE, FIGHTING TO HANG ON, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF MY INSURANCE COMPANY, HIS INSURANCE COMPANY SAID YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF COVERAGE. TIME'S UP. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. FOLKS, IT'S A QUESTION NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FACE IN AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD AND WHY OBAMACARE WAS SUCH A BIG THING. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. [HONKING] IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE DONALD TRUMP, FROM THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED TO RIGHT NOW, HE IS FIGHTING IN COURT TO RIP THAT AWAY FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM DO IT. WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK TO THOSE DAYS. [HONKING] WE ARE GOING TO WIN, FOR YOU, JESSICA, AND YOUR FAMILY. I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AS IF IT WERE MY OWN. [HONKING] I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS YOU HEARD EARLIER. YOUR GOVERNOR, LEADING MINNESOTA WITH DECENCY AND INTEGRITY. ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, LET'S SEND HER BACK TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE NEED HER BADLY. AND YOUR INCREDIBLE JUNIOR SENATOR, TINA SMITH , SHE HAS GOT TO GO BACK. [HONKING] AND LOOK, LET'S WIN BACK THE MINNESOTA STATE SENATE WHILE WE ARE AT IT. [HONKING] ONE OF THE NATION'S FINEST LEADERS IN A DEAR FRIEND, I'VE BEEN HONORED TO STAND ALONGSIDE AND FIGHT TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME, SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR. AMY, I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. [HONKING] YESTERDAY, AND FLORIDA, HAD A CHANCE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH ANOTHER IN , ANOTHER MINNESOTA ICON. CARL ANTHONY TOWNS. BOY, HE CAN PLAY, MAN. YOU KNOW HIM AS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE TIMBERWOLVES, BUT HE'S ALSO A SON, WHO LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICANS LOST HIS MOM TO COVID 19 A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. FOR ALL THOSE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THOSE PARENTS, SIBLINGS, HUSBANDS, AND WIVES FACING EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINING ROOM TABLES, ALL OF THOSE WHO REACH OVER AT NIGHT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE, THEY DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER. THESE GUYS ARE NOT VERY POLITE, BUT THEY ARE LIKE TRUMP. [HONKING] THEY ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AS WELL. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR ALL THESE FOLKS. WE HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT TO GET IT DONE. FOUR DAYS. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING. MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE BY TUESDAY. AND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU USE YOUR POWER TO VOTE, IT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY. RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA, WITH ALL OF YOU, IN THE FINAL DAYS, KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT. KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT, THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM SO WE CAN OVERCOME. THERE'S A REASON THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ME. THEY KNOW THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING, SO THEY ARE NOT USED TO NOT HEARING ANYTHING. I KNOW IT'S HARD, FOLKS. MORE THAN 20028I BELIEVE NOW THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF COVID-19. NEARLY 2500 HERE IN MINNESOTA, GONE. WE HAVE 9 MILLION NEW CASES NATIONWIDE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE OUT OF WORK. ON THE EDGE, THEY CAN'T SEE ANY LIGHT, THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS SIMPLY GIVEN UP. OVER THE WEEKEND, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, CHIEF OF STAFF, HE SAID THE FOLLOWING , WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. AT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP TURNED TO ME AND SAID WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT'S GOING AWAY. WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM, HE'S ASKING US TO LEARN TO DIE WITH IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO. [HONKING] DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID TODAY? WHAT HE SAID TODAY ON THE TRAIL, HE SAID OUR DOCTORS, OUR DOCTORS, OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, OVER A THOUSAND LOST THEIR LIVES , PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, BUSTING THEIR NEXT, HE SAID THEY ARE MAKING UP DEATHS FROM COVID BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ACCUSING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF MAKING UP COVID DEATHS SO THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. DOCTORS AND NURSES GO TO WORK EVERY DAY TO SAVE LIVES. THEY DO THEIR JOBS. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STOP ATTACKING THEM AND DO HIS JOB. [HONKING] FOLKS, THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO WEEKS AGO, WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE ARE LOSING A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY, RUN NUMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT'S THOUGHTFUL. IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. DONALD TRUMP HAS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG AND SURRENDERED TO THIS VIRUS. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T GIVE UP. THEY DON'T COWER. REMEMBER WHEN HE DID THAT INTERVIEW AND TOLD BOB WOODWARD THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW DEADLY IT WAS AT THE END OF JANUARY BUT DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. AND WOODWARD ASKED HIM WHY. HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T PANIC. DONALD TRUMP PANICKED. [HONKING] UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER TO THIS VIRUS. LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPREADING DIVISION AND DISCORD. HE THINKS HE CAN DIVIDE US. WE WON'T NOTICE HIS FAILURES. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHY HE SHAMELESSLY EQUATES SOMALI REFUGEES, FOLKS SEEKING A BETTER LIFE IN AMERICA WITH TERRORISTS AS HE DID LAST NIGHT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BRING US TOGETHER, NOT PULL US APART. I WILL DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND TESTING, TRACING. IT'S ESTIMATED BY THE LEADING DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IF WE JUST WORE A MASK FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, WE WOULD SAVE OVER 100,000 LIVES OF THE 200,000 LIVES WE EXPECT TO LOSE. DR. FAUCI CALLED FOR A MASK MANDATE LAST WEEK. THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT LIKE THOSE UGLY THINGS OVER THERE BEEPING THE HORNS. THIS IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY, FOR GOD SAKE. [HONKING] LOOK, IN HIS OWN WORDS, AS I SAID, THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY HOW EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND COMMUNICABLE THIS DISEASE WAS. HE WENT ON AND MADE THAT TAPE, HE SAID THE DISEASE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SPREAD, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DID NOTHING AT ALL. LOOK, FOLKS, AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TOUGH. INSTEAD OF TALKING AND POLITICIZING THE VACCINE, HE SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR A SAFE, EQUITABLE AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE WHEN IT COMES NEXT YEAR. [HONKING] THIS GUY REFUSES TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THE RESOURCES AND THE NATIONAL STANDARD TO OPEN SAFELY. THE HOUSE OF PAST THE MONEY TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPEN SAFELY, BUSINESSES TO OPEN SAFELY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PAID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL BRING REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER TO BRING RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. [HONKING] DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY THAT BARACK AND I GAVE HIM. BUT GUESS WHAT? LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE SQUANDERED IT. LIKE EVERYTHING HE HAS INHERITED. BUT WE CAN BUILD BACK AND WE CAN BUILD BACK BETTER WITH AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT WEALTH. WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES. I PROMISE YOU, YOU HAVE MY WORD, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR, YOU WON'T PAY A PENNY MORE IN TAXES. [HONKING] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, THE WEALTHIEST AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 91 OUT OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAID ZERO IN TAXES LAST YEAR. WHY? HEARING THAT GUY BLOWING HIS HORN, WHY SHOULD HE PAY, WHY SHOULD A NURSE PAY HIGHER TAX RATES THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY? WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THEN DONALD TRUMP PAYS? [HONKING] HE HAS EXPLOITED EVERY LOOPHOLE AND TAX CODE, HE HAS RUN A SHELL GAME TO AVOID PAYING TAXES. IF YOU NOTICE, I RELEASED 22 YEARS OF MY TAX RETURNS. HE'S NOT RELEASED ONE SINGLE YEAR. WHAT IS HE HIDING? WHERE'S THE CORRUPTION? ACCORDING TO TRUMP, THE REASON AIOLI PAY $750 IS BECAUSE HE SMART. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE THE REST OF US TO PAY OUR FAIR SHARE, MR. PRESIDENT? WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, HELP YOU PAY FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS OR CHILDCARE OR CARE FOR YOUR AGING PARENTS OR BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR SCHOOL. TRUMP GOT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE , FIRST TIME IT HAS EVER HAPPENED WHILE AN ELECTION HAS ALREADY STARTED , FOR ONE REASON. HE'S DETERMINED TO DO WHAT HE COULDN'T DO FOR FOUR YEARS, DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FOR COVID-19 WILL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY YOU COVERAGE. AND WE WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A WOMAN. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS YOUR RIGHT. [HONKING] AND IF YOU ALL GET OUT AND VOTE, WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMACARE, WE WILL EXPAND IT AND BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, REDUCED COSTS BY 60% BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG PRICES. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY SAID IF DONALD TRUMP SAYS ELECT ME AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY SAID THE CHANGES HE PUTS IN PLACE, SOCIAL SECURITY WOULD BE BANKRUPT IN 2023. SO GO HOME AND TELL YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHAT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO DO. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. [HONKING] FOLKS, NOTHING IS WORSE THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY SON BEAU GAVE UP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SEAT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO VOLUNTEER TO GO TO A RACK FOR A YEAR. HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL. HE WASN'T A LOSER OR SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. [HONKING] SO MANY OF YOU AS WELL. NO WONDER THE SIX GENERALS WHO WORKED DIRECTLY FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE LEFT AND SAYS HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ANY PRESIDENT BEFORE. [HONKING] THAT'S WHY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMANDER STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, NAVY SEAL COMMANDER ADMIRAL CREMA AND, OH , OVER 24 STARS , OVER 20 FOUR STARS ENDORSED ME BECAUSE THEY TRUST ME. [HONKING] THAT'S WHY THE MILITARY TIMES REPORTED MORE TROOPS VOTE FOR BIDEN THEN TRUMP. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LET THEM VOTE AND VOTE FOR THEM. WHEN DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY, WE CAN DELIVER ON RACIAL JUSTICE. SEEING PROTESTERS ACROSS THE NATION, THE LIFE AND DIGNITY AND GEORGE FLOYD KILLED SEVEN MILES FROM HERE AND SO MANY OTHERS , PROTESTING, BURNING AND LOOTING IS NOT PROTESTING , IT VIOLENCE, CLEAR AND SIMPLE AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT THESE PROTESTS ARE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR COME IN JACOB BLAKE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN, NOT BY ME, NOT BY US, NOT BY THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ECONOMIC JUSTICE. ACCESS TO SCHOOLING, HOUSING, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH FINANCIAL STABILITY, GIVING FAMILIES OF COLOR A REAL SHOT TO OWN A HOME, START A SMALL BUSINESS, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE THEY CAN BUILD WEALTH AND PASS ON OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE GENERATIONS LIKE THE REST OF US HAVE. WE HAVE TO VOTE TO ENSURE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. FINALLY, WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE WEST IS ON FIRE, LOSING MORE FORESTS THAN THE TOTAL LAND OF CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND COMBINED. THE MIDWEST IS FLOODING. HERE IN MINNESOTA, IT INCURS BIG COSTS, INCREASE FLOODING IN MISSISSIPPI. IN SAINT PAUL, , DONALD TRUMP THINKS IT'S ALL A HOAX. HE SURE IS A STABLE GENIUS. HE SAID WIND POWER CAUSES CANCER. I SAY IT CREATES JOBS, MINNESOTA JOBS. [HONKING] WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT NATION AND CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE CAN CHANGE THE PATH WE ARE ON. NOTHING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO LEAD AGAIN. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICANS TO TRUST EACH OTHER AGAIN. [HONKING] HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE STABILITY AGAIN. [HONKING] AND HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO BE UNITED AGAIN. [HONKING] WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN ME AND IN BARACK OBAMA AND WE WORKED FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. I WILL DO IT AGAIN. MY CAMPAIGN IS A BROAD COALITION OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, REPUBLICAN OFFICEHOLDERS. I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [HONKING] I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO, BECAUSE THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE A SACRED DUTY, THE DUTY TO VOTE. IT MATTERS. MINNESOTA MATTERS. STAY OPTIMISTIC, STAY UNITED. MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. AND GO ONLINE. THERE WAS A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE IN THE ROLES, ABSENTEE BALLOTS HAVE TO BE IN BY TUESDAY. DROP IT OFF, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MAIL, OR VOTE SAFELY AND PERSON IN A DAY UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET IT DONE. AND MAKE SURE EVERYONE YOU KNOW VOTES AS WELL. SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP US, DESPITE TRUMP'S EFFORTS. A PRESS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT ""NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS , NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS HAS A CANDIDATE BEEN SO RELIANT ON WIDESPREAD EFFORTS TO REPRESS THE VOTE AS TRUMP."" WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. OVER 85 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. 85 MILLION. [HONKING] THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. LOOK, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE WORDS PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED TO SEND US TO THE MOON. HE SAID WE WERE DOING IT BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE WORK AMERICA MUST DO. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NO LIMIT TO AMERICA, INCLUDING GUYS LIKE THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING. DIVIDING AMERICA, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING HIM WHO WE ARE. [HONKING] WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES , OVER LIES. SO IT IS TIME TO STAND UP, TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN BE WHO WE ARE AT OUR BEST, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

TODAY HE IS JOINED BY FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. (music) HELLO, FLINT. ARE WE READY TO GO OUT AND WIN AN ELECTION? HOW WE READY TO BRING ALL OF OUR FRIENDS TO THE POLLS? I KNOW WE READY NOT JUST TO WIN, BUT ARE WE READY TO WIN BIG? WELL, I CAN FEEL IT. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE AND I'M EXCITED, BECAUSE WE HAVE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA READY TO COME OUT TO GREET US. [HONKING] WE ALSO HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN, READY TO COME OUT AND GREET US. AND THEY ARE BOTH HERE BECAUSE THEY LOVE MICHIGAN AND THEY CERTAINLY LOVE THE CITY OF FLINT. AND WE KNOW THEY LOVE THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN HERE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. BUT THEY DON'T JUST SHOW UP TO VISIT AND WAVE THEIR HANDS AND DO SOME POLITICKING. WHEN THEY SHOW UP, GET THE BUSINESS DONE. THEY HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE, AND THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. THEY HAVE SHOWN STABLE LEADERSHIP, THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP, FOCUSED LEADERSHIP. MAN, DO WE NEED THAT AGAIN OR WHAT? I JUST WANT TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT HOW WE SAW THEM TOGETHER AND HOW IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT IS PERSONAL TO ME. WHEN WE WERE FACING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, WALL STREET AGREED , WENT WILD AND ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY, IT WAS A MESS THAT BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN WALKED INTO. A MESS CREATED BY THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS THERE BEFORE. THEY CAME TO OUR CITY. HE CAME TO OUR STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS HANGING IN THE BALANCE, WITH ALL OF THOSE JOBS, ALL OF THAT HISTORY. THE STATE THAT PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON WHEELS AND BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. ALL OF THAT WAS IN DANGER. I REMEMBER, I WAS A NEW MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN 2008, AND I REPRESENTED A DISTRICT THAT INCLUDED CHRYSLER. MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS IN ANN ARBOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MEETING I HAD WITH THE CEO. AND THEY WERE IN BIG TROUBLE ON THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE ANY ASSISTANCE FOR THE AUTO COMPANIES AND GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER. I REMEMBER THAT DISCUSSION WITH THAT CEO WHEN HE SAID, CONGRESSMAN, LET ME BE CLEAR. THE ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES, MONEY IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND I'M LITERALLY 4, 5, MAYBE SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM LIQUIDATING CHRYSLER. NOT REORGANIZING, LIQUIDATING. I LOOKED AROUND THAT ROOM AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE , I DON'T THINK THEY HAD HEARD FROM THE CEO THAT THIS COMPANY WAS GOING TO DISAPPEAR. I HAD VISIONS OF THAT GIANT PARKING LOT WITH GRASS GROWING IN IT, NO CARS. FAMILIES IN DIFFICULT SHAPE. I WENT BACK AND WORKED WITH COLLEAGUES AND TALKED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN AND SAID, WE'VE GOT TO DO IT AND WE'VE GOT TO INCLUDE CHRYSLER. I WILL SAY TO THIS DAY, AND I WILL SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WHEN PEOPLE WERE BETTING AGAINST MICHIGAN WORKERS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SET, HEY, LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT , HE SAID THAT , WHEN VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND VOTED AGAINST THE AUTO RESCUE, I WILL SAY, THANK GOD BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN STILL WITH US. THEY STOOD WITH AMERICAN WORKERS. THEY STOOD WITH WORKERS IN MICHIGAN. THEY STOOD WITH WORKERS IN FLINT AND DETROIT. THEY WERE THERE FOR US WHEN WE NEEDED THEM, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM NOW, BECAUSE WE NEED THEM BACK. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS LASTED A WHOLE LOT LONGER THAN ANY OF US WOULD LIKE. WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND PITTED STATES AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE DID NOT SHOW THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, BUT THANK GOD JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN, THANK GOD HE WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, AND THANK GOD WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH HIM TO GET TO THIS CHALLENGE. , THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE. I WILL SAY THAT JOE BIDEN , HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. HE NEEDS HELP. HE NEEDS FRIENDS. AND HE NEEDS FRIENDS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HE NEEDS A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE KNOW IF MITCH MCCONNELL STAYS AS REPUBLICAN LEADER, HE WILL STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SAW HIM DO IT WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT ALLOW HIM TO STAY, WHICH IS WHY WE MUST WIN. IT IS WHY WE MUST WIN HERE IN MICHIGAN. I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU , WE HAVE A REAL SHOT. A SHOT TO TAKE THE MAJORITY. ONE THING WE MUST DO IS, WE MUST WIN HERE. WE MUST HOLD THIS SEAT, AND WE WILL HOLD THIS SEAT AS A DEMOCRATIC SEAT FOR MICHIGAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] NOW THE REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THEY ARE POURING MONEY INTO MY RACE. YOU SEE THE TV COMMERCIALS. THERE ARE A LOT OF TV COMMERCIALS. THEY ARE POURING MONEY IN WITH NEGATIVE, NASTY, FALSE ADS. THE FALL , THE FACT CHECKER SAY THEY ARE FALSE OR SMEARS. MITCH MCCONNELL AND HIS BILLIONAIRE BUDDIES PUT IN $20 MILLION AND THE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND THIS WEEKEND THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND $8 MILLION. THESE ARE BILLIONAIRES THAT THINK THEY CAN BUY THE SELECTION. WE ALL KNOW, WE ARE ALL PROUD MICHIGANDERS, AND WE KNOW THAT WILLIAM AYRES CANNOT BUY AN ELECTION , THAT BILLIONAIRES CANNOT BUY AN ELECTION IN MICHIGAN. WE KNOW BILLIONAIRES HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THIS COUNTRY IS SO GREAT , A BILLIONAIRE STILL GETS ONE VOTE. WE GET ONE VOTE AND WE HAVE MORE VOTES HERE TODAY IN FLINT THAN THOSE BILLIONAIRES. [CAR HORNS HONKING] BUT WE HAVE TO WORK. IT IS NOT OVER. LET ME WRAP UP BY RINGING A BAD MEMORY AND PAINTING A PICTURE OF WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE. WE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. WE REMEMBER WAKING UP THAT MORNING AND SEEING THE RESULTS. I KNOW EVERYONE HERE TODAY HAS THIS THOUGHT , WAS THERE SOMETHING MORE I COULD HAVE DONE? THE LOSS WAS ONLY TWO VOTES A PRECINCT. COULD I HAVE MADE A FEW MORE CALLS? COULD I HAVE TALKED TO MY NEIGHBOR? COULD I HAVE HAD A COUPLE FRIENDS, AND MAKE SURE THEY GET TO THE BALLOT? I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. YOU LEAVE HERE TODAY, YOU STILL HAVE TIME TO DO THAT WORK. WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW, YOU CAN PUT IN THOSE TWO EXTRA HOURS OF WORK. YOU CAN TALK TO THOSE NEIGHBORS. YOU CAN TAKE TO THE POLLS A FRIEND OF YOURS. WE DO THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, THIS WILL BE THE VISION I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH, THIS VISION BEFORE WE HEAR FROM SOME AMAZING PEOPLE. WHEN WE ARE WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION, YOU ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE TV. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE WATCHING, BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS THE CENTER OF THAT. WHEN THE RESULTS COME IN, WHEN THAT COMES ACROSS YOUR TV SCREEN, I KNOW WHAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL DO. YOU WILL JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEAT, YOU WILL CHEER, BECAUSE YOU WILL SAY, THANK GOD MICHIGAN IS A BLUE STATE. THANK GOD WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK GOD WE REELECTED GARY PETERSON TO THE SENATE AND HAVE TOLD MITCH MCCONNELL, YOU ARE IN THE MINORITY. WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AND HOUSE, AND COLLECTIVELY WE WILL SAY NO TO THE POLITICS OF DIVISION AND HATE WE HAVE SEEN THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AND SAY, HELLO, TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROGRESS. LET'S GO ON TO VICTORY. (music) PEOPLE KEEP ON LEARNING SOLDIERS KEEP ON WARRING THE WORLD KEEPS ON TURNING 'CAUSE IT WON'T BE TOO LONG POWERS KEEP ON LYIN' WHILE YOUR PEOPLE KEEP ON DYIN' WORLD KEEP ON TURNIN' 'CAUSE IT WON'T BE TOO LONG I'M SO DARN GLAD HE LET ME TRY IT AGAIN 'CAUSE MY LAST TIME ON EARTH I LIVED A WHOLE WORLD OF SIN I'M SO GLAD THAT I KNOW MORE THAN I KNEW THEN GONNA KEEP ON TRYIN' 'TIL I REACH MY HIGHEST GROUND TEACHERS KEEP ON TEACHING PREACHERS KEEP ON PREACHING WORLD KEEP ON TURNIN' 'CAUSE IT WON'T BE TOO LONG OH, LORD LOVERS KEEP ON LOVIN' BELIEVERS KEEP ON BELIEVIN' GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND FOR JOINING TODAY'S CAR RALLY. I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY MY ENTIRE LIFE, ORGANIZING AND ENGAGING PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN, AFFORDABLE WATER AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. I GREW UP STRONG, WITH MY FAMILY WORKING AT GENERAL MOTORS, PROUD MEMBERS OF THE UAW. MY MOTHER WAS A UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND LIAISON FOR FLINT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY MOTIVATE ME TO STAY COMMITTED TO THE FIGHT FOR EQUITY, WHICH STARTS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THAT FIGHTING FOR CHANGE AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL IS MORE THAN JUST YOUR TYPICAL 9:00-5:00 JOB. IT IS YOUR WHOLE LIFE. RIGHT NOW, WE DESPERATELY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RECOGNIZES THAT. THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHINED A LIGHT ON THE INEQUITIES THAT DEFINE OUR. EXISTENCE THIS PRESIDENT HAS USED HAS WORDS AND THE NATION'S HIGHEST OFFICE TO STOKE HATE AND DIVISION. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THE SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK FOR US. , THIS SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK FOR US. WE ARE JUST THREE DAYS AWAY FROM A DAY WE WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS IS NO DOUBT THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIVES. AND WHEN NOVEMBER 4 ROLLS AROUND, WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE LEFT IT ALL ON THE TABLE, THAT WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO ELECT THE LEADERS WE KNOW WE DESERVE. WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW AND MEETING THIS MOMENT MEANS EXERCISING YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. IT MEANS TELLING YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO VOTE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE YET TO VOTE, YOU CAN GO TO IWILL VOTE.COM TO MAKE YOUR PLAN TODAY. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE WATER YOU DRINK, YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH TO SIT THIS ONE OUT. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT CHANGE STARTS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. HE KNOWS THAT THE BEST LAWS AND POLICIES DEMAND A PATIENT, ATTENTIVE EAR TO THE GROUND. HE WILL LISTEN. HE CARES ABOUT US. HE HELPED SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY, WHICH MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR THOUSANDS IN FLINT AND HE WILL BE MORE THAN A 9:00-5:00 PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO RIGHT THE SHIP. HERE IN FLINT, WE ARE NO STRANGERS TO A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AS OUR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC, WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR HOPE AND LEADERSHIP TO MOVE US FORWARD. I REMEMBER A TIME WHERE WE SAW THAT SAME UNIQUE BRAND OF HOPE WHEN WE WERE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE USED OUR OWN POWER, MADE HISTORY, AND ELECTED THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I AM SO HONORED TO INTRODUCE THE MAN AND PRESIDENT WHO EMBODIES THAT HOPE, WHO FORGED A BRIGHT PATH FORWARD, BUT ONE HOUSEKEEPING ITEM BEFORE I WELCOME HIM TO THE STAGE. WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HONKING YOUR HORNS DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REMARKS. FLINT, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING TO THE STAGE THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BARACK OBAMA. (music) HELLO, FLINT. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN MICHIGAN. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE MIDWEST, GETTING CLOSER TO CHICAGO FROM HERE. HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING? CAN EVERYBODY GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO ANDRE YOUNG? FANTASTIC YOUNG MAN. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. HAPPY HALLOWEEN, EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOUR MASKS. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS WELL TO GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GARLAND GILCHRIST. MY BUDDY FROM THE SENATE, DEBBIE STABENOW. A MAN WHO IS ALWAYS IN THERE FIGHTING FOR YOU WHO WE NEED TO SEND BACK TO THE SENATE, JARED PETERS. YOUR CONGRESSMAN, BORN AND RAISED GREAT HERE IN FLINT, MICHIGAN, DAN KILLED THE , DAN KILDEE. MAYOR SHELTON NEELY. , SHELDON NEELY. AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. THREE DAYS, FLINT. THREE DAYS UNTIL THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES. I LOVE YOU TOO. LISTEN, I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE GOT THE MICHIGAN-MICHIGAN STATE GAME, AND THAT IS A BIG DEAL. THE PAUL BUNYAN TROPHY IS ON THE LINE, BUT THIS TUESDAY, EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE. OUR JOBS ARE ON THE LINE, OUR HEALTH CARE IS ON THE LINE, WHETHER OR NOT WE GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL IS ON THE LINE, BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. ON TUESDAY, YOU CAN CHOOSE CHANGE. ON TUESDAY, YOU CAN ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. YOU CAN CHOOSE A BETTER AMERICA. AND WHAT IS EVEN BETTER NEWS IS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY TO CAST YOUR BALLOT, MICHIGAN. YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON RIGHT NOW. JUST GO TOWILLVOTE.COM, FIND YOUR POLLING PLACE, GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. IF SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ALREADY VOTED, GO HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. WE HAVE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY OUT THERE. I LOVE YOU TOO. OK, THAT'S IT. PUT THAT MASK BACK ON. LISTEN, MICHIGAN, JOE BIDEN IS MY BROTHER. I LOVE THAT , I LOVE JOE BIDEN AND HE WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. NOW, I WILL ADMIT, 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASKED HIM TO BE THE NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH ME WHEN I WAS RUNNING, I DID NOT KNOW JOE THAT WELL. WE HAD SERVED TOGETHER IN THE SENATE, BUT HE AND I CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES, PART OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS, BUT I QUICKLY CAME TO ADMIRE JOE AS A MAN WHO LEARNED EARLY ON TO TREAT EVERYBODY HE MEETS WITH DIGNITY AND WITH RESPECT, LIVING BY THE WORDS HIS MOM TAUGHT HIM ""NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU, JOE, BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE."" AND THAT SENSE OF DECENCY AND EMPATHY, A BELIEF IN HARD WORK, FAMILY, FAITH, THE BELIEF THAT EVERYBODY COUNTS, THAT IS WHO JOE IS. AND THAT IS WHO HE WILL BE AS PRESIDENT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENCY DOES NOT CHANGE WHO YOU ARE. IT SHOWS WHO YOU ARE. IT REVEALS WHO YOU ARE. AND FOR EIGHT YEARS, JOE WAS THE LAST ONE IN THE ROOM WHENEVER I FACED A BIG DECISION, AND HE MADE ME A BETTER PRESIDENT. HE HAS THE CHARACTER AND THE EXPERIENCE TO MAKE US A BETTER COUNTRY AND HE AND KAMALA WILL BE IN THE FIGHT NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR EVERYONE OF US. AND WE SURE CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I SAID THIS BEFORE. I NEVER THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WOULD EMBRACE MY VISION. HE DID NOT AGREE WITH MY POLICIES, BUT I DID HOPE HE WOULD SHOW SOME INTEREST IN THE JOB. HE MIGHT TAKE THE JOB SERIOUSLY. HE NEVER HAS. HE HAS NOT SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN DOING THE WORK OR HELPING ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS OR TREATING THE PRESIDENCY IS ANYTHING MORE THAN A REALITY SHOW TO GIVE HIM THE ATTENTION THAT HE CRAVES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE REST OF US HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. ALMOST 230,000 AMERICANS ARE DEAD. MORE THAN 100,000 SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED. ALMOST 300,000 JOBS ARE GONE IN MICHIGAN ALONE. AMERICA JUST HAD ITS SINGLE WORST WEEK OF NEW COVID CASES. AND WHAT IS HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT? HERE WE ARE, THE WORST WEEK, THIS WEEK. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS NOW FOR MONTHS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND FOR MONTHS AND HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT THIS WEEK IS THAT THE PRESS AND PEOPLE ARE TOO FOCUSED ON COVID. COVID, COVID, COVID HE IS COMPLAINING. HE IS JEALOUS OF COVID'S MEDIA COVERAGE. AND NOW HE IS ACCUSING DOCTORS OF PROFITING OFF THIS PANDEMIC. THINK OF THAT. HE SAID THIS JUST YESTERDAY. HE SAID DOCTORS ARE OVER BLOWING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT. DOCTORS. HE CANNOT FATHOM, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEBODY WOULD RISK THEIR LIFE TO SAVE OTHERS WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT. HIS CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS A QUOTE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. WE NOTICED, MR. CHIEF OF STAFF. WE UNDERSTAND YOU WILL NOT, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO WILL? JOE BIDEN WELL WHEN WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. , WILL WHEN WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT? REMEMBER THAT? THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE SAYING LET AMERICA GET COVID, BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THEY ARE ACTING. IF TRUMP WERE FOCUSED ON COVID FROM THE BEGINNING, CASES WOULD NOT BE REACHING NEW RECORD HIGHS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SOME OF THE PLACES HE HOLDS RALLIES HAVE SEEN NEW SPIKES AFTER HE LEAVES TOWN. THERE WAS JUST A STUDY BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT JUST CAME OUT SHOWING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE GOTTEN SICK BECAUSE OF THESE RALLIES HE IS HOLDING. WHAT IS HIS OBSESSION, BY THE WAY, WITH CROWD SIZE? HAVE YOU NOTICED THIS? HE IS ALWAYS WORRIED , THIS IS THE ONE MEASURE HE HAS OF SUCCESS. HE IS STILL WORRYING ABOUT HIS INAUGURATION CROWD BEING SMALLER THAN MINE. IT REALLY BUGS HIM. HE STILL IS TALKING ABOUT THAT. DOES HE HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO WORRY ABOUT? DID NO ONE COME TO HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY WHEN HE WAS A KID? WAS HE TRAUMATIZED? WHAT'S WITH CROWDS? I HAVE HAD CROWDS BEFORE, YOU KNOW. I HAVE HAD QUITE A FEW, BUT WHEN A COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH A PANDEMIC, THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT. AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND TRUMP RIGHT THERE. TRUMP CARES ABOUT FEEDING HIS EGO. JOE CARES ABOUT KEEPING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE. AND HE IS LESS INTERESTED IN FEEDING HIS EGO THAN MAKING SURE HE IS NOT GOING AROUND MAKING MORE PEOPLE SICK. THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT FROM A PRESIDENT. YOU CAN EXPECT SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM A REALITY TV STAR, BUT FROM A PRESIDENT, YOU WANT THEM TO PUT YOU ABOVE THEIR OWN EGO. HERE'S THE TRUTH, MICHIGAN. THIS PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING FOR ANY PRESIDENT, BUT THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS DONE ANYTHING BUT COMPLETELY SCREW THIS UP IS NONSENSE. CANADA IDENTIFIED ITS FIRST CASE THE SAME WEEK THAT THE U.S. DID, JUST A FEW MILES UP. I MAY NOT BE POINTING NORTH, BUT CANADA IS PRETTY CLOSE. OUR MORTALITY RATE IN THE UNITED STATES IS 2.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN CANADA. THINK ABOUT THAT. IF WE HAD THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS DYING IN CANADA AS WE DO HERE, NEARLY 90,000 AMERICANS WOULD HAVE DIED INSTEAD OF 230,000 AMERICANS. IF WE HAD HANDLED THIS PANDEMIC LIKE CANADA DID, 140,000 OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE TODAY. THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. AND YET, DESPITE THAT, LAST WEEK, WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT, HE SAID ""NOT MUCH."" REALLY? NOT MUCH? CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT WAS ANXIOUS TO DOWNPLAY IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET CREDIT FOR THE ECONOMY HE INHERITED AND ZERO BLAME FOR THE PANDEMIC KIA GOURD, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. , PANDEMIC HE IGNORED, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. THE JOB DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. MAKING STUFF UP DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT IN THE WORK. AND, ALONG WITH THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THINGS DONE, JOE BIDEN HAS CONCRETE PLANS AND POLICIES THAT WILL TURN OUR VISION OF A FAIRER, STRONGER COUNTRY A REALITY. JOE WILL NOT SCREW UP TESTING. HE WILL NOT CALL SCIENTIST IDIOTS. HE WILL NOT HOST SUPER SPREADER EVENTS. WHAT HE WILL DO IS GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL WITH A PLAN TO MAKE TESTING FREE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE, GETTING A VACCINE TO EVERY AMERICAN COST FREE, AND MAKING SURE OUR FRONTLINE HEROES NEVER HAVE TO ASK OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED. THAT IS WHAT JOE BIDEN WILL DO. JOE'S PLAN WILL GUARANTEE PAID SICK LEAVE FOR WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES IN EVERY COMMUNITY, NOT JUST SOME, NOT JUST BIG CORPORATIONS, BUT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HOLD OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER CAN REOPEN SAFELY. AMERICA CREATED 1.5 MILLION MORE JOBS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THEN IN HIS FIRST THREE YEARS AND THAT WAS BEFORE HE COULD BLAME THE PANDEMIC. JOE BIDEN AND I, WITH THE HELP OF A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, RESCUE THE AUTO INDUSTRY. GARY PETERS WAS THERE. HE TOLD US TO BET ON MICHIGAN AND WE DID. AND MANUFACTURING IN MICHIGAN GREW BY 15% OVER OUR LAST FOUR YEARS. TRUMP PROMISED HE WOULD MAKE MICHIGAN THE MANUFACTURING HUB OF THE WORLD AGAIN. IT IS UP 1% UNDER HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS. 15% UNDER OBAMA-BIDEN, 1% UNDER HIM. THAT IS MICHIGAN. WE ADDED THE LONGEST STREAK OF JOB GROWTH IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE HE INFLICTED MEANS THAT HE WILL BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT SINCE HERBERT HOOVER TO ACTUALLY LOSE JOBS. THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO. JOE BIDEN AND GARY PETERS KNOW THAT THE KEY TO WHAT IS , TO A STRONG ECONOMY IS NOT CUTTING TAXES FOR BILLIONAIRES. IT IS LIFTING THE PROSPECTS FOR WORKING AMERICANS. AND JOE HAS GOT A PLAN TO CREATE ONE MILLION NEW AUTO RELATED JOBS BY ACCELERATING ELECTRIC VEHICLE PRODUCTION. HE HAS A PLAN TO CREATE 10 MILLION GOOD CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. FLINT, MICHIGAN, YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. HE WILL PAY FOR HIS PLANS BY ROLLING BACK TRUMP'S TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. JOE SEES THIS , JOE SEIZED THIS MOMENT NOT TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, BUT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TOGETHER AND FINALLY MAKE LONG-OVERDUE CHANGES SO THAT OUR ECONOMY ACTUALLY MAKES LIFE A LITTLE EASIER FOR EVERYBODY, FOR THE WAITRESS TRYING TO RAISE A KID ON HER OWN, FOR THE STUDENT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR CLASSES, FOR THE SHIP WORKER ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF GETTING LAID OFF, WHERE THE CANCER SURVIVOR WHO IS WORRIED THAT HER PRE-EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE FOR A SECOND. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE FOR THE SECOND. , THE SECOND. REPUBLICANS LOVE TO SAY RIGHT BEFORE ELECTIONS THAT THEY WILL TECH YOUR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? JOE AND I ACTUALLY PROTECTED THEM TENURES AGO WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. [HONKING] AND SINCE WE DID SO, WITH NO HELP FROM REPUBLICANS, NO VOTES FROM REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED TO REPEAL OR UNDERMINE THE ACA 60 TIMES. 60 TIMES THEY HAVE TRIED TO TAKE PEOPLES HEALTH CARE AWAY. WHEN ASKED, WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT? YOU DON'T THINK THESE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE HEALTH CARE? ""NO, NO, WE HAVE A PLAN."" EXCEPT IT HAS BEEN 10 YEARS AND THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE A PLAN. THEY ARE TRYING TO BAMBOOZLE YOU. INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY COMING UP WITH A PLAN, THEY HAVE ATTACKED THE ACA AT EVERY TURN. THEY HAVE DRIVEN UP COSTS, DRIVEN UP THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC. IN THE MIDST, RIGHT AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEED HEALTH CARE. THEY SIDE ONTO A CASE RIGHT NOW IN THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THEY ARE , THEY SIGNED ON TO A CASE RIGHT NOW IN THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE ACA WITH NOTHING TO TAKE ITS PLACE. MITCH MCCONNELL IS POURING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUPER PAC DOLLARS INTO MICHIGAN TO TRY TO BE GARY PETERS. MICHIGAN, HERE IS THE TRUTH. JOE AND KAMALA AND GARY WILL PROTECT YOUR HEALTH CARE, EXPANDED MEDICARE, MAKE INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY, AND THE REASON YOU KNOW THAT IS TRUE IS BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE DID IT THE FIRST TIME. AND HERE IS ANOTHER THING. WITH JOE AND KAMALA AT THE HELM, THIS IS A BIG BENEFIT. MICHELLE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS OVER DINNER THE OTHER DAY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO ARGUE WITH YOUR FAMILY ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY. IT WILL NOT BE SO EXHAUSTING. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE KNOWING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO SUGGEST WE INJECT BLEACH AS A POSSIBLE CURE OF COVID. HE WILL NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING , YOU WILL NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, OPEN YOUR PHONE, NEWSFLASH, A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THE NAVY SEALS DID NOT ACTUALLY KILL BIN LADEN. YOU WILL NOT HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO INSULT PEOPLE THAT DO NOT SUPPORT HIM. THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. WE WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT FROM A TEACHER, A COACH, A COWORKER OR A FAMILY MEMBER IF A NEIGHBOR WAS ACTING LIKE THIS, YOU WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOR. WHY WOULD BE ACCEPTED FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? , WE ACCEPT IT FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. IT IS NOT JUST A JOKE. IT IS NOT JUST FUNNY. THOSE ACTIONS EMBOLDEN OTHER PEOPLE TO BE MEAN AND DIVISIVE AND RACIST. IT AFFECTS THE FABRIC OF ALL OF OUR LIVES IN HOWARD CHILDREN SEE THE WORLD , LIVES AND HOW OUR CHILDREN SEE THE WORLD, HOW OUR FAMILY GETS ALONG, HOW THE WORLD SEES AMERICA. THAT IS WHY JOE TALKS ABOUT THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHY HE TALKS ABOUT DECENCY AND KINDNESS AND RESPONSIBILITY AND HARD WORK. THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS WHAT SEPARATES JOE BIDEN FROM HIS OPPONENT. HE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT EVERY AMERICAN. HE DOES NOT HAVE A MEAN-SPIRITED BONE IN HIS BODY. I HAVE SEEN HIM SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE, STRANGERS, THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE HEARS ABOUT THEIR HARDSHIP. HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH. WHEN HE SEES A KID, HIS EYES LIGHT UP BECAUSE HE THINKS ABOUT HIS OWN KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. JOE BIDEN TRIES TO LIVE THE VALUES WE CHERISH , HONESTY, HARD WORK, KINDNESS, HUMILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE OUT. THAT USED TO BE THE DEFINITION OF MANLINESS, NOT STRUTTING AND SHOWING OFF, ACTING IMPORTANT, BULLYING PEOPLE. IT USED TO BE BEING A MAN MEANT TAKING CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE, NOT GOING AROUND BRAGGING, BUT DOING THE WORK. NOT LOOKING FOR CREDIT. TRYING TO LIBERATE , TO LIVE RIGHT, PASSING ALONG THOSE VALUES TO YOUR KIDS, LOOKING OUT FOR COMMUNITY, CARRYING YOUR WEIGHT, GIVING UP A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HELP SOMEBODY WHO HAS A REAL NEED. WHEN YOU ELECT JOE, THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL SEE REFLECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THOUGH SHOULD NOT BE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THEY DID NOT USED TO BE. THEY ARE WHAT WE GROW UP LEARNING FROM OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. AND THEY ARE THE VALUES WE STILL TRY TO TEACH OUR KIDS. THEY ARE NOT WHITE OR BLACK OR HISPANIC OR ASIAN OR NATIVE AMERICAN VALUES, THEY ARE AMERICAN VALUES, AND WE HAVE GOT TO RECLAIM THEM RIGHT NOW, BUT TO RECLAIM THEM, WE WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IF WE ARE GOING TO RECLAIM THOSE VALUES, WE NEED TO LEAVE NO DOUBT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT. NOT THIS TIME.. NOT IN THIS ELECTION. WE GOT A LITTLE COMPLACENT THE LAST ELECTION. LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND WHY AMERICANS GET FRUSTRATED AND SOMETIMES THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, VOTING WILL NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT PERFECT, EVEN WHEN IT IS WORKING. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM, BUT WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. A PRESIDENT CANNOT BY HIMSELF SOLVE EVERY CHALLENGE FACING THE ECONOMY HERE IN FLINT OR MICHIGAN, BUT IF WE ELECT PEOPLE LIKE GARY PETERS AND DAN KILDEE AND IF WE GET A HOUSE AND A SENATE JOINT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ARE MORE FOCUSED ON WORKING PEOPLE AND GETTING YOU THE HELP THAT THEY NEED , THAT YOU NEED, THEY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND FOLKS WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE. A PRESIDENT BY HIMSELF CANNOT ELIMINATE ALL RACIAL BIAS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT IF WE ELECT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND STATE ATTORNEYS AND SHERIFFS FOCUSED ON EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND WE ONCE AGAIN HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT CARES ABOUT THESE ISSUES, WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND THAT IS WHAT VOTING IS ABOUT, NOT MAKING THINGS PERFECT BUT MAKING THINGS BETTER. IT PUTS US ON A TRACK SO THAT GENERATIONS FROM NOW, WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY, RIGHT ABOUT THEN, THINGS STARTED GETTING BETTER AGAIN. THE FACT THAT YOU DO NOT GET 100% OF WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT AWAY IS NOT A GOOD REASON TO VOTE. YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ADDED. , AT IT. TYPICALLY, JUST OVER 50% OF US VOTE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. ALMOST HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN MOST ELECTIONS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE DO NOT VOTE. IMAGINE IF 60% OF US VOTED. IMAGINE IF 70% OF US VOTED. IMAGINE, JANUARY 20, WHEN WE SWEAR IN A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WHO HAVE A PLAN TO GET US OUT OF THIS MESS, WHO CARE ABOUT FOLKS LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES, WHO KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO STRUGGLE, WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WORK HARD, WHO THINK ABOUT WORKING AMERICANS AND HAVE A PLAN TO HELP YOU GET AHEAD. IMAGINE WHAT'LL BE LIKE TO , WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVE AND SCIENCE AND WHO BELIEVE IN RACIAL EQUALITY AND ARE SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER AND ARE DOING THE WORK TO BRING US CLOSER SO THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA WHERE NO MATTER WHAT WE LOOK LIKE OR WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHO WE LOVE OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE, WE CAN MAKE IT. AND WE HAVE A PLACE WHERE WE ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I AM ASKING YOU TO REMEMBER THAT'S POSSIBLE. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHAT THIS COUNTRY CAN BE, BUT YOU CANNOT JUST IMAGINE A BETTER FUTURE. YOU CANNOT JUST WISH FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. WE HAVE TO OUT HUSSLE THE OTHER SIDE , OUT HUS THE OTHER SIDETLE , WE HAVE TO OUT HUSTLE THE OTHER SIDE, LEAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT WHO WE ARE INTO THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. IF WE DO, WE WILL SEND GARY PETERS BACK TO THE SENATE AND WE WILL ELECT A MAN WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND WHO CARES ABOUT YOU AND WHO WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AND LOOK OUT NOT JUST FOR FOLKS WHO SUPPORT HIM BUT EVEN THE FOLKS WHO DO NOT. MY FRIENDS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT KIND OF REMINDS YOU OF HOW GOOD IT CAN BE LISTENING TO HIM, DOESN'T IT? GOD LOVE HIM. HE IS A GOOD MAN. FOLKS, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK WITH FRIENDS. NEELY, GOVERNOR WHITMER, DEBBIE STABENOW, MY BUDDY, GARY PETERS, WHO YOU WILL SEND BACK TO THE SENATE, BECAUSE I AM GOING TO NEED HIM. YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON HIM TO BE A SENATOR FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. MY GOOD FRIEND, CONGRESSMAN DAN KILDY, A GOOD MAN. AND, OF COURSE, I WISH WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND BACK A GUY WHO WE USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION UP IN SCRANTON WE WOULD SAY WHEN SOMEBODY WASN'T SOMEBODY ELSE'S EQUAL. WE WOULD SAY, HE WAS NOT A PATCH ON HIS JEANS. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU WERE STILL DRIVING HIM CRAZY BECAUSE HE IS NOT A PATCH ON YOUR JEANS. BARACK OBAMA, IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH THE PRESIDENT AGAIN. IT IS A REMINDER OF A PRESIDENT OF CHARACTER, RESPECTIVE, TO OUR KIDS LOOKED UP TO IN LOOK UP TO. , AND LOOK UP TO. BARACK OBAMA WAS A GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE SAY AGAIN TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WE WENT THROUGH EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT ONE SINGLE TRACE OF SCANDAL. NOT ONE SINGLE TRACE OF SCANDAL. IT WILL BE NICE TO RETURN TO THAT. FLINT, THREE DAYS. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THIS PRESIDENCY WE HAVE NOW THAT HAS DIVIDED THE NATION. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THE PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE ALL ACROSS THIS NATION AND MADE US A LAUGHING STOCK AROUND THE WORLD. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. MILLIONS MORE ARE VOTING TODAY, TOMORROW, AND, GOD WILLING, ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CLOSE OF THE POLLS ON TUESDAY. AND MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. THE POWER TO CHANGE THE COUNTRY IS NOT FIGURATIVELY, IT IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. I DO NOT CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES, THERE IS NOTHING , LET ME SAY IT AGAIN , THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO TO STOP THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION FROM VOTING IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS AND TAKING BACK THIS MARKER SEE. AND WHEN AMERICANS VOTE, NO MATTER HOW MANY THREATS HE MAKES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE WILL BE ALLOWED AND IT IS GOING TO BE CLEAR. IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME. WE ARE DONE WITH THE CHAOS, THE TWEETS, THE ANGER, THE HATE, THE FAILURE, THE REFUSAL TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND IF I AM ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. WE ARE GOING TO ACT. WE ARE GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP IN DOING IT AS WELL. WE WILL HAVE TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, I WILL PUT INTO ACTION A PLAN I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, ALREADY LAID OUT, NATIONAL MANDATE, MASK WEARING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING, TRACING, ALL THINGS, AS PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST SAID, COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE MONTHS AGO. THE PLAN INCLUDES FULL, FAIR, AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS AND A VACCINE WHEN WE GET ONE. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WORE A MASK INSTEAD OF MOCKING IT. I CAN TELL YOU THIS. WE WOULD NOT HAVE 9 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF COBIT IN THIS NATION , CASES OF COVID IN THIS NATION. 90,000 CASES TODAY, YESTERDAY. BY THE WAY, 500,000 IN THE PAST WEEK. THIS GUY TELLS US IT IS GOING AWAY. WHAT MAKES IT GO AWAY IS IF HE GOES AWAY. FOLKS, WE WOULD NOT BE FACING ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THIS PRESIDENT KNEW IN JANUARY THE VIRUS WAS DEADLY AND TRIED TO IMPROVE HIS IMAGE. HE TRIED TO TALK TO BOB WOODWARD. HE THOUGHT HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND. BUT WHAT HE DID IT, HE LET IT BE KNOWN, ALL THE WAY BACK IN JANUARY, HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THIS WAS AND HE HIT IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WAS WORSE THAN THE FLU, BUT HE LIED FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WOULD NOT DISAPPEAR, BUT HE KEPT TELLING US A MIRACLE WAS COMING. YESTERDAY, HE HAD THE GALL TO SUGGEST THAT AMERICAN DOCTORS, PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE ON THE FRONT LINES TO SAVE OTHER LIVES, ALONG WITH NURSES AND SO MANY OTHERS, HE SUGGESTED FALSELY THAT THEY ARE INFLATING THE NUMBER OF COVID DEATHS TO MAKE MORE MONEY. WHAT IN THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN? EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE, BUT THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS PERVERTED. HE MAY BELIEVE IT BECAUSE HE DOES NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FOR MONEY. PEOPLE IN THIS NATION HAVE SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED FOR NINE MONTHS, NONE MORE SO THAN THE DOCTORS ON THE FRONT LINES IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS, AND THIS PRESIDENT IS QUESTIONING THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR INTEGRITY, THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS. IT IS MORE THAN OFFENSIVE. IT IS A DISGRACE, ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A PRESIDENT WHO HAS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER TO THIS VIRUS. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE GIVEN THEIR ALL TO BEAT THE VIRUS. THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN UP. I WILL NEVER RAISE THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. WE WILL BEAT THIS VIRUS AND WE WILL GET IT UNDER CONTROL. IN THE FIRST STEP TO DOING THAT , AND THE FIRST STEP TO DOING THAT IS BEATING DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP KEEPS TELLING US WHAT A GREAT JOB HE HAS DONE AS PRESIDENT. OH, MAN. WELL, DID YOU KNOW THAT PRESIDENT AND , PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I CREATED MORE JOBS IN OUR FIRST YEAR THAN HE DID IN HIS FIRST THREE? HOW ABOUT THIS? DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS TO FINISH HIS TERM WITH FEWER JOBS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THAN WHEN HE STARTED. LOOK, THAT IS A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. THAT IS A LOT OF CRISES, BUT ONLY DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE FEWER JOBS AT THE END OF HIS PRESIDENCY THAN WHEN HE STARTED. BC , YOU SEE, I AND BARACK UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU DID. WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. HE IS GOING TO WAGE WAR ON AMERICAN LABOR. I SEE THE UAW SIGN OUT THERE. THEY FIRST ENDORSED ME WHEN I WAS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID, GOD LOVE YOU. LOOK, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE PORTING WORK, NOT WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. UNDER MY PLAN, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR, YOU WILL NOT PAY A PENNY IN ADDITIONAL TAXES, BUT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE, THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAY , PAID ZERO AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAST YEAR. THEY WILL START TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THEY WILL PAY THE SAME RATE THEY DID AT THE BEGINNING OF GEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION. INCORPORATIONS WILL START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. , AND CORPORATIONS WILL START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. WHY SHARE , SHOULD A NURSE PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE? MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THAN DONALD TRUMP? HE PAID $75 IN TAXES THE YEAR WE KNOW OF. I RELEASED 22 YEARS OF MY TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND LOOK. HE HAS NOT RELEASED ONE. HE TALKS ABOUT CORRUPTION. WHAT IS HE HIDING? HE OWES $41 MILLION. WHO DOES HE OWE IT TO? IF YOU HAVE NOTICED, HE IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT I KNOW OF THAT HAS A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT IN CHINA. HE PAID 50 TIMES MORE TAXES IN BEIJING THEN HE HAS PAID IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THIS GUY TALKS ABOUT CORRUPTION? LOOK, WE WILL ALSO ACT TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE. TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS JUST JAMMED THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON. LIKE BARACK SAID, THE PRESIDENT SAID, THEY HAVE TRIED OVER 50 SHOTS TO TAKE OUT OBAMACARE, DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BUT THEY WILL BE IN COURT, I BELIEVE IN SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, WIN OR LOSE THEY WILL BE IN COURT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 4 MILLION MICHIGANDERS. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. BARACK AND I THINK IT IS A RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMACARE, WE WILL BUILD ON IT. WE WILL KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE IT, AND YOU CAN CHOOSE A MEDICARE LIKE PUBLIC OPTION IF YOU DO NOT. WE WILL LOWER PREMIUMS, DEDUCTIBLES, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. REDUCE PRESCRIPTION JUG COST BY 60%. , DRUG COST BY 60%. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP LAID OUT IF , OUT WHAT HE WILL DO IN HIS SECOND TERM TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF YOU GET THAT PASSED, IT WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023, SOMETHING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIVE ON, PAID FOR FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE. I SAID SIX YEARS AGO, REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE MEDICARE. THEY SAID THAT IS CRAZY. THE FIRST THING PAUL RYAN AND THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS DID WAS TRY TO CUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF MEDICARE. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. I AM GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND MEDICAID. IT IS A LIFELINE FOR SO MANY HARD-WORKING FOLKS. BUT, FOLKS, I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU , THIS IS KIND OF PERSONAL WITH ME , THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN MY VIEW THAN THE WAY HE SPEAKS ABOUT OUR WOMEN AND MEN IN UNIFORM AND THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY SON BEAU WAS A MAJOR IN THE U.S. ARMY. HE GAVE UP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S JOB AND PETITION TO BE ABLE TO GO WITH HIS UNIT TO IRAQ FOR ONE SOLID YEAR. BEING IN KOSOVO, I MIGHT ADD , I WILL BE ATYPICAL DAD , HE IS THE ONLY FOREIGNER IN KOSOVO THAT HAS A MEMORIAL DID , A MEMORIAL DEDICATED TO HIM, THE HIGHWAY, THE BEAU BIDEN HIGHWAY, DEDICATED TO HIM BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT. GUESS WHAT? HE WAS NOT A SUCKER OR LOSER, NOR ARE ANY OF YOU WHO SERVED. YOU ARE PATRIOTS. THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF , I LOVE THIS. HE LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY. ANYWAY, A MACHO MAN. BUT WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU READ ABOUT, SAW, HEARD ABOUT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LITERALLY BEING LAUGHED AT BY WORLD LEADERS WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE UNITED NATIONS? LAUGHED AT OUT LOUD. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BEING OPENLY MOCKED BY THE LEADERS OF NATO AT A NATO CONFERENCE? AND CAN YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PUPPY? PUTIN PUT BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS SERVING IN IRAQ, AND TRUMP WAS TOO SCARED TO CHALLENGE HIM. HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. TRUMP IS NOT STRONG. HE IS WEAK. HE COMMANDS LITTLE RESPECT ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SACRIFICE, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND COURAGE, THE PHYSICAL COURAGE IT TAKES TO SERVE IN UNIFORM IN A WAR ZONE. MAYBE THAT IS WHY SIX GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO WORKED FOR HIM HIS ADMINISTRATION AND SAID HE WAS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME ANY PRESIDENT HAS HAD THAT HAPPEN? TOUGH GUY. THAT IS WHY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OR GENERAL CHRISMAN, THAT IS WHY THE HEAD OF THE NAVY SEALS, AND 22 OTHER FOUR STARS SUPPORT ME. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE WILL RESPECT THEM, WE WILL SUPPORT THEM. I HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF WAR ZONES AS SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT OVER 35 TIMES. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE FOLKS WE HAVE, ONLY 1% OF THE COUNTRY IS IN THE MILITARY. WE OVER THEM. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE, THE SINEW, THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY AND GET RID OF TRUMP. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A GUY WHO SAYS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. HE CALLS IT A HOAX. I SEE IT AS JOBS, HEALTH, AND SAFETY. THE IMPACTS ON CLIMATE ART , ON CLIMATE TOO OFTEN FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE WILL MAKE SURE THEY BENEFIT FROM THE BILLIONS OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT WE WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE LOCAL JOBS TO REBUILD ROADS, BUILD SIDEWALKS, INSTALL BROADBAND, CREATE PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK SAFELY, MODERNIZE INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU CAN TURN ON THE WATER AND CLEAN WATER COMES OUT, SO THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN AMERICA. WE CAN AND MUST DO THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS ROLLED BACK MORE THAN 100 ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION LAWS, MANY ENACTED UNDER BARACK AND ME. IT WILL ALSO HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE WITH THE MOST AMBITIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN EVER. PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING OR POLLUTING. VIOLENCE CANNOT BE TOLERATED AND IT WON'T, BUT THESE PROTESTS ARE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE, WILL INSPIRE A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. AMERICANS HAVE THEIR EYES OPENED UP. THEY ARE READY. LOOK, I BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY HAS TO COME TOGETHER. I KNOW WHEN I ANNOUNCED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO UNITE THE COUNTRY, EVERYBODY SAID THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. YOU DID IT BEFORE, YOU CANNOT DO IT AGAIN. WELL, WE CAN AND WE MUST WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACIES WORK. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE, A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE, SO PLEASE VOTE. IF YOU STILL HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT, GET IT TO A DROPBOX AS SOON AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN ALSO SAFELY VOTE EARLY UNTIL MONDAY AFTERNOON OR ON ELECTION DAY. JUST MAKE A PLAN. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. AS YOU HAVE HEARD 10 TIMES ALREADY. VISIT IWILLVOTE.COM/MI. FOLKS, WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. WE HAVE GOT TO VOTE UP AND DOWN THE TICKET HERE. I, HONEST TO GOD, BELIEVE , I GIVE YOU MY WORD , I BELIEVE WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE SUCH ENORMOUS PROGRESS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN WHAT THE OTHER LOOKS LIKE. THEY HAVE GOTTEN A GLIMPSE OF THE ABYSS. I MEAN IT APPEARED THEY ARE READY TO CHANGE SO MUCH. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED TO SEND US TO THE MOON, A PHRASE THAT GUIDED ME. HE SAID, WE ARE DOING IT BECAUSE WE ""REFUSED TO POSTPONE."" I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN, DIVIDING AMERICA, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS WRONG. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING THEM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS TIME FOR US TO STAND BACK AND STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE HAVE BEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD TECH OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

IT IS TIME FOR US TO HEAR LEADERS THAT WILL GUIDE THIS NATION THROUGH THE FOREST OF BIGOTRY. A LEADER WHO KNOWS HOW TO BUILD BRIDGES THAT UNITE US AND NOT BUILD WALLS THAT DIVIDE. THIS INDIVIDUAL LEADER NEEDS TO BE ONE THAT COMES FROM MORE OF A BIBLICAL MOTIFF, AND THAT IS HE NEEDS TO BE A SERVANT. A SERVANT IS ONE THAT SERVES OTHERS MORE THAN THEY DO THESE , DO THEMSELVES. HE HAS SERVED NEXT TO THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BARACK OBAMA. FOR TWO TERMS. HE IS A SERVANT BECAUSE HE HAS SERVED NOT ONLY NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BUT HE HAS SERVED IN THE PLACE CALLED THE SENATE BEING A SENATOR. HIS YEARS OF SERVING HAVE BEEN OVER 40 YEARS IN PUBLIC OFFICE. NOT ONLY WILL IT TAKE A SERVANT, BUT IT WILL ALSO TAKE A SUFFERER, SOMEONE WHO FEELS WHAT WE FEEL. HE HIS ONE THAT HAS , HE IS ONE THAT HAS SUFFERED THE TRAGEDY OF DEATH IN HIS OWN LIFE , A WIFE, A SON, AND THEREFORE HE CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH OTHER SUFFERERS. HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS. I KNOW HE FEELS LET BECAUSE , I KNOW HE FEELS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A SUFFERER. I KNOW HE FEELS THE DEATH OF MANY, OVER 250,000 INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED DEATH HIMSELF, HE CAN RELATE TO THE DEATH OF MANY LIVES THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOT ONLY MUST HE BE A SERVANT, NOT ONLY MUST HE BE A SUFFERER, BUT HE ALSO MUST BE A SUSTAINER, SOMEBODY THAT IS ABLE TO GET BACK ON TRACK WHO HAVE FALLEN OFF THE TRACK. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT ALL OF US REMEMBER 2008, WHEN THEY GAVE OVER THIS COUNTRY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHAT I WOULD CALL A SINKING TITANIC.ECONOMICALLY WE WERE IN THE WATERS OF RECESSION. SOME SAID VERY CLOSE TO ANOTHER DEPRESSION. BUT SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, THEY GOT TOGETHER, PLUGGED UP THE HOLES, PULLED THIS SINKING TITANIC OUT OF THE WATERS AND GUIDED US BACK TO THE SHORES THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN IN. SO I SAY TO YOU, AND I SAY TO ALL OF US, THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO WHAT WE USED TO BE, IT IS GOING TO TAKE A SERVANT. IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE WHO IS A SUFFERER AND A SUSTAINER, AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE PERSON OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS COMPOSITE RATE, HIS , HIS COMPADRE, HIS PARTNER, SISTER HARRIS, WILL BE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE CAME FROM AND NOT GO BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE. SO I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. [HORNS HONKING] HELLO. HELLO, PHILADELPHIA. IT IS GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE. I WANT TO THANK SHARON BAPTIST CHURCH FOR LETTING US BORROW YOUR PARKING LOT. AND THE DNC CHAIR, VICE CHAIR. I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT MAN CAN MAKE A SPEECH, CAN'T HE? VICE CHAIR BLAKE, FOR ALL YOU DO, FOR OUR PARTY, AND ALL YOU DO TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN DWIGHT EVANS, FOR COMING OUT AND SPEAKING TODAY, AND ALL YOU DO TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF PHILADELPHIA EVERYTHING WILL DAY IN CONGRESS. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BISHOP HUNTER, AND REVEREND MARK TYLER, STATE REPRESENTATIVES. WHERE IS MORGAN? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND BISHOP LEWIS FELTON. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SHARON BAPTIST CHURCH CHOIR. AREN'T THEY GREAT? [HONKING] ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST ENJOYED ABOUT BEING BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WAS MEETING WITH BLACK FAITH LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE CHURCHES I GET TO GO TO DURING THE PRIMARIES AND OVER 400 BLACK LEADERS, CHURCH LEADERS, SUPPORTING US. ALMOST EVERY SUNDAY I GET TO SIT IN THE PEW AND GET INSPIRED. I GO TO MASS EARLY IN THE MORNING, THEN I GO TO THE BLACK CHURCH TO GET SOME HOPE AND INVIGORATION. I TALKED TO PEOPLE AND HEAR WHAT IS ON THEIR MINDS, PRAY WITH THEM, AND GUESS WHAT? IT WAS RENEWING. IT WAS NOT ABOUT ME, BUT OUR ENTIRE FAMILY. JILL WOULD BE WITH ME AND MY GRANDKIDS, ONE OF MY GRANDKIDS IS WITH ME TODAY, A SENIOR IN COLLEGE. I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, IT HAS BEEN UNLIKE ANY CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY. THERE IS ONE THING THAT REMAINS THE SAME. WE HAVE TO EARN OUR DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. AS MY LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS REMINDED US, FREEDOM IS NOT A STATE. FREEDOM IS AN ACT. WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT, WE HAVE TO VOTE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAVE TO VOTE LIKE WE NEVER DID BEFORE. EVERY DAY IS A NEW REMINDER OF HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE. OF HOW FAR THE OTHER SIDE WILL GO TO TRY TO SUPPRESS THE TURNOUT, ESPECIALLY HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TERRIFIED OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE KNOWS THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA GET TO HAVE THEIR SAY, IF YOU HAVE YOUR SAY, HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. [HONKING] BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. 90 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. [HORNS HONKING] THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THERE IS TOO MUCH ON THE LINE TO SIT IT OUT. WE HAVE TWO MORE DAYS. TWO MORE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THIS PRESIDENCY THAT HAS, SINCE THE BEGINNING, SOUGHT TO DIVIDE US, TO TEAR US APART. FOLKS, IN TWO DAYS, WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENT THAT HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. IN TWO DAYS, WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE, POURED GASOLINE ON EVERY OPPORTUNITY HE HAD ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE IN THE TWO DAYS AHEAD. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PENNSYLVANIANS WHO HAVE NOT VOTED YET. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE ON TUESDAY. MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. PENNSYLVANIA IS CRITICAL IN THIS ELECTION. [HORNS HONKING] I LIVE IN DELAWARE, BUT I WAS BORN IN SCRANTON. [HORNS HONKING] I AM A PENNSYLVANIA BOY. [HORNS HONKING] I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE LAST TIME DONALD TRUMP RAN, HE WON THIS STATE BY 44,000 VOTES. SO EVERY SINGLE VOTE MATTERS. THE POWER THE POWER TO CHANGE , THIS COUNTRY IS IN YOUR HANDS. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES. THERE IS NOTHING HE IS GOING TO DO TO STOP THIS NATION FROM VOTING, NO MATTER WHAT HE TRIES. [HORNS HONKING] AND FOLKS, WHEN AMERICANS VOTE, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS GOING TO BE LOUD AND CLEAR. IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: IT IS TIME TO BREATHE SOME LIFE BACK INTO THIS NATION. WE ARE DONE, WE ARE TIRED OF THE TWEETS, THE ANGER, THE HATE, THE FAILURE, THE IRRESPONSIBILITY. [HORNS HONKING] WE HAVE A LOT WORK TO DO. IF I'M ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AND WE ARE GOING TO ACT AND START FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE GOING TO ACT TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. IT IS ALMOST CRIMINAL, THE WAY HE HAS HANDLED IT. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, I'M GOING TO PUT IN ACTION A PLAN I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, MASKING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING, TRACING. A PLAN FOR FULL AND FAIR AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS, VACCINE, WHEN WE GET ONE. A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE WAY THIS VIRUS HAS BEEN HITTING AND DEVASTATING THE BLACK COMMUNITY ACROSS AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: FOLKS, EVERY SINGLE DAY, WE ARE SEEING RACE-BASED DISPARITIES IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS VIRUS. HIGHER INFECTION RATES, LOWER ACCESS TO TESTING, HARDER TIME QUARANTINING SAFELY, LOWER ACCESS TO QUALITY TREATMENT WHEN YOU BECOME INFECTED, AND TRAGICALLY, HIGHER MORTALITY RATES. THREE TIMES AS MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE DYING AS WHITE AMERICANS. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: WHEN THEY GET THE VIRUS. ONE IN 100 BLACK AMERICANS , EXCUSE ME, ONE IN 1000 BLACK AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19. AND IF WE DON'T CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE IN 500 BY THE END OF THIS PANDEMIC. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS A MASS CASUALTY EVENT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND IT IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY, TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR. MY PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN WILL ENSURE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST BY THIS VIRUS ARE A PRIORITY, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. WE ARE GOING TO PLAN TO GET OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, NOT GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, BUT BUILD BACK BETTER, [HORNS HONKING] TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS DEALT IN ON A FULL-SCALE SHARE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS AND BUILD ECONOMIC EQUALITY. WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THEY HAVE SEEN HOW BAD THINGS ARE. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO START A BUSINESS. TO BUY YOUR FIRST HOME. TO PURSUE AND EDUCATION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT BEEN BURDENED WITH DEBT. TO INVEST IN HBCUS THAT DO SO MUCH TO MOLD BLACK LEADERS OF TOMORROW. I MEAN IT. [HORNS HONKING] THIS IS NOT JUST TALK. I MEAN THAT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] I SEE IN ALL THE PROTESTS HERE IN PHILADELPHIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY A CRY FOR JUSTICE. [HORNS HONKING] PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING, AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE, [HORNS HONKING] WALTER WALLACE JUNIOR, THEY WILL NOT SOON BE FOR COTTON. [HORNS HONKING] THEY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY ME, NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY YOU, AND THEY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY ARE INSPIRING A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. GEORGE FLOYD'S LITTLE GIRL, SIX YEARS OLD SAID TO ME WHEN I WANT TO BE WITH THE FAMILY. I KNELT DOWN AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID, ""DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD."" THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID TO ME. SIX YEARS OLD. DADDY. [HORNS HONKING] LOOK, WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. WE CAN CHANGE IT. WE ALL KNOW THIS COUNTRY HAS TO COME TOGETHER. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF ANGER, HATE, AND DIVISION WE HAVE SEEN UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. [HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, LOOK. FROM THE DAY HE ANNOUNCED, THE MOMENT A CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR, WHAT DID HE SAY? IN NEW YORK, HE SAID, WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND GET THOSE RAPIST MEXICANS. RAPIST MEXICANS. HE PUT A BAN ON ALL MUSLIMS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES. AND THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. LOOK, FOLKS WE HAVE TO COME , TOGETHER. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT FOR EVERYBODY. [HORNS HONKING] I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO SUPPORT ME. I MEAN IT. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. THE DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. [HORNS HONKING] IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMERICA, THERE WILL BE NO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES. THERE WILL ONLY BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] LOOK, OUR FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY IS BEING TESTED. BUT OUR FAITH IN GOD IS HELPING US THROUGH BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. [HORNS HONKING] THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT, LOVE OUR NEIGHBORS AS OURSELVES. [HORNS HONKING] AND OUR DEDICATION TO NEVER GROW WEARY OF DOING GOOD. BEING WITH YOU ALL REMINDS ME OF THAT GOSPEL HYMN THAT INSPIRED SO MANY OF US. WHEN I LAST TALKED TO JOHN LEWIS WHEN HE WAS DYING, HE REMINDED ME OF IT. I DON'T FEEL NO WAYS TIRED. [HORNS HONKING] I'VE COME TOO FAR FROM WHERE I STARTED FROM. [HORNS HONKING] NOBODY TOLD ME THE ROAD WOULD BE EASY. [HORNS HONKING] I DON'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT ME THIS FAR TO LEAVE ME. [HORNS HONKING] HE DID NOT LEAVE US. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE NOT TIRED. [HORNS HONKING] THE ROAD HAS NOT BEEN EASY. [HORNS HONKING] BUT WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO STOP NOW. SO, PLEASE, VOTE. [HORNS HONKING] GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO VOTE. WE NEED TO GET EVERY SOUL IN PHILADELPHIA TO THE POLLS. YOUR VOICE, YOUR VOTE MATTERS. YOUR VOICE MATTERS. YOUR VOICE DESERVES TO BE HEARD. IF YOU STILL HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT, GET IT TO WAY DROPBOX AS SOON AS YOU CAN, OR YOU CAN VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. BUT MAKE A PLAN. I MEAN IT MAKE A PLAN. , MAKE A PLAN NOW. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/PA. FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A WHILE. ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE IN DELAWARE ACROSS THE LINE, WAS BECAUSE OF THE FOLKS IN PENNSYLVANIA. ALL THE MEDIA AND DELAWARE FOR , ALL OF THE MEDIA IN PENNSYLVANIA AND IN DELAWARE, WAS ALL PHILADELPHIA TELEVISION. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THE MONIKER OF BEING KNOWN AS PHILADELPHIA'S THIRD SENATOR. I KNOW PHILADELPHIA WELL. I MARRIED A PHILLY GIRL, BY THE WAY. [HORNS HONKING] BY THE WAY I HAVE GOT MY EAGLES , JACKET ON. [HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY, AND I WILL CONCLUDE. YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED WE WERE GOING TO GO TO THE MOON. HE SAID WORDS THAT MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE ALWAYS USED TO , KID ME FOR REPEATING. HE SAID, WE ARE DOING IT BECAUSE WE AMERICANS, WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. WELL I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE , INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I REFUSE TO POSTPONE WHAT WE CAN DO. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] THERE IS NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. [HORNS HONKING] THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA PART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP'S BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR THE BEGINNING. DIVIDING AMERICA BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, GENDER, NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS WRONG. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING HIM WHO WE ARE. [HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, AND I MEAN THIS. IT IS NOT JUST CAMPAIGN RHETORIC. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. [HORNS HONKING] WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. [HORNS HONKING] AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES, THE MULTIPLE LIES HE REPEATS. IT IS TIME TO STAND UP. [HORNS HONKING] IT IS TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. [HORNS HONKING] WE CAN DO THIS. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. [HORNS HONKING] I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. YOU BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOD LOVE YOU ALL. KEEP THE FAITH. EVERY TIME I WALK INTO MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE IN SCRANTON, HE WOULD YELL KEEP THE FAITH. MY GRANDFATHER , MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD SAY, NO, JOEY, SPREAD IT. LET'S SPREAD THE FAITH.

I AM A FOURTH GENERATION UNION STRONG HERE IN PITTSBURGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] I HAVE BEEN A PROUD MEMBER AT 1050 84 11 YEARS. FOUR YEARS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HE WOULD CREATE JOBS. TODAY THERE ARE 200,000 FEWER JOBS IN THIS STATE THAN WHEN BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN LEFT OFFICE. HE CAMPAIGNED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA IN 2016 PROMISING A MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. INFRASTRUCTURE MADE WITH AMERICAN STEEL IN PITTSBURGH. HE NEVER EVEN REALLY TRIED TO DELIVER. INSTEAD HE SPENT HIS TIME GIVING TAX BREAKS TO WALL STREET AND THE SUPER WEALTHY WHILE UNDERMINING UNIONS AND LEAVING WORKING FAMILIES BEHIND. FROM THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE WORLD, HE HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF RACIAL TENSION, PUTTING THE LIVES OF 70 PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME IN DANGER , SO MANY PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME IN DANGER. WE CANNOT STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS IT IS FINE TO KEEP WORKERS DOWN SO LONG AS THE NUMBERS ON THE STOCK MARKET GO UP. WE CANNOT KEEP WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HE WILL SAY NEXT TO DEEPEN THE RACIAL DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TO STAND UP AND ELECT THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO SHARES THE VALUES OF WORKING PEOPLE AND WILL EMPOWER US TO SUCCEED. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. JOE UNDERSTANDS THE STRUGGLES THAT WORKING COMMUNITY SPACE BECAUSE JOE IS ONE OF US. HE IS FROM PENNSYLVANIA. SCRANTON IS NOT FAR AWAY. THE VALUES JOE LEARNED IN SCRANTON, HARD WORK, EMPATHY, ARE THE SAME VALUES HE HAS CARRIED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT. THERE , THEY ARE THE SAME VALUES HE IS GOING TO TAKE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. AS PRESIDENT JOE IS GOING TO HELP COMMUNITIES RECOVER FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AND THEN BUT WORKING PEOPLE IN WESTERN PA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AT THE CENTER OF EFFORTS TO BUILD BACK A BETTER ECONOMY. [CARS HONKING] HE'S GOING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND HE WILL ENCOURAGE UNIONIZATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT WORKERS IN UNIONS, NOT WALL STREET, BUILT THIS COUNTRY. [CARS HONKING] JOE IS GOING TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, WHO THEY LOVE WHAT THEY DO FOR LIVING ARE TREATED WITH THE EQUAL AMOUNT OF DIGNITY AND RESPECT. WE ARE A MATTER OF HOURS AWAY FROM THE END OF THE SELECTION AND THE WORK WE DO TOMORROW WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE PUT A CHAMPION FOR THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN OFFICE OR CONTINUE TO BE PUSHED AROUND BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. TO ME, THE CHOICE IS EASY. TOMORROW, LET'S GET A PLAN, LET'S GO OUT AND LET'S VOTE, AND LET'S VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. HELP ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] (music) HELLO, PITTSBURGH! I'M JOE BIDEN. LADY GAGA'S FRIEND. WE GO BACK A WHILE. SHE HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME HELPING ME WITH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND SO MANY WOMEN WHO NEEDED HELP , GOD LOVE YOU, YOU ARE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. FOLKS, JOHN, THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY, AND THANKS TO MR. MAYOR , I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THANKS FOR THE PASSPORT INTO TOWN.

YOU COULDN'T SEE BUT ALL OF MY GRANDKIDS WERE OVER THERE AND WIN YOU WERE SINGING, THEY KNEW EVERY WORD OF EVERY SONG, THEY WERE JUMPING AND MOVING. I'VE GOT TO GET A PICTURE WITH THEM. ANYWAY. MY BUDDY, CONGRESSMAN MARK DOYLE , THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH ME AND FIGHTING FOR THE DIGNITY OF WORKING PEOPLE. EVERYONE YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS IN PHILADELPHIA, WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEARLY. CONGRESSMAN BOYLE HAS BEEN WITH ME A WHILE, A REMARKABLE FRIEND. HIS DAD AND I GREW UP FIVE BLOCKS AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER IN SCRANTON. BOB CASEY, PATTI LABELLE AND JOHN LEGEND. JOHN, I'M VOTING FOR YOU AFTER THAT SPEECH. LOOK, DOUG, I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. I WANT TO THANK THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, A WOMAN I AM SO PROUD TO RUN ALONGSIDE, KAMALA HARRIS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] LOOK, I KNOW AS A SCRANTON BOY, AND FROM CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO BRING WESTERN AND EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE STEELERS GOT A BIG WIN YESTERDAY AND THE EAGLES GOT A BIG WIN LAST NIGHT. THEY CAN BOTH BE HAPPY. [LAUGHS] AND FOLKS, I HAVE A FEELING WE ARE COMING TOGETHER FOR A BIG WIN TOMORROW. [RAUCOUS CHEERING] MY LORD, THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU OUT HERE ON THIS COLD NIGHT. THANK YOU. DON'T JUMP, I NEED YOU. FOLKS, LOOK , 18 MONTHS AGO WE KICKED OFF THE CAMPAIGN AT THE LOCAL 249 RIGHT HERE IN PITTSBURGH. I CHOSE WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA FOR MY FIRST START AS A CANDIDATE AND NOW AS MY LAST STOP BEFORE ELECTION DAY BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING FAMILIES ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT A FAIR SHOT, AND EVEN CHANCE, ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THE QUALITIES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY, THAT CREATED AND SUSTAINED THE MIDDLE CLASS. BY THE WAY, AS I SAID, UNIONS BILL TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE WE ANNOUNCED. AMERICA HAS FACED A CONFLUENCE OF CRISES UNLIKE ANYTHING IN LIVING MEMORY. WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. DECENCY, HONOR AND RESPECT. THEY ARE GONE WITH THIS PRESIDENT. TOMORROW IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW DAY! TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS LEFT HARD-WORKING AMERICANS IN THE COLD. TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS DIVIDED THIS NATION AND FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE. TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY WHO HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED, CLOSE TO 100 MILLION, AND MORE WILL VOTE TOMORROW. MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE , THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS COUNTRY IS IN YOUR HANDS, IN YOUR HANDS! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I DON'T CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES, THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT WILL STOP THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION FROM VOTING, PERIOD. AND WHEN AMERICA VOTES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD! AND WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE WILL BE LOUD AND CLEAR , IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY , THE CHAOS, THE CORRUPTION, THE FAILURE, THE IRRESPONSIBILITY, THE INDIFFERENCE TO AMERICAN LIVES, THE INDIFFERENCE TO AMERICAN DIGNITY. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. NOT THE VISION AND DISTRACTION, BUT REAL, REAL, REAL HEALING FOR THIS COUNTRY. IF YOU ELECT ME AS PRESIDENT, I WILL HEAL THIS COUNTRY AND WE WILL ACT, WE WILL ACT TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL BEGINNING DAY ONE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I WILL PUT AN ACTION PLAN I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, TESTING, TRACING, A PLAN FOR A PLAN FOR FULL AND FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS AND A VACCINE WHEN IT COMES. IMAGINE, IMAGINE WHERE WE COULD BE IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ONLY WORE A MASK IN THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF MOCKING THEM. I CAN TELL YOU THIS, AS EVERY EXPERT WILL TELL YOU, WE WOULD NOT HAVE 9 BILLION COVID CASES IN THIS NATION, OVER 230,000 DEATHS, NEARLY 100,000 CASES NATIONWIDE SINCE TWO DAYS AGO, WOULD NOT BE FACING ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS , THAT IS WHAT EXPERTS ARE TELLING US. IF WE DON'T CHANGE, 200,000 MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS PRESIDENT KNEW IN JANUARY THAT THIS VIRUS WAS DEADLY, BUT HE HIT IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WAS WORTH THE FLU , WORSE THAN THE FLU BUT HE LIED TO US. HE KNEW IT WAS NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR, HE KEPT TELLING US IT WOULD BE OVER BY EASTER. LAST FRIDAY HE HAD THE GALL TO SUGGEST THAT AMERICA'S DOCTORS, ON THE FRONTLINE LINE OF THE CRISIS, FOR NINE MONTHS, ALONG WITH NURSES AND FIRST RESPONDERS, HE SUGGESTED THE DOCTORS WERE FALSELY INFLATING THE DEATHS DUE TO COVID BECAUSE THEY WANTED MORE MONEY. FOR GOD'S SAKE. I REALLY MEAN IT, THINK ABOUT IT. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS, THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED FOR NINE WORDS , NINE MONTHS IN THIS QUESTION IS QUESTIONING THEIR CHARACTER, INTEGRITY, COMMITMENT TO THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS? IT IS A DISGRACE! LAST NIGHT, TRUMP WENT ON TO SAY HE WAS GOING TO FIRE DR. FAUCI. I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA, LET'S FIRE TRUMP AND I WILL HIRE FAUCI! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP HAS WAIVED WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. HE SAID I AM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND I WILL FIGHT THIS FIGHT , WITH ME A BREAK. , GIVE ME A BREAK. HE WAVED THE WHITE FLAG OF CEMENT OR , OF SURRENDER. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. THE FIRST STEP TO BEATING THE VIRUS IS BEATING DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING , DONALD TRUMP KEEPS TELLING US WHAT A GREAT JOB HE'S DONE AS PRESIDENT. AS I SAY, BLESS ME FATHER AS I , [LAUGHTER] HERE IS THE TRUTH, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS , THAT IS A LOT OF PRESIDENTS , THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS TO FINISH HIS TERM IN OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE STARTED. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS, NOT FROM A LIBERAL THINK TANK, BUT MOODY'S, WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS MY PLAN WILL CREATE 7 MILLION MORE JOBS AND A TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ECONOMIC GROUP , GROWTH MORE THAN ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS PROPOSED. SO WE CAN DO THIS. I AM GOING TO END TRUMPS TAX LOOPHOLES TO INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO SHIFT JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOT AS MANY JOBS HERE. I'M GOING TO AT A 10% SURTAX ON ANY COMPANY THAT SHIPS JOBS OVERSEAS. COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, BRING JOBS BACK, WILL GET THAT 10% TAX CREDIT. BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ABOUT $600 MILLION OF CONTRACTS A YEAR, FROM BUILDING AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO ALL THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT VIOLATES NO TRADE AGREEMENT, THERE WILL BE NO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS GIVEN OUT ON MY WATCH THAT DON'T MAKE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS HERE IN AMERICA. THE FUTURE WILL BE MADE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, IN PENNSYLVANIA. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, TRUMP SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. FROM WALL STREET. THAT'S ALL HE CAN SEE. I SEE IT FROM SCRANTON, WHERE I GREW UP. I SEE IT FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND DELAWARE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THE COUNTRY, AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOE, THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IN CORPORATE AMERICA IS UNION POWER! THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE CAN BE DEALT WITH. IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL SEE THE MOST PROUNION PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LOOK , I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ABOUT REWARDING WORK, NOT WEALTH. UNDER MY PLAN, AS KAMALA SAID, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000, YOU WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE IN TAXES. FINALLY, FINALLY, THE WEALTHIEST AMONG US, THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, 91 OF WHICH ON THE FORTUNE 500 PAY ZERO IN INCOME TAX, YOU WILL PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. WHY? WHY SHOULD AN IRONWORKER, AN EDUCATOR, A NURSE PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY? FOLKS , HERE IS A GOOD ONE , WHY SHOULD YOU BE PAYING MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP PAYS IN TAXES? [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] HE PAID $750 IN TAXES ONE YEAR. WHEN THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT IT A LITTLE BEFORE THAT, HE SAID THE REASON HE ALWAYS PAID THAT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SMART AND HE KNEW HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM. I AM SICK OF THE WEALTHY GUYS GAMING THE SYSTEM! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] MOST ARE WILLING TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, BY THE WAY, HE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT CORRUPTION. [LAUGHS] OH MY LORD. HE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT CORRUPTION. WE FOUND OUT LAST WEEK HE IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT I'VE EVER HEARD OF WHO HAS A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT IN CHINA, WHERE HE PAID 50 TIMES MORE TAXES IN BEIJING THAN HE DID IN THE UNITED STATES. FOLKS, AS MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE SAID, I ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. LOOK, WE HAVE TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE AS WELL. TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING LIKE THE DEVIL TO ELIMINATE THE HEALTH CARE PLAN. BY THE WAY, BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES AND SO MANY COMPANIES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, WE ALREADY HAVE 10 MILLION AMERICANS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST HEALTH CARE. NOW TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS JAMMED THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON , THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY , BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT MY PROBLEM , BY THE WAY, THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, SEVEN DAYS AFTER TOMORROW THEY WILL BE IN THE SUPREME COURT ARGUING TO WIPE OUT ALL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HURTING. I CAN REMEMBER AS A KID GROWING UP IN CLAYMONT AND WILMINGTON, SPLIT-LEVEL HOME WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDFATHER. ONE NIGHT I COULD HEAR MY DAD IN THE NEXT ROOM TALKING TO MY MOM. I ASKED ABOUT IT THE NEXT MORNING AND SHE SAID YOUR DAD JUST LOST HER HEALTH INSURANCE. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW ARE STARING AT THE CEILING WONDERING WHAT IN GOD'S NAME THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE? HOW MANY OF THEM? HOW MANY OF THEM ARE WORRIED LIKE WE WERE WHEN OUR SON CAME HOME DYING? I WONDER WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE IF HE WOULD'VE HAD TO SUFFER THE LAST MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT INSURANCE. HOW MANY OF YOU WORRY ABOUT IT? WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS, WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING? IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING 5 MILLION PENNSYLVANIANS. IT IS WRONG! IT IS WRONG! DONALD TRUMP , LOOK, FOLKS. CONSUMER HEALTH CARE, I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS A RIGHT! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE HEALTH CARE, I WILL BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU HAVE IT OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES TO LOWER YOUR DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, SURPRISE BILLING. HOW WILL YOU DO THAT? TRUMP AND HIS BUDDIES WILL PAY MORE TAXES SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] WE WILL REDUCE , IF IT DIDN'T SOUND SO STRANGE I WOULD NOT EVEN EXPLAIN IT , WE WILL REDUCE RESTRUCTURING , PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60% TO MAKE SURE MEDICARE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG COMPANIES FOR THE COST OF DRUGS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. MEANWHILE , THESE GUYS ARE REAL, UNFORTUNATELY. MEANWHILE, TRUMP HAS ANNOUNCED WHAT HE WILL DO IF HE GETS REELECTED WITH REGARDS TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY HAS SAID TRUMP WERE ELECTED AND CAN PASS WHAT HE WANTS, IT WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023. YOU THINK I'M MAKING IT UP, BUT JUST LIKE I SAID WHEN PAUL RYAN WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, I SAID THEY ARE GOING TO CUT MEDICARE. EVERYBODY SAID NO, NO. THEY TRIED TO CUT IT BY $5 BILLION RIGHT OFF THE BAT. FOLKS, THESE GUYS ARE SERIOUS. THEY NEVER FULLY SUPPORTED THESE PROGRAMS. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, YOU HAVE MY WORD ON IT. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, AS WE USED TO SAY IN THE SENATE, EXCUSE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE , NOTHING HAS MADE ME MORE ANGRY ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT THAN THE WAY HE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVED IN UNIFORM. LOSERS AND SUCKERS, HE REFERRED TO YOU. OUR SON BEAUU, HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE WITH US TONIGHT. HE GAVE UP HIS JOB AS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR, HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL, AND CAME BACK WITH BRAIN CANCER. GUESS WHAT? HE WASN'T A SUCKER, HE WAS A PATRIOT! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] LIKE ALL OF YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS! IT ANGERS THE HELL OUT OF ME THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT OUR VETERANS. YOUR PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, ALL WHO SERVED. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, HE IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS SIX GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO WORKED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WHO LEFT AND SAID HE WAS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. FOLKS, A FORMER COMMANDER OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FOR THE OSAMA BIN LADEN RAID, 22 OTHER FOUR STARS, THEY ENDORSED ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW I WILL HAVE THEIR BACK. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] TRUMP LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY, A MACHO MAN. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SHOT? ANYWAY. A MACHO MAN. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME , AND HE SAYS PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS TOUGH AROUND THE WORLD , WHEN HIS LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LITERALLY BEING LAUGHED AT OUT LOUD BY WORLD LEADERS WHEN HE SPOKE OF UNITED NATIONS? SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TO HIM. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES MET WITH THE NATO LEADERS AT THE NATO SUMMIT, OTHER WORLD LEADERS, PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND BEFORE THEY REALIZED IT, THEY WERE ALL MAKING FUN OF HIM AS HE LEFT THE ROOM. FOLKS, CAN YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PUPPY? PUTIN PUTS , ON THE HEAD OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. IT IS A ROUGH AREA. TRUMP HAS BEEN FRIGHTENED TO CHALLENGE HIM AT ALL. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT STRONG, HE IS WEAK. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SACRIFICE, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND COURAGE, THE PHYSICAL COURAGE IT TAKES TO BE IN UNIFORM. FOLKS, WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, THEY ARE THE BACKBONE AND THE SPINE OF THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, WE HAVE TO VOTE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP CALLS IT A HOAX. I CALL IT ABOUT OUR HEALTH AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS RIGHT HERE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH AMERICAN INGENUITY AND MANUFACTURING, CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS. LET ME BE CLEAR , I WILL NOT BAN FRACKING AND PENNSYLVANIA, I WILL PROTECT THOSE JOBS NO MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL, I WILL NO LONGER FUND WILL COMPANIES WITH SUBSIDIES, PERIOD. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ALSO HAVE TO UNIFY IT. WE ARE GOING TO ACT TO DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, BUT THE PROTESTERS'S CRY FOR JUSTICE, GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, WALTER WALLACE, THEY WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN BY ME OR ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY WILL INSPIRE A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WHEN I MET WITH FLOYD'S FAMILY, WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TEXAS, HE HAS A LITTLE DAUGHTER, SIX YEARS OLD. I KNELT DOWN TO TALK TO HER. SHE SAID MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MY DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE AMERICA. MY DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE AMERICA. GUESS WHAT? WE ALSO KNOW, WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALIZE WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT JUSTICE IS NOT JUST ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE, IT IS ABOUT KNOWING TRUE JUSTICE IS ABOUT JOBS, BUILDING WEALTH FOR YOUR FAMILIES. NO ONE SHOULD BE WORKING TWO JOBS TO STAY IN POVERTY. WE NEED A MINIMUM OF $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] AND FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING, FIRST-TERM HOMEBUYERS, THEY WILL GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FROM ME. WE WILL PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS TO START SMALL BUSINESSES. PROVIDE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHICH BY THE WAY, COSTS $6 BILLION A YEAR, AND WE SPEND ABOUT THAT MUCH GIVING BREAKS FOR RESOURCES. , RACE HORSES. AS WELL AS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING STATE UNIVERSITY IF THEY COME FROM FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $125,000. FOLKS, WE CAN DO THIS, PENNSYLVANIA. IN 2008, 2012, YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN ME AND BARACK. IN 2020, I'M ASKING FOR YOUR TRUST AGAIN. I TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE HAVE TO WIN THIS. WE HAVE TO WIN THIS TOGETHER. BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. I AM PROUD OF THE COALITION THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BUILT, WELCOMING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] THERE WILL BE NO RED STATES AND BLUE STATES! THERE WILL BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I PROMISE YOU I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT, THE DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE, THE DUTY TO HEAL. THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S JOB. SO PLEASE VOTE. IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR ABSENTEE ALEX, GET IT TO A DROPBOX AS SOON AS YOU CAN OR VOTE TOMORROW IN PERSON. JUST MAKE A PLAN AND HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS, PENNSYLVANIA! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] AND HERE'S THE AMAZING THING, HERE IS THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY. THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. ON THE ONE HAND, WE ARE FACING THE BIGGEST THREATS TO WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE, THEN WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR LIFETIMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR FUTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PROMISING. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE TODAY THAN I WAS WHEN I GOT INVITED, GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID. HERE IS WHY , WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY. FACT , OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS. WE ARE VIRTUALLY ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES OUT OF WHICH EVERY MAJOR NEW CHANGE HAS COME THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED, LITERALLY. NO NATION IN THE WORLD CAN MATCH US. WE LEAD BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. NO ONE ELSE CAN CHALLENGE US. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAMPAIGN, DIVIDING AMERICA, TEARING US APART, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER BASED ON RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, RELIGION. IT IS WRONG! THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING THEM WHO WE ARE! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] WE CHOOSE, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIE LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WE CAN BE WHO WE ARE AT OUR BEST , THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

The former vice president strongly criticized the Trump administration over a range of issues, including its coronavirus pandemic response, record on the economy, foreign policy, and handling of protests in response to police brutality and racial injustice. Mr. Biden talked about his plans if elected president and promised to heal a divided nation. Lady Gaga spoke to and performed for attendees before Mr. Biden&rsquo;s speech.	477700-1	Speech

WE TAKE YOU NOW LIVE TO PHILADELPHIA. WE WILL HEAR SHORTLY FROM HIS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE KAMALA HARRIS, WITH MUSICIAN JOHN LEGEND ON STAGE. THIS IS LIVE CAMPAIGN 2020 COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. IS OUR ABILITY TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, . IN THIS ELECTION, YOUR VOTE WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT ALLOWS THIS PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY OR ONE WITH A PLAN TO END IT. A COUNTRY WHERE THE PRESIDENT WILL GO TO COURT TO KICK 20 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF THEIR HEALTH CARE, OR ONE WHERE HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT FOR ALL AMERICANS. A COUNTRY WHERE THE PRESIDENT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES POLICE BRUTALITY AND CANNOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS OR NEO NAZIS, OR ONE WHERE WE HOLD OUR POLICE ACCOUNTABLE AND BEGIN TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR SOCIETY. A COUNTRY THAT IS SMALL, MEAN, SELFISH, AND DIVIDED, OR A COUNTRY THAT IS BIG, GENEROUS, KIND AND DECENT. A COUNTRY WHERE WE REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICS AND DIFFERENT BELIEFS, WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. THAT'S WHY I ALREADY VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. [CHEERS] JOE BIDEN WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T TAKE PLEASURE IN DIVIDING US, BUT ONE WHO WORKS HARD TO BRING US TOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE IN COMMON EFFORT. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING BUT BY A BELIEF IN SCIENCE AND A COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE. SOME PEOPLE SEE THE MEANNESS, THE BULLYING, THE SELFISHNESS OF DONALD TRUMP, AND A MISTAKE IT FOR STRENGTH. IT KIND OF TWISTED MASCULINITY. SOME SEE HIS GREED AND A MISTAKE IT FOR BEING GOOD AT BUSINESS. SOME OF YOUR FORMER FAVORITE RAPPERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY THESE LIES. [APPLAUSE] I THINK THEY EVEN FOUNDED IN YOU SUPERGROUP, IT IS CALLED ""THE SUNKEN PLACE."" BUT TRUMP'S PLATINUM PLAN FOR BLACK FOLKS IS NOTHING BUT FULL'SFOOLS'S GOLD. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BANK ON THE WORD HE SAID. ASK THE STUDENTS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY. ASK ALL THE CONTRACTORS HE STIFFED. ASK THE PEOPLE HIS CHARITY WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP BEFORE IT WAS SHUT DOWN FOR BEING A FRAUD. ASK ALL THE BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS WHO ARE DYING FROM THIS VIRUS AND LOSING THEIR JOBS UNDER HIS WATCH. THE PRESIDENT ISN'T STRONG. HE IS A COWARD. AND HIS CAREER IN BUSINESS AND IN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WE CAN TRUST. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT JOE WILL BE. HE WILL NOT ONLY REVERSE THE DAMAGE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAND-IN-HAND WITH SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, THEY WILL BUILD BACK A BETTER ECONOMY AND COUNTRY THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT JOE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. HE NEEDS YOUR HELP. AND TOMORROW HE NEEDS YOUR VOTE. GO OUT TO I WILL. WILLVOTE.COM RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE OUT YOUR POLLING PLACE AND FIGURE OUT WHEN AND HOW YOU ARE CASTING YOUR BALLOT IF YOU HAVEN'T. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED, MAKE SURE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE A PLAN TO DO THE SAME THING. REMEMBER, YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON TOMORROW BETWEEN 7 A.M. AND 8 P.M., OR YOU CAN DELIVER YOUR MAIL-IN BALLOT IN PERSON, IN PERSON , DON'T PUT IT IN THE MAIL , IN PERSON TO ONE OF THE DROP BOXES OR ELECTION OFFICES LOCATED IN YOUR COUNTY BY TOMORROW AT 8 P.M. AND MAKE SURE YOU READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. PUT THE BALLOT IN THE SMALL ENVELOPE. DON'T BE CAUGHT OUT THERE NAKED. THEN PUT THE WHOLE THING IN THE BIG ENVELOPE INSIDE IT. SETS THE ONLY WAY IT WILL COUNT. REMEMBER, THAT , THE OTHER SIDE WOULD NOT BE TRYING SO HARD TO STOP YOU FROM VOTING IF THEY WERE NOT SO SCARED OF WHAT YOUR VOTE COULD DO. DON'T LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR VOTE, DON'T LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR VOICE. PHILADELPHIA, WE HAVE A POWER TO PUT AN END TO THIS NIGHTMARE. IF WE WIN THIS STATE, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE GONE, AND JOE BIDEN WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS MORE THAN AN ELECTION. AS JOE SAYS, IT IS A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND TOGETHER WITH OUR VOICES AND WITH OUR VOTES, WE WILL WIN.

I AM NOT JUST A BARBER, I AM A GOD-FEARING MAN WHO LOVES MY FAMILY, AND I LOVE TO BE IN BUSINESS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY TODAY IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. THEY SAY THIS ELECTION IS A BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THE NATION. WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TOMORROW TO PUT MORE SO IN OUR NATION, THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. MY WIFE AND I HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAINING OF OUR CHILDREN AND WERE THEY SHOULD GO. BUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE ALONE, BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A FAMILY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH KAMALA HARRIS AT A VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SHE BECAME AN ADDITIONAL ROLE MODEL FOR MY DAUGHTER. LET ME TELL YOU WHY. SHE HANDLED THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH GRACE. IF THERE IS ANYBODY THAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING, I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING KEMAL AND NOT CARDI. EXCUSE ME, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I'M TALKING. WHEN I LOOK AT , [INAUDIBLE] , BUT YOUR CHILDREN TO DREAM BIGGER, TO WALK TALLER, BECAUSE OF HAVING INSPIRATIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONNECTED. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HEART, WHO UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AS CITIZENS WITHIN PENNSYLVANIA, AS CITIZENS WITHIN AMERICA. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN OFFICE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS ON THE BALLOT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT , THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST LIKE ANY SPORTS TEAM. WE CANNOT JUST HAVE OUR STAR PLAYERS. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EVERY OTHER ROLE PLAYER THAT IS ELECTED BY US TO BE A PART OF THAT WINNING TEAM. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET, WE DO NEED OUR STARS. BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM THAT IS NEEDED FOR US TO WIN. [CARS HONKING] [APPLAUSE] PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE A FIRST-CLASS STATE.

WE ARE PUTTING IN LEADERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE CONNECTED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ALLIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE CAN HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES IN OFFICE. WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE THAT HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT HBCUS. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I NEED FROM ALL OF US IS TO GET OUT TO VOTE. I NEED FROM ALL OF US TO TELL OTHERS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I NEED ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WE KNOW IS CHARGED UP WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN TRULY WIN.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WENZHOU ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET , WHEN JOE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET, SAYING YES WAS EASY. HE AND I DON'T COME FROM THE SAME BACKGROUNDS, BUT WE WERE RAISED WITH THE SAME VALUES , HARD WORK, HONESTY, DECENCY, A BELIEF THAT WE ALL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I HAVE SEEN WHEN I HAVE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 84 DAYS. THE VALUES WE SHARE AS AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU CAN FEEL. YOU CAN FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL TOWN, WEARING MASKS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE LINING THE STREETS AND GATHERING ON CORNERS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. THEY ARE BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN. HOLDING UP SIGNS. WEARING THEIR COLORS AND STROLLING TO THE POLLS! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] AND WAVING THE RED WHITE AND BLUE! [APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] THE ENERGY OUT THERE IS REAL. AND IT IS INSPIRING. IN THIS BATTLE FOR THE VERY SOUL OF OUR NATION, WE HAVE SEEN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. WE HAVE SEEN WHO WE ARE. AND A WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. AND THAT IS WHY I KNOW THAT TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU HAVE VOTED. ]AND IF YOU HAVE NOT, FIND OUT WHEN AND WHERE YOU WILL GO TOMORROW. THERE IS STILL ALMOST 20 FOUR HOURS WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS DONE.

WE CANNOT LET UP BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER. AND EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. OUR HEALTH, OUR ECONOMY, OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TREATS ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW. A SUPREME COURT THAT IT ADVANCES THE LEGACY OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THAT LIVES UP, LIVES UP TO THE PHRASE ABOVE ITS ENTRANCE, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. THE DECISION WE MAKE WILL WITHOUT QUESTION LAST FOR GENERATIONS. AS I TRAVEL AROUND, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS RAVAGING OUR COUNTRY. REMEMBER, BACK IN JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP NEW JUST HOW BAD THE CORONAVIRUS WAS. THAT IT WAS DEADLY AND AIRBORNE. BUT WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERAS AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIED ABOUT IT. HE COVERED IT UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28 WHAT HE KNEW? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, WHAT YOUR FAMILY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? HOW WE AS A COUNTRY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. HE ONLY THINKS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR HIMSELF. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LOST 230,000 LIVES TO COVID. SO MANY PEOPLE FORCED TO DIE ALONE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. 230,000 AMERICANS. THE LAST TIME WE EXPERIENCED LOSS LIKE THIS WAS WORLD WAR II. IN ADDITION, WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND WE KNOW IT IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST. LATINOS ARE CONTRACTING COVID AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OTHERS. LET'S BE CLEAR. WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS WE HAVE FACED SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS, HE FAILED TO LEAD. 23 MILLION PEOPLE ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN AS BEING HUNGRY. IN AMERICA. IN ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND CONCERNED THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY. AND YET NINE MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC, THIS PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN TO CONTAIN IT. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE GREATEST FAILURE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. [CARS HONKING] ON TOP OF IT ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN COURT TRYING TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TAKE HEALTH COVERAGE AWAY FROM OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. HE'S TRYING TO END PROTECTIONS FOR THE OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES , HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR CANCER. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. MORE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR ASTHMA, OR CANCER. AMERICA, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE FIRST THING JOE AND I WILL DO WHEN WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. [CARS HONKING] WE WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WE WILL PROVIDE FREE TESTING AND TREATMENT AND, WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A SAFE VACCINE FOR ALL. WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE OPEN SAFELY AND WE WILL BILL BACK AN ECONOMY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. JOE AND I WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING UNDER $400,000 A YEAR. PERIOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] BUT WE WILL ASK THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WE WILL INVEST THOSE TAX DOLLARS TO REBUILD OUR NATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. MAKE CHILDCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND INVEST IN OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND IT DESERVES THE HEALTH CARE THAT ALL PEOPLE NEED. WE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND PROTECT AND EXPAND MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL WORK TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL EXISTS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE WILL CONFRONT, NOT CONDONE, WHITE SUPREMACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND PENNSYLVANIA, WE WILL BEGIN THE WORK OF HEALING AND REPAIRING AND UNITING OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. TOGETHER. JOE GETS THAT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. YOU SEE, JOE IS A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. HE SEES US AND HE UNDERSTANDS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED SO MUCH OF IT HIMSELF. JOE BIDEN IS A LEADER OF STRENGTH AND EMPATHY. TOUGHNESS AND HUMILITY. HE UNDERSTANDS THE MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU PUT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HE KNOWS NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHERE WE LIVE, RACE, GENDER, BACKGROUND OR FAITH, NO MATTER HOW WE IDENTIFY OR WHO WE LOVE, NO MATTER THE LANGUAGE A GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. [CARS HONKING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THIS. YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOICE IS YOUR POWER. AND DO NOT LET ANYONE TAKE YOUR POWER FROM YOU. NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP. NOW IS THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT. NOW IS THE TIME TO VOTE AND VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. IN THIS ELECTION, LET'S ABOUT LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT, VOTE LIKE JUSTICE, EQUALITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, CHARACTER, AND DIGNITY ARE ON THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THEY ARE. AND ONE DAY, ONE DAY, OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK US IN THE EYE, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHAT DID YOU DO AT THAT MOMENT? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR FUTURE. SO LET'S DO THAT. LET'S VOTE, BUT WITH CONVICTION AND CONFIDENCE AND HOPE, AND LET US ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

Tomorrow we have an oppo rtunity to p ut an end to a presidenc y that's divided thi s nation. Tom orrow we can put an end to a presid ent, has failed to protec t this nation . And tomor row we could put an end to a pr esident has fan ned the flames of h ate All acros s this cou ntr y, millions of Americans have already vote d. Almo st 100 million have voted so fa r. Ah, 100 mill ion vot ed already. I'm or gon na vote today on my mess age is simple. The power to change the cou ntry is in your hands. I don't car e how much Dona ld Trump tries . There's nothing Nothing he's going to do to stop the people in this nation from voti ng folks. He hadn't figured it out. President, Do n't deter mine who gets to vote. Vote rs determi ned who is goi ng to be the President o f American Votes. America will be heard when America is heard. I believe the message is going to be l oud and cle ar. It's time for D onald Trum p to pack his bags and g o home. We're d one. W e're done with the chaos. We're done wit h the tweets. The anger, the hate, the fail ure, the irr esponsibi lity. We've got a whole lot of work to do. If I am elected your pr esident , I'm gonna act . I'm gonna act on Day one, folks. We're g onna act to get thi s under control . On Day one of my pr esidency , we're gonna put in actio n. Ah, plan that I've been talking about for months and he's been pa ying no attenti on to masking soci al distinct testing. Tracy. Ah, plan for a fair and full on fr ee distribution of therap eutics and vaccines. When we get o ne. Imagine. Imagi ne where we b ay had this preside nt from the be ginning just w ore a ma sk inst ead of mocked wea ring a ma sk. I c an tell you this. We would n't hav e nine million confir med covert cases in this nation. Would n't have over 230 ,000 deaths . It woul dn't be seeing those new r ecord numbe rs of cases we're seeing every single day right now. Nea rly 100,000 cases and one day just two days ago, 10 0,000 new cases. We w ouldn't be fac ing another 200, 000 projected deaths in the next few months. This presid ent new Last January, the virus was deadly, but he hit it fro m the American peopl e he knew was worse than th e flu. He lied to the American people. You kn ew it wasn't going to d isappear. Bu t he kept telling us a m iracle was coming. And just F riday he had the g oal. Think of t his now the Presi dent, Unite d States of America, who is responsi ble for so many death s here. The g oal. To suggest a n American docto rs, the people who have been on the f ront lines of this crisi s for nine months, along with nur ses and so many other s, many of whom have died to sugges t the doctors ar e falsely inflating deaths due to Kobe becaus e they want to ma ke mawr mo ney. I 'm se rious, man. Thi s gu y's a disgrace . People of this natio n have suffer ed. They've sacrificed for nine mont hs, no t more than those doc tors and nurses, those health care worker s. And this president is q uestioning their chara cter, their int egrity, their commitment to their fe llow Americans. So I said, it's a disgrace. And last night Trum p said he was go ing to fire Dr Fa uci. Isn't that won derful? I go t a b etter ide a. Elect me and I'm gonna hire Dr Fauci. N ot an d we're gonna fire Donald Trump. Donald Trump waved the whit e flag of surrender to this virus . He did t hat. His own ch ief of staff said last week. We're giving up on the vi rus. We're not g onna do anything a bout it. I'm never goi ng to raise the white flag of surr ender. We'r e g onna beat this viru s. We're going to get i t under control. I prom ise you. Look, the first step to b eating the virus is beating Do nald Trump. D onald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. I was ju st wi th Bar ack and Detroit and Flint . It was g reat to be with the pr esident's, um, char acter Pres ident respected arou nd the world, Pres ident our kids c ouldn't did look up to. But did you know tha t after President Obam a and I bet on American wo rkers and help ed rescue t he auto in dustry. Nea rly 500, 000 jobs created her e in Ohio. Meanwhile, 330,000 of th ose h ave been lost since Trump's become presid ent. You kno w, Donald Tru mp is going to be the fi rst president in 90 years. That's a lot of presidents in 90 years was go ing to finish his four y ears in office w ith fe wer jobs. Then when he got elected to office, it's no surprise. Remember what the lies he told al l the worker s, he told the f amilies of the GM plan t in Lordst own. He said, Quote, Do n't move, Do n't tell your house . But then the plant shut down. After the firs t debate in Cleveland, I met in Ohio, woman named Tiffan y, whose husban d lost her job at the plant, and he had to ta ke a job eight hours away. In another state, he drives home weekends, 1 6 hours round t rip to be home with hi s kids. So mu ch for Don't worry. What about his threat and h is g rudge ag ainst Goo dyear? What about h is broken promise t o protect pensions for workers, e specially mod el employer and pensio ns? Wh at about? H e stopped the overti me for m illions of Am erican work ers over a billion $ 200 million for Ameri can worker s. The president. I was helpin g your delegation pu t in place. Let's not forget how Donald Trump is we akened, chaotic with China on trade, f oreign bankruptcies, away up, exports your way down. Agricult ural exports to China during the tr ump years hav e be en 40% lo wer than they were doing. We w ere in our sec ond ter m and even even say s, because of his bail outs of the farmers tha t your ta x dollars, by t he way, the B aylor his bail out of the farmers qu ote. Our farmers ar e d oing better now, then wh en they actually had a farm. Ca n you b elieve that our farmers are doing be tter now tha t we ac tually had a farm becau se they we re able to be bailed out? Although they may not h ave a fa rm anym ore? Who does this guy thi nk he is? My policy is gonna ho ld China a ccountab le. I' ll end the Trump ta x loopholes, then incentiviz e compa nies that s hip jobs overseas . I'l l add a 10% surtax on c ompanies who do ship j obs overseas. But f or companies who bring and come ba ck and invest in American manufacturing and bri ng jobs back home, I' ll offer 10% tax c redit and folks, it's no violation. Any t rade agreement but no government contracts. And the president has a bout $600 billion in cont racts from the military on down, no go vernment c ontract We've g iven to a company that i sn't have all the produc ts, including the supply lin e, all produc ts made in America, every product . L ook on our future we made rig ht here , right her e in Ohio. Folks, we' re in a position that we could do s o much mawr. So m uch mo re folks. Donald fo r Donald Trump forgot and betrayed Ohio workers. Q uite frankly , I grew up with g uys lik e around guys lik e Donald Trump. I gre w up in neighborhoods like pr obably many of you did working class ne ighborhoods were most people d idn't hav e a college ed ucation. But w e had guys like Trum p we used to play ag ainst when we played bal l in Scranton a nd Claymont, and I kinda beca use they had mor e money than we did kind of look down th eir nose on us. I gotta admit to you, I got a bit of a chip on my shou lder whe n I read about, I read. Onc e we won the nomi nation and things be gan to look a little b etter . I read f rom serious pres s people . Th ey're decent, ho norable peopl e that If I g et elected, I'll be the first president who didn't have an Ivy League d egree in a long time . Well, let me tell y ou somet hing somehow that 's come in. I didn' t belong because I went to a state university . But let m e t ell you wha t it's about. Time I g ot from t he Sta te Univer sity gra duated into the White House . Because if I 'm there, you 're gonna be ther e, too. Look, Trump sees the world from Pa rk A venue looking down on Wall S treet . I see fr om Scranton an d Claymont where I grew up. I see it f rom he re in Clevel and. Wall S treet didn' t build America t he middle class Bill America. And gu ess what? Unions bui lt t he middle class. I th ink it's long past t ime we start rewarding work , n ot wealth in this cou ntry. Und er m y plan, if you ma ke less tha n $4 00,000 you won't pay a sing le penny more in taxes. You hav e my word on it. But I t ell you what. The wealthi est among us b ig corporations, 91 o f w hich don't pay any tax that paid ze ro fede ral inco me tax they're go ing to start paying t heir fair s har e. Why literature? Why should a firefight er uneducated a cop. Wh y should a welde r why shoul d have stil l work er pay the higher t ax rate, then th e super wealthy? It's not right . Why should you pay more taxes than Donal d Trump? For G od's sak e, look , I released 22 years of my tax return. They c an look him up online. Donald T di dn't release any wonder wha t tell he's hiding. I won der why he won't let anyb ody know what his tax returns are. Who's your the money to this? The guy , by the way, he found out r ece ntl y, has a se cret bank account in C hin a, paid 50 times more tax in Beijing. Then he did in the United States, and, ove rall, the o ne income tax The N ew Yo rk Tim es got he p aid $750 in federal taxes. How abo ut you? And when he was ask e d how we could pay so littl e, remember what h e said? He said, Beca use I'm smar t, don't know how to g am e the system. And that's the kind of guy who w ants president t hat can game the syste m be a billionaire o n page 750 b ucks in taxes Are you al l B reak your necks, break your n ecks, pay a f air shar e. We'r e going to act to pr otect healthca re. By the way, Trum p and Repub lican just jam through a new Su preme Court nomin ation for one basic reas on. Within a week afte r the election, they're gon na be before the S upreme Court in this new nominee is g onna be on t he court. It's all about de stroying t he Aff ordable car e act, g etting rid o f it completely . They've been t rying to do it n ow for nine years. If they ge t their way, 100 million Ame ricans will lose p rotections for pre existing cond itions, including n early five mill ion folks here in Ohio. Look, Don ald care D onald Trump don't under stand health care. He thinks it's the pr ivilege. I think healt h care is a right, by t he way, because of his, the way ruined t he economy. Even before t he pandemic, 10 m illion American s have a lready lost their emp loyer based health car e because the employer has gone out o f business. Now he wants to g o after the 22 mi llion who h ave health car e only because the affordable c are act I'm not o nly restore the afore affordable care act, I'll build on i t to keep y ou can keep your private insurance, or yo u can choos e the Medic are like public opti on in the new plan, I'm go nna increase subsidi es a nd lower premiums a nd deduct ibl es out of pocket expenses and surprise billin gs. We' re gonna red uce drug costs by 60% b y allo wing Medicare to negotiate drug pr ices for all of u s. Folks, folks, it's going to cost more mo ney, But guess I'm gonna pa y for it. Trump's gonna s tart paying some taxes. We 're g onna make su re we keep protecti ons for people w ith p re existin g conditio ns. Meanwhile, the Social Security, actually that person al runs The Social Securit y Department says if Do nald Trump's plan th at he an nounced, if he's reelecte d, he's gon na put in place if in fact, i s put in p lace, it would bankrupt S ocial Security b y 2023. This guy rea ll y cares a lot about his, d oesn't he? H e really understands. Been busted on tha t. My par ents bef ore of May and everyone else paying i nto Social Security. So go home and tell your parents and grand parents what a great deal they' re gonna g et if Trump gets re ele cted. But, folks, the fact is, I'm gonna protect yo ur Social Security. I guarante e it be cause I got people beh ind me. You're gonn a make sure it's pr ot ected. We're gonna protect Soc ial Security, and we' re gonna have a situ ation. We ll, guess what. We hav e a majority in the Unite d Stat es Senate folks. L ook, the t hing is bothere d me most. Maybe emotionally bothere d me the most, but sub stantively as well that t his president has done. There's b een nothing worse than the way he has spoken about th ose who'v e served in uniforms. You calle d y'all losers and su ckers. My son Beau was the attorney g eneral, the sta te of Delaware. My son Be au volu nteered. He had to give up the seat of attorney general, volunteered t o go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the key speakers service medal, and he saw th at peo ple die in Iraq. He was not a loser. He was not a sucke r. He was a patriot, ju st like al l your sons and daugh ters, p arents and grand parents who serve folks . Six generals who work ed in the White House with t he preside nt, United States and admirals wor ked in t he admi nistration have sin ce left, and they've said he is unfit to be comm ander in chief. Bes t of my knowledge, share it. That's never happen ed before for any president United Stat es. And that's why S pecial Ope rations Commander stand ing McChrys t al as well as the Commander, Spec ial Ops and the Navy SEALS who took out bin Laden alo ng Bill McRaven Admiral Craven , along with 2 22 other four star s. They have endor sed me, saying t hey'd be proud t o have me is thei r comm ander in ch ief. Thi s pres ident lik es to portray himself as a t ough guy. The macho man. Whe n's the last t ime you saw the presid ent, United State s, literally be ing laughed at by the world leaders when he spoke to the Unite d Nations? I do n't ever recall tha t ever happened. Can you b elieve when th e president, United States, acts like Vladi mir Putin's puppy? Puti n put bounties o n the heads of American so ldiers in Afghanis tan. T spoke to him six tim es. There's too fri ght ened to chall enge him. Why Donald Trump's not stro ng. He's we ak. This is a president who not only doesn't und ersta nd sa crifice, he doesn't understan d courage , physical courage. It takes for so many of you to put on that unif orm. We must support our mil itary. Let's make this vote for them as well. God love them . Look, we have to meet. We have to vote to meet the c hallenges of the climate crisis. Well, we can a ct to meet that climate cr isis. Tru mp calls climate crisis the hoax . I see it as a great opportunity to improve our health as well as c reate mill ions of goo d paying jobs. I see America's work ing to bui ld and instal l 500 0 chargin g stations al l acr oss this c ountry. Ameri can consumers switch ing to c lean electric vehicle . We can own the electr ic vehicle market, c reating mil lions of jobs here in Cleveland and in Ohio and in D etroit. Fo lks, I see the federal governme nt harnessing th e persons of power by buy ing these electric v ehicles made in Ameri ca made in Ohio, made i n Detroit, Made in A merica, it's going to m ean on e million, accordin g to experts. On e million new good pai n, a uto jobs in the automob ile industry alo ne. Folks, if we don't act, Chin a is gonna own the market. C hina is g onna ow n it all and we w ill act. In addit ion, deliver racial just ice in Ameri ca, folks. Pro testing is not burn ing and looting. Violence not must never be t olerated. It won't. Bu t these protests are cry for justice. The na me s of Geor ge floored Rianna Taylor Jac ob break Blake will soon no t be forgot. You know, I met with all the se families Well, I met with with Floyd 's little girl I thi nk she was six y ears old. I knelt dow n to say or to be a high level with her.

I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'll govern as an American president. Ther e will be no r ed states and blue s tates, Just th e United Stat es. Yeah, and I pr omise yo u, I'll work us hard for those w ho don' t support me is t hose who dio that's the job of a pres ident to care to care abo ut everyb ody, everybody. Th at's the duty of a presi dent. Look, loo k. You too ha ve a duty a d uty to vo te, folks, m ake a pl an, Goto I will vote d ot com slas h o h folks, amazing th ing about this momen t in our history. O n the one hand , we're fac ing the biggest t hreat of wh o we are. What we believe. Wha t we've seen. What we've been in ou r lifetimes. Another hand. Our future has ne ve r been mo re promising. I've said it many times. The character of America is literally on the bal lot, the character of our country. But I'm more optimistic about America's future today. Then, when I was elected, two United States senators, a 29 year old kid, let me tell you why we are better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers were three times as productive as other work. We have the biggest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world, and we are virtually energy independent. We have more great research universities in America than all the rest of the world combined, out of which all these new inventions of GERD No, the nation could matches. We lead by the example of our power, not just by the power by the power of our example. The only thing we could could tear America apart is America itself. And that's exactly what Donald Trump has tried to do from the beginning of his campaign. Divide America. The only way you can win separators pit Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It's wrong. It's not who we are. But it's his only prospect. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lives. Thanks. It's time to stand up. It's time to take back our democracy. We can do this for so much better than this. We could be our best. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the United States of America. There's not a damn thing. We can't do nothing. So let's get up and do it. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah . I'm sor r y. I wo uld sa y Yeah . No Donald her e. Too far away. Oh, Go d. Runs a c heerio, my friends, w e owe In stead I get ric h. You know I'm my h eart keeps going backw ard s there Shelter, don't you? Have you done?

Thank y ou. Thank you. Thank you. A special thanks. The local and state elected offic ials who w ere here I want to thank them a lot And I also tha nk your police dep artment . I tell you what they g otta one heck of a motorcycle of es cort. You kn ow, it's great seeing Franco again. I l ive in t he other s ide of the state jus t below that to wn called Philadelphia, and I get in troub le because I talk a bou t how much I like Pittsburgh and how much I like th e Steelers . Now, let me te l l you why Franco and I were just in L atro be together l ast month, and Franco and his teammate a guy na med Rocky Bleier back i n the day when my the Ro oneys were reall y wonderful to me a nd m y family. Bec ause just a month afte r I was elected the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. De cember 18th It wa s a week before Chri stmas. I got a phone call w hen I was hiring st aff in Washing ton, saying a tractor tr ai ler broadsided my wife and my th ree Childr en Christmas shopping and kill my wife and killed my wife and I k illed my daughter. My two boys were very bad ly injured. Th at's why I hustl ed homos quick as I could, and I stayed with him in that hospital room because they were really in t ough shape . But o n the 23rd I believe it Waa s. I decided that I was go nna go out to K Mart and get a pla stic Christmas tree. You kno w, those kinds of have on d isplay because you weren't allowed to hav e any Chri stmas paraphernal ia in the hospital that cou ld c atch fire, but I could get one of those. So I went out and I was o nly gone. The only time I was gone, I was gone for about, I gues s, an hour, hour and a half When I came back on both my boy s for the firs t time, th ere were littl e guy s, three and four years old, al most four and five. They had smiles on t heir face, an d each of th em were ho lding a fo otball signed by the entire still curt ain. Pittsbu rgh, the Pi ttsburgh te am. And I s aid, What happened, boy s? An d they w ere the first t ime. They smi led, and they said Rocky Bleier and Franco Harr is came because guess what happe ned. The Rooneys really fin e, fi ne people. The Rooneys decide d that th ey were going to se nd Rocky an d Franco to see my b oys. N o pu blicity. They did n't do any press. Didn't anybody kno w? They spent 45 m inutes of my boys. T hey got on th e plane i n one home. That 's w ho we are as a coun try. That's some thing the pres ident doesn't understan d. Looking out f or each othe r, 1000 acts of kindnes s, decency that p eople used to show to one another and still do that He jus t doesn't get. Pi ttsburgh Pittsburgh There' s one more day, one more day to s how who we are. Once again . Tomorr ow we can end t he presidency that has d ivided t his nation. Folks at ho me w ould know. Tom orrow we cou ld put an end to a pres idency th at failed to protect the nati on. Tomorrow we could put an end to a pre sidency that has fann ed the flames of ha te acro ss this nation, p ouring gasoline on e very racial incident in the country. Millions of Americ ans hav e already voted ove r al most 100 mill ion. Now mill ions m ore will vote tomorrow . My me ssage is simple . Th e power to change this country is in your hands, and I d on't care how ha rd Do nal d Trump tries. There's noth ing nothing he could d o to stop the peop le of this nation from v oting, no matter how he tries. The re's a press arti cle last week and a read as fo llows. Ne ver before in modern presid ential hist ory ha s a c andid ate b een so reliant on wi de sc ale efforts to repres s the vote as Trump something. Watch over. You don't want Americans voting. He thi nks only wealth y folks should vote. You wa nt America votes so America will be heard when America 's heard. The message is going to be out loud a nd clear. I t's time for Do nald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Go home. Look, we're done with t he chaos. We' re done with the racism. We' re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure o f their responsibilit y. But we got a lot of wo rk to do. Folks, if I 'm elected presiden t, we're gonn a act on day one, we're gonna act t o get Cove it un der control. On Da y one of m y preside ncy, I'l l put k nocks in a plan. But I've been talking about f or months maski ng social distancing, test ing . Tracy Ah, plan for full and fair an d free distribution o f ther apeutics and va ccines when we get one. And most importantly, we hadn't done yet a pla n, a plan that addresses the fact t hat we can g et everybody access to the vaccine when it comes. Folks, there's over 30 0 mil lion people in Ame rica. Everyone, everyone going to get he lp. The plan to add ress the dispr opor tionate wa y the virus is he ading the black community and minority com munities. We'r e seeing race based dis parities all across e very as pect o f this vir us. Higher in fect ion rates . Lower access to testing. Ah, harder tim e quaran tine , safe quara ntine and safe ly lower acce s s to quality tr eat ment when you be come infected and tragically hi gher Mo rtality ra tes three times as high as the white population. One in 1000 black Americans have die d fro m covert so far. By the end of this pandemic, i f things continu e as he's allowing th em dio until the next preside nt takes office, ther e will be another 200,0 00 deaths p rojected. And that will mean one in 500 African Americans will have died because of Cove in. That is absolutely outrageous. That is an attack, a mass casualties for black Americans. This president he knew in January how bad this virus was in January. He knew it. Some of you may remember vaguely have turned on the television time. I wouldn't in office, but I was talking about the fact that he got intelligence briefings laying out how dangerous it was coming from China and where it was happening. And he said no. He didn't read his intelligence uh, briefin g in the mornin g. Well, that didn't surpr ise May. It doesn' t r ead, but turns out he knew e xactly how dangero us it Wa as. Remember what he said to Bob Woodward, the famo us journalist? He w ent on tape and he sai d to Woodward, he knew in January h ow dangerous it waas and how many people could d ie and he said nothing. He d idn't say a thing t o you, me or anybody else. He kept it secret . He hi t it from the Ame rican people. He knew his worse tha n the flu. He l ied to the American people. H e knew it wasn't goi ng to disappear. He kept te lling us a mirac le was coming. Or maybe we should inje ct bleach into ou r veins. I mean , whateve r. God , what, anyway ? And just Fri day, this past Frida y here, t he goal. To suggest that the American docto rs an d nurses who are literal ly risking thei r live s to save lives o n the front line of this crisis for nine months that he suggeste d that thes e folks know what th ey said they' re doin g, he said. Do ctors air falsely inflating th e death. Do Thio co verted because the y wanna make m awr money. Now think abou t that President of the United Stat es of Ame rica. But then ag ain, it doesn't s ur prise me . He wouldn't do any thing unless he coul d make more money, not a joke. Eve rything to him is about How do you help you rself, folks? Look, people o f this nation have suff ered sacrifice f or nine months, non e more so than o ur doctors and ou r frontline hea lthcare worke rs as the presid ent questio ning thei r c haracter and the ir integrit y, their commit ment to h is fe llow Americans , the president question ing that it's a fla t disgrace. A nd then last night, Trump said, he's gonna fire D r Fauci. I got a better idea . Let's fire Trum p and I'll hir e Dr Fauci. Look , the pres ident has wave d the white flag of s urrender in t his virus. I'll never do that, his chief of sta ff said last w eek. We' re not going to c ontrol this virus. We 're not go ing to contr ol the vir us. The fi rst step, the beating, the vi rus is defeatin g Do nald Trump. Look, folks, if you know if we didn't know this was happening and I s omebody made a movie about this five ye ars a go, you think it was all crazy, but it's really it's really w hat's hap pening. Dona ld Trump, by the way, keeps te lling us w h at a great jobs pre sident has been h ow many jobs created ? Well, I w as just with Pr esident Obama i n Detroit and Flint, Michigan, my bu ddy. It was great to be with the president. Re al character, a pr esident respected around the world a p resident kids could l ook u p to. But did you know P resident Ob ama? I helped crea te more jobs i n the last th ree years of our adminis tration than Trump d id in the fi rst three years of h is. Even before the pa ndemic, it did. You know, Donald Trump i s going to be the first pres ident in 90 years who's g oing to finis h with is four year s in office with fewer j obs unde r his leadership than when he started his presi den t? And black unemployme nt remains too high. Too many black b usi nesses shuttered for good black don' t busine ss or shutting down twi ce as fast as other business es a nd busine ss c ommunities of color hav e shuttered beca use they didn't get the help. The money that Congre ss had passe d Con gress passed over $ 2 trillion . No, the first thing when the presi dent did, he fired the ins p ector general was suppos ed to follow the money wen t and guess what when already busi nesses, small busin esses, they didn't ge t the help. It went to t he mar ch. A Lago crowd . Not a joke. His wealthy f riends Hey, fired the Inspector genera l . You know he sees the worl d fro m Park Ave nue. I had seen it from Skrine. I see fro m where I grew up. I see. F rom here in Pittsburgh, Wall Street di dn't build t his coun try. Working people buil t this country that's alwa ys has b uilt t he country's middle class. And you just built the middle class folks. I believe we should be rea dy. Work, not weal th in this count ry. You don't re ali ze that just since the pandemic start ed, the liste d billionaires i n America mad e anothe r $300 b illion. What a joke. $300 bill ion they made in the mid dle of pandemic. What's goin g on here, folks? Well, I g ot a plan. None of my plan I com mit to you . No one m aking less th an 400 grand is gonn a see there A penny in ta xes raised . But fo r a change. The wealt hiest and the b iggest cor porations, 91 of t he Fortune 500 co mpanies pay z ero in taxes af ter maki n g billions of dollars. Well, guess what? Under a bite administration . They're go ing to start paying their fair share. Why should a firefight er uneducated or a nurse. Still, worker pay a higher t ax rate. And that's the God's truth. Ah, higher tax rate that is su per wea lt hy. And by the way, why should you p ay more taxe s than Do nald Trump? I released 23 years o f my tax returns. I had two dubious distinc tion. Being lis ted as the p oorest ma n in Congress for 36 year s. And then when I got elected, vice pres ident said, it's proba ble no man has ever a ssumed the office vice president wit h fewer assets th an Jo e Biden. I assum e they weren't speaki ng abou t intellec tual assets. It could h ave been. B ut w ho knows? Well, look, here's my point, Trum p and the o nly taxes th at we'v e b een able to find out t hroug h The New York T imes one year he has he paid $750 in taxes. Trump keeps talking about corr uption. When's th e last time you heard what president having a secret bank acc ount in China? What s he did, we just foun d out whe re he played 50 times Mawr tax in China th an it in the U nited States. Eve ry time he starts talking about corruption, I se release your tax return. What in the hell are you hidi ng? What are y ou hiding? Not on e anyway. I won't get into. Look, we'r e gonna have to protect health care. Trump. R epublicans just jam med through a Supreme Court nomination . You know why th ey did? To try to destroy the Affordable care act. If they get th eir way , 100 million Ame ricans will los e the protections for p re existing conditio ns, including more th an five million people here in the Uni ted Sta tes. I mean, excuse me. Here in the state of Pennsylvania, over 100 million in the U nited States, million s of bla ck Ameri cans will be left uninsured . Denied heal th coverage because of pre e xisting cond itions and their arm or pre exis ting conditions in poor communities than there are i n others. Dona ld Trump thinks health care is a privil ege. I think it 's a right Look, I' m not only restore of Obama care, I'll build on it. You can ke ep your privat e insurance if you like it. Y ou can choose Medicare like pub lic option. I'm gonna increase subs idies to lower your premiums, deductibl es, out o f pocket expense s, out of pocket spendin g, surprise billing. I'm gonna low er prescription drugs by 60 %. And that's the truth. But by th e way, how you gonna do it, Joe? Beca use those wea lthy people a re gonna start paying the ir fair share. I thought of a punishing everyone. It's ab out being fair. We'll mak e sure the protecti ons for peo ple w ith preexisting co nditions r emain. And meanwhil e, Trum p said p ublicly said, if he's re elected, he's gonna defund Social Sec urity payme nts. The extr a It's so, Securi ty Depar tment said, if h e does that, that w ill el iminat e eliminate Medicare by 2023 . After all the people rely on Medicare. It's n ot gonna h appen, by the way, w e're not gonna let it happen. B ut that's his plan. S o go home and t ell yo ur grand parent's and pa rent's. We' ll protect Social Sec urity, Medicare an d M edicaid, which he won' t do. And finally, both deliver s ome. We need to vote now deliver som e racial justic e in A merica. Look, A seaso n of prote st ha s broken out all across this nation . Protest. It is n ot burning and lootin g and v iolence that can't be tolerate d. A won't But those pro te sts our cry for justice. The name of George Floyd, Briana Tailor, Ja cob Blake, Walter Wallace Jr. They're not go ing to soon be forgot . Not gonna be forgott en by me, not by us, no t by this country. They'll in s pire a whole new wave of justice in America w hen I met with wh en I met with F loyd's family, has a little d aughter survived him. She's six years old and I kn elt down. I talked to I said I start ed t o talk t o her. No, she said. He look ed at me, said Mr Vice Pr esident, Dad dy, change, go ing to change t he world. Daddy is going to chang e the world, Folk s, The country is rea dy. The country is r eady. But not w ith Donald. Trump is pr esident now. He wants us to believe so much. He's d one for black Ameri cans. You might have seen the deba te ahead of them. I was standing next to Abr aham Lincoln, he said. Not since Ab raham Lincoln has anyone done as much for th e Afr ican American co mmunities. I have. I t urned hi m and ask him a . He got offended. You got offe nded. Look, Pitts burgh honk if you t hi nk h is commi tmen t of having Dunmore for the African A merican communit y and Abraham Lincoln is tru e, honk your ho rn Silen ce. You got it, man. Pittsburgh honk if y ou think it' s a b unch of mala rkey, Why you got i t? Look, the tr uth is, Donald T has done M aura Harm Bl ack Amer ica and then the pre sident in modern hi story. This is the same man w ho started t he birther mov ement against my buddy. Ba rack. Obama is the first man. That's the ma n who in t he first blac k woman running for vice pres ident, h e looks at her. He calls he r a mon ster. Oh, yeah, man. R emembe r on st age with them when I as k about the proud bo ys, that racist gr oup of white supre mac ists, he said, I said , Would y ou deny them? He turn ed and he said, I'm gonn a te ll him toe stand dow n and sta nd by Wh en in God's name did you ev er expect Ame rican presid ent say who refused? I t announced. White suprema cy Doesn't believe system ic rac ism is a p roblem. I won 't even s ay blac k li ves matter. Bla ck lives matte r what I w ork to deliver real police a nd criminal reform. Just ice reform. We know, we know . But true justice is a ll about. It's no t onl y about system crimi nal justice sys tem, that' s fair, but it's ab out being abl e to build wealt h, jobs, hom es, fam ilies, folks. We' re in a situation wher e think about it, how man y peo ple you know, working two jobs and still being in pover ty? We need a nation al minimum wage of $15 an ho ur for everybody, pe riod hog. If you agree with May honking. You agree with me? My pr oposal for fi rst time home buyer. First time Homebuyers. I pr omise you are go ing to get a $15 down p ayment for the first home, h uh? Ye ah. For new capital start business es because bloc k entre preneur s a re equally success ful. Is any ot her en trepren eurs? But the y can't g et access. Tha t's why Barack and I starte d a pr ogram to give $1.5 bill ion a local small business associations to e lend money that brought 30 billion off the si deline. Want chan ge that to $15 billi on and we're gonn a bring 150 of f the sidelin e. Look , in addition to that, think a bout this Edu catio n. Education i s the key. The m ove m ent. Well, guess what? Th ey're gon na be free col lege education for state universiti es When I am yo ur presiden t, I got tri ple funding by the way we could afford this . I promise you, I' m gonna triple funding f or Title one schools so a ch il d could get a good publ ic education n o matter what their zi p code is allowing, every three and four or five y ear olds would goto schoo l, no t daycare. Tha t increases by 58 % of prospects. That chi ld wi ll go a ll the w ay through 12 years. And, hawk , if you agr ee with me, I 'm gonna invest $7 0 b illion in H BC. Use a minorit y serving i nstitutions for r eally D eGette instit utions. So future generations of bl ack students can contin ue to get the very best education folk s. Pennsylvania in 2000 and e ight in 200 0 and 12. You placed your trust in B arack and me Now in 2020. I'm asking for your trus t again in May. And Kamala, by the way, she is one smart, b right, tough wo man. Man, I'm so proud. She said Yes. Loo k, I'm running i s a proud Democra t, but I w il l govern as an American presid ent. That's the job of a pres ident, the duty to represent everyo ne. Everyo ne and y ou two have a duty. If you haven 't already voted to v ote tomorrow, make a plan. Get o ut the vote Goto. I will v ote com slash p a and ask yourself if Donald Trump is so prou d of his record, espe cially for African Americ ans, why doe s he make it so hard for us to v ote? And then rem ember the final wor ds my g ood friend and American he ro John Lewis, who recently died, he said the v ote is the m ost powerful, nonvi ole nt change agent you h ave in a democrati c society. You mus t use it because they're not guaranteed. Y ou'll lose folks. P lease, pl ease. Here's the amazing thing. Here's the amazing thing, folks. I t's about t his mome nt in history. On the o ne hand, we're fa cing the bigg est threat about wh o we are, what we believe we've se en in our lifet imes. But on the ot her hand, our f uture has never been more pro mising. I said it many times. I'm more o ptimistic ab out Americ a's future today t han it was when I got elected as a 29 year ol d kid and I mean it. Here's why or better posi tion than any natio n in t he world t oe lead t he 21st cen tury, our work ers or three ti mes as p roductive workers, the bigge st e conomies in th e worl d. We ha ve t he s tronges t mil itary in history o f the wo rl d. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs, were virtually energy independent, and we have mawr research universities out of virtue. Every major change comes then the entire rest of the world combined. Northern Asian can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. We're laughing stock around the world right now. The only thing that could tear America apart as America itself. And that's exactly what Donald Trump has been doing beginning this campaign. He knows the only way he can win his divide. America finished against one another based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion. That's wrong. It's not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's show them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. It's time to stand up and take back this democracy. We could do this. We're better than we've been. We could be our best. What were the United States of America? God bless you all And may God protect our troops. Girl vote. We could get this done. I promise you, the the people he thio Yeah. Mhm Thio Man, are you okay? Okay, I don't know.

WE HAVE A TRADE STRATEGY RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU GET 10% CUT IN YOUR TAX IF YOU SEND A JOB OVERSEAS. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE IT. BRING A JOB HOME, GET 10%. I'M GOING TO PROMISE YOU ONE THING, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS CONTROL OF 600 BILLION DOLLARS, HANDING OUT CONTRACTS AND CONSTRUCTION FOR EVERYTHING FROM AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO PUBLIC HOUSING. HERE'S THE PROMISE I MADE TO YOU. NOT ONE SINGLE CONTRACT WILL BE LET TO A CONTRACTOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALL MADE IN AMERICA. THAT'S A GUARANTEE, EVERYONE. WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT NOW, BUT WE HAVE NEVER DONE IT. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STEPPED UP TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE , BY THE WAY, ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION, DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY. I GREW UP WITH HIM , GUYS LIKE HIM AROUND AND SCRANTON. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD LOOK DOWN THEIR NOSE AT US BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE MONEY. THAT BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM WELL-KNOWN FAMILIES THEY WERE SOMEHOW BETTER. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. HE TALKS ABOUT HOW TOUGH HE IS, HARD-WORKING HE IS, DONE SO MUCH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BOTHERED ME MOST IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAD TO TELL YOU, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT OUR VETERANS AS BEING LOSERS. LOSERS. WHAT IS THIS GUY ALL ABOUT? WHO IS HE? HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. FOLKS, MY SON WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE. HE GAVE UP THE SEAT TO FIGHT IN A RACK FOR A YEAR. HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE SERVICE MEDAL. HE CAME HOME AND HE DIED OF CANCER. HE CAME HOME AND GUESS WHAT, HE WAS NO LOSER. TRUMP IS THE LOSER. ALL OF YOU HAVE SERVED. ALL OF YOU HAVE SERVED. I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT IT. IS IT ANY WONDER WHY? THIS IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT I'M AWARE OF, THE SIX TOP GENERALS THAT WORK FOR HIM, THE SIX FOUR-STAR ADMIRALS AND GENERALS, THEY ALL LEFT SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T, HE WASN'T WORTHY OF BEING COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THEY QUIT. SPECIAL FORCES, THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO DID A LOT COMMANDING. THEY BOTH ENDORSED ME. AND I CAME ALONG, 22 FOUR STARS, STEPPING UP TO ENDORSE ME BECAUSE THEY KNEW I WOULD HAVE THEIR BACK. THIS GUY DOESN'T GET IT. I MEAN IT. MANY OF YOU SERVED. IT TOOK PHYSICAL COURAGE TO DO IT. HE DOESN'T GET IT. FOLKS, WE OWE THE MILITARY. 1%, 1% OF THE AMERICANS PROTECTING THE OTHER 99% OF US. WE OWE THEM BIG. LOOK, WE CAN ONLY GET THIS DONE, THOUGH, WE CAN ONLY GET THIS DONE IF PENNSYLVANIANS VOTE. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER RETURNS THEIR BALLOT IN VOTES TOMORROW, MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE YOU KNOW DOES THE SAME. IT'S TIME TO REBUILD THE BACK OWN OF THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THIS TIME BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY. IT'S TIME TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY. ON THE ONE HAND FACING THE BIGGEST THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN OUR LIFETIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR FUTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PROMISING. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE TODAY THAN WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE SENATE. HERE'S WHY, WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS, VIRTUALLY ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD COMBINED. NO OTHER NATION CAN TOUCH US. NO OTHER NATION CAN LEAD US. WE CAN LEAD BY THE POWER OF EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. THE ONLY THING THEY CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. DIVIDE AMERICA, PIT AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER. RURAL VERSUS URBAN, BASED ON RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. THAT'S WRONG. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WHAT ABOUT HONOR, INTEGRITY, DIGNITY. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW HIM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, UNITY OVER DIVISION. SCIENCE OVER FICTION. YEAH, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES, CONSTANT LIES , TRUTH OVER LIES, CONSTANT LIES. FOLKS, IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. NOT LOSE STATES AND RED STATES, BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . LET'S TAKE IT BACK. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, LIKE MY DAD USED TO SAY, THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH POWER IS POWER. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH CORPORATE GREED IN AMERICA IS UNION POWER. THAT'S A FACT. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHERS OF THE GATE, MAN. THE ONLY ONES. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU, THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT BACK IN USE OF , ROOSEVELT STATE DIDN'T SAY THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE UNIONS, IT SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROMOTE UNIONS. I PROMISE YOU I WILL BE THE MOST PRO UNION PRESIDENT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. I GUARANTEE YOU A SEAT AT THE TABLE. GOD LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. LET'S GET THIS VOTE OUT. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. (music) I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I'M VERY , V.P. BIDEN: I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF.

LATER ON FRIDAY NIGHT, JOE BIDEN ADDRESSES THE NATION FROM HIS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. HE TALKED ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR THE COUNTRY INCLUDING HIS CALLS FOR THE NATION TO COME TOGETHER. GOOD EVENING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL DECLARATION OF VICTORY YET BUT THE NUMBERS TELL US IT IS CLEAR , A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STORY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE. JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY. 24 HOURS, WE WERE BEHIND IN GEORGIA, NOW WE ARE AHEAD. AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT STATE. 24 HOURS AGO, WE WERE BEHIND IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. AND NOW WE ARE AHEAD, WINNING IN ARIZONA, WINNING IN NEVADA. IN FACT, OUR LEAD DOUBLED IN NEVADA. WE ARE ON TRACK TO OVER 300 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. AND LOOK AT THE NATIONAL NUMBERS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE WITH A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE NATION BEHIND US. WE HAVE GOTTEN OVER 74 MILLION VOTES. LET ME REPEAT THAT, AT 74 MILLION VOTES, THAT IS MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENTIAL TICKET HAS EVER GOTTEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND OUR VOTE TOTAL IS STILL GROWING. WE ARE BEATING DONALD TRUMP BY 4 MILLION VOTES, AND THAT IS A MARGIN THAT IS STILL GROWING AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF IS HOW WELL WE HAVE DONE ACROSS AMERICA. AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN IN ARIZONA IN 24 YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN GEORGIA IN 28 YEARS. AND WE HAVE REBUILT THE BLUE WALL, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY, THAT CRUMPLED JUST FOUR YEARS AGO. PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, THE HEARTLAND OF THIS NATION. I KNOW WATCHING THESE VOTE TALLIES ON TV MOVES VERY SLOWLY, AND AS SLOW AS IT GOES, IT CAN BE NUMBING. BUT NEVER FORGET, THE TALLIES ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS. THEY REPRESENT VOTES AND VOTERS. MEN AND WOMEN WHO EXERCISE THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. AND WHAT IS BECOMING CLEAR EACH HOUR IS THAT A RECORD NUMBERS OF AMERICANS OF ALL FAITHS AND RELIGIONS SHOWS CHANGE OVER MORE , CHOSE CHANGE OVER MORE OF THE SAME. THEY HAVE GIVEN US A MANDATE FOR ACTION ON COVID, THE ECONOMY, CLIMATE CHANGE, SYSTEMIC RACISM. THEY MADE IT CLEAR, THEY WANT THE COUNTRY TO COME TOGETHER, NOT CONTINUE TO PULL APART. THE PEOPLE SPOKE. MORE THAN 74 MILLION AMERICANS. AND THEY SPOKE LOUDLY FOR OUR TICKET. BUT WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FINAL RESULTS, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT WAITING TO GET THE WORK DONE AND START THE PROCESS. YESTERDAY SENATOR HARRIS AND I HELD MEETINGS WITH GROUPS OF EXPERTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THIS COUNTRY IS FACING. THE PANDEMIC, AS YOU ALSO KNOW, IS GETTING MORE WORRISOME ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DAILY CASES ARE SKYROCKETING. IT IS NOW BELIEVED WE COULD SEE A SPIKE OF 200,000 CASES IN A SINGLE DAY. THE DEATH TOLL IS APPROACHING 240,000 LIVES LOST TO THIS VIRUS. THAT IS 240,000 EMPTY CHAIRS AT KITCHEN TABLES ACROSS AMERICA. WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT PAIN AND SUFFERING AND LOSS SO MANY FAMILIES EXPERIENCED. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LOSE SOMEONE, AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALONE. OUR HEARTS BREAK WITH YOU. WE WANT EVERYONE, EVERYONE TO KNOW ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR PLAN TO CONTROL THIS VIRUS INTO ACTION. WE CANNOT SAVE ANY OF THE LIVES LOST, ANY OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN LOST, BUT WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. SENATOR HARRIS AND I ALSO HEARD YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW THIS RECOVERY IS SLOWING, BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO GET THE PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING RENT, AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. OUR ECONOMIC PLAN WILL PUT A FOCUS ON A PATH TO A STRONG RECOVERY. LOOK, WE BOTH KNOW TENSIONS ARE HIGH. THEY CAN BE HIGH AFTER A TOUGH ELECTION, ONE LIKE WE HAVE HAD. BUT REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO REMAIN CALM, PATIENT. LET THE PROCESS WORK OUT, AS WE COUNT ALL THE VOTES. WE ARE PROVING AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE PROVED FOR 244 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY WORKS. YOUR VOTE WILL BE COUNTED. I DO NOT CARE HOW HARD PEOPLE TRY TO STOP IT. I WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. THE PEOPLE WILL BE HEARD. OUR JOURNEY IS TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION. AND IT KEEPS MOVING ON. IN AMERICA, WE HOLD STRONG VIEWS, WE HAVE STRONG DISAGREEMENTS, AND THAT IS OK. STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ARE INEVITABLE IN A DEMOCRACY, AND STRONG DISCRETENESS ARE HEALTHY. , AND STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ARE HEALTHY. THEY ARE A SIGN OF A VIGOROUS DEBATE, OF DEEPLY HELD VIEWS. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THE PURPOSE OF OUR POLITICS IS NOT TOTAL, UNRELENTING, UNENDING WARFARE, NO. THE PURPOSE OF OUR POLITICS, THE WORK OF THE NATION, IS NOT TO FAN THE FLAMES OF CONFLICT, BUT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. TO GUARANTEE JUSTICE. TO GIVE EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE. WE MAY BE OPPONENTS, BUT WE ARE NOT ENEMIES. WE ARE AMERICANS. NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTED FOR, I AM CERTAIN OF ONE THING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 150 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED, THEY WANT TO GET THE VITRIOL OUT OF OUR POLITICS. WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO AGREE ON A LOT OF ISSUES BUT WE CAN AGREE TO BE CIVIL TO ONE ANOTHER. LET'S PUT THE ANGER AND DEMONIZATION BEHIND US. IT IS TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION TO HEAL. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT WE HAVE TO TRY. MY RESPONSIBILITY AS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE NATION. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST ME, AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB. THAT IS THE JOB. IT IS CALLED THE DUTY OF CARE, FOR ALL AMERICANS. WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH. COVID. THE ECONOMY. RACIAL JUSTICE. CLIMATE CHANGE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME TO WASTE ON PARTISAN WARFARE. MORE THAN THAT, WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE FUTURE WE WANT FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS. I HAVE SAID MANY, MANY TIMES, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS NATION. THERE IS NO REASON WE CANNOT OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING, ANYTHING, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO OR UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH, WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. I HOPE TO BE TALKING TO TOMORROW. I THANK YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. GOOD NIGHT.

BUT THERE IS JOY IN IT. AND THERE IS PROGRESS, BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE.

AND NOW IN 2020, WITH A NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY WHO CAST THEIR BALLOTS AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE AND BE HEARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] TONIGHT I REFLECT ON THEIR STRUGGLE, THEIR DETERMINATION, AND THE STRENGTH OF THEIR VISION TO SEE WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. AND I STAND ON THEIR SHOULDERS. AND WHAT A TESTAMENT IT IS TO JOE'S CHARACTER THAT HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO BREAK ONE OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS THAT EXISTS IN OUR COUNTRY AND SELECT A WOMAN AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] BECAUSE EVERY LITTLE GIRL WATCHING TONIGHT SEES THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY OF POSSIBILITIES. AND TO THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER, OUR COUNTRY HAS SENT YOU A CLEAR MESSAGE, DREAM WITH AMBITION. LEAD WITH CONVICTION. SEE YOURSELVES IN A WAY THAT OTHERS MAY NOT, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. BUT KNOW THAT WE WILL APPLAUD YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

FOR ALL OF YOU WHO VOLUNTEERED AND WORKED THE POLLS IN THIS PANDEMIC, LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOU DESERVE A SPECIAL THANKS FROM THE ENTIRE NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO MY CAMPAIGN TEAM AND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND ALL WHO GAVE SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES TO MAKE THIS MOMENT POSSIBLE, IOU EVERYTHING , I OWE YOU EVERYTHING. ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED US, I AM PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN WE BUILT AND RAN. I AM PROUD OF THE COALITION WE PUT TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PROGRESSIVES, MODERATES, CONSERVATIVE, YOUNG, OLD, RURAL, SUBURBAN, GAY, STRAIGHT, TRANSGENDER, NATIVE AMERICAN. I MADE IT, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WAS AT ITS SLOWEST, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IMMUNITY , COMMUNITY STOOD UP AGAIN FOR ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ALL HAD MY BACK AND I WILL HAVE YOURS. I SAID AT THE OUTSET, I WANTED TO REPRESENT THIS CAMPAIGN, TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AMERICA. WE HAVE DONE THAT. FOR ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, I UNDERSTAND THE DISAPPOINTMENT TONIGHT. I LOST A COUPLE TIMES MYSELF. NOW LET'S GIVE EACH OTHER A CHANCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] IT IS TIME TO PUT AWAY THE HARSH RHETORIC, LOWER THE TEMPERATURE, SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AGAIN, AND TO MAKE PROGRESS, WE HAVE TO STOP TREATING OUR OPPONENTS AS AN ENEMY. THEY ARE NOT OUR ENEMIES, THEY ARE AMERICANS. THEY ARE AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE TELLS US TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON, A TIME TO BUILD, A TIME TO REAP AND A TIME TO SOW AND A TIME TO HEAL. THIS IS THE TIME TO HEAL IN AMERICA. [HONKING] NOW THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER, WHAT IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? WHAT IS OUR MANDATE? I BELIEVE IT IS THIS , AMERICA HAS CALLED UPON US TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF DECENCY, THE FORCES OF FAIRNESS, TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF SCIENCE AND FORCES OF HOPE IN THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR TIME. THE BATTLE TO CONTROL THE VIRUS. THE BATTLE TO BUILD PROSPERITY. THE BATTLE TO SECURE YOUR FAMILY'S HEALTH CARE. THE BATTLE TO ACHIEVE RACIAL JUSTICE AND ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BATTLE TO SAVE OUR PLANET BY GETTING CLIMATE UNDER CONTROL. THE BATTLE TO RESTORE DECENCY, DEFEND DEMOCRACY, AND GIVE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS ALL THEY ARE ASKING FOR, A FAIR SHOT. FOLKS, OUR WORK BEGINS WITH GETTING COVID UNDER CONTROL. WE CANNOT REPAIR THE ECONOMY OR RELISH LIFE'S MOST PRECIOUS MOMENTS HUGGING OUR GRANDCHILDREN, BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS, ALL THE MOMENTS THAT MATTER MOST TO US, UNTIL WE GET IT UNDER CONTROL. ON MONDAY, I WILL NAME A GROUP OF LEADING SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AS TRANSITION ADVISORS TO HELP TAKE THE BIDEN-HARRIS PLAN AND CONVERT IT INTO AN ACTION BLUEPRINT THAT WILL RESTORE IT ON JANUARY 2020, 20 - - 20, 2021. THAT PLAN WILL BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF COMPASSION, EMPATHY AND CONCERN. I WILL SPARE NO EFFORT, NONE, OR ANY COMMITMENT TO TURN AROUND THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS, I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME AS THOSE WHO DID. LET THIS GRIM ERA OF DEMONIZATION IN AMERICA BEGIN TO END HERE AND NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REFUSAL OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IS NOT SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, IT IS A DECISION, A CHOICE WE MAKE. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE, WE CAN DECIDE TO COOPERATE. I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE MANDATE GIVEN TO US FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WANT US TO COOPERATE IN THEIR INTERESTS. THAT IS THE CHOICE I WILL MAKE. I WILL CALL ON CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, TO MAKE THAT CHOICE WITH ME. THE AMERICAN STORY IS ABOUT A , ABOUT SLOW, YET WIDENING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN AMERICA. TOO MANY DREAMS HAVE BEEN DIFFERED FOR TOO , DEFERRED FOR TOO LONG. NO MATTER THEIR RACE, FAITH, IDENTITY OR DISABILITY. FOLKS, AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHAPED BY INFLECTION POINTS, BY MOMENTS IN TIME WHERE WE MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE. LINCOLN IN 1860 COMING TO SAVE THE UNION. FDR IN 1932 PROMISING A BELEAGUERED COUNTRY A NEW DEAL. JFK IN 1960 PLEDGING A NEW FRONTIER. AND 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN BARACK OBAMA MADE HISTORY, HE TOLD US YES, WE CAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] FOLKS, WE STAND AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT DESPAIR, TO BUILD PROSPERITY AND PURPOSE. WE CAN DO IT. I LONG TALKED ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE MUST RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. OUR NATION IS SHAPED BY THE CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN OUR BETTER ANGELS AND OUR DARKEST IMPULSES. IT'S TIME FOR OUR BETTER ANGELS TO PREVAIL. TONIGHT, THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING AMERICA. AND I BELIEVE AT OUR BEST, AMERICA IS A BEACON FOR THE GLOBE. WE WILL LEAD NOT ONLY BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, AND MANY HEARD MY H , HEARD ME SAY WE CAN DEFINE AMERICA IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITY. THAT IN AMERICA EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AS FAR AS THEIR DREAM AND GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AHEAD, AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT IS FREER AND MORE JUST, THAT TREATS JOBS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT, AN AMERICA THAT CURES DISEASES LIKE CANCER AND ALZHEIMER, AN AMERICA THAT NEVER LEAVES ANYONE BEHIND. AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT NEVER GIVES UP, NEVER GIVES IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS A GREAT NATION. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BAD BET TO BET AGAINST AMERICA. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. FOLKS, IN THE LAST STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, I BEGAN THINKING ABOUT A HYNMN THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME AND MY FAMILY THAT CAPTURES THE FAITH THAT SUSTAINS ME AND WHICH I BELIEVE SUSTAINS AMERICA.

PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN TRAVELED TO ATLANTA TO CAMPAIGN FOR DEMOCRATS JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK AHEAD OF TUESDAY'S SENATE RUNOFF ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA. THIS IS JUST UNDER ONE HOUR. THERE IS A REASON WHY WE ARE OUT HERE. AND LET'S GET TO THIS RECENT. I'M GOING TO BRING THE REVEREND TO THE STAGE. MAKE SOME NOISE FOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK ONE TIME. (music) REV. WARNOCK: WELL HELLO, ATLANTA, GEORGIA. SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE READY TO WIN AN ELECTION. GEORGIA, WE'RE ALMOST THERE. BUT WE'VE GOT TO FINISH THE JOB. LET ME HEAR YOU IF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR VOTING. FOR EXERCISING YOUR RIGHT, AND YOUR CIVIC OBLIGATION. BUT KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED, YOUR JOB IS NOT DONE. YOUR JOB IS NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CALL EVERYBODY IN YOUR CIRCLE, EVERYBODY YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU CALL YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOU TELL THEM TO VOTE. TELL THEM THAT THE PREACHER SAID A VOTE IS A KIND OF PRAYER. FOR THE KIND OF WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN. AND OUR PRAYERS ARE STRONGER WHEN WE PRAY TOGETHER, SO VOTE TOGETHER. ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE SO HONORED TO HAVE BACK IN ATLANTA THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO BE STANDING ON THIS STAGE, AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I GREW UP IN PUBLIC HOUSING. ONE OF 12 CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY. I'M NUMBER 11. AND I'M THE FIRST COLLEGE GRADUATE IN MY FAMILY. I GOT THERE THROUGH HARD WORK, GRIT, AND DETERMINATION. BUT THAT ALONE DOES NOT PUT ME ON THIS STAGE AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT. MY PARENTS POURED INTO ME THE ETHICS OF HARD WORK. THEY TAUGHT ME WHAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY LOOKS LIKE. MY MOTHER GREW UP IN GEORGIA. YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS. WAY ACROSS GEORGIA. SO SHE BELIEVED IN HARD WORK. SHE GREW UP IN THE SUMMERS IN THE 1950'S, A BLACK TEENAGER PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON. PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOBACCO. BUT BECAUSE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE OTHER DAY THE 82-YEAR-OLD HANDS THAT USED TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON WENT TO THE POLLS AND PICKED HER YOUNGEST SON TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] ONLY IN AMERICA IS MY STORY EVEN POSSIBLE. AND I'M RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PROMISE. I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT IT IS SLIPPING AWAY FROM TOO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN. NOT JUST POOR CHILDREN GROWING UP IN THE HOUSING PROJECTS OF ATLANTA OR SAVANNAH, BUT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTH GEORGIA. OUR CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A SIMILAR , SENATOR IN THE U.S. SENATE UNDERSTANDS THEIR STRUGGLE, UNDERSTANDS THE STRUGGLE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE, AND WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED HAVE NO SHORTAGE OF REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON. IT'S TIME FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE. FOLK WHO GOTO WORK EVERY DAY. FOLK WHO WOULD LOVE TO GO TO WORK, BUT THEY LOST THEIR JOBS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. IT'S TIME FOR ORDINARY FOLKS TO HAVE REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON, AND IF YOU SEND ME T O THE SENATE, EVERY SINGLE DAY I WILL HAVE GEORGIA ON MY MIND. I WON'T BE THINKING ABOUT HOW I CAN BEST REPRESENT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND HOW I CAN BEST REPRESENT THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THEY HAVE ENOUGH REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S TIME FOR ORDINARY FOLKS TO HAVE SOMEBODY SPEAKING ABOUT THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SO, LISTEN, WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CAN HARDLY BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE HAD ABOUT 350,000 AMERICAN SOULS PERISH. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY SEATS AT THANKSGIVING. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY CHAIRS AT CHRISTMAS. THE LIGHTING OF THE CHANUKAH CANDLES. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY SPACES AS WE WELCOMED THE NEW YEAR AND FOLKS THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES WERE NO LONGER WITH THEM. AND EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNSPEAKABLE HUMAN PAIN AND SUFFERING, WHAT DID WE WITNESS. WE SAW THE POLITICIANS PLAYING GAMES. POLITICIANS WHO WERE SO FOCUSED ON THE NEXT ELECTION, THAT THEY ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. YOU HEARD THE DEBATE THIS WEEK. TOO OFTEN IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE POLITICIANS. WHO IS UP AND WHO IS DOWN, WHO IS IN AND WHO IS OUT, WHO IS WINNING AND WHO IS LOSING. MEANWHILE, AS I WALK ACROSS THE STREETS OF ATLANTA, AND ACROSS THE STREETS OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE ARE LOSING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THEY NEED A VOICE IN THEIR DEMOCRACY. THEY NEED SENATORS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY DISTRIBUTED. THAT WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP AND WE HAVE GOT TO PROVIDE COVID RELIEF TO WORKERS. WE HAVE GOT TO HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK SAFELY. AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CENTER THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE HAVE GOT WORK TO DO, AND IN THE MIDST OF THE WORK THAT WE MUST DO, WE CAN HARDLY AFFORD TO BE DIVIDED. AND SO HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DO. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE TOMORROW. AND WHEN THEY SHOW UP TO VOTE, HERE'S THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING, HERE'S THE IMPORTANT MORAL WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE PUSHING HARD AGAINST THE FORCES OF DIVISION AND DISTRACTION IN OUR POLITICS. BECAUSE THERE ARE FOLKS WH OARE , WHO ARE TRYING SO HARD TO DIVIDE US. I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE UNELECTED SENATOR OF GEORGIA. [CARS HONKING] SHE WAS APPOINTED. THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. SHE GIVES A LOT OF MONEY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND SOMEHOW, SHE GOT A SEAT. AND WHEN SHE WENT TO THAT SEAT, SHE DID NOT WASTE MUCH TIME. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WANTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SHE HA BARELY UNPACKEDD, HAD BEEN THERE THREE WEEKS. WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE FOLKS WHO WERE SHELTERING IN, SHE WAS FOCUSED ON SHELTERING HER OWN INVESTMENTS. PROFITING OFF OF A PANDEMIC, WHILE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA WERE SUFFERING AND LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GIVE ORDINARY PEOPLE SOME RELIEF, SHE SAID I SEE NO NEED. SHE SAYS IT WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. MEANWHILE, SHE WAS PROFITING OFF OF THE PANDEMIC. WHO DOES THAT? WHO DOES THAT? FORGIVE ME, I AM FROM THE HOOD. WHERE I AM FROM, WE WOULD SAY WHERE THEY DO THAT AT? PROFITING OFF OF A PANDEMIC. AND SO, HAVE YOU NOTICED, SHE HASN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO MAKE HER CASE, GEORGIA, FOR WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP HER IN THAT SEAT? THAT'S BECAUSE SHE HAS NO CASE TO MAKE. INSTEAD, SHE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU. TRYING TO MISREPRESENT MY RECORD. HAVE YOU NOTICED? LYING ON ME. LYING ON MY CHURCH. THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.. LYING ON THE GOSPEL. AS WE SAY IN CHURCH, CALLING ME EVERYTHING BUT A CHILD OF GOD. SCANDALIZE MY NAME. , SCANDALIZING MY NAME. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. MY MOTHER DOWN IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA SAYS IT IS NOT WHAT THEY CALL YOU, IT IS WHAT YOU ANSWER BY. AND IN A FEW DAYS, SHE CAN CALL ME SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND AS WE BUILD THIS MOVEMENT, AS WE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS ENGAGED AND EVERYBODY IS INVOLVED, WE WILL CONTINUE THIS BLUE WAVE THAT WILL MAKE ITS WAY ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THE RIPPLES OF WHICH WILL BE FELT ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. GEORGIA, ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] SO DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THIS MOVEMENT. DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THIS MOMENT. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. MY FATHER USED TO WAKE ME EVERY MORNING, RAIN OR SHINE. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. WEEKDAYS, SATURDAYS, SUNDAYS. DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR, DURING THE SUMMER. YOU COULD NOT SLEEP IN MY DADDY'S HOUSE. HE WAS A VETERAN DURING THE WORLD WAR II ERA. AND HE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE THAT YOU OUGHT TO GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT SHOES ON, GET READY. I SAID DAD, WHAT DEEMING GET READY , WHAT DO YOU MEAN GET READY? IT'S SATURDAY? GET READY FOR WHAT? HE SAID I DON'T KNOW. JUST PUT SHOES ON, BOY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO LATER, JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY. THAT ANNOYED ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, BUT I AM SO GLAD THAT MY DAD WOKE ME UP EVERY MORNING, GOD BLESSES SOUL, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW GEORGIA, I AM READY, I AM READY TO BE YOUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] I'M READY TO WORK ALONGSIDE MY BROTHER JON OSSOFF AS YOU SEND US TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THINK ABOUT THIS. IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT, WHEN FOLKS ARE TRYING TO DIVIDE US, GEORGE IS GETTING READY TO SEND TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, A YOUNG, JEWISH MAN, THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT, AND A BLACK PREACHER, THE PASTOR OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH, WHERE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR USED TO SERVE AND WHERE JOHN LEWIS WORSHIPED. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM SO PROUD OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. LET THEM HEAR YOU ROAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAN I ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME, ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? WELL CALL EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND TELL THEM TO GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY, FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. GET READY FOR A LIVABLE WAGE. GET READY TO RECLAIM OUR DEMOCRACY, AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. GOD BLESS YOU. LET'S WIN THE FUTURE. (music) [(music) STEVIE WONDER'S ""SUPERSTITION"" (music) (music)] YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LET'S KEEP THIS ENERGY GOING. ARE YOU ALREADY TO WIN TOMORROW? I SAID ARE WE READY TO WIN TOMORROW? WHAT'S UP? ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I BRING TO YOU, JON OSSOFF TO THE STAGE. WHAT'S UP? (music) [(music) OUTKAST'S ""THE WAY YOU MOVE"" (music) (music)] HELLO, ATLANTA. FOREVER I LOVE ATLANTA. GIVE IT UP AGAIN FOR MY BROTHER, THE REVEREND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ATLANTA, GEORGIA, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS. TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY. THE EYES OF THE NATION ARE ON GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE ON GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. FEEL YOUR POWER, GEORGIA. TOMORROW, WE MAKE HISTORY. NOW, I WANT YOU TO SAY IT WITH ME NOW. SAVE VOTE. , SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. TOMORROW, WE MAKE HISTORY. AND THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, ATLANTA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME IN THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH. GEORGIA IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU DID THAT. YOU DID THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW HOSTING TWO RUNOFF ELECTIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. YOUR STANDARDBEARERS ARE THE YOUNG JEWISH SON OF AN IMMIGRANT AND A PASTOR WHO HOLDS DR. KING'S PULPIT AT THE CHURCH. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, ATLANTA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. AND WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST , WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST LIKE, THE BONNY AND CLYDE OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS. TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS, WHO WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC THAT WAS BEARING DOWN ON OUR SHORES, WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY A VIRUS THAT HAS NOW KILLED MORE THAN 300,000 OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS, THEIR FIRST CALL WAS TO THEIR STOCKBROKER. ATLANTA, WE DESERVE BETTER, AND RETIREMENT IS COMING FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER, AT LANTA. [CARS HONKING] BUT SEE, WE HAVE BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS TO DISCUSS THAN DAVID AND KELLY. LIKE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE AS A PEOPLE. WHERE WE GO FROM HERE AS A COMMUNITY, AS AST STATE, AS A NATION. WE HAVE HAD FOUR YEARS OF BIGOTRY, LIES AND INCOMPETENCE. BUT DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING. AND GEORGIA VOTERS SENT DONALD TRUMP PACKING. YOU DID THAT. SO NOW IT'S TIME TO REBUILD. NOW IT'S TIME TO BUILD AN AMERICA THAT IS DEFINED BY LOVE, THAT IS DEFINED BY UNITY, THAT IS DEFINED BY COMPASSION AND EMPATHY. THOSE ARE THE SUBSTANCES OF COMMUNITY. THOSE MUST BE OUR GUIDING LIGHTS, BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER. I'M GOING TO TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THE REVEREND'S PLAYBOOK. TURN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM. THIS IS ABOUT LOVE. I LOVE YOU, TOO. AND WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT BASED ON LOVE, FOR HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, ATLANTA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH FOR A MOMENT. 300,000 AMERICANS KILLED BY THIS VIRUS. OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, OR NURSING HOMES, BUCKLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC. SO MANY WHO HAVE LOST SO MUCH. LOVED ONES, BURIED. LOVED ONES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES, UNABLE TO SEE OR TOUCH THEIR LOVED ONES AS THEY PASS. A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS LIED TO US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WE CAN BEAT COVID-19, ATLANTA. WE CAN PASS LEGISLATION TO RUSH RESOURCES TO HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES. WE CAN MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN GETS ACCESS TO TESTING AND VACCINE FREE OF CHARGE. WE CAN BEAT COVID-19 AND GET OUR DAILY LIVES BACK. AND DO YOU BELIEVE, LIKE I DO ATLANTA, AND LIKE REV. WARNOCK DOES, THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT? HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS, OR WHO LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE. I WAS JUST DOWN AND CUSTARD, GEORGIA A FEW DAYS AGO. RANDOLPH COUNTY IN SOUTH GEORGIA. YA'LL, THEY LOST THEIR HOSPITAL IN OCTOBER. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, THEIR HOSPITAL CLOSED. AND NOW THE PEOPLE OF RANDOLPH COUNTY, IF THEY NEED AN EMERGENCY ROOM, THEY HAVE TO DRIVE 1.5 HOURS TO TO GO TO COLUMBUS OR ALBANY. IT'S ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS WE HAVE LOST IN GEORGIA IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE WE WILL DELIVER THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN THOSE NINE HOSPITALS AND TO BUILD NEW CLINICS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE HAS HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE WILL STAND UP TO THE DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE RISK , RIPPING OFF YOUR TO FAMILIES AT THE PHARMACY EVERY DAY. CHARGING OUTRAGEOUS PRICES FOR LIFE-SAVING MEDICINE AND INSULIN. WE WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN HAS GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE NOMAD OR THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. WHETHER THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA, DIABETES OR A CANCER SURVIVOR. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND WE WILL MAKE IT SO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HORNS HONKING] LET ME GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE MOTHERS OUT THERE. LET ME GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MY MAMA, WHO IS HERE. I LOVE YOU, MOM. Y'ALL MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT MY WIFE WORKS AS AN OB/GYN DR. AT GRADY HOSPITAL, IN LABOR AND DELIVERY RIGHT HERE IN ATLANTA. SHE SEES, EVERY DAY AT WORK, MOTHERS WHO STRUGGLE, WHO SUFFER. BABIES WHO STRUGGLE INTO THIS WORLD BECAUSE OUR LEADERS HAVE REFUSED TO EXPAND MEDICAID. BECAUSE OUR LEADERS HAVE REFUSED TO INVEST IN MATERNAL HEALTH. WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HERE IN GEORGIA. IF YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WHEN YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL SURGE RESOURCES TO SAVE LIVES TO MAKE SURE EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AS AN OB/GYN DOCTOR. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, ATLANTA. HEALTH, JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS. MILLIONS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THIS CRISIS. MILLIONS FACING EVICTION AND FORECLOSURE. SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR STATE OPERATING AT 20% OR 30% CAPACITY GAS BILLS PILING UP, CREDIT CARDS MAXED OUT, FAMILIES THAT CAN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE. AND FOR EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT, THE UNITED STATES SENATE BLOCKED THE DIRECT RELEASE THAT THE PEOPLE NEEDED. LET HIM NEVER DECEIVE YOU. DAVID PURDUE OPPOSED DIRECT STIMULUS FOR THE PEOPLE ALL YEAR LONG. LAST WEEK DAVID PURDUE CHANGED HIS TUNE. GUESS WHAT, THERE'S AN ELECTION COMING. GEORGIA, YOU DESERVE SENATORS WHO HAVE YOUR BACK NOT JUST WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO FACE THE PEOPLE, BUT AT ALL TIMES. AND WHEN YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL PASS THOSE $2000 STIMULUS CHECKS THAT THE PEOPLE NEED, THAT THE FAMILIES NEED TO STAY ON THEIR FEET AND IN THEIR HOMES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL PASS THE MOST AMBITIOUS JOBS INFRASTRUCTURE , JOBS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECOVERY PROGRAM IN U.S. HISTORY. WE WILL UPGRADE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WE WILL UPGRADE TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION TO CONNECT EVERY TOWN AND COUNTY AND CONNECT EVERY CITY, EVERY QUARTER , CORNER OF THE STATE AND CONNECT GEORGIA WITH THE REST OF THE SOUTHEAST. WE WILL CREATE TENS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, SAVING OUR PLANET WHILE WE MAKE AMERICA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD, AND GEORGIA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE SOUTH. I WANT YOU TO FEEL WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER. I WANT YOU TO FEEL WHAT IS POSSIBLE. I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE IN WHAT IS POSSIBLE. HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. IF MITCH MCCONNELL AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD ON TO THE SENATE, THEY WILL TRY TO DO TO JOE AND KAMALA EXACTLY LIKE THEY TRIED TO DO TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO FOR THINGS TO BE GROUND TO A HALT IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. WE NEED TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15. WE NEED TO EXTEND THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM SO NO YOUNG PERSON IN THE STATE HAS TO TAKE ON DEBT TO GET A DEGREE FROM A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR FROM AN HBCU. WE NEED TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT FROM THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR LOW. WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS WHEN WE WIN TOMORROW. WE CAN DELIVER HEALTH, JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. I MENTIONED MY MOTHER A FEW MINUTES AGO. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS AN IMMIGRANT WHEN SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD. A LOAN AS A YOUNG WOMAN. IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO UPROOT YOUR LIFE AT THAT AGE. MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET. , PLANET AND START NEW. BUT LIKE SO MANY IMMIGRANTS, MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT HER COUNTRY STOOD FOR CERTAIN IDEALS. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE INDULGED ANY FANTASIES ABOUT OUR PAST. THAT DID NOT MEAN SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH FURTHER AMERICA HAD TO GO. SHE BECAME A YOUNG ACTIVIST. MY MOTHER WAS MARCHING IN THE STREETS FOR THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IN THE 1970'S. SHE HAD ME WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE WHEN I WAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD WITH AN E.R.A. BUTTON ON. NOW YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM. MY MOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZED THAT THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE DEMAND PROGRESS. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTRY KEEPS MOVING ON A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS, TOWARDS FULLY REALIZING THE VERY BEST OF OUR FOUNDING IDEALS. IN GOD'S EYES. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. OUR CONSTITUTION ALREADY GUARANTEES EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. BUT WHEN AHMAUD ARBERY IS SHOT TO DEATH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, IN THE STREET, ON CAMERA, AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES LOOK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE HE IS A YOUNG BLACK MAN, THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. SO, ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO PASS A NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL, NO MATTER THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT TO PASS A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE THE SACRED FRANCHISE THAT JOHN LEWIS AND SO MANY BLED AND SUFFERED FOR? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE? ARE YOU READY TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT ECHOES NOT JUST FROM COAST TO COAST, BUT DOWN THE GENERATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE STANDS FOR? [HORN HONKING] ATLANTIC, WE JUST HAVE A FEW HOURS LEFT. I AM ASKING YOU TO DREAM ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE. I'M ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE IN WHAT'S POSSIBLE. I'M ASKING YOU TO WORK TO MAKE REAL WHAT IS POSSIBLE. NO REGRETS. NO REGRETS. WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF A HISTORIC VICTORY. FEEL IT. NO IT. BELIEVE IT , KNOW IT. BELIEVE IT. WORK FOR IT. ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO WORK? ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO WIN? ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO ELECT TO NEW UNITED STATES SENATORS? ATLANTA, SAY IT WITH ME AGAIN. SAVE BOAT , SAY VOTE. I LOVE YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY (music)(music) (music) I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING I HAD HOLDING THAT BALLOT IN MY HAND. FOR THE FIRST TIME, I HAD A VOICE. A VOICE THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. I DID NOT EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE THAT FEELING FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS . BUT, HERE WE ARE. TODAY, WE GEORGE IAN'S HAVE THE POWER TO BRING COVID-19 RELIEF, TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, TO MOVE TOWARDS CLEANER ENERGY. HOWEVER, NONE OF THIS CAN BE DONE IF WE DON'T ALL VOTE. WHETHER THIS IS YOUR FIRST ELECTION OR YOUR 20TH, YOUR VOTE WILL DICTATE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED. WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN OUR VOICES NEED TO BE LOUD. SO PLEASE, GEORGIA, USE YOUR VOTE, YOUR VOICE TO PUT JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK IN THE U.S. SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO AROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD NOW [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. LET'S HEAR IT FOR ALLY. THAT INTRODUCTION AND A GREAT LINEUP OF ENTERTAINERS YOU HAVE HAD. YOU ARE PROBABLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR A SPEAK AND WE WILL GET THE ENTERTAINERS BACK OUT HERE. LET'S HEAR IT FOR STACEY ABRAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: NOBODY, NOBODY IN AMERICA HAS DONE MORE FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE THAN STACEY ABRAMS. YOU ARE CHANGING GEORGIA. YOU CHANGED AMERICA. I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU AGAIN. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER, DANIEL BLACKMAN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS, BUT I KNOW HE'S HERE. HE IS ONE OF THE BEST MAYORS AMERICA HAS. AND MY GOOD FRIEND KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS. IF I HAD THREE OF HER I COULD RULE THE WORLD. WE LOVE YOU. PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I LOVE HER, I TELL YOU. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT UNITED STATES SENATORS, JON OSSOFF AND REV. WARNOCK. THEY ARE TALENTED, THEY ARE PRINCIPLED, THEY ARE QUALIFIED, THEY ARE DECENT, THEY ARE HONORABLE, THEY MEAN WHAT THEY SAY AND THEY BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE THE DEFINITION OF AMERICA IS, IT'S ABOUT POSSIBILITIES A MIKE ANY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. WE ARE GOING TOWARDS JUSTICE, HOPE AND PROGRESS. THAT IS NOT A HYPERBOLE, THAT ISRAEL. FULKS, THIS IS IT , , THAT IS REAL. FOLKS, THIS IS IT. TOMORROW CAN BE A NEW DAY FOR ATLANTA, GEORGIA, AND FOR AMERICA. FIRST, LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR ELECTING ME AND, AS PRESIDENT , ME AND KAMALA AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS IN NOVEMBER. YOUR VOICES WERE HEARD. WE WON THREE TIMES HERE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I THINK WE SHOULD COUNT IT AS THREE STATES, NOT THREE TIMES. NOW, WE NEED YOU TO VOTE AGAIN IN RECORD NUMBERS. TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN TO CHANGE GEORGIA, TO CHANGE AMERICA AGAIN. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, GEORGIA, THE WHOLE NATION IS LOOKING TO YOU TO LEAD US FORWARD. YOU KNOW IT. YOU CANNOT TURN ON ANY NATIONAL TELEVISION SHOW WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE DOING. THE POWER IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. UNLIKE ANY TIME IN MY CAREER, ONE STATE, ONE STATE CAN CHART THE COURSE, NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT, YOU CAN MAKE AN IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR OWN LIVES. THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEIR ELECTION WILL PUT AN END TO THE BLOCK IN WASHINGTON ON THAT $2000 STIMULUS CHECK. THAT MONEY WILL GO OUT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY TO PEOPLE IN REAL TROUBLE. PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. PAYING RENT. PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE. PAYING DOWN THE CREDIT CARD, PAYING THE PHONE BILL, THE GAS BILL, THE ELECTRIC BILL. JUST LOOK AROUND. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE OUT OF WORK THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THEY ARE STRUGGLING. MANY ARE FEARFUL AND MANY HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE. LOOK AT THE LINES AT FOOD BANKS. HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR GOD'S SAKE, AND THERE ARE FOOD LINES THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE THE DEPRESSION. AND THEY ARE GETTING LONGER. FAMILIES, CHILDREN, PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND NEVER ASKED FOR A THING EXCEPT A FIGHTING CHANCE. NOW THEY ARE LINING UP FOR FOOD IN AMERICA. AND THE DEBATE OVER $2000 ISN'T SOME ABSTRACT DEBATE IN WASHINGTON, IT'S ABOUT REAL LIVES, YOUR LIES, THE LIVES OF GOOD, HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. IF YOU ARE LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU NEED THE MONEY, YOU NEED THE HELP, AND YOU NEED IT NOW, LOOK, GEORGIA, THERE IS NO ONE IN AMERICA WITH MORE POWER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THEN YOU, THE CITIZENS OF ATLANTA, THE CITIZENS OF GEORGIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: AND THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, THAT IS LITERALLY TRUE. IF YOU SEND JOHN AND THE REVEREND TO WASHINGTON, THOSE $2000 CHECKS WILL GO OUT THE DOOR, RESTORING HOPE AND DECENCY AND HONOR TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. IF YOU SEND SENATORS PURDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, THOSE CHECKS WILL NEVER GET THERE. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. THE POWER IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT, YOU CAN BREAK THE GRIDLOCK THAT HAS GRIPPED WASHINGTON AND DISH NATION. , DISH NATION. THEY CAN MAKE THE PROMISE , THIS NATION. THEY CAN MAKE THE PROMISE ON JOBS, ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH CARE. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVEREND YOU ARE VOTING FOR STATES THAT NEED THE VACCINES TO GET DISTRIBUTED. IT IS A SHAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, GETTING AMERICA VACCINATED WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THIS NATION HAS EVER FACED. BUT WE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR THE LAST MONTHS. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS GOTTEN OFF TO A GOD AWFUL START. THE PRESIDENT SPENT MORE TIME WHINING AND COMPLAINING BEEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE STILL WANTS THE JOB, HE DOES NOT WANT TO DO THE WORK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: LOOK, THE STATES NEED HELP. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE CONSTITUTION SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE DEFICIT SPENDING IN TIMES OF CRISIS AND STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. IT'S THE WHOLE IDEA, YOUR STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LAID OFF. MORE FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE OFFICERS, SCHOOL TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, THE PEOPLE WE NEED BADLY NOW. THE STATES NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH THEM, NOT ATTACK THEM AND LEAVE THEM OUT THERE HANGING. IT WILL BE TOUGH TO GET THIS DONE, BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT. PEOPLE'S LIVES LITERALLY DEPEND ON IT. OUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ON IT. AND WE WILL GET IT DONE BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO THE STATES. TO KEEP COPS, FIREFIGHTERS, TEACHERS, KEEP THEM ON THE JOB, PROTECTING YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THEY NEED HELP. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVEREND YOU WILL SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE . IT IS TIME FOR THIS NATION TO FINALLY COME TOGETHER, TO FINALLY WORK TOGETHER, TEEN NIGHT WITH THE ANGER AND DIVISION AND DIVISIVE POLICIES PUT IN THE PAST. HERE IS ONE MORE THING, VOTING FOR JON AND THE REVEREND WON'T JUST BE GOOD FOR AMERICA, IT WILL BE GOOD FOR GEORGIA. AND HERE IS WHY. WHEN YOU VOTE FOR JON AND RAFAEL, YOU WILL VOTE FOR TWO SENATORS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AND PUT GEORGIA FIRST. WHO WILL PUT YOU FIRST. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT NOW. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE WEALTH THAN HARD WORK. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEY DON'T WORK FOR YOU, THEY WORK FOR TRUMP. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEIR LOYALTY IS TO TRUMP NOT TO GEORGIA. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEY SWORE AN OATH TO DONALD TRUMP NOT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD AND SIX MORE TIMES IN DELAWARE. GUESS WHAT, NOT ONCE DID I THINK I TOOK AN OATH TO ANY PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. I TOOK AN OATH TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: AND AS PRESIDENT, I DON'T BELIEVE UNITED STATES SENATORS ARE GOING TO WORK FOR ME, THEY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ASKING YOUR SENATORS TO BE LOYAL TO ME. I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE LOYAL TO YOU, TO GEORGIA AND TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, PERIOD. AND IF YOU VOTE FOR JON AND THE REVEREND, THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL GET. DECENT, HONORABLE MAN. THEY WILL PUT A PRESIDENT OR PARTY FIRST, AND THEY SURE WON'T PUT THEMSELVES FIRST. THEY KNOW PUBLIC SERVICE IS ABOUT YOU. IT ISN'T ABOUT THEM, IT'S NOT ABOUT ENRICHING THEMSELVES, IT'S ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE. IT'S TIME TO START REWARDING WORK AND NOT WEALTH. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO JON AND THE REVEREND, THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING, THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING ON. LOOK, I'M DEALING WITH COVID. I'M REVITALIZING OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH CARE, OUR VOTING RIGHTS, TERMINAL JUSTICE, RACIAL JUSTICE, CLIMATE CHANGE, ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF YOUR FAMILY. GEORGIA, AS DARK AS THESE DAYS THAT WE ARE SEEING, I'M STILL MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY TIME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT'S AT STAKE. AND JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY SAW THE POWER OF BELIEVING IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN AND OUR DARKEST MONTHS. JOHN LEARNED IT FROM MY OLD FRIEND AND YOURS, JOHN LEWIS. REV. WARNOCK SEES THE POWER TO OVERCOME THE TOUGHEST TRIALS THAT LIFE CAN THROW AT US. HE BELIEVES AS I DO, IN THE QUOTE OF A PHILOSOPHER WHO SAID, FATE SEES BEST IN THE DARK. THE FAITH THAT ENABLES US TO OVERCOME ADVERSITY. TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP, TO BE A BEACON OF LIGHT TO ONE ANOTHER, AND FOR THE WORLD. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES AND I WILL SAY IT HERE AGAIN. THERE IS NOTHING, AND I SAY AGAIN, THERE IS NOTHING THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN WE DECIDE TO DO IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE FACED TOUGHER TIMES BEFORE, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME. WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME. WE HAVE ALWAYS COME OUT BETTER THAN WE WENT IN. NO MATTER WHAT. I KNOW THESE , I KNOW THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN EXHAUSTING. YOU PUT THE HARD WORK IN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO GET TO THIS MOMENT. IT HAS BEEN INTENSE. IT HAS BEEN NONSTOP. BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO GIVE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY. ONE MORE DAY. AND THAT ONE MORE DAY IS NOT A HYPERBOLE. YOU CAN CHANGE AMERICA. SO IF YOU HAVE NOT VOTED, BOAT. IF YOU ALREADY VOTED, THEN I ASK YOU FOR ONE MORE DAY OF MAKING CALLS AND SAFELY KNOCKING ON DOORS. GO TO IOWA VOTE.COM/GA TO FIND YOUR POLLING LOCATION. JUST LIKE YOU DID IN NOVEMBER. BOAT, BOAT, BOAT. VOTE FOR JOHN AND THE REVERENT. IN AMERICA, FRIENDS ARE FINDING OUT ALL POWER FLOWS FROM THE PEOPLE. FROM THE PEOPLE. THAT IS OUR HISTORY. THAT IS OUR TRADITION, THAT'S OUR CONSTITUTION, THAT'S OUR DEMOCRACY. POLITICIANS CANNOT ASSERT, TAKE OR SEIZED POWER. POWER IS GIVEN, GRANTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALONE. AND WE CAN NEVER GIVE THAT UP. IT'S ALWAYS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT MUST PREVAIL. SO TODAY, TOMORROW, MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. DO IT FOR YOURSELVES, DO IT FOR YOUR FAMILIES, DO IT FOR YOUR CHILDREN, DO IT FOR YOUR STATE AND YOUR COUNTRY. DO IT FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP SO MUCH. THINK OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP SO MUCH TO SECURE THAT RIGHT. DO IT FOR THE COUNTRY YOU LOVE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. IN THE FUTURE YOU WANT TO BUILD FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. DO IT FOR ALL THOSE AROUND THE WORLD WHO ASPIRE LIKE US TO BE FREE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE WHO LOOK TO US. I HAVE BEEN TO ALMOST OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND ALL LOOK TO AMERICA. THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS. JON AND THE REVEREND ARE COUNTING ON YOU. SO IS KAMALA, SO AM I AND SO IS THE NATION. WE ARE A NATION BUILT ON HONOR BUILT ON DECENCY AND RESPECT. AMERICA IS AND MUST CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON OF LIFE, LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND UNITY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. THAT'S THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. (music) GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO AROUND.
